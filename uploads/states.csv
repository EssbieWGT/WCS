Food benefits have stopped flowing because of the federal government shutdown. (Photo by Getty Images)There’s a word to describe the mess that Kansas and the rest of our country faces, now that the federal government shutdown has stopped food assistance.
That word is failure.
It’s a failure on the part of a Washington, D.C., governing class interested in scoring points at the expense of everyday people just trying to feed their families. It’s a failure of government bureaucrats — such as former Kansas Rep. Patrick Penn — who have used the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program as a political bargaining chip in the months leading up to this shutdown.
More broadly, it’s a failure on the part of a society that allows so many to go hungry without government intervention. In the United States, one in eight people receives benefits through the program. That’s more than 12% of the country’s population. In Kansas, about 186,000 people receive SNAP, which is also known as food stamps. That’s more than 6% of our population.
Since the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve watched food prices rise, entry-level job opportunities disappear and a president take office whose persona depends on gilded excess.
What’s left for those who simply want to eat? Can they perhaps go to the planned East Wing ballroom at the White House for a sandwich and cup of soup? How about the remodeled Lincoln bathroom?
Don’t think I’m letting Democrats off the hook here, either. The whole reason we’re in this situation to begin with is the party’s somnambulant performance over President Joe Biden’s term and the failure of the party to inspire voters last year. Now out of power and searching for ways to prove their mettle, Democratic leaders picked a fight with the Trump administration over government funding.
Well, they got that fight. And their stated mission of renewing Affordable Care Act subsidies makes sense. But as people go hungry, does it really make sense to keep fighting a political battle?
I mentioned humorist Will Rogers last week. Back in 1931, he put his finger on the infuriating contraction of hunger in America: “Here we are, in a country with more wheat, and more corn, and more money in the bank, more cotton, more everything in the world; there’s not a product that you can name that we haven’t got more of than any other country ever had on the face of the earth, and yet we’ve got people starving. We’ll hold the distinction of being the only nation in the history of the world that ever went to the poor house in an automobile.”


Here in Kansas, Gov. Laura Kelly’s administration has been involved in a legal feud with the U.S. Department of Agriculture over sharing personal information about SNAP recipients with the federal government. The overall message has been that hungry Kansans exist as political props. If Republicans can make Kelly look bad for protecting Kansans’ data, all the better.
Meanwhile, food banks brace for impact. Food drives have picked up across the country. At the Shawnee Mission Unitarian Universalist Church, where I appeared at an event Saturday about media literacy, attendees brought a variety of canned and packaged food. They were doing their part. They were trying to help.
But dear reader, it made me angry. It made me furious. As I considered that food drive, as I thought about the stories Kansas Reflector has run over and over about SNAP, all I could focus on was that word: failure.
We have failed our fellow humans. And while both parties and our national government bear huge responsibility, so does our business class. So do all of us. We have mainstreamed hunger. We have left government benefits that partially solve this problem at the mercy of soulless political tacticians.
I wish I could believe that we can do better. But can we? Have we? What has happened to give us any indication that we could actually make progress in solving this problem?
Increasingly, I look at our nation and our government and see a system that no longer even pretends to do the best it can for people. Both political parties indulge in byzantine schemes, while leaders to the right hail authoritarian power grabs and those to the left squabble amongst themselves.
I walked through downtown Lawrence this weekend, feeling the autumn breeze and watching trees burst into improbable orange and yellow and red. I walked, and I did not despair or rage or grieve.
For a moment, the misery lifted. My thoughts took a positive turn. The interruption in SNAP benefits might prove short lived, thanks to court decisions. Our leaders might decide, having danced so close to the edge, to reach a lasting truce. Absent such breakthroughs, each one of us can take positive actions in our own lives — donating to that food drive or volunteering at that food bank. Or, I suppose, writing a column.
Yet I cannot shake the deep disappointment that gnaws at me late at night and early in the morning.
Bad times have come. And all of us are responsible.

(Courtesy of Reach Out and Read)I bought my grandson five books for his birthday, five titles** in hardcover from a variety of authors and nestled in a small antique case. While I was prouder of myself than I probably should have been, the gift felt weirdly old school, an homage to a past when books were prized and people actually read them. Wait, that’s my past. Plus, my grandson can’t even read these.
Well, OK, he just turned one. There is that. 
My worry, however, is that by the time he can or will want to read them, advances in ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude or similar large language models and their technological kin will have further changed how we read, write and, most importantly, think. Those monumental alterations may cut further into the notion that reading books remains an intellectual, informational and entertainment bonanza for those choosing to take one down off the shelf. Or, perhaps more appropriate, download to your Kindle or iPad.
Lest you think I’m some sort of unreconstructed Luddite, let me hike up my pants, check my Social Security benefits and welcome you to Geezerville, where I will make the case that we’ve been here before. Well, kinda.
Shortly before philosopher Marshall McLuhan told us in 1964 that the “medium was the message,” not the actual content it was delivering, FCC Chairman Newton Minow said programming on television, just past the glow of its first golden age, was a “vast wasteland.” McLuhan’s premise enjoyed some notoriety on college campuses and among cultural observers. Television, however, continued apace with new and ever-changing content on a continuum that ran from exceptionally-accomplished-to-utter-wasteland.  So “Ken Burns Civil War” and “The Wire” might be on one end and “Jerry Springer” and “My Mother the Car” on the other. 
Today we watch Netflix and YouTube on all our screens, the television one included. Studies have long suggested that too much “screen time” can negatively impact children’s development, but, nevertheless, also educate and inform them. Other research indicates that the tube can also enrich adult lives while possibly increasing loneliness, anxiety and the physical troubles associated with too much couch time. In sum, the “wasteland” continues to have mixed reviews.
Some of the same worries accompanied our descent into social media about the turn of the century as we found friends, shared cat videos and berated, doxxed and threatened each other over our political affiliations. That slide into some depressing and dangerous depths continues. Social media remains the chief suspect in a series of societal ills, not the least of which is the rising sea of misinformation compromising our ability to communicate with each other — ironically the platforms’ once highly-touted promise. The best antidote to date is moderation or abstinence, both of which are a drag on the positive impacts of social media, such as the ability to disseminate information at lightning speed.
My grandson has yet to open an account on Bluesky, X, Instagram or even Facebook, so I’m holding out hope for the little guy, who is brilliant, handsome and kind, as I’m sure your grandchildren are.
So where do artificial intelligence, large language models and other “thinking” technology fit into a history that began with a cathode ray tube and now has robots speaking and learning and getting smarter? I have no idea either.
We do know this: In our relationship with science and technology, the wonders of life-saving advances, mind-blowing potential or simply advanced scholarship are almost always ahead of our ability to understand them. The advent and role of AI is no exception. Our history and experience tell us that if we are smart about things — sometimes we are, sometimes not so much — we can find ways not simply to cope with our flourishing technology, but rather to use it to our advantage. To enhance our work rather than eliminate our work. To serve us rather than scare us. To enlighten us rather than undo us. 
Which is why I gave my grandson books for his future, one in which they may still play some role in advancing culture, enlightenment, education and, yes, entertainment. I consider the covers to my quintet … and all his toddler books for that matter … as the original screens.
AI is a rare and exceptional tool, at least until a new one comes along. Still, even though it can’t reopen the government or compel our leaders to tell the truth or undo a natural calamity, we should make peace with it. 
Then write a story about it. Perhaps put it in a book.
**If you’re keeping score at home, the five books were “To Kill a Mockingbird,” “The Catcher in the Rye,” “The Outsiders,” “The Baseball Codes: Beanballs, Sign Stealing and Bench-Clearing Brawls, the Unwritten Rules of America’s Pastime,” and a novella titled “Warm, for Christmas,” written by his grandfather.

Connecticut is one of the richest states in one of the world’s richest countries.  We now face the very real prospect of tens of thousands of people unable to eat and losing health care. The cruelty of HR1, President Donald Trump’s big ugly bill, and his government shutdown, are taking hold in Connecticut.  Massive numbers of people are at risk to be without food and/or healthcare. 
Despite an extraordinary court order that the federal government use contingency funds to keep the feed assistance coming, the threat still exists in the face of Congressional inaction.
We, in Connecticut, must act.
HR1 and the shutdown are just the latest cruel actions by Trump and Republicans that reward billionaires and corporations and at the expense of working people. Even if Congress does restore these cuts, Connecticut must be prepared to step up and make sure children do not starve and that all people have healthcare.
Unfortunately, our leaders appear to be negotiating Connecticut’s response in terms of budget limits instead of determining what it takes to meet the needs of Connecticut residents. We finished the 2024 fiscal year with a $1.9 billion surplus, which can and should be used to meet urgent needs now.
Gov. Ned Lamont, Speaker Matt Ritter, Senator Martin Looney — we have an emergency.  We cannot food bank our way out of this. Children will go hungry and health care will be at risk for everyone, unless you act.
Connecticut has the capacity to address these cuts. At the moment we have a record surplus and the wealthiest among us are receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in tax cuts as part of Trump’s big ugly Bill.
It is good that the legislature and the governor are planning a special session to address the looming crisis and cruelty about to be unleashed in Connecticut. But we need to step up, go outside the current budget framework and develop both a short term response and longer term solutions to what we are about to withstand over the next couple years
Immediate steps include:

Ensure no one loses coverage as a result of the One Ugly Bill and Trump’s inaction.  This includes people seeking reproductive health care, Legally Present Immigrants and people receiving Enhanced Premium Tax Credit to purchase insurance on the exchange.  We know some of these items will be costly, but we should consider reforms that would lessen the costs, particularly around the tax credits.  An example is to clamp down on the profiteering by insurers through vertical integration and their self -dealing through both mandatory disclosure and caps.
Prepare for the looming mess the bill creates for Medicaid and SNAP.  DSS has acknowledged the problems with their call centers with some recent announcements. However these steps will not come close to solving the problem and DSS should have to meet the same standards they demand for contractors in terms of customer service.  In addition, we need to significantly increase our investment in community health works to help people navigate the new bureaucratic hurdles in the bill and to do the traditional health and wellness functions CHWs perform.  This will save money on uncompensated care and by keeping people healthier.
Make sure people have food.  The fact that Trump is playing political games with food is no excuse for Connecticut to not act here.  It is a lot of money, but if the idea of our neighbors going to bed hungry isn’t enough of a reason to act, the impact on grocers, small businesses, and farmers should make this a no brainer for the governor and legislature should be.

Some people are arguing Connecticut can’t afford to address the needs.  We argue Connecticut can’t afford not to.  We have a record budget surplus that the legislature can redirect to cover this.  
In addition, the wealthiest amongst us are receiving huge tax cuts from the ugly bill.  Do the Governor and the legislature really think these people should be able to cash these tax cuts while others starve and/or lose health care?  
We find that hard to believe because in Connecticut NO ONE SHOULD STARVE OR LOSE THEIR HEALTH CARE.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Another day in Paradise, where 3 million Floridians may soon go hungry.
SNAP, what we used to call Food Stamps, is out of money. 
Head Start centers, which serve about 45,000 Florida children, plus pregnant women, are mostly closed. That’s not merely a blow to medical screenings and critical early childhood education, it means the kids won’t get the meals Head Start provides. 
And no, churches and food banks can’t fill the gaps. Nobody has those kinds of resources.
Nobody but the federal government.
Veterans’ services have been curtailed, and the National Flood Insurance Program suspended. 
That means you can’t close on that Florida dream house unless you buy private flood insurance, which can cost nearly twice as much, especially if you’re near water.
There are already longer lines at airports and flights delayed as some TSA officers and air traffic controllers, all deemed “essential employees” but not being paid, call in sick.
(And who can blame them?)
ICE agents, on the other hand, are still getting their paychecks, arresting cleaning ladies and using tear gas near children on their way to a Chicago Halloween parade.
A judge, incredulous that she had to remind federal agents children in Halloween costumes “do not pose an immediate threat,” told them to knock it off.
Our tax dollars at work.
Some national parks and refuges may be open, but without visitor centers, rangers to tell you how to avoid alligators or escape an irate wild hog, or anyone to pick up litter or clean bathrooms. 
As of last year, there were approximately 95,000 federal employees in Florida. It’s unclear how many there are now, what with DOGE slashing and burning, dumping anyone and anything “not consistent with the president’s priorities.”
NASA and NOAA, for example, apparently fall into the “not consistent” category: about 1,700 have lost their jobs. 
Who needs satellites to help us track hurricanes? It’s more sporting to guess where the storm might go. 
Even if there are, say, only 90,000 federal workers left in the state, they’re not getting paid, which means they’re not spending money in their communities.
Shops, restaurants, services–all taking a hit.
Grocery stores, appliance stores, clothing stores will be hurting, too.

Hitting what the current occupant of the White House calls “Democrat programs” is more important than the 42 million across the country who might not have enough to eat.
Taking away the subsidies which help millions get health care, which is at the heart of the shutdown fight, is not just owning the libs, it’s an act of calculated cruelty.

Florida has 4.7 million enrollees in the Affordable Care Act, the most of any state.
Many are service workers, gig workers, people who have decent, lower-middle class jobs which don’t offer health care, or those who’ve retired but aren’t quite old enough for Medicare.
Instead of paying a few hundred dollars a month, many will see their premiums rocket up to more than $1,000 a month, in some cases trebling or quadrupling. 
Don’t be poor and don’t get sick
Gov. Ron DeSantis is unmoved, suggesting that all most people need is a catastrophic plan, the kind with high deductibles – like around $10,000 – which many can’t possibly afford.
DeSantis and the Legislature have refused to expand Medicaid to Floridians who make less than $21,000 a year.
The message: don’t be poor and don’t get sick. If you’re poor, it’s probably your own fault, and if you get the flu or COVID-19 or the measles, well, either suck it up or go to the emergency room.
And you wonder why health care costs in this country keep climbing while Americans’ get sicker and fatter and more susceptible to disease?
Pretty much every other developed nation on earth offers universal health care. These countries pay on average half what Americans do and get better health outcomes. 
Don’t you hate that “socialized medicine?” 
Our government likes to remind everybody the U.S. is the richest nation on the face of the earth. Yet we pretend we cannot take care of our most vulnerable citizens.
WIC, the federal nutrition program for women, infants and children, got some extra money in October, keeping it afloat in some (but not all) states, but that money’s running out. 
Last week more than two dozen state attorneys general and governors sued the USDA, demanding they release the money for food assistance. 
Fun fact: the US Department of Agriculture has a $6 billion emergency fund, but the Trump regime denies there’s an emergency.
Two federal judges disagree. Massachusetts Judge Indira Talwani said  “Congress has put money in an emergency fund, and it is hard for me to understand how this is not an emergency.”
Judge Jack McConnell in Rhode Island ordered USDA to cough up the contingency funds “as soon as possible.”
Talwani hasn’t gone quite that far, but has directed USDA to say whether it’ll release the money Monday.
The problem is, even if USDA is forced to use its emergency funds in what is an actual emergency the money won’t stretch very far: SNAP costs $8.36 billion per month. 
The regime responded with partisan snark on USDA web page blaming Democratic senators for supposedly continuing “to hold out for health care for illegal aliens and gender mutilation procedures [refusing to] reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive critical nutrition assistance.” 
That is, of course, nonsense–and probably a violation of the Hatch Act, too. The ACA does not provide health care for the undocumented, and while some states allow for gender-affirming care for youth, others restrict it. The Trump administration is working to outlaw it altogether.
Other spending priorities
Here in Florida, Democratic members of the Legislature have written to the governor, urging him to use his emergency powers to help those dependent on the now-suspended SNAP funds: “For families already struggling under record food and housing costs, the loss of this critical support would be catastrophic,” they said. 
“Local food banks and pantries have already reported overwhelming demand and depleted supplies. . . . The state cannot stand by.”
Oh, but the state can indeed stand by. And often does.
DeSantis’ response was predictably snotty: “Did those Democrats write a letter to Chuck Schumer asking him to stop filibustering the spending? Come on.”
Last I looked, Republicans control the government. All of it. 
They could release those allotments any time, just as they could negotiate a solution to our outrageous health care costs. 
Maybe if the state hadn’t spent $50 million of taxpayer money in 2024 to defeat ballot measures DeSantis disliked or untold millions of bucks suing over providing health care to children or giving upper middle-class families vouchers so they can send their kids to private schools without breaking a sweat, or flying asylum-seekers to Martha’s Vineyard, we might have a little extra cash to spend on the needy. 
The federal government could pay for SNAP, Head Start, flood insurance, heating assistance, WIC, and all the rest of it if the regime weren’t so busy wasting your money on Trump’s expensive whims, such as bailing out his friend, the right-wing fruitcake president of Argentina, to the tune of  $40 billion. 
Or retrofitting his Qatari gift-jet as Airforce One, which reportedly could cost  us about $1 billion.
Trump’s buying Homeland Security Spokesmodel Kristi Noem not one, but two new private jets, costing in the region of $200 million, in case Delta first class is sold out and she needs to get to El Salvador for a photo-op.  
As for the tax cuts, the ones overwhelmingly benefitting the rich, well, they will cost the nation a big, fat $4 trillion over the next 10 years.
A billion here, a trillion there: pretty soon you’re talking real money.
Extending the ACA enhanced premium tax subsidies would cost us $350 billion over 10 years.
Even if you practice good old Republican voodoo economics, it’s pretty obvious that $350 billion is way less than $4 trillion.
Insured people go to the doctor, get preventative treatment, and expert help when they need it.


	A sickness boom in Florida?/subhed]
Uninsured people either never get the care they need or go to the emergency room, which costs us all a lot in increased hospital costs and insurance premiums. 
Here in Florida, we’re pretty much guaranteed a sickness boom: the anti-science fanatic running U.S. Health and Human Services pushes raw milk and unproven Covid treatments while cutting money for genuine medical research, and Florida’s surgeon general demands the state do away with vaccine mandates.
Trump and congressional Republicans want us to believe that if the Democrats will just pass a “clean” Continuing Resolution to fund the government, they can all sit down and have a nice chat about healthcare. 
Remember how they said they’d never touch Medicaid? And Trump promised he wouldn’t touch the East Wing to build his trashy new ballroom? The Ukraine war would end? The price of eggs would drop? 
If you buy the cozy image of Republicans “negotiating” ACA subsidies with Democrats, I have a lovely piece of Florida swamp land to sell you.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-03 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Moving Bridgeport forward through charter reform,Thomas Gaudett,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/03/moving-bridgeport-forward-through-charter-reform/,The changes proposed on the ballot this November are all about building a city government that works better for everyone.,"Amending our City Charter—the blueprint for how our local government is structured and operates—is a rare opportunity. On November 4th, Bridgeport voters will have the chance to approve a comprehensive charter revision which was the work of a bipartisan group of thirteen Bridgeport residents committed to improving local governance and the image of our city. The proposed reforms substantively improve and modernize several aspects of local government, while also signalizing a renewed commitment towards professionalism, integrity, and ethics in Bridgeport.
As both a lifelong Bridgeport resident who served on the Charter Revision Commission and as the City’s Chief Administrative Officer, I strongly encourage voters to support this charter rewrite.
Ethics Reform
Bridgeport is moving in the right direction with balanced budgets, higher credit ratings, and exciting new development projects. But there’s no doubt that Bridgeport’s reputation has been a drag on its success. Understanding this reality, the Charter Revision Commission made ethics reform a centerpiece of charter revision, turning what is currently a single paragraph in the charter to an entire chapter.
The revised charter formally reestablishes the Ethics Commission and creates an Office of Municipal Ethics, providing an independent mechanism to uphold integrity in local government. The Commission will have the power to adopt a City Code of Ethics, investigate alleged violations, and impose fines—demonstrating Bridgeport’s commitment to accountability and public trust.
Civil Service Reform
Bridgeport’s civil service rules, which have not been meaningfully updated in decades, have created challenges for city officials tasked with enforcing them and have resulted in costly litigation for taxpayers. Building on the work begun by the 2012 Charter Revision Commission, the proposed reforms bring much-needed clarity and modernization.
The revisions clearly define which positions serve at the Mayor’s discretion — typically only department heads and senior policy roles — and which are protected civil service positions — most positions in local government — which continue across administrations. This balance ensures both alignment with the Mayor’s goals for the city and stability in city government.
The reforms also create a structured process for the creation of city positions moving forward, allowing for local government to adapt with the times. Overall, the proposed civil service changes protect employees’ rights, ensure consistency in hiring, and strengthen the integrity of our personnel system.
City Council Reform
For years, members of the City Council and civic advocates have called for changes that give the Council more independence and the tools to perform its legislative role effectively. This charter revision delivers on many of those long-awaited improvements.
The Office of Legislative Services will now be formally recognized as an independent arm of the City Council, led by a Director chosen by the Council and staffed to meet its operational needs. The revisions also clarify Council leadership roles and responsibilities, empower the Council to act when boards or commissions have long-standing vacancies, and set procedures for creating new boards, commissions, and departments. Together, these reforms strengthen the Council’s independence and capacity to govern effectively.
Modernization and Good Governance
The current charter has not been comprehensively updated in decades. It still references long-defunct agencies, omits essential modern departments, and includes outdated notice requirements, structural inconsistencies, and typographical errors.
The proposed revision—informed by best practices from Connecticut’s leading municipal charter expert Attorney Steve Mednick and modeled after recent charter reforms in Norwalk and New Haven—brings Bridgeport’s Charter into the modern era. It reflects the city’s actual organizational structure and creates processes for the City Council to make future updates as the city evolves.
Additional improvements include consistent formatting across the Charter itself, gender-neutral language, and clarification of ambiguous provisions. Together, these updates make the charter clearer, more usable, and aligned with good-governance standards across the state.
Making Clerk Positions Nonpartisan
“Question 2” on the November ballot proposes converting the City and Town Clerk positions from elected partisan offices to professional, nonpartisan civil service roles, with only for-cause removal, beginning after the 2031 municipal election. This proposal will not impact the current incumbents or the 2027 municipal election for these offices.
While the voters of Bridgeport elect a Mayor, City Council, and Board of Education to make policy decisions, the work of our City and Town Clerks are largely administrative in nature — filing records, preparing agendas, and administering absentee ballots. It is the opinion of the Charter Revision Commission that these positions demand professionalism, not partisanship.
Bridgeport made a similar change decades ago to the position of City Treasurer, which is now a nonpartisan civil service role. City government is better off for that change. Furthermore, setting the start date for these changes to December 2031 allows the current incumbents to remain in office while allowing time to plan for a smooth, depoliticized shift.
A Vote to Move Bridgeport Forward
The reforms that have been put forth by the Charter Revision Commission are the result of years of proposals and debate, build on the positive aspects of the 2012 Charter Revision Commission, learn from costly lawsuits and mistakes of the past, and are aimed at creating a better, brighter future for Bridgeport.
It’s rare in Bridgeport politics, but the charter reforms have brought most of our local government officials and reform advocates together around a common cause—building a government that works better for everyone.
On November 4th, I urge my fellow Bridgeport residents to vote YES on Charter Revision. By improving our City’s founding document, we will move Bridgeport forward towards a better future.

Tim Walz next November.
Demuth, who served as the GOP House minority leader during the Democrats’ 2023-2024 trifecta, raised money and recruited candidates to topple the trifecta in 2024. Republicans flipped three key swing districts in 2024, bringing the House to a 67-67 tie between Republicans and Democrats.
Though the tie hasn’t allowed Republicans to pass significant legislation, Republicans were able to block Democratic priorities — while propelling Demuth to emerge as the face of Republican opposition.
Demuth, 58, was first elected to the Minnesota House in 2018 after serving on her local school board in Cold Spring — about 20 miles southwest of St. Cloud — for over a decade.
Demuth’s campaign website was active Sunday, and she’s expected to announce she’s running for governor at a Monday morning news conference.
“I’ll never bow to the radical mob,” Demuth says in a campaign video while a shotgun is slung over her shoulder. “And I’ll never apologize for standing up for common sense … Let’s fire Tim Walz and take our state back.”
The House speaker joins a growing field of GOP candidates who are seeking to beat Walz next year, including Republican Rep. Kristin Robbins; 2022 GOP nominee for governor Scott Jensen; and Kendall Qualls, an army veteran and health care executive. If Republicans can raise money and blanket the media, they’ll have plenty to work with to attack Walz’s nearly eight years in office, from flagging school test scores to fraud-riddled government programs.
Demuth is likely to pitch herself as an electable general election candidate compared to the rest of the field. Demuth and Robbins are both Minnesota House members and Robbins has raised her profile in recent months by publicizing fraud in public programs.
But Robbins served as state chair for 2024 presidential candidate Nikki Haley, which will likely be a frequent source of attacks from Republicans who will question her loyalty to Trump. 
Republican primary voters tend to follow the party’s convention endorsement, wherein hundreds of hardcore activists — often the most ideologically dogmatic — decide the candidates’ fate.
Demuth was elected House speaker earlier this year after a rancorous start to the legislative session. A judge ruled one of the newly elected Democrats ineligible for office because he didn’t live in the district. Republicans sought to use a temporary 67-66 advantage to win full control of the chamber, and Demuth threatened to refuse to seat Democratic Rep. Brad Tabke, who won a contested race.
To prevent this usurpation, Democrats boycotted the session for three weeks and then won a Supreme Court case. The two sides came to an agreement wherein Tabke was seated, and Demuth could claim the speakership for the whole two-year session.
Demuth became Minnesota’s first Black House speaker and first Republican woman speaker. She used her caucus’ power of exactly half of the House to force the DFL to roll back state-subsidized health insurance for undocumented immigrants. House Republicans also blocked numerous tax increases proposed by Democrats.
Demuth agreed to a few tax increases, including increasing the state’s tax on cannabis from 10% to 15% and repealing the electricity sales tax exemption for data centers, which will increase costs for companies — which could make for attack fodder from her fellow tax-loathing Republicans.
Long negotiations in the split Legislature caused lawmakers to go into a one-day special session and pass a $66 billion biennium budget. 
Right on cue, Robbins decried the deal in a statement Sunday, saying that although she’s friends with with the House speaker, Demuth isn’t electable.
“Lisa Demuth agreed to a backroom budget deal that raised taxes and shut down the Stillwater prison with no plan which will result in releasing criminals back into our communities,” Robbins said. “Demuth and Walz raised our taxes and made our streets less safe, and that’s exactly what I’m fighting against.”
Demuth was born in Paynesville, Minnesota, and has four children. She’s spent the bulk of her life in rural Minnesota. Outside of politics, Demuth manages commercial properties, and her husband, Nick Demuth, runs Avon Plastics in Paynesville.
In response to Demuth’s campaign for governor, Alliance for a Better Minnesota — a progressive political group — said Minnesota needs a governor who will stand up to Trump, not acquiesce to him.
“Lisa Demuth would bring Trump’s dangerous agenda to Minnesota. She would take away our reproductive freedoms, underfund our public schools and give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations at the expense of Minnesota families,” Marissa Luna, executive director at Alliance for a Better Minnesota, said in a statement.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/MG_8997-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-02 19:02:53.829566

The Liberty Flames (4-4, 3-1 CUSA) scored 42 combined points in the second and third quarters to defeat the University of Delaware Fightin’ Blue Hens (4-4, 2-3 CUSA) Saturday evening.
 
The Blue Hens lined up to punt from their own 26 yard and it felt like a streak of luck to have that opportunity. The play before the punt, quarterback Nick Minicucci threw what appeared to be an interception but was ruled as an incomplete pass following a review. Instead of sending the defense out to about midfield, Delaware had a chance to flip the field and make the Flames traverse a longer distance. Liberty ended up having an even shorter field than if the interception stood.
On fourth and six with more than eleven minutes remaining in the second quarter, the Blue Hens snapped the ball to linebacker Gavin Moul standing on the right hash of the punt formation. Moul ran the ball toward the middle of the field and flipped the ball to safety KT Seay running the opposite direction. Seay was met in the backfield by junior Bryson Jennings seconds after receiving the ball and the play ended without any chance of earning the first down.
The Flames outscored the Blue Hens 21-3 following that play in the second quarter, coasting to a 59-30 victory over UD, Saturday evening in Lynchburg, Virginia.
The former Georgia Tech running back — Evan Dickens — was the beneficiary of Delaware’s questionable attempt at trickery. Two plays after Liberty took over at the Blue Hen 21 yard line, Dickens rushed up the middle five yards to the endzone for his first of three consecutive touchdowns.
Dickens’ next touchdown was a one yard run that followed a UD three and out on the Blue Hens ensuing possession. Following a punt from the Hens, the Flames marched 79 yards downfield on 13 plays to set up Dickens’ second touchdown run of the quarter. The redshirt sophomore finished his terrific second frame with a 30-yard run to the endzone in the Flames final possession of the first half.
Delaware’s offense only mustered nine points on three made field goals from graduate kicker Nate Reed in the first half. The Blue Hen’s offense struggled both on the ground and in the air against the conference’s highest ranked passing defense and third ranked scoring defense. 
The Blue Hens had six big plays — passes of more than 15-yards and runs of over ten yards — in the first half compared to nine for the Flames. None of UD’s plays went for more than 30 yards.
Delaware finished the first half with 205 total yards of which only 39 came from the ground game — an area where Liberty had struggled all year allowing close to 190 yards on the ground per game entering the contest.
Following Dickens’ fourth touchdown of the game on a 72-yard run to open the second half, things got better for the UD offense. The Blue Hens scored back-to-back touchdowns to cut Liberty’s lead down to 35-24 with under six minutes to play in the third quarter. The two scores came on receptions by tight end Elijah Sessoms and junior Donovan Lewis which were their first career touchdown receptions. 
The Flames answered the scores with a pair of touchdown receptions from Donte Lee Jr. and Jacob Jenkins in the final minutes of the third quarter. The catches put the score out of reach of a fourth quarter comeback as Liberty started the final frame ahead by 25 points.
The Flames ended the game with their season high for total yards (561 yards) and rushing yards (282 yards). Conversely it was Delaware’s worst defensive game of the year allowing a season high rushing total and season high total yardage. 
Dickens’ ended with a record setting day rushing for a career high 217 yards and four touchdowns. 
The Blue Hens have four games remaining on their schedule. Three of those games are against fellow CUSA members including next week’s game against Louisiana Tech. That game will be on November 8 at Tubby Raymond Field.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Gemini_Generated_Image_bfmrk1bfmrk1bfmr.png,,,2025-11-02 18:02:01.735995

(Kansas Reflector screen capture from Kansas Oral History Project video)TOPEKA — Former Kansas Senate President Steve Morris, who served southwest Kansas for more than three decades as an elected school board member and state legislator, died Saturday. He was 79.
Morris died unexpectedly at home in Hugoton. He had undergone a series of bypass surgeries and underwent treatment for prostate cancer, said a daughter, Stephanie Heger.
“He was definitely someone who only wanted what was best and for people to work together,” Heger said in an interview Sunday. “He wanted to be a policymaker instead of a politician.”
As a father, she said, Morris was kind, humble and adhered to the biblical concept of “do to others as you you would have them do to you.”
“He was one of the people who never said a negative thing about anyone,” Heger said.
She said services were pending.
Morris was born in Garden City and raised in rural Hugoton. He graduated from Hugoton High School in 1964 and from Kansas State University in 1969. He served on active duty as a pilot in the U.S. Air Force from 1969 to 1974 before moving to the Air Force Reserve and returning to Hugoton to farm. His was married to Barbara Morris and they had three daughters — Susan Morris, Sara Tasset and Heger.
He was on the Hugoton Board of Education from 1977 to 1993 and the K-State Alumni Association Board of Directors from 1985 to 1991.
In 1992, Morris was elected to the Kansas Senate by defeating Democrat Leroy Hayden. Morris, a Republican, was a member of the Senate for 20 years.
He served as the chamber’s president from 2005 to 2013 during a period in which the Legislature grappled with controversial casino gambling legislation and court cases on funding of K-12 education. He was involved in shaping major bills on the budget, taxation, transportation and energy issues.
He lost a campaign for reelection in 2012 when defeated by Republican Larry Powell in the August primary. GOP Gov. Sam Brownback and Koch political interests had targeted Morris and one-half dozen other Senate Republicans they viewed as political moderates.
“Americans for Prosperity and Kansas Chamber sent out I think something like 40 negative, large postcards in the last two weeks of the campaign,” Morris said in an August 2024 interview with Kansas Oral History Project. “People had never seen something like that before. They assumed all those things were true, which they weren’t.”
Morris also was interviewed by Kansas Oral History Project in July 2020 regarding his legislative career.
Morris said that after leaving the Legislature he missed “the good people we worked with” and that “overall it was a good experience.”
 In 2014, Morris played a role in Republicans for Kansas Values, which supported Democratic state Rep. Paul Davis’ unsuccessful campaign for governor against Brownback.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SteveMorris-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-02 17:00:37.407888

(Photo courtesy of Baiba Rozite)U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Milwaukee) is raising an alarm after Wisconsin was denied flood mitigation funds by the Trump administration. The assistance, which was denied by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), would have  helped the state prepare for situations like the record-breaking floods that swept through southeastern Wisconsin in August. 
“The risks of severe flooding will only increase due to climate change, and our community needs to be prepared,” Moore said in a statement Thursday. “FEMA’s ill-conceived decision denies our state the opportunity to take proactive efforts to prevent future flooding and damage, which saves homeowners and taxpayers dollars in the long run.”
Research shows that severe storms and flooding will increase in Wisconsin due to climate change. Shortly after the August floods, which inundated parks and left over 1,800 homes damaged or  destroyed, Wisconsin Policy Forum noted a “dramatic increase” in extreme rain and flooding events, resulting in higher payouts for flood insurance. 
Although the Trump administration  approved a first round of disaster funds to assist individual homes and small businesses, additional support to help repair public infrastructure was also denied in late October. Counties in areas represented by both Democrats and Republicans were denied additional assistance.
“State and local governments cannot do it alone,” said Moore. “I expect Gov. Evers will rightly appeal this denial, and I hope that request will get bipartisan support in our congressional delegation. As our communities continue to recover, it is clear there is a need to build our communities back stronger and more resilient. I will continue advocating for Wisconsin’s needs at the federal level and push back against these ill-advised decisions.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-02 18:01:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Monkey escape in Mississippi gives a glimpse into the secretive world of animal research,"Jeff Martin, Associated Press",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/02/monkey-escape-mississippi-secretive-world-of-animal-research/,The recent escape of several research monkeys after the truck carrying them overturned on a Mississippi interstate is the latest glimpse into the secretive industry of animal research.,"The recent escape of several research monkeys after the truck carrying them overturned on a Mississippi interstate is the latest glimpse into the secretive industry of animal research and the processes that allow key details of what happened to be kept from the public.
Three monkeys have remained on the loose since the crash on Tuesday in a rural area along Interstate 59 near Heidelberg, spilling wooden crates labeled “live monkeys” into the tall grass near the highway. Since then, searchers in masks, face shields and other protective equipment have scoured nearby fields and woods for the missing primates. Five of the 21 Rhesus macaques on board were killed during the search, according to the local sheriff, but it was unclear how that happened.
Key details remain shrouded in secrecy
Mississippi authorities have not disclosed the company involved in transporting the monkeys, where the monkeys were headed or who owns them. While Tulane University in New Orleans has acknowledged that the monkeys had been housed at its National Biomedical Research Center in Covington, Louisiana, it said it doesn’t own them and won’t identify who does.
An initial report from the sheriff described the monkeys as “aggressive” and carrying diseases such as herpes, adding to the confusion. Tulane later said the monkeys were free of pathogens, but it is still unclear what kind of research the monkeys were used for.
The questions surrounding the Mississippi crash and the mystery of why the animals were traveling through the South are remarkable, animal advocates say.
“When a truck carrying 21 monkeys crashes on a public highway, the community has a right to know who owned those animals, where they were being sent, and what diseases they may have been exposed to and harbored simply by being caught up in the primate experimentation industry,” said Lisa Jones-Engel, senior science adviser on primate experimentation with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
“It is highly unusual — and deeply troubling — that Tulane refuses to identify its partner in this shipment,” Jones-Engel added.
One thing that is known is that the 2025 Chevrolet Silverado pickup hauling the monkeys was driven by a 54-year-old Cascade, Maryland, man when it ran off the highway into the grassy median area, the Mississippi Highway Patrol said in a statement to The Associated Press. The driver wasn’t hurt, nor was his passenger, a 34-year-old resident of Thurmont, Maryland.
Confidentiality is built into contracts, blocking information
Transporting research animals typically requires legally binding contracts that prohibit the parties involved from disclosing information, Tulane University said in a statement to the AP. That’s done for the safety of the animals and to protect proprietary information, the New Orleans-based university said.
“To the best of Tulane’s knowledge, the 13 recovered animals remain in the possession of their owner and are en route to their original destination,” the statement said.
The crash has drawn a range of reactions — from conspiracy theories that suggest a government plot to sicken people to serious responses from people who oppose experimenting on animals.
“How incredibly sad and wrong,” Republican U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said of the crash.
“I’ve never met a taxpayer that wants their hard-earned dollars paying for animal abuse nor who supports it,” the Georgia congresswoman said in a post on the social platform X. “This needs to end!”
Tulane center has ties to more than 155 institutions worldwide
Tulane’s Covington center has received $35 million annually in National Institutes of Health support, and its partners include nearly 500 investigators from more than 155 institutions globally, the school said in an Oct. 9 news release. The center has been funded by NIH since 1964, and federal grants have been a significant source of income for the institution, it said.
In July, some of the research center’s 350 employees held a ribbon-cutting ceremony to mark the opening of a new 10,000-square-foot office building and a new laboratory at the facility. This fall, the facility’s name was changed from the Tulane National Primate Research Center to the Tulane National Biomedical Research Center to reflect its broader mission, university officials announced.
Research monkeys have escaped before in South Carolina, Pennsylvania
The Mississippi crash is one of at least three major monkey escapes in the U.S. over the past four years.
Last November, 43 Rhesus macaques escaped from a South Carolina compound that breeds them for medical research after an enclosure wasn’t fully locked. Employees from the Alpha Genesis facility in Yemassee, South Carolina, set up traps to capture them. However, some spent two months that winter living in the woods and weathering a rare snowstorm. By late January, the last four escapees were recaptured after being lured back into captivity by peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
In January 2022, several cynomolgus macaque monkeys escaped when a truck towing a trailer of about 100 of the animals collided with a dump truck on a Pennsylvania highway, authorities said. The monkeys were headed to a quarantine facility in an undisclosed location after arriving at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York on a flight from Mauritius, an Indian Ocean island nation, authorities said. A spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said all of the animals were accounted for within about a day, though three were euthanized for undisclosed reasons.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29160952/AP25302613820212.jpg,,,2025-11-02 13:16:47.302730

Detroit residents who haven’t already voted will head to the polls on Tuesday to help decide who the city’s next mayor will be.
The election — featuring candidates Solomon Kinloch, a pastor, and Mary Sheffield, city council president — has been largely focused around issues related to neighborhood revitalization, safety, poverty, and housing instability.
All of those issues affect the city’s public schools, and each of the candidates say they intend to play a role by partnering with schools to ensure children have a quality education.
What that role looks like remains to be seen. But low academic achievement, high rates of chronic absenteeism, and the myriad effects of poverty on student learning are key challenges in Detroit.
Here’s what you need to know about the election.
 What can Detroit’s next mayor do?

Unlike in some other big cities, Detroit’s mayor doesn’t have any control over or say in education issues. But the mayor can still have some influence.
For instance, students miss school at alarming rates in the city, and it’s not just because they want to blow off the classroom.
More than half of the students in the Detroit Public Schools Community District attend school outside their neighborhood, and challenges getting to and from school often lead to absences.
The Detroit Partnership for Education Equity and Research has reported that a third of families in Detroit don’t own a car, and 30% of families don’t have a fixed way to get their children to school.
Meanwhile, high school students largely take city-run transportation to get to school, and Chalkbeat has often heard from teens that buses don’t always arrive on time or pass them by when they’re waiting at the bus stop.
While the mayor can’t equip all Detroit residents with vehicles or require students to attend their neighborhood school, they can address issues with the transportation system. The topic came up earlier this month when Sheffield and Kinloch met for a televised debate.
Sheffield vowed to provide “more coordinated transportation to reduce absenteeism and get our students back in school,” while also noting that the city needs to improve transportation wait times. Kinloch said that in order to improve transportation, the city needs to ensure it is offering competitive pay to transit workers, has reliable vehicles, and has trained mechanics.
 What Detroiters told us they want from the next mayor

Chalkbeat asked Detroit residents to tell us what they would like to see the next mayor do to address education issues in the city.
Some common themes emerged. Residents said they welcome the mayor playing a role in education issues, though several made it clear schools should continue to be independently operated. They told us they want to see Sheffield or Kinloch address issues such as safety, transportation, poor attendance, lack of stable housing, and lack of student engagement.
One reader told us that the mayor needs to play a role because she or he “has a direct impact” on some of the biggest challenges facing schools in the city.
Sharon Kelso, a Detroit district parent and education advocate, said safety, lack of student engagement, and lack of accountability of school staff are major factors affecting student learning.
“There is currently too much failure with blame being placed on students and parents,” Kelso said.
The next mayor, she said, can promote parental involvement by holding town hall meetings to hear parent concerns. They can also hold town hall meetings and conferences to hear from students. Kelso said the mayor can work with DPSCD and charter school leaders to address transportation and safety issues.
 Sheffield and Kinloch’s views on education

Kinloch has said he will create a cabinet-level position that would partner with DPSCD “to make sure that we’re removing the social ills that keep the children from showing up in class in a productive way, not to just to survive, but to thrive.” He said on his website that the cabinet member would work with school administrators, educators, parents, and students “to coordinate city services that support student success.”
Sheffield, in a response to a Chalkbeat Detroit survey, said she would “commit significant resources” toward improving conditions that affect education that the city oversees. Sheffield, during the debate, said she would partner with DPSCD and charter schools on a consistent basis to “ensure that we have robust after-school programming within a two mile radius of every school, focusing in on literacy,” as well as addressing the social deterrents that affect students and families.
 How to vote in Tuesday’s Detroit election

Detroit residents aren’t just voting for a new mayor. They also will be electing city council members, city clerk, board of police commissioners, and the community advisory council.

Joe Pizarchik knows mining.
For nearly a decade, he served as the Senate-confirmed head of the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), the federal agency charged with regulating the surface impacts of underground coal mining across the country.
Before that, Pizarchik served in his home state of Pennsylvania in its Department of Environmental Protection, first as assistant director of the Bureau of Regulatory Counsel, then as director of the Bureau of Mining and Reclamation.

Pizarchik said that in all that time, he’s never seen a situation quite as disheartening as the one the nation is experiencing under President Donald Trump.
In an interview with Inside Climate News, Pizarchik spoke at length about the current regulatory environment around coal mining and, more specifically, about a recent announcement in Alabama. The state’s top coal regulator has suspended federally mandated methane monitoring after a March 2024 home explosion atop a coal mine that left an Alabama grandfather dead and his grandson severely injured.
“It is extremely disappointing to see a Trump regime putting the interests of big corporations and wealthy people ahead of American citizens and the environment,” he said.


So far in his second term, President Donald Trump has emphasized his administration’s support for what he calls “clean, beautiful coal,” which is actually the dirtiest, and often most expensive, of fossil fuels.
The administration has also trumpeted the fast-tracking of coal projects across the country, claiming that doing so will “unleash American energy.” Often, however, that characterization doesn’t hold water. In Alabama, for example, where the Bureau of Land Management has just approved mining thousands of acres of publicly owned coal, part of what may be the largest mining expansion in state history, none of the extracted coal will be used to power American homes. Instead, the metallurgical coal, used in steelmaking, will virtually all be shipped overseas through the port of Mobile, Alabama, for use in foreign manufacturing.
Pizarchik said that he’s particularly concerned about the ability of federal agencies like OSMRE to enforce regulations required by law during a government shutdown.
Even when Pizarchik was head of the regulator and a government shutdown wasn’t at hand, he said, it was difficult for the agency to meet its goal of inspecting 10 percent of all mines. Now, under the current regulatory environment, Pizarchik said that’s even further out of reach.
“It’s highly unlikely that’s happening at this point,” he said.
Pizarchik is also deeply troubled by the actions state like Alabama, where regulators have moved to push back against what he views as common-sense enforcement of federal law to protect citizens from imminent threats.
In March 2024, a home exploded above Oak Grove mine, a longwall coal mining operation in rural Jefferson County, southwest of Birmingham. The explosion, likely caused by the release of methane gas, which is released during the mining process, led to the death of W.M. Griffice, a grandfather, and severely injured his grandson.
The Griffice family’s home is one of well over a hundred that Oak Grove Mine operators have said could be impacted by subsidence. (Lee Hedgepeth/Inside Climate News)
In December 2024, following an extensive investigation by Inside Climate News, federal regulators at OSMRE issued a “Ten-Day Notice” indicating that the mine might have been out of compliance for failing to adequately monitor potentially explosive methane emissions. The notice required Alabama regulators to come into compliance or “show cause” for any failure to seek adequate remedies.
In response, state officials required coal companies across Alabama to submit methane-monitoring plans within 90 days to mitigate risks posed by escaping gas. Before the 90 days were up, and at the request of the coal industry, the director of Alabama’s coal regulator, Kathy Love of the Alabama Surface Mining Commission, issued a six-month extension.
Officials from OSMRE pushed back, writing to Love that they felt the extension was “excessively long” and that the agency likely would not have abated its Ten-Day Notice had they known she planned such a delay.
In September, as that extension was about to expire, Love sent a letter to OSMRE notifying federal regulators that she had indefinitely suspended any requirements to monitor methane gases above coal mines, even where homes and businesses are present. Love also asked federal regulators for a formal review of the circumstances surrounding the issuance of the Ten-Day Notice, which she said she believes should be “withdrawn.”

Pizarchik said he’s never heard of a state agency approaching federal regulators months after a Ten-Day Notice to ask that it be withdrawn. If Love had issues with the agency’s actions, he said, they should have been expressed to federal regulators months ago.
“If Alabama and this director thought there was no merit to it, she had ten days to put together the evidence and demonstrate that,” he said. “She didn’t do that, which I think raises questions about her credibility.”
Love declined to answer Inside Climate News’ questions about the letter and Pizarchik’s observations. “No comment,” the director said in an e-mail.
Pizarchik also said that the timing of Love’s letter may be opportunistic, sent at a time when OSMRE’s regulatory staff is stifled by the government shutdown and in the shadow of the Senate’s confirmation of Lanny Erdos, a former coal executive, as the new head of OSMRE.
“This letter’s timing might have been tied to the impending shutdown and with the change in leadership,” he said.
Love’s letter also came just weeks after the Bureau of Land Management approved a private company’s mining of federal coal in Alabama, partly based on the expectation that Alabama would soon have methane monitoring requirements above mines.
That expansion of Warrior Met’s Blue Creek mining facilities is slated to be one of the largest buildouts of coal mining infrastructure in the state’s history, with capital costs topping $1 billion. Taxpayer-funded support for the project, which included the controversial deepening of Mobile Bay to support exporting mined coal, may exceed $400 million.
“That could definitely be another timing factor,” Pizarchik said. “Wait until that project is finalized and then suspend the monitoring program so the coal companies don’t have to do it.”

Pizarchik also said that he doesn’t buy Love’s contention that the technology doesn’t exist to conduct such monitoring and that doing so would be cost prohibitive for coal operators.
“It’s a crock of bull,” Pizarchik said. “Longwall mines are the most efficient in the country. So they ought to be able to afford that.”
Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill even lowered costs for coal mines, he said, reducing royalties on mining publicly owned coal and providing a tax break for metallurgical coal operations.
And the technology to monitor methane, Pizarchik said, already exists. Anyone can go into a Lowe’s or Home Depot and buy a basic methane detector, similar to a fire alarm, to provide protection. There are also basic steps mining operators can take to reduce the risk of methane escaping into residences or other confined spaces.
“You simply vent the methane into the atmosphere,” Pizarchik said. “And that’s not particularly expensive.”
Pizarchik also noted that Love’s letter unnecessarily criticizes a citizen who complained directly to federal officials following the home explosion. Love wrote that OSMRE’s regulatory actions may have been based on “media pressure and a citizen’s unknowledgeable complaint.”

Pizarchik said that preventing citizens from providing relevant information to federal regulators would violate the law. During the first Trump presidency, the administration moved to change federal rules to prevent direct citizen complaints, but that decision was ultimately reversed in the wake of lawsuits by environmental groups and, ultimately, Biden’s election, Pizarchik said.
“She appears to want to go back to the rules the way Trump had changed them last time—and that would make them not in compliance with federal law,” he said. “And she’s making a bold assumption about whether that citizen was knowledgeable or not, because the fact is, we know methane got into her neighbor’s home and killed a man.”
Ultimately, Pizarchik said Love’s suspension of methane monitoring increases the risk to residents living above coal mines, particularly “gassy” mines where significant amounts of potentially explosive methane gas are released during mining.
Love and her agency’s actions may bring into question whether the government, and potentially even Love personally, Pizarchik said, may be liable if another tragedy like the March 2024 explosion were to occur again:
“Given the six-month extension and now the permanent suspension, has she not created the circumstances for government liability in Alabama, in her official capacity and maybe in her personal capacity, if someone else is injured or killed from a methane explosion?”
If he were still director, Pizarchik said he would likely take a multi-prong approach to dealing with Alabama regulators. First, he would reissue the Ten-Day Notice requiring immediate action to mitigate the risks of methane escaping from mines. Then, he would begin the lengthy process of a federal takeover of Alabama’s mining regulatory program.
“I think I’d probably do both at this point,” he said.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)A South Dakota legislative leader predicted he can “almost assure” that “every legislator” will support reforms addressing inmate rehabilitation and recidivism during the legislative session that begins in January.
Sioux Falls Republican Rep. Greg Jamison, a House majority whip, made the comment as a legislative committee examining recidivism rates held a meeting Wednesday in Sioux Falls. Recidivism is the term applied to inmates who commit more crimes after being released from prison.
Jamison is also a member of a new task force taking up the issue, appointed by the governor and dedicated to rehabilitation transformations in the system.

Both groups came out of lawmakers’ disillusionment with the state’s rehabilitation efforts during discussions about the need for a new men’s prison. Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden promised to form the task force in exchange for support for the $650 million project in Sioux Falls, which he and lawmakers approved during a special legislative session in September.
The legislative committee will finalize its list of recommended legislation at its next meeting, targeting rehabilitation, diversion and supervision issues that affect incarceration and recidivism rates. Diversion of nonviolent felony suspects into rehabilitative programming, sentencing reform, more support for inmates reentering society, and addressing why parolees return to prison are all pieces that could impact South Dakota’s incarceration and recidivism rates, lawmakers on both groups said.
The new task force intends to look at rehabilitation throughout the remainder of 2025 and 2026. Task force chair and Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen said the task force will focus on short-term and long-term rehabilitation efforts happening with inmates while in prison.
Representatives with the Council of State Governments Justice Center spoke to lawmakers about helping improve rehabilitation efforts based on data from South Dakota and other states. The nonprofit worked with several other states to study and suggest criminal justice and prison reforms.
The nonprofit is already partnering with the state Department of Corrections through next spring to shore up the data tracking offenders who reenter South Dakota communities and better understand outcomes of inmates after they are released from prison. The task force voted to explore working with the nonprofit on Wednesday.

“We’ve struggled to kind of chart our path and goals and now our time is up,” Jamison said, “but this next committee, really, is going to have another window of time to evaluate and lay out a timetable and goals.”
A majority of inmates stay in the prison system for a year or less before being released. Ryan Brunner, senior policy adviser for the governor, said that timeline can limit the rehabilitation programs available to inmates. Upon admission, about 91% of male inmates and 97% of female inmates last year were diagnosed with a substance use disorder.
The task force plans to dive more deeply into rehabilitation options and community partnerships connected to programming for education, faith, tribal and behavioral health needs. Venhuizen said the group will likely meet again in December.

Three hearts
Harper Grant, 15, Chelsea
Octopuses have three hearts. I’ve been told that I do too. Is it the way I look at you or the way I listen? Is it how I place my hand on your shoulder or how I smile? I don’t think I try to hide myself the way an octopus does, and I certainly don’t have the tentacles to show off. But everything about the octopus seems familiar. 
The skin that changes color at will to help them hide. They’ll bury themselves in the sand just to be safe. That has to be uncomfortable, right? I’m sure they don’t exactly like it, but there are dangers around. The octopus is as much prey as it is predator, and their flexibility is both a blessing and a curse. Great for getting around and hiding out, but so easily breakable it’s funny. How much of me is in that skin?
The eyes that watch their surroundings for prey. Looking for the perfect chance to strike while hidden under a rock. How long do they wait just to eat? The ocean is littered with fish, shrimp and crabs for them to eat, but how many tries does it take just for one bite? That has to be exhausting, spending all day waiting to replenish the energy spent on waiting. When do they even have time to sleep? With those eyes that always watch for a chance that they may not even take. How much of me is in those eyes?
And of course, those three hearts. Two pump blood to the gills to pick up oxygen, and the other
takes that blood and spreads it to the rest of the body. When an octopus swims, its third heart stops. Is that why they crawl? Even if they’re slower crawling, they can’t live a life of swimming. They’ll die. So they crawl, at the price of slowness. At least it won’t be their own fault if harm comes to them. At least they can say they were careful.
So, I guess I have to ask now. How much of me is in those hearts?

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island has not sent a voter list maintenance mailing to all active registered voters in over 15 years. That changes as early as Monday, Nov 3, when voters across the state should start receiving a notice in a white envelope with yellow markings and an “Official Election Mail” decal. 
The enclosed letter asks recipients to review the information on their voter record and update any inaccurate or outdated information online at vote.ri.gov or by mail using the form on the back of the letter.
Reviewing and responding to the mailing will help ensure the accuracy of Rhode Island’s voter list and that voters are eligible to vote in the 2026 elections, according to the office of Secretary of State Gregg M. Amore.
If voters receive a letter addressed to someone who does not live at their address, they are asked to write “Not at this address” above the address on the envelope and return the envelope to their mail carrier. 
State and local election officials receive voter list maintenance information from several agencies, including the Division of Motor Vehicles, the Department of Health, and the U.S. Postal Service’s National Change of Address program. 
A voter’s registration becomes inactive when a piece of official elections mail is returned to the sender as “undeliverable.” If an inactive voter does not cast a ballot in one of the next two federal elections, their voter registration can be removed from the voter list, according to federal and state law.
Election officials have removed 107,738 voters from the state’s voter list through these voter list maintenance processes since Amore took office in January 2023.
Voters who need assistance updating their record can call the Department of State Elections Division at (401) 222-2340 or their local Board of Canvassers’ office. For more information on the mailing and a list of frequently asked questions, visit sos.ri.gov/mailing.

An official told legislators the private schools would not submit their students to state assessment tests and would not require their schools to have open enrollment.
When asked about a possible middle ground, Barrett Donahoe, executive director of the Mid-South Association of Independent Schools, replied, “I don’t think we have to compromise anything. I think our schools do a good job.”
The private schools’ refusal to bend on certain issues should not be a surprise to legislators. While House Speaker Jason White, House Ways and Means Chairman Trey Lamar of Senatobia, Gov. Tate Reeves and advocates have touted the need for and advantages of vouchers, the private schools historically have been relatively quiet on the issue, though they do say now they would take the public money as long as they did not have to follow some of the rules adhered to by public schools.
But in recent years, as late as 2024, private schools embraced state tax credits being used to benefit them instead of direct taxpayer payments through vouchers.
They reasoned there would be less oversight with tax credits.
The Mid-South Association of Independent Schools said in a paper titled “The ABCs of School Choice” that tax credits with revenue going to private schools were considered more advantageous to them than vouchers.
“Freedom advocates, instead, look for policies like tuition tax credits and tax credits for donations to scholarship funds, to free up resources so that parents and donors can fund their own choices,” said the paper found on the MAIS website in 2024. “Such policies expand choice for parents without shifting the burden for their children onto others.”
The paper, which no longer is available on the private school association’s website, in part reads, “School choice cannot exist without driving up taxes – or cutting other parts of the budget to avoid deficits. As of 2019, private schools educated 44,000 students in Mississippi. If the Legislature approved a $7,000 voucher for each of those children, it must come up with $308 million more dollars in tax revenue – plus the increased bureaucratic costs (and other costs) associated with administering the program.” 
The state currently offers limited tax credits to private schools through a program dubbed the Children’s Promise Act. The program allows a person or business to make a donation to one of the private schools certified by the Department of Revenue and receive a dollar-for-dollar tax credit for up to 50% of the donor’s state tax liability or a credit on local property taxes.
In simple terms, the donors to private schools get to pay less in either state income taxes or local property taxes.
The maximum a private school currently can receive through the program is $405,000 annually. Because of the popularity of the program with the private schools, there have been unsuccessful efforts in recent years, led by White and Lamar, to expand the Children’s Promise Act. It is currently capped at $9 million per year in tax credits.
To qualify to receive the benefits of the tax credits, a school must provide services to at least one student with “a chronic illness or physical, intellectual, developmental or emotional disability” or be eligible for the free lunch program or be a foster child.
The Department of Revenue, which oversees the program, has said it does not know how many students who fit into the Children Promise Act categories are educated by each school. Yes, theoretically, it could be only one.
While Lamar, the primary legislative advocate of the Children’s Promise Act, has sought unsuccessfully to increase the amount of the tax credits, he has not made any effort to increase the oversight of the program.
Some have argued that the tax credits do not put a strain on the state budget because money from state coffers does not go out to the private schools.
The argument seems disingenuous since people who donate to the private schools can have their tax liability cut in half, thus reducing the amount of money going into the state general fund.
Reducing the amount of state revenue available, as the tax credits do, accomplishes the same goal as vouchers – decreasing the amount of money available for public schools, health care, law enforcement and other services the state is expected to provide.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/06124141/3X0A2527-scaled.jpg,,,2025-11-02 07:16:39.011769

“This is the best place in the world to train,” says Jessie Diggins, a gold, silver and bronze medalist and member of the SMS T2 elite cross-country team capping its offseason in Vermont.

STRATTON — After winning Olympic gold, silver and bronze medals and, just last winter, her third cross-country season World Cup, Jessie Diggins could be forgiven for lazing away the summer and fall on vacation. So why has the most decorated U.S. Nordic skier in history instead run, biked, roller-skied and weightlifted the past six months in Vermont?
“This is the best place in the world to train,” the 34-year-old said recently atop Stratton Mountain as she pointed to steep trails and a nearby gym. “There’s everything you need.”
Diggins isn’t alone in her assessment. She’s one of a half-dozen athletes — including fellow U.S. Olympians Julia Kern and Ben Ogden, Canadian colleague Rémi Drolet and U.S. development team members Fin Bailey and Jack Lange — capping their offseason in the Green Mountain State as part of the SMS T2 elite cross-country team.
The team — formed in 2012 by Stratton Mountain School and the T2 Foundation, a nonprofit that’s now part of the World Cup Dreams Foundation — trains annually from May to the start of racing in November.
“We’re getting prepped all the ways you can when you don’t have snow underneath your feet,” said head coach Colin Rodgers, a former Middlebury College ski team captain and recent U.S. Ski & Snowboard coach of the year. “This place has a tradition and track record that’s probably unmatched anywhere else.”
Or at least in the “lower 48” United States. Diggins, Kern and Ogden just scored three of the seven top “A” slots on the 2025-26 U.S. cross country ski team (which also includes “B” racer Jack Young of the Craftsbury Outdoor Center’s Green Racing Project). Alaska Pacific University’s elite team snagged another three “A” positions, while a Mainer training in Norway took the final spot.
Sverre Caldwell, a retired four-decade Stratton Mountain School coach, has been there from the beginning.

“I remember talking with a couple of people about starting this,” said Caldwell, now 70.
Those “couple of people” weren’t random folk. Take Caldwell: A 2013 inductee into the Vermont Ski & Snowboard Hall of Fame, he’s the father of 2014 and 2018 Olympian Sophie Caldwell and the son of 1952 Olympian John Caldwell — the latter who literally wrote the book on cross-country skiing in a trailblazing 1964 guide the Boston Globe calls “the bible of the sport.”
Another team founder: Caldwell’s friend and fellow Vermonter Bill Koch, the first American to win an Olympic Nordic medal, in 1976, and U.S. flag bearer at the 1992 Winter Games. Koch, 70, remembers when offseason training was limited to cycling the back roads of his childhood Windham County.
“We weren’t pricking our fingers and taking blood samples — that’s all new to me,” Koch said of today’s physical and physiological performance testing. “We know a lot more now than we did then.”
So much so, Diggins devoted an entire chapter of her recent memoir “Brave Enough” to her Stratton workout.
“We hike, swim, gravel bike, run … this incredible mix of different things,” she said in an interview. “You’re trying to train as hard and as much as you can, but not stepping over into injury or burnout.”
“I think of it as stacking bricks,” Diggins continued. “Every day that you work out you add another, and then the weeks build into a really strong base, an incredible fortress of fitness.”
Diggins elaborated on the regimen on comedian Paula Poundstone’s podcast.

“Roller skis,” the Olympian told the host, “are kind of like speedy death traps because they don’t have brakes.”
Diggins said she can wheel more than 50 miles an hour, spurring Poundstone to wonder if everyone on the team was still standing.
“We’ve lost the ability to have a knee-modeling career or an elbow-modeling career,” the skier replied, “but other than that, we’ve lost nobody.”
Instead, all are somebodies. Kern, named to the U.S. cross-country ski team at 17, is now a 28-year-old two-time World Championship medalist.
“I wanted to train with the best,” Kern said of her arrival at Stratton a decade ago.
Ogden, for his part, is the son of two other of those founding “couple of people,” John and Andrea Ogden of nearby Landgrove. But the 25-year-old University of Vermont graduate earned his place on the team as a two-time NCAA national champion and winner of the World Cup’s 2023 Green Bib for fastest male skier under age 23.
“I’ve been coming up to Stratton since I was a kid,” he said.
The team works out six days a week, then kicks back on Mondays.

“There are certain times you need to train really, really hard, but there also are times when you need to be recovering,” Rodgers said. “Your body’s only able to absorb the training if you give it proper rest.”
The team took side trips this summer and fall to Olympic venues in Lake Placid, New York, and Park City, Utah. Diggins and Kern also flew to the Snow Farm cross-country ski area in New Zealand.
“Although we can replicate training on roller-skis,” Kern said, “nothing beats being on snow.”
Then again, working out amid green grass and flaming foliage has its benefits.
“You just feel really supported by this close-knit community,” Diggins said.
In appreciation, the team gathered more than 100 local Bill Koch Youth Ski League students at the base of Stratton Mountain in August for a question-and-answer session.
“What’s your favorite glitter color?” one girl asked Diggins, who often bedazzles her face.
“One time I got to glitter Ben’s mustache for a team relay,” she said of Ogden, “and that was a combo of blue and red.”
The team is wrapping up its training before the start of international racing Nov. 28 in Finland, the 2026 Olympics Feb. 6-22 in Italy and the first-ever World Cup cross-country finals in the United States March 20-22 in Lake Placid.
But while at Stratton, members are focused less on the future than on the present.
“The process of being fit enough to try to win the race is the fun part, and you have to really love and enjoy all that goes into that,” Diggins said. “The race is like the cherry on top.”

Riding trails in Kirchner Woods on Taber Hill Road Thursday morning, Louis Arevalo noticed the smell of rain-soaked cedars and decaying leaves melting into the ground.
Long a locals’ hangout for lunch rides and dog walks, these trails just became a lot more accessible through minimal upgrades. Arevalo is an adaptive rider from Essex who rides a recumbent, hand-powered bike. He’s known for tackling terrain some able-bodied riders would shake their heads at, but today he’s taking flow laps with his dog Ozul, smelling cedars and leaves and giving feedback to Stowe’s trail ambassadors about the upgrades.
“I can ride more advanced terrain,” Arevalo said. “But it’s nice to have gentle terrain for everybody to either learn on or just play together on.”

Arevalo especially likes how the trails still feel natural, with roots and non-threatening rocks making the ride interesting, but not necessarily technical.
“The number one question we received about this project was, ‘Is this going to become another Cady Hill?’ And the answer is, ‘No,’” Caroline Loeb, stewardship director with the Stowe Land Trust, said. “We’re not smoothing trails in the same way. Cady Hill serves a very different purpose. The goal here is to keep the rugged natural beauty while providing better access.”
According to Kenzie Brunner, executive director of the Stowe Trails Partnership, Stowe has some of the best accessible riding terrain in Vermont — and she would know. In her prior role with the Vermont Mountain Bike Association, she traveled the state taking inventories of these types of trails.
Since the formation of the Trail Accessibility Hub through the Vermont Trails and Greenways Council in 2023, which dispersed $600,000 in Vermont to assess and upgrade as many trails as possible, towns like Stowe have been expanding their accessible terrain to the point where some zones no longer distinguish between an accessible and non-accessible trail.
Kirchner Woods is the latest trail network in Stowe to receive this treatment. Charlie’s Bypass and Eagle Ridge in Cady Hill have seen the biggest changes, and Stowe Trails is currently planning another beginner and adaptive-friendly trail behind Stowe Village Inn.
For Staub, Brunner and Tom Rogers, executive director of the Stowe Land Trust, the Kirchner project highlights the potential of local partnerships.
The Land Trust owns Kirchner Woods, and according to Staub, the group identified its trails for accessibility upgrades years ago. Acting as a conduit to state funds, the Land Trust contracted Stowe Trails to perform the upgrades. Nicole Corriveau, an AmeriCorps member whose time with the land trust ended this year, worked closely with Stowe Trails on construction. There were even a handful of successful volunteer trail days.
Riding is only permitted on trails in the bottom half of Kirchner Woods, but the area is still a hotbed of activity for hollow residents and visitors alike.
“It’s beautiful in there,” Jeff Alexander said. He works with Vermont Adaptive Ski and Sports and helped Stowe Trails assess the changes that needed to be made in Kirchner.
Like many old mountain bike trails in Stowe, the system in Kirchner was built decades ago by former resident Hardy Avery. They’re beloved trails, Brunner said, and they haven’t changed that much.
“Recreation is such a well-loved and well-engrained thing in the state,” Staub said. “And we’re saying, like, ‘We’ve already done some of the work of making these places public and putting the trails in,’ but they’re not serving everybody. So how can we all collectively change that? I think it’s an across-the-board phenomenon.”

Seeing the falls
The Mill Trail to Bingham Falls is also getting an accessibility makeover. Owned by the Stowe Land Trust, the trail is short and not intended for mountain biking, but it’s extremely popular and dangerous for some people.
According to Rogers, Stowe Mountain Rescue, of which he is a member, responds to Bingham Falls seven or eight times a season. From a Google Maps perspective, it’s just a short jaunt from Route 100 to the majestic crashing falls, but the trail is steep with several hazards.
The calls are mostly non-emergent — lots of twisted ankles and busted legs — but some are more complex, with people trying to navigate areas where “they could really hurt themselves,” Rogers said.
Stowe Land Trust is midway through an accessibility project in the area. So far, they’ve replaced culverts with bridges and removed dangerous hazards. Rogers said the motivation is twofold — to improve flood resiliency and create a universally accessible trail.
“It’s just such a beautiful falls and a lot of people want to see it,” Rogers said. “Our goal is to open up the outdoors and nature, especially in some of these really high-profile beautiful spots, to people of all abilities.”

“It is so much more people-management than policy,” Kristine Lott said.

WINOOSKI — At her last city council meeting on Sept. 15, Kristine Lott closed out six years as Winooski’s first female mayor. Lott stepped down before the end of her term to start a family, and she reflected on the time she spent as mayor and the lessons she would carry forward. 
“It is so much more people-management than policy,” she said. “So much relationship building and communication to try to get these things to come together and move. It’s public service, but it is really people’s service before anything else.”
“I mean, it’s exciting to be the first breaking a barrier,” Lott said of her election in 2019. 
A week after being sworn in, Lott was thrown into the deep end: her first city council meeting as mayor included a vote on a $23 million bond for the city’s Main Street Project. The moment marked the start of a steep learning curve. 
“I didn’t say anything the whole time,” Lott recalled.  She said the experience was very intimidating, but she was determined to ask questions and learn quickly. 
In an interview after Lott’s final city council meeting, Interim Mayor Thomas Renner said he always admired “Mayor Lott’s attention to detail and the way that she is able to see the big picture and also the future picture of what we’re discussing at the moment.”

“I really want to make sure I uphold Mayor Lott’s legacy and continue the work that she’s been doing,” Renner said. 
Renner is breaking barriers as well. He is the first black man and first openly gay man to be mayor. “I’m excited to be able to bring some diversity to the job as well,” he said.
Just over a year into her term, the COVID-19 pandemic hit, giving Lott a challenge that would define her mayorship. “‘What am I doing?’” she remembered thinking. “I am in a leadership role. I don’t know what to do in this scenario.” 
During those first months, Lott leaned on staff and council members to help her steady the city through an unpredictable and challenging time. Lott said the Black Lives Matter movement in particular “made racial disparities come to a head.”

“The way that COVID information was being shared initially was not getting to a lot of our BIPOC and New American community members,” she said.
Winooski is among the most diverse cities in the state and one of Vermont’s only majority-minority school districts. Lott said she always felt a responsibility to reach across the community and make sure that as many voices as possible were heard and a part of the conversation. 
“As a white person representing this most diverse city, I knew that I had to do work to make sure I was engaging with other racial backgrounds,” she said. “It takes intentional work.”
That intention was clear during Lott’s time in office, said City Manager Elaine Wang. “Kristine was a really great partner,” Wang said. “She had a very even-handed approach, always listening to all perspectives before deciding on a direction.”

Some of Lott’s proudest moments came not from policy but from the bonds she built. Among them are her relationships with the members of Winooski’s Islamic community, which began with a simple introduction that grew into something much more meaningful.
Early in her first term, Lott kept walking past the Islamic Community Center of Vermont, just a few blocks from her house, and decided to stop in and introduce herself.  “Eventually someone answered, and I was like, ‘Hi, I’m the mayor,” Lott said, laughing. 
What started as a tentative knock on the door grew into a lasting relationship. Lott helped open lines of communication between mosque members, city staff and school liaisons that hadn’t existed before. She calls it her “biggest small win.” 
“The relationship building I did with the Islamic community through the mosque made me feel so good,” she said. “What was seemingly a small effort on my part really made them feel more included.” Lott said it will feel strange to lose the constant connection to what is happening around town.
“I’m just not going to be as plugged in as I was before,” she said. Lott is now ready for a new chapter filled with more time for herself and her family. She’s excited to enjoy the fall weather and welcome her first child later this year. 
“It’s going to be very freeing,” she said. 
Lott doesn’t hesitate to encourage young people to get involved in local politics. She said every perspective adds value to the community.

“Just do it,” she said. “You don’t need any special training or experience. The politics we’re doing at the local level impact everyone who lives here, and the more different perspectives we can get involved, the better the outcomes will be.”

(Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)Communities around Louisiana, in a bid to get more information about the environmental and health impacts of industrial pollution, are taking data collection into their own hands — despite a law restricting how their research findings can be used to enforce air quality regulations. 
The practice is called community, citizen or participatory science, and it involves data collected from non-scientists that’s passed along to researchers who use their expertise to study and understand what they mean. From air quality to fisheries impacts, the grassroots-gathered information has the potential to inform the public about impacts of nearby industry. 
“Our challenge for really a couple decades has been: How can we get something that can empower the communities to be able to speak for themselves, about the issues, with data?” said Marylee Orr, executive director of Louisiana Environmental Action Network. 
The Louisiana-based nonprofit, long involved with community air monitoring projects, recently posted on its website an interactive air monitoring dashboard. The site gives continuous updates from air quality sensors placed at four locations along the Mississippi River in the heavily industrialized corridor between Baton Rouge and New Orleans. The dashboard also lists locations and readings from Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality monitors.

The system, funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, uses stationary air quality sensors to measure spikes in air pollutant levels. Toxic emissions such as sulphur dioxide, nitrous oxide and volatile organic compounds can be detected, recorded and displayed on the online dashboard, providing neighboring communities with information about potential health risks. 
Similar efforts to get hard numbers for air and water quality concerns are also happening in Cameron Parish, where community air monitoring and water quality research partnerships are expanding. The area is the site of three liquified natural gas (LNG) terminals, and six more LNG facilities are either under construction or in the planning stages.
Environmental groups, including the Habitat Recovery Project and For a Better Bayou, have been working to secure funding for air quality monitoring equipment and underwater sound research in an attempt to find the source of air pollution and fisheries disruptions in the region. 
“Stories hold weight, and science and data holds weight,” Habitat Recovery Project director Alyssa Portaro. “When we put these two things together, it really gives a robust picture of what’s going on.” 
Fishermen and advocates alike suspect air quality and fisheries problems in Cameron have ties to the nearby LNG facilities but have no independent data to back up their suspicions. The environmental groups received grants to buy monitoring equipment and hire fishermen to collect data and partner with scientists for research projects.
“Nobody knows exactly what’s going on out here,” said Sky Leger, a fisherman who works along Cameron Parish’s coast. He and his girlfriend, restaurant worker Karri Hooper, recently got involved with community science monitoring, in part, to help track whether noise from boat traffic and LNG facility construction is impacting adjacent fishing grounds.

Around the country, scientific communities have seen growing acceptance of data collection in partnership with non-scientists. 
“There’s been increasing recognition of the power of these types of projects to collect really useful data,” said Bradley Allf, a postdoctoral research associate at Colorado State University who uses participatory science to study urban ecology and conservation.
Allf studied the concept of citizen science data collection for his doctoral thesis, saying the research technique has grown in popularity as well as acceptance within the scientific community over recent decades. 
“There was some hesitation around whether we can really trust data collected by people who haven’t necessarily been trained in science,” Allf said. “I don’t think that’s very true anymore.”
Despite its expanding acceptance, the struggle to increase transparency around industry’s environmental impact in Louisiana with community-gathered data faces legal hurdles. 
The Louisiana Legislature approved a law in 2024 enacting strict qualitative standards for community air monitoring programs in order to be considered valid data that state regulators could use for oversight or enforcement. 
Air-monitoring equipment and analysis must use the most current EPA-approved techniques, and data must be analyzed at labs the Louisiana Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program certifies, according to the legislation dubbed the Community Air Monitoring Reliability Act.
Environmental groups argue these standards, which can be costly, prices them out of being able to do research. The cost for the state’s preferred monitoring equipment runs up to $500,000 dollars, said former EPA official Larry Starfield, an adviser to Orr’s monitoring dashboard project
“That’s not something that is accessible,” said Misha Mayeur with the Habitat Recovery Project. 
The equipment her group intends to buy with current grant proceeds costs around $11,000, cheaper than the regulatory monitors that cost more than their entire annual budget to buy. 
The sensors the Louisiana Environmental Action Network uses for its stationary air monitoring in Southeast Louisiana, like those in Cameron Parish, aren’t up to the standards for regulatory enforcement in the 2024 state law. The regulatory monitors required in Louisiana to allege pollution violations cost around $500,000 dollars, said former EPA official Larry Starfield.
Even if the data can’t be used to enforce air quality standards for Louisiana, Orr said there’s still value in community awareness that could prompt change. 
“If the data suggest a problem, it’s an opportunity for communities to invite companies to investigate their concerns,” said Orr. 
Starfield said he hopes keeping the community informed could offer a way to let industry prove its willingness to cooperate and improve air quality. 
“Many of the workers live in the community. Why wouldn’t you want to have a good relationship?” he said. 
President and CEO of the Louisiana Chemical Association and Louisiana Chemical Industry Alliance president David Cresson responded to the launch of LEAN’s dashboard in a statement emailed to the Illuminator, saying the association was reviewing LEAN’s data and methodology. 
“We hope to continue to work with LEAN to identify the areas of impact as indicated by their data, and if the specific source can be verified, take practical steps to remediate the issue,” Cresson said in a statement from the association.
And if industry chooses not to cooperate, Starfield said data can help encourage state and federal entities to get involved. 
“The idea is to engage Louisiana [Department of Environmental Quality] and EPA in a situation where there’s a feeling that there’s a problem here, we’re seeing a pattern,” he said. “Certainly bringing in EPA and bringing in LDEQ and asking them to investigate … that’s absolutely a good thing.”
Fishermen in Cameron used their collective voice to engage state enforcement in August when they brought to light impacts to oysters, crabs and fish from dredging spills near the site where Venture Global’s CP2 LNG facility is being built. 
Venture Global initially claimed there were no sediment spills or harmed fisheries. But at the urging of fishermen, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries sent a biologist to study the area, and the official later confirmed oysters had been killed.

“The only thing that they’re going off of is by the reports of the people that Venture Global hired,” Leger said. “But we have the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries coming out here and checking the oysters … and they are saying that there is very much so a problem with sediment being on top of those oysters in the lake.”
Portaro said this example is a strong argument for informing the community, as well as involving scientists, in documenting air and water quality issues in places like Cameron Parish. 
“The fishermen were able to verify that, document it; then Fish and Wildlife came out and said, ‘Yeah, there is mud in the lake,’” said Portaro. “Sometimes the biologists on the job need the community keeping an eye on them, a well-informed community.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Cameron-community-science-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-02 06:16:51.508557

But the next year, a 26-year-old Republican woman named Erin Stewart was elected mayor.
It was the start of a 12-year run for Stewart. She has been reelected every two years, the beneficiary of her own brand of fusion politics, an aversion to polarizing national issues, and the low turnout in municipal races that tend to blunt a Democratic advantage in voter registration.
On Tuesday, Democrats will try to exploit open seats for mayor or first selectman in New Britain, Norwich and Torrington and the coastal suburbs of Branford and Westport. They are held by Republicans, and all the communities except Torrington have Democratic advantages in voter registration.
More than 150,000 votes already had been cast as of 10 a.m. Saturday in early voting that ends ends Sunday, with 75,657 ballots cast by Democrats, 33,474 by Republicans and 43,936 by unaffiliated voters.
With no competitive mayoral contests in the larger cities, New Britain is the marquee race. Gov. Ned Lamont, Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz and U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal headlined a rally there Saturday for the Democratic nominee, state Rep. Bobby Sanchez.

A victory there would be important to Democrats on two counts: It is home to Stewart, who is exiting city hall to focus on a run for governor in 2026, and it offers a test of the degree to which animosity to President Donald Trump can be used to turn out Democrats who typically vote only in presidential years.
“I’m listening to a lot of individuals throughout the city in New Britain that are not happy with the current administration in Washington, D.C., and I think that’s going to trickle down to our local elections this year,” Sanchez said. “The working poor are really pissed off they are not going to get SNAP benefits.”
The Trump administration ordered the suspension of the SNAP food program, effective on Saturday, the start of the second month of the partial federal shutdown. Two federal judges ordered Friday that payments resume, but it could take days to restart a program that relies on federal vendors using state data to load benefits on electric benefit transfer, or EBT, cards.
Sanchez, 64, is a soft-spoken nonprofit administrator who has been a state lawmaker for 14 years. He trying to become the first Hispanic mayor of a city known for its Polish immigrant heritage but is now 43% Latino or Hispanic and 14% Black.
New Britain is a city of 74,000 where the poverty rate is 20%, median household income is $51,586, nearly 11,000 people rely on SNAP federal assistance for food and 30,000 rely on Medicaid for health care. Democrats are exploiting the interruption of SNAP and threats to Medicaid.
“We’ve made a big point of that in campaigning, that everybody is on the line,” said Don DeFronzo, a former New Britain mayor and state senator supporting Sanchez. Democrats “did a mailing this week that says, ‘Today, it’s SNAP. Tomorrow, it’s Medicaid. Tomorrow, it’s Social Security.’”
GOP voter registration increased during Stewart’s tenure, but Democrats still outnumber Republicans in the city by nearly a 3-1 margin.
The Republican nominee for mayor is Sharon Beloin-Saavedra, 60, an alderwoman who was a Democrat until last year, albeit one who was allied with Stewart and most recently was elected on the GOP line. She bristles at any attempt to associate her with Trump.
“I don’t support Trump, but I support Erin Stewart. I support the city of New Britain,” Beloin-Saavedra said. “Donald Trump has nothing to do with the city of New Britain.”
Ben Proto, the chair of the Connecticut Republican Party, said Trump is a tactical distraction employed by Democrats, not a relevant factor in running a municipality.
“If the most important issue to you is whether or not the pride flag gets flown over town hall, well, I think you’re missing the whole point of municipal government,” Proto said. “I think other people care more about other things, like, more importantly, did my trash get picked up? Did my street get plowed? Did the ambulance show up when my kid fell out of the tree and broke his arm?”
Stewart, anticipating a Republican primary for governor, now embraces Trump after studiously keeping a distance. When she opened an exploratory campaign for governor in January, she announced without prompting that she had voted for Trump in all three of his campaigns for the White House.
“It’s not that she’s necessarily a rabid Trumper, but she empowers him,” DeFronzo said of Beloin-Saavedra. “They all do. By being there, they empower him to do what he’s doing. And no one has the balls to stand up and say, ‘No, stop!’ I think it makes a difference.” 
Speaking at the rally, Blumenthal said, “It’s us vs. them, and you have a right to ask, ‘Who is on my side?’”
Other cities
There are no mayoral races in Bridgeport, Hartford or Waterbury, where mayors are at the midpoint of four year terms.
Stamford Mayor Caroline Simmons and New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker are heavily favored in their reelection campaigns. There are open mayoral races in Hamden and Norwalk, where Democratic primaries in August determined the likely winners on Tuesday, given the voter registration.
On Saturday, Lamont left the New Britain event to campaign in Torrington, where the Republican mayor, Elinor Carbone, also is leaving office after a dozen years.  Democrat Stephen Ivain, a councilman and Democratic chair, is facing Republican Molly E. Spino, a former Marine who has served on the council and board of education.
Torrington has trended Republican in both voter registration and election results. Trump won handily in 2024, and a long-time Democratic lawmaker was unseated.
In Norwich, Democrat Singh Swarnjit is attempting to become first Sikh elected as a mayor in Connecticut. He faces Republican Stacy Gould in a city where Democrats have nearly a 2-1 voter registration advantage. Republican Mayor Peter Nystrom did not seek another term.
In Westport, a wealthy Fairfield County town that also has more than a 2-1 Democratic advantage, Republican First Selectwoman Jen Tooker is not running, creating an opening for Democrats. Tooker won four years ago with just 50.03% of the vote. The candidates trying to succeed her are Democrat Kevin Christie and Republican Don O’Day.
In Branford, Republican First Selectman Jamie Cosgrove is not running, an opportiunity in a community where Democrats outnumber Republicans, 7,113 to 4,362. The candidates are Democrat Josh Brooks and Republican Jeff Vailette.
Bristol, a community with a Democratic edge in voter registration and a history of close elections, has a mayoral rematch. Democrat Ellen Zoppo-Sassu is challenging Republican Jeff Caggiano, who narrowly unseated her four years ago. Trump and national politics went unmentioned in a debate last week.

(Nuclear Regulatory Commission)Swords or ploughshares?
That’s the dilemma that has plagued us since the sudden dawn of the nuclear age. Should we split atoms for peace or to rain destruction on our enemies? In the space of a single human life we’ve done both, killing hundreds of thousands in two atomic bomb attacks on Japan and then building nuclear reactors to provide light, power and medicine.
Radioactivity was discovered just more than a century ago, when Wilhelm Roentgen detected X-rays. In high school textbooks, most of us saw the ghostly radiograph of his wife Anna’s skeletal hand with wedding band, “Hand mit Ringen.” The image — the first X-ray — prompted Anna to remark, “I have seen my own death.” In 1913, science fiction writer H.G. Wells predicted both nuclear power and weaponry, in “The World Set Free.” In 1938, the trio of Hahn, Meitner, and Strassmann were first to recognize that uranium atoms split when bombarded by neutrons. When physicist Leo Szilard confirmed fission, according to author Edward A. Friedman, he said ”the world was headed for sorrow.”
In 1939, Szilard and Albert Einstein sent a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt advising that fission could be used to create a powerful new bomb. The scientists feared the Nazis were already working on such a device, and their letter helped spur creation of the secret Manhattan Project, which eventually resulted to the test firing of the first atomic bomb in a remote part of New Mexico in 1945. Three weeks later came the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan.
The Cold War began shortly after, and by 1949 our former allies, the Soviets, had their own nuclear weapon, too.
Later we created nuclear weapons stockpiles ready to kill hundreds of millions more and built dozens of nuclear generating plants to provide about 20% of the American electrical supply. One of those plants, Wolf Creek, owned by two regional utilities, has been online in Kansas since 1985.
Now comes a firm founded by one of the world’s richest men, Bill Gates, with the lure of bringing “advanced” nuclear power to Kansas. TerraPower announced a partnership last month with the state’s Department of Commerce and Evergy, one of the owners of Wolf Creek, to explore placing a natrium reactor somewhere in the utility’s service area of eastern Kansas.
TerraPower is already building a $4 billion pilot natrium reactor site in Wyoming, with half of the funding from the US Department of Energy. Some of the projected energy may power AI data centers. The company promises clean and safe power through its innovative technology, which uses molten salt (natrium is Latin for sodium) to cool the 345-megawatt reactor instead of water, as is done at Wolf Creek and every other commercial nuclear plant in the U.S.
A few Kansas communities in Evergy country have already tossed their hardhats in the ring to host the natrium reactor, including my home city of Emporia. The city commission, along with the county board and a regional development association, signed a letter of support for the project. Commissioners in Coffey County, home to the Wolf Creek plant, have also expressed interest, as have officials in Hutchinson.
TerraPower claims it will only place reactors where they are wanted, but there’s not been time for any substantive public discussion yet on the issue. Nobody asked Kansans whether we want a second nuclear plant or not. Another firm, Deep Fission, is working with an undisclosed partner to place reactors at the bottom of mile-deep holes in Kansas to supply power-hungry AI centers, but it’s not answering questions about details or whether it has sought state approval.
The gold rush for new nuclear is on.
We are, according to current U.S. policy, on the verge of a “new nuclear renaissance.” Old fears spawned by Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Three Mile Island and Chernobyl are receding in popular memory. There is now public and bipartisan support for expanding nuclear power, according to a Pew Research Center poll.
It is understandable why leaders in a community like Emporia — which logged the state’s highest unemployment following the closure of Tyson meats — would find TerraPower’s projected 1,500 construction and 500 permanent jobs attractive.
But those vying to bring TerraPower jobs to their communities might want to cool their enthusiasm long enough to consider the safety and security risks presented by natrium reactors.
These risks were described to me by Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit science advocacy group. Lyman is an expert on nuclear proliferation, terrorism, and safety and security. He’s also one of the authors of “Fukishima: The Story of a Nuclear Disaster.”
“I have signifcant concerns,” Lyman said, “related to safety and security as well as for the economics. … It’s inexplicable to me why there’s so much enthusiasm for this type of reactor.”
When I spoke with Lyman on Tuesday, he’d just finished monitoring a multi-day Nuclear Regulatory Commission advisory committee meeting reviewing the preliminary safeguard assessment of the TerraPower’s Wyoming reactor.
It is important to note that TerraPower refused my repeated requests for an interview. “TerraPower will have to politely decline participation in this opportunity at this time,” public relations specialist Brooke Leader said on behalf of the firm.
The problems with the natrium reactor, Lyman said, are inherent in the design of any sodium-cooled reactor. The molten sodium bursts into flame upon contact with air or water, he said, and these types of reactors have historically been expensive to build and prone to leaks. But, he said, the most worrying thing about the natrium reactor is that it uses fuel enriched to up to 20% of the isotope Uranium 235. This fuel is called HALEU, for high assay low enrichment uranium, and it’s just below the threshold for weapons-grade material.
Conventional nuclear reactors use fuel that is between 3 and 5% enriched.
Natrium reactors require HALEU to make them smaller and more efficient, Lyman said, but there is no domestic source of this fuel available in the quantities needed. In addition, security at natrium reactors would have to be beefed up compared with conventional reactors, because HALEU is attractive to terrorists and rogue states. Enriching uranium to 20% represents most of the effort required to make weapons-grade material.
In addition, there’s the problem — inherent with every reactor currently operating or planned in the United States — that there’s no long-term storage solution for spent fuel. Work on the Yucca Mountain geologic repository was halted in 2010. All waste is stored on-site, in cooling ponds and dry casks. It will remain hazardous for much longer than there has been recorded history — tens of thousands of years.
We can’t even keep the government running year-round or provide reliable food and health care to our poorest Americans. How can we expect to keep the distant future safe from us?
The immediate risk with a natrium reactor, Lyman said, is fire.
Molten sodium “is a highly reactive material, so you have to keep it away from the air and water at all costs,” Lyman said, “or you could end up with a sodium fire. And having a nuclear reactor where the coolant itself can catch on fire just sounds like a bad idea. It really is. So they have to go to extraordinary lengths to prevent any exposure of the coolant to air or water.”
This adds a level of unneeded complexity, he said. Even though TerraPower claims that natrium reactors are safer than light water-cooled reactors, Lyman said just the opposite is true. The time to respond to accidents is much shorter, he said, and there is no containment structure — the familiar dome-shaped vessel — as additional backup to contain leaks.
“The Department of Energy is trying, with Congress’s help, to stimulate and stand up a whole production program for this kind of (HALEU) material,” Lyman said. “But the demand is very unclear. The investments are on the order of billions and billions of dollars for an infrastructure to make this fuel. It’s a risky proposition, and it’s not clear that TerraPower is going to have the amount of fuel it needs just for the first plant.”
Because TerraPower would not speak to me, I will rely on author Edward A. Friedman, in his 2025 book “Nuclear Energy: boom, Bust, and Emerging Renaissance,” to make the case for next generation reactor technology.
“The promise for successful realization of (advanced) technology was significantly enhanced with the groundbreaking of the TerraPower sodium-cooled natrium reactor,” Friedman writes. Bills Gates’s company, TerraPower, began construction June 10, 2024, at Kemmerer, Wyoming,  “of the natrium fast-neutron, liquid sodium-cooled reactor (SFR) that uses an associated liquid salt storage system. This fail-safe, small modular reactor (SMR) will be the first model in the world for cost-effective replacement of a coal-fired power plant with a nuclear reactor.”
The reactor is expected to become operational in 2030.
Gates hopes for hundreds of coal-to-nuclear transformations in the future, according to Friedman. Indeed, the vision of replacing fossil fuel that drove Gates to found TerraPower in the first place.
“There’s no scenario in which we keep adding carbon to the atmosphere and the world stops getting hotter,” Gates wrote in his 2021 book, “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster.”
“The hotter it gets, the harder it will be for humans to survive, much less thrive,” Gates wrote.
Nuclear is the only carbon-free energy source, he said, that can reliably deliver power day and night through any type of weather on a large scale. It’s also one of the few practical ways to bring electricity to the poorest of countries, such as those found in sub-Saharan Africa. Access to energy is highly correlated to wealth and happiness.
“It’s no secret that nuclear power has its problems,” Gates wrote. “It’s very expensive to build today. Human error can cause accidents. Uranium, the fuel it uses, can be converted for use in weapons. The waste is dangerous and hard to store.”
Yet, nuclear represented our best hope of stopping global warming, he claimed. There was nothing more important than halting the rise in temperature if we were to avoid catastrophe.
Recently, Gates has changed his tune on climate.
In a memo to COP30, the United Nations climate change conference scheduled for next week in Brazil, Gates abandoned his previous “net zero” views. He criticized “doomsday” climate scenarios and suggested that people will be able to “live and thrive” in most places on Earth for the foreseeable future. It’s time to put “human welfare” at the center of climate strategies and improving agriculture and health in the poorest countries.
“Climate change is a serious problem,” he said, “but it will not be the end of civilization.”
The memo sounds like nothing short of a retreat from climate activism from a man who had spent personal billions on a quest for net zero. In the case of his push for advanced reactors, Gates may have been so driven by his desire to stop global warming that he swallowed the nuclear pill.
His sudden redirection must be having some effect on TerraPower, the company he founded. But his memo will have no effect on the U.S. delegation to COP30, because there will be no official American presence there. Donald Trump had already pulled the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement. The world has now blown past the agreement’s 1.5 degree Celsius limit on global warming, with more climate suffering to follow.
Trump recently directed the United States to resume nuclear weapons testing, something we haven’t done since 1992. There is not yet a name for this arms race, but it is on as surely as the seas are rising. I am reminded of Damocles from Greek mythology, who was taught the dangers of power by the sword dangling above. So let us call this the Age of Damocles, because nothing is happy for those wracked by anxiety.
It is no coincidence that we embrace a new arms race at the same moment we accelerate the regulatory process to approve and deploy new types of nuclear reactors that use disturbingly enriched fuel. While nuclear proponents like Friedman dismiss opposition to nuclear power as an artifact of the Cold War and media misinformation, there were reasons for those fears. Troubling issues remain.
Opposition to nuclear power that curbed the U.S. nuclear power program from the 1980s until recently was based not only on fictional movies like 1979’s “The China Syndrome” but in real-life accidents like Fukishima in 2011, in which an earthquake and tsunami shut down the power grid and made it impossible to cool the reactors. More recently, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine, has caused alarm because it’s been damaged and sometimes cut off in the ongoing war with Russia. Movies that might contain some inaccuracies, such as the 2019 HBO miniseries “Chernobyl,” are not causes of our nuclear jitters but expressions of them.
This is the global context in which we find ourselves pondering whether a new type of nuclear energy is good for Kansas or just a costly experiment that will risk accident or murderous mayhem. We live in a new period of global instability, one driven by all the old forces — greed, ignorance, haste, denial — that have plagued us since the ice receded. The communications from TerraPower have been carefully curated to present a sanitized version of a techno billionaire philanthropist’s dream of a nuclear renaissance.
I’m cold to the idea of spending billions on nuke plants to power, in large part, electricity-hungry AI data centers. It seems immoral when so many Americans go hungry and are without health insurance. Beyond that, there’s just too many unanswered questions about next-generation reactors.
But I’m opposed to the TerraPower plan for a natrium reactor in Kansas not because of the unknowns — where, how much, how long? — but because of what we do know. The HALEU fuel, in the amounts needed, presents an unacceptable risk of nuclear proliferation.
Let us not unknowingly beat our ploughshares into swords.

Manfred Mann
Has this ever happened to you?  You’re driving on a narrow road in the dark, when the headlights of oncoming traffic suddenly blind you, leaving you wondering where is the road and whether you might crash.


With sunset now coming as early as 5 p.m. (thanks to the return to Standard Time), driving in the dark becomes a real challenge if not a danger.  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) data shows nighttime crashes are three times more likely than daytime, even on dry roads.
Why is this happening?  There are several reasons that headlights appear so bright.  The first is that the headlights may not be properly aligned, aiming too high.  And with more vehicles riding higher from the road (think SUVs and trucks), their headlights shine more directly into oncoming traffic.
Most problematic are the new kinds of headlights we use.  The older incandescent (yellowish) lightbulbs are being replaced by LED or xenon lights, which are blue-white and more glaring to your eyes. That’s because bright oncoming headlights, especially the bluish ones, cause the pupils in your eyes to constrict rapidly, literally blinding you until the oncoming vehicle passes and your eyes adjust.
What can you do? When bright lights come at you, don’t look into the oncoming beam.  Instead, look to the right edge or lane marker of your driving lane.  Use anti-glare mirrors, especially  in your rearview mirror,  so headlights on vehicles behind you don’t hit your eyes.
Most of all, slow down!  Being blinded on darkened roads, coated with wet slippery leaves, is dangerous.
Will blue light glasses help?  Even with good driving habits, glare from new headlight technology can still feel intense leading some drivers to look for solutions like special glasses.  
But the jury’s still out on this idea.  Some manufacturers and optometrists say that lenses designed to block or filter short-wavelength blue light can help reduce the perceived glare by filtering out that part of the spectrum.  Some glasses described as “for night driving” (the ones that are often yellow in tint) also have reflective coatings.
Doctors say some patients swear by these specs, making them more confident.  But safety experts say you shouldn’t take this as license to drive faster than is safe for the road conditions.
What else can you do? You can start by making sure you’re not part of the problem.  Get your own headlights checked for alignment at your mechanic or national chains like Midas or Goodyear.  It’ll cost you about $100.
It used to be that the Connecticut Division of Motor Vehicles checked headlight alignments during your bi-annual emissions tests, but that ended in 2001.  A bill (HB 6163) before the Connecticut legislature in 2023 would have restored those tests, but it never became law.
In the United Kingdom they’re taking this problem more seriously, upping testing of headlight brightness and where they aim down the road.  Some are even calling for a ban on super-bright LED and xenon bulbs.  UK stats claim 280 collisions a year in that country are caused by the dazzling bulbs.
Meantime, take it easy on the roads at night.  Maybe even avoid driving in those hours, if you can.  Try the glasses, if you’d like.  But above all… stay safe!",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/headlights.jpg,,,2025-11-02 04:56:18.340335

(Photo by Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)[2025 governor's race Voter Guide: Where NJ’s governor hopefuls stand on the issues]NEWARK — Former President Barack Obama made a push for Democratic gubernatorial nominee Rep. Mikie Sherrill during a raucous campaign rally just days before Election Day.
“If you meet this moment, if you believe change can happen, you will not just elect Mikie Sherrill as your next governor, you will not just put New Jersey on a brighter path, you will set a glorious example for this nation,” Obama said Saturday to a packed house in the Essex County College gym.
More than 2,000 people attended the rally, cheering for the former president, chanting in support of Sherrill, and holding blue-and-white signs reading, “Hit the road, Jack,” and “Let’s land this,” a reference to Sherrill’s background as a helicopter pilot for the U.S. Navy. Hundreds who couldn’t snag tickets watched on a screen outside.
Saturday’s event was the latest in a string of events to boost voter turnout ahead of Tuesday’s election, where Sherrill and Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli are on the ballot. Polls show Sherrill ahead with a narrow lead, and Ciattarelli has been holding his own campaign stops with high-profile guests.
New Jersey is one of two states with a gubernatorial election this year, and they are often framed as a signal of voter sentiment one year after the presidential race and a year ahead of congressional elections.
Democrats from across the state came out to support Sherrill, including Democratic Reps. LaMonica McIver, Rob Menendez, Frank Pallone, and Nellie Pou, and local lawmakers like state Sens. Teresa Ruiz and Vin Gopal. Gov. Phil Murphy and his wife, Tammy, also spoke to the crowd in advance of the ex-president’s remarks. 
Rep. Josh Gottheimer, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, and former teachers union chief Sean Spiller — who all ran against Sherrill in the June Democratic primary — also attended. 
Sherrill, who walked on stage to Bruce Springsteen’s “Born to Run,” was greeted with a standing ovation and chants of “Mikie! Mikie!” 
She largely repeated her standard stump-speech promises, saying she would stand up to President Donald Trump, make New Jersey more affordable, and fight for the middle class. She also restated her pledges to freeze utility rates on her first day in office, lower prescription drug costs, and improve public schools. 
Sherrill attacked Ciattarelli for aligning with Trump, who held a tele-rally in support of the GOP nominee last week. The crowd often booed at the mere mention of Republicans. 
“I’m feeling nothing but courage. New Jersey will need courage, courage to make a change,” Sherrill said during her 20-minute speech. “Anger and courage are the daughters of hope.”

More than 1 million people have already cast ballots in New Jersey, either through early in-person voting or using mail ballots. Sherrill encouraged everyone to get their “friends, family, and frenemies” to get out and vote. 
Obama took the stage at around 7 p.m., hours after appearing in Virginia to support Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee in that state’s governor’s race. During his 40-minute speech, during which the audience in Newark remained standing, Obama told voters they “have a candidate worth being excited about.”
He slammed Trump for unleashing masked law enforcement to enforce immigration laws, wreaking havoc on federal workers and people dependent on food stamps during the government shutdown, and weaponizing the U.S. Department of Justice to go after his political enemies.
Obama said the country and our politics are “in a pretty dark place right now.”
“The good news is there is something you can do about it, New Jersey, right here, right now. You’ve got a candidate for governor … someone who sees you and knows your struggles,” he said. 
Obama said Sherrill, if elected, would work “with anyone if it helps the people of New Jersey, and she will listen to everyone too, whether they voted for her or not.” 
He also took aim at Ciattarelli for running for governor three times — Obama joked he believes in “persistence, but at a certain point” — and said that during Ciattarelli’s current campaign, he had to “suck up” to Trump. 
“At the end of the day, what this election is about, what politics in a democracy is always about, is values,” he said. “What do we care about? What are we voting for? What do we prioritize? What are our core convictions?”

Obama headlined the event, where Virginia Democratic lawmakers at the state and federal level as well as Spanberger’s running mates spoke in support of her in a final attempt to galvanize voters ahead of Tuesday’s historic race, where Spanberger or Republican nominee Winsome Earle-Sears will be elected the state’s first woman governor.
The crowd of roughly 7,000 chanted “yes we can” and sang songs before the speakers — including Virginia Senate President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Newport News and Democratic lieutenant governor nominee Ghazala Hashmi and attorney general candidate Jay Jones — took the stage.

All of them drew applause, but the crowd roared with excitement when the country’s 44th president walked to the podium. The rally, days ahead of Election Day, is the third time Obama has stumped for Virginia’s gubernatorial nominees since leaving the White House.
Obama portrayed Spanberger as a “workhorse” in Congress whose bipartisan track record will translate to good governing. 
“Abigail does not just say the right thing,” Obama said. “As your governor, she will do the right thing.” 
Spanberger called Obama “someone who represents the very best of public service” whom she was “honored and humbled” to have in Virginia to cheer her on.
 Themes of service, bipartisan cooperation

Service, Spanberger emphasized in her speech before Obama’s, has been the core of her career — first, in law enforcement, then the Central Intelligence Agency, and later in Congress where she worked with lawmakers of both parties to pass bills that became law. 
She recalled how health care policy first inspired her to run for office. Frustrated by Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act — Obama’s legacy as president — she said “I knew I had to do something.” 
“Spoiler alert, I won,” she said of being elected to Congress, flipping the 7th  District to Democratic control and defending the seat two more terms before deciding to seek the governorship. 
Health care remains a critical issue this election cycle both in Virginia and nationally, as the Republican-controlled Congress passed a reconciliation bill this summer that will trigger changes to hospital funding mechanisms and may cause millions of Americans to lose Medicaid coverage. Members of Virginia’s congressional delegation are also trying to extend ACA subsidies that help low-income earners purchase health insurance, but those efforts have been stalled amid the current government shutdown. 
In addition to health care affordability, Spanberger noted her goals to address housing, and energy affordability and said as governor, she would stand firm against overreach from President Donald Trump’s administration while finding ways to work across the aisle. 
“You deserve a governor who will work with Democrats and Republicans to grow our economy and not stand by while Virginia’s workforce is under attack,” she said, a reference to the Trump administration’s layoffs of federal workers. Virginia is home to nearly 150,000 civilian federal employees.
“When I was in Congress, I worked with anybody and everybody to deliver results,” Spanberger said. 
 ‘We need that light’

After branding her the next governor of Virginia, Obama asked voters to cast their ballots for Spanberger. As he reflected on the first 10 months of Trump’s second term in office — marked by the federal layoffs, ramped up anti-immigration efforts and growing economic strains — Obama pitched Spanberger as an inspiration amid the widescale uncertainty. 
“And Lord knows, we need that light. We need that inspiration, because let’s face it, our country and our politics are in a pretty dark place right now,” he said. “It’s hard to know where to start, because every day, this White House offers up a fresh batch of lawlessness and recklessness and mean-spiritedness and just plain craziness.”
“I know I’m the ‘hope and change’ guy,” Obama said in reference to his winning presidential campaign slogans, but he emphasized he is “worried” about the direction of the nation under Trump. Obama criticized Capitol Hill Republicans for the ongoing government shutdown and Trump for “using the Justice Department for going after his political opponents,” “deploying the National Guard in American cities, claiming to stop crime waves that don’t actually exist,” and other actions to which the crowd booed in response.  
“Don’t boo, vote,” Obama said, a callback to 2016 when he supported Hillary Clinton for president. “They don’t hear boos, they hear votes.”
 Jones joins the rally

The event also featured Democratic lieutenant governor candidate Hashmi and attorney general candidate Jones — the first time both have campaigned in person with Spanberger since news broke of violent texts Jones sent in 2022. 
Jones apologized to former Virginia House Speaker Todd Gilbert and his family for the texts at an  Oct. 16 debate with Republican incumbent Jason Miyares. In the messages, Jones said hypothetically he would kill Gilbert with “two bullets” and referenced his children dying.  
The incident was not rehashed during the Saturday rally with Obama, as Jones reiterated his commitment to standing up to Trump if elected. As the top lawyers for the state, attorneys general have responsibilities that range from consumer protection to providing legal counsel to governors and signing onto multi-state lawsuits. 
“I’m running for attorney general to put Virginia first,” he said as the crowd cheered. 
With over one million votes already cast via early voting, Election Day on Tuesday, Nov. 4 will determine who next helms Virginia’s executive branch and which party will control its House of Delegates, where all 100 seats are on the ballot.

The Caesar Rodney Riders scored 21 points in the second quarter to beat the Cape Henlopen Vikings, 35-14, Thursday night.
 
CAMDEN — Amidst a moderate downpour of rain, Caesar Rodney’s senior quarterback Quinn Deviere stood in the pistol formation awaiting the snap on third down. Needing four yards for a new set of downs, Deviere caught the snap and surveyed the field starting to his right working his way back to the middle of the field. That’s where he found sophomore Denzel Jones.
Deviere launched his pass through the rain to Jones overtop the second level of the defense. Jones leaped up and caught the elevated pass securing it with two hands without breaking his stride. Jones burst across the field to the left sideline where he turned upfield and finished the play in the endzone for the Riders’ first score of the game. 
Jones’ 46-yard touchdown catch was one of three consecutive touchdowns for Caesar Rodney in the second quarter that helped them defeat Cape Henlopen, 35-14, Thursday night.
The Riders scored their next touchdown just a few minutes after their first. The Riders started their offensive possession on the Vikings’ 20 yard line following a turnover on the kick-off. On the second play of the drive, Deviere connected with senior Jayden Minor at the back of the endzone to take the lead. 
Deviere’s third touchdown pass of the game came in the final minutes of the first half on a deep ball to Jones. The sophomore caught the pass and raced 60-yards to the endzone completing a strong second quarter for Caesar Rodney.

The whole second quarter was played while rain poured down on the players, coaches and fans. The heaviest rain started with about six minutes left to play in the first quarter and lasted until the end of the half. The skies were clear for the Riders’ senior night celebration pregame and the Vikings first touchdown of the game in the first quarter.  
Junior quarterback Jameson Tingle scored Cape Henlopen’s first touchdown on their first offensive possession of the game. On third and goal, Tingle took the quarterback keeper and dove into the endzone for the rushing touchdown. Junior running back Ozmeer Batson scored the Vikings’ other touchdown in the late stages of the third quarter on a one yard run through the middle of the defense.

The Riders held the district’s second best scoring offense scoreless the rest of the way and added a pair of scores in the fourth quarter to earn the victory.
Caesar Rodney is 2-2 in 3A district two play this season sitting behind the undefeated Smyrna High School in the standings. Cape Henlopen is also 2-2 in district play. The two teams are tied with St. Georges and Sussex Central whom also have 2-2 district records.

McConnell ordered that the government distribute payments of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits. Because Congress is locked in a stalemate over a stopgap spending bill and did not appropriate money for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, Trump administration officials had said the program could not provide SNAP benefits beyond Saturday.In response to McConnell, President Donald Trump in a social media post later Friday said administration lawyers believed the funds could not legally be paid and that he needed clarification about how to distribute SNAP benefits. “I do not want Americans to go hungry just because the Radical Democrats refuse to do the right thing and REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT,” Trump said.  “If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding …”Government lawyers also filed a brief in the Rhode Island case asking McConnell to clarify how his order could legally be carried out, noting it was delivered orally and there was no written transcript.In his Saturday order, McConnell, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, quoted Trump and said, “So, here’s the ORDER and here’s the legal direction from the Court.”In a footnote, the McConnell order also said: “The Court greatly appreciates the President’s quick and definitive response to this Court’s Order and his desire to provide the necessary SNAP funding.”McConnell said it was likely that the plaintiffs would succeed in their case. He noted that Congress appropriated funds for SNAP in an annual spending bill, and lawmakers directed that $3 billion should be put in reserve through Sept. 30, 2026. Another $3 billion in a later bill was put aside until Sept. 30, 2027. “There is no question that the congressionally approved contingency funds must be used now because of the shutdown; in fact, the President during his first term issued guidance indicating that these contingency funds are available if SNAP funds lapse due to a government shutdown,” McConnell said.Two options in written orderBecause the $6 billion is not enough to cover the estimated $9 billion cost of November benefits, government lawyers have said it would be difficult to determine reduced benefits, McConnell said. He said USDA then should “within its discretion, find the additional funds necessary” to fund the full $9 billion, suggesting use of $23 billion in a fund for state child nutrition programs.If the government chooses to make full SNAP payments for November, it must do so by the end of the day Monday, he said. If instead the government makes a partial payment of SNAP funds, then it must pay out all the $6 billion in contingency funds by Wednesday, he said.He asked the government to update him by noon Monday how it was complying with the order.In a separate case, a federal judge in Boston also ruled Friday that the USDA plan to pause SNAP was illegal — but gave the Trump administration until Monday to respond to her finding before she decides on a motion to force the benefits be paid despite the ongoing government shutdown.No matter what happens on Monday, experts and a key member of Congress have said that some SNAP recipients still may see delays in their benefits because changes in administration from the federal government to states to vendors take time. In states, SNAP benefits are loaded onto cards on varying dates, but the Saturday cutoff would have been effective for November benefits.",,,,2025-11-01 17:00:57.686047

First, colleges are not doing enough to build purpose, confidence, agency, and maturity. Colleges are not the cause of growing anxiety and a declining sense of purpose among young people; but, faced with the reality of these trends, colleges have not changed their models nearly enough to help students build purpose, confidence, agency, and maturity. 
Second, colleges are not doing enough to build “durable” or “transferable” skills and the networks and experiences students need to transition successfully from high school to 21st century careers that pay good wages.  
There is a striking gap between what students and college administrators think students have learned and can do, and what employers think students can do, particularly in vital areas such as communication, critical thinking, professionalism, and leadership. For example, 81 percent of recent graduates feel they are adept at critical thinking, while only 56 percent of employers agree. Seventy-eight percent of new graduates say they are proficient at communication, while only 54 percent of employers agree. 
Third, colleges cost too much. While many colleges and degrees still provide a great return on investment, many do not. Over the last 80 years, the relative portion of college costs borne by students/families, philanthropy, and the public sector has gone up and down, but the actual cost of delivering a year of college has risen sharply — at about four times the rate of inflation. 
The cost today of delivering a year of college education (not including research expenses, housing, etc.) at a four-year institution ranges from approximately $25,000 to $40,000,   compared to the average cost per student of delivering a year of K-12 education of about $16,000. And this is true even though K-12 students are in class for about 950 hours a year and college students are in class for about 350 hours a year. 
After a career spent mostly in K-12 education, for the last decade I have partnered closely with 20 different four-year colleges and universities, including public and private, large and small, selective and not selective. Each of these institutions offer strong programs backed by committed faculty and staff. But none is doing nearly enough to address the root causes of this trio of crises – a crisis of purpose, a crisis of skills, and a crisis of cost.  
The result is that American young people and their families are voting with their feet (the percentage of high school graduates choosing to enroll in college has declined from 70 percent in 2009 to 61 percent in 2023) and Americans of all ages are sharing their opinions about college, including at the ballot box.  
According to Gallup, the percentage of Americans expressing “a great deal” or “quite a lot” of confidence in higher education declined from 58 to 36 percent over the last 10 years while the percent expressing “very little” or “no” confidence shot up from 10 to 32 percent. 
So what should be done? And how can Massachusetts – home to America’s first public school (Boston Latin), first university (Harvard), and one of the greatest concentrations of colleges (104 colleges in a state of 7 million residents) – lead the way? 
I believe we need fundamentally new models for teaching and learning and that the new models need to break the monopoly of “sage on the stage” teaching and lean into an experiential learning revolution – a dramatic increase in real-world, apprenticeship-based, internship-based, and work-based learning.  We need to get students out of the classroom and out into the community.  
When I was in college, I learned a lot from some very sagacious professors who lectured and led discussions in their area of expertise. But I learned much more from job and internship experiences out in the real world. My experience is not an outlier. A survey sponsored by Hult International Business School reported that 77 percent of young people entering business careers said they learned more in their first six months of work after college than they did in four years of college. Why not make college more like those first six months of work? 
To be clear, I don’t think the purpose of college is just to prepare young people for work. And I do think an important role remains for “sage on the stage” instruction, including lectures, guided discussions, and liberal arts inquiry led by skilled professors. The purpose of college should include preparation for work, but also preparation of young people for a life of purpose, a life of civic leadership, and a life of critical thinking and action as citizens in a democracy, and as family and community members. 
What are some new college models that could point the way forward – and that could address the three crises of purpose, skills, and cost? 

A whole new type of college – an apprenticeship college – where half the credit comes from purposeful work with special projects, guided challenges, reflection, mentorship, and more. Reach University is piloting this approach with future teachers and public health workers, and College for Social Innovation, the nonprofit I lead, is exploring the creation of a two-year public service college built around four immersive public service internships as well as related courses in problem solving, human centered design, and communication. History credits can come from studying the history of social change movements in Boston and math credits from diving deep on the use of data to explain the successes and challenges of various social impact strategies. But the internships themselves – packed with research, project management, independent learning, and mentorship – need to be credited too. 


A whole new type of college that is organized around missions, not majors, and that includes deep Outward Bound-type experiences at launch, at least two immersive high-impact learning semesters that offer learning primarily outside of the traditional classroom (with full academic credit), and a requirement that every student complete a capstone project that connects to their personal and professional mission. Colleges built around mission and purpose can build from an emerging network of “microcolleges” such as Deep Springs College in Nevada, Thoreau College in Wisconsin, and the Seguinland Institute in Maine, all supported by Springboard, a nonprofit designed to research and support small and purpose-driven learning communities. 


A whole new type of college that marries AmeriCorps or other intense and well-scaffolded service experiences with deep mentoring and low-cost distance learning taken at whatever pace is desired by the learner — with degrees earned over two years or over 10 years. This model can build on the work at Boston-based nonprofit Duet, which in partnership with Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) enrolls low-income students to work toward associate or bachelor’s degrees, using just half of their Pell grant to pay for classes at SNHU and the other half to pay for intensive mentoring and personalized coaching from Duet.  

The dramatic changes we need will require new and disruptive innovations – new “microcolleges” with the freedom to invent new approaches to higher education. But I also believe that many of New England’s current public and private universities have the potential to pivot and to build on the many superb things they are already doing while also adding substantially more real-world learning with substantially more rigorous assessment of that learning. The recent effort across Massachusetts public universities to dramatically expand work-based learning programs, supported by the Axim Collaborative, is a good start.  
The challenge is to move immersive, experiential learning from the sidelines to the center and from extracurricular to curricular. A related challenge is to measure learning much more robustly in a way that marries the mastery of competencies such as storytelling, data visualization, human-centered research and design, and project management with credits and credentials.  
In the future workforce, jobs that require simple research and even powerful regurgitation will be done by AI, by robots, or by low-wage labor from other countries. Great jobs will still exist, but they will require the type of nimble problem solving that can only be learned through real-world practice and experience. Colleges need to realize that what the students are learning today is not enough anymore. 
Our goal must be nothing less than a bottom-up rethinking of that period between high school and adulthood that finds new ways to build confidence and purpose, new ways to build skills and networks, and that does it for an affordable price.  
I often refer to Boston as “the Silicon Valley of social innovation,” and that description has been well earned over the centuries. Now we face a new crisis around the declining efficacy of one of those innovations – higher education – and we need to lead the nation again, in an experiential learning revolution – a set of solutions that help more young people become the leaders we need and the fulfilled adults they want to become.

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-01 17:05:54+00:00,Mississippi Today,Uncertainty over federal food aid deepens as the shutdown fight reaches a crisis point,Associated Press,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/01/uncertainty-over-federal-food-aid-deepens-shutdown-fight-reaches-crisis/,Crises at the heart of the government shutdown were in focus as the federal food assistance program faced delays and millions of Americans were set to see a dramatic rise in their health insurance bills.,"WASHINGTON — The crises at the heart of the government shutdown fight in Washington were coming to a head Saturday as the federal food assistance program faced delays and millions of Americans were set to see a dramatic rise in their health insurance bills.
The impacts on basic needs — food and medical care — underscored how the impasse is hitting homes across the United States. Plans by the Trump administration to freeze payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program on Saturday were halted by federal judges, but the delay in payouts will still likely leave millions of people short on their grocery bills.
It all added to the strain on the country, with a month of missed paychecks for federal workers and growing air travel delays. The shutdown is already the second longest in history and entered its second month on Saturday, yet there was little urgency in Washington to end it. Lawmakers are away from Capitol Hill and both parties are entrenched in their positions.
The House has not met for legislative business in more than six weeks, while Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., closed his chamber for the weekend after bipartisan talks failed to achieve significant progress.
Thune said he is hoping “the pressure starts to intensify, and the consequences of keeping the government shut down become even more real for everybody that they will express, hopefully new interest in trying to come up with a path forward.”
The stalemate appears increasingly unsustainable as Republican President Donald Trump demands action and Democratic leaders warn that an uproar over rising health insurance costs will force Congress to act.
“This weekend, Americans face a health care crisis unprecedented in modern times,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said this week.
Delays and uncertainty around SNAP
The Department of Agriculture planned to withhold payments to the food program starting on Saturday until two federal judges ordered the administration to make them. Trump said he would provide the money but wanted more legal direction from the court, which will not happen until Monday.
Benefits were already facing delays because it takes a week or more to load SNAP cards in many states.
“People are just nervous, scared,” said Jill Corbin, the director of the St. Vincent De Paul soup kitchen and food pantry in Norwich, Connecticut. ”It’s not really a definite answer that we have right now.”
As people lined up early Saturday for hot meals and groceries, the Connecticut organization had 10 extra volunteers to help newcomers navigate the process. On Wednesday, some 400 families visited the food pantry and 555 people received hot meals.
“It’s kind of like everything is unraveling at the same time,” Corbin said. “I’m not going to lie. It is challenging.”
The SNAP program serves about 1 in 8 Americans and costs about $8 billion per month. The judges agreed that the USDA needed to at least tap a contingency fund of about $5 billion to keep the program running. But that left some uncertainty about whether the department would use additional money or only provide partial benefits for the month.
“The Trump administration needs to follow the law and fix this problem immediately by working closely with states to get nutritional assistance to the millions who rely on it as soon as possible,” House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said in a statement following the ruling.
Democrats demanded this week that the government fund SNAP, but Republicans responded by arguing the program is in such a dire situation because Democrats have repeatedly voted against a short-term government funding bill.
“We are now reaching a breaking point thanks to Democrats voting no on government funding, now 14 different times,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said at a news conference Friday.
Trump injected himself into the debate late Thursday by suggesting that Republican senators, who hold the majority, end the shutdown by getting rid of the filibuster rules that prevent most legislation from advancing unless it has the support of at least 60 senators. Democrats have used the filibuster to block a funding bill in the Senate for weeks.
Republican leaders quickly rejected Trump’s idea, but the discussion showed how desperate the fight has become.
Health care subsidies expiring
The annual sign-up period for the Affordable Care Act health insurance also begins Saturday, and there are sharp increases in what people are paying for coverage. Enhanced tax credits that help most enrollees pay for the health plans are set to expire next year.
Democrats have rallied around a push to extend those credits and have refused to vote for government funding legislation until Congress acts.
Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., spoke on the Senate floor this week about constituents who she said face premium increases of up to $2,000 a month if the credits expire.
“I am hearing from families in my state today who are panicked,” she said. “The time to act is now.”
If Congress does not extend the credits, subsidized enrollees will face cost increases of about 114%, or more than $1,000 per year, on average, health care research nonprofit KFF found.
In the days before the start of open enrollment, Democratic officials across the country warned that the cost increases would hit their constituents hard.
In Wisconsin, for example, families on the ACA’s silver plan could see premium increases of roughly $12,500 to $24,500 annually depending on their location. Sixty-year-old couples could face increases ranging from nearly $19,900 to $33,150 annually.
“No matter what the percentage is, it’s a hell of a lot,” Gov. Tony Evers, D-Wis., said.
Some Republicans in Congress have been open to the idea of extending the subsidies, but they also want to make major changes to the health overhaul enacted while Democrat Barack Obama was president. Thune has offered Democrats a vote on extending the benefits, but has not guaranteed a result. And he is demanding that Democrats first vote to reopen the government.
So the country waits and watches for Congress to act.
T.J. McCuin, whose family owns and operates farmers markets in Mesa and Apache Junction, Arizona, said 15% of the markets’ customers use SNAP benefits. He was not assuming the delays would immediately hurt the business, but added, “Hopefully this isn’t a long-term problem because once those benefits run out, then it’s going to start to hurt.”

(Photo by Clisby/Daily Express/Hulton Archive/Getty Images)​Martha Layne Collins, who as the only woman to serve as governor of Kentucky revolutionized the state’s economy by landing Toyota Motor Manufacturing, died at 3 a.m. Saturday, Nov. 1, in Lexington. She was 88.
Her husband, Dr. Bill Collins, said his wife died in her sleep at Richmond Place, a retirement community in Lexington where they have been living. 
“I was with her. We had a lady for hospice, and caregivers came in and out. She died peacefully. She lived a remarkable life,” he said.
Her remarkable life began with her birth in Shelby County on Dec. 7, 1936. She served as governor from 1983 to 1987, when Kentucky governors were limited to one term.  
Collins was considered a candidate in 1984 for vice president of the United States as a running mate with Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale, who instead chose Geraldine Ferraro.
Collins was elected lieutenant governor in 1979 and served simultaneously with Democratic Gov. John Y. Brown Jr.  
Collins got off to a rocky start as governor but after the first two years excelled, using economic incentives to bring Japanese automaker Toyota’s largest manufacturing plant to Georgetown in 1986, a development that remains an economic mainstay in Kentucky.  
Collins also successfully pushed for improvements in education. In June 1985 she unveiled a package that raised teachers’ salaries by 5%, reduced class sizes, funded construction projects, provided aides in kindergarten classrooms and helped find more money for poorer school districts. 
After leaving office, she was president of St. Catharine College in Springfield from 1990 to 1996 and later taught leadership classes at the Harvard Institute of Politics’ John F. Kenedy School of Government.
Dr. Collins said their children, Steve and Marla, will decide arrangements.  Steve is director of Hall-Taylor Funeral Home in downtown Shelbyville, which his grandfather, Martha Layne’s father, Everett Hall, operated.

(Photo by Minh Ha/Verite News)The Federal Communications Commission voted Tuesday to loosen regulations set just last year that would have significantly reduced the rates that prisoners, jail detainees and their loved ones pay to keep in touch.
In July 2024, the FCC passed its first cap on rates that prisons and jails — along with their telecommunications contractors — can charge inmates to make audio calls. The rule, originally scheduled to take effect at the beginning of this year, set the rate at 6 cents per minute for a 15-minute call for large jails and prisons, far below the rates that most people were paying in Louisiana, where some parish jails were charging as much as 25 cents per minute, according to a 2022 report by the Prison Policy Initiative.
Criminal justice reform advocates, including Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson, who runs New Orleans’ jail, have argued that high call rates stretch family budgets and prohibit the type of connectivity that studies show is beneficial to incarcerated people and their families.

Still, for decades people behind bars and their loved ones have been forced to pay exorbitant rates to stay in touch, while telecommunications companies and facility operators have traditionally split the revenue they made from enforcing high rates.
Hutson, who will step down in May after losing her reelection bid this month secured a new contract that offers one free 15-minute phone call per day and one free 20-minute video call per week to jail detainees.
Neither Hutson, nor Sheriff-elect Michelle Woodfork immediately responded to requests for comment from Verite News.
In 2023, Congress granted the FCC the authority to regulate phone rates and in 2024 it voted unanimously to significantly limit the amount that telecommunications companies and the facilities that they provide service to can charge for calls.
But the rule never took full effect. State prison systems and local jails, such as the New Orleans city jail, that had active contracts with telecommunications providers were given a one-year grace period to adjust their rates. And then, in June of this year, the FCC announced that the caps would be delayed until April 2027.
Thursday’s vote, meanwhile, nearly doubles the 2024 cap for some institutions. The new interim rates raise the maximum cost of phone calls with people inside prisons from 6 cents per minute to 11 cents per minute. Rates for large jails, like the Orleans Justice Center, defined as holding 1,000 or more residents, are now capped at 10 cents per minute for phone calls. Rates for medium to very small jails range from 11 to 18 cents per minute. Under the previously agreed upon rules, those rates were capped at between 7 and 12 cents per minute.
The new rates include a two-cent-per-minute added fee that would go to the jails and prisons for “correctional facilities’ expenses.” The temporary regulations continue to prohibit fees known as “site commissions” — a percentage of the per-minute calls that is shared with facility operators, such as sheriff’s offices — and other ancillary fees, associated with setting up an account to make phone calls.
Women need earlier intervention in the criminal justice system, report suggests

The change in rate caps appears to be a response to concerns raised by telecommunications companies that the 6 cents per minute limit did not cover the costs of security measures — like surveillance of calls — associated with providing service in prisons and jails. FCC members said the 2024 rules had resulted in some jails ceasing to provide telecommunications services at all.
In a meeting on Zoom on Monday, prison phone justice advocates representing Worth Rises and the United Church of Christ Media Justice Ministry said that only one small jail, in Baxter Country, Arkansas, had opted to end telecommunications services in retaliation against the lowered rate caps.
Criminal justice reform advocates at Louisiana nonprofit the Promise of Justice Initiative have been campaigning to convince the state Department of Corrections and local sheriffs to reduce the cost of phone calls for detainees and their loved ones to zero. Hardell Ward, director of community impact for the organization, said the FCC is backpedaling and going against what Congress and voters want to benefit telecommunications companies.
Ward noted that Securus, one of the the largest prison and jail telecommunications companies in the United States, is owned by Tom Gores, owner of the Detroit Pistons, through his private equity firm Platinum Equity. Securus provides phone services for Louisiana state prisons and a number of parish jails. (The New Orleans jail uses a different contractor.)
“Louisiana pays for the Detroit Pistons,” Ward said.
A representative for Securus’ parent company Aventiv did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the rate changes from Verite News.
Ward said that lower call rates keep incarcerated people more connected with their loved ones on the outside, which in turn keeps them happier and makes the prisons and jails safer.
“When you deny that connection, you’re putting guards who have to manage that facility in the line of fire. You’re taxing the resources of sheriffs,” Ward said.
Louisiana Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell, a Shreveport Democrat who represents north Louisiana on the commission — which regulates telecommunications companies for the state —  has long criticized rates for phone calls with incarcerated people. In a telephone interview on Tuesday, Campbell said he is against the less restrictive rate limits.
“We have the highest rate of incarceration in the country and the poorest people,” Campbell said. “It all circles around one word – greed. If you gave [the telecommunications companies] 6 cents, they’d want 10 and if you gave ‘em 10, they’d want 15 and then 20.”
The Louisiana Department of Corrections did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Verite News.
Federal Communications Commission member Anna Gomez, a Biden administration appointee and the only commissioner who voted against the rate cap increases, opened her remarks by calling the move to increase rate limits for prison and jail calls “indefensible.” The other two commissioners, Olivia Trusty and Chairman Brendan Carr, were both appointed by President Donald Trump.
“[Adopting the new rules] implements an egregious transfer of wealth from families in incredibly vulnerable situations to greedy monopoly companies,” Gomez said, noting that people with loved ones behind bars are saddled with the difficult choice of paying the high rates or losing their connections. “Families have no option but to pay the higher rates, regardless of whether they have enough to make rent, buy groceries or pay the electric bill.”
Trusty, who joined the commission this year, noted that telecommunications companies that provide phone service in prisons operate at an advantage because their customers can’t sign up with a competing firm. But she said the high costs of safety and security measures, like recording and monitoring phone calls, unique to providing service to carceral facilities, must also be considered.
Before the vote, Carr noted that changes to rate caps of prison and jail communications have resulted in multiple lawsuits. In November Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas and the Louisiana Sheriff’s Association sued the FCC in opposition to the 6 cent rate cap.
Carr laughed at an audible “boo” that came from a member of the audience when he entered the deciding vote to approve the new rate caps.

(Photo courtesy of Great Plains Food Bank)The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, Spirit Lake Nation and Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa have enacted emergency plans as they prepare for interruptions to federal nutrition and fuel programs come November.
“These are things that were thrown on us knowing damn well that we are going into our winter months,” Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Chair Jamie Azure said during a Thursday morning tribal council meeting. “This is a literal life and death situation for a lot of people.”
Tribal governments are tapping into their own resources to help their communities weather the shutdown, which started Oct. 1 after Congress failed to adopt a budget.
The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa on Thursday announced it will deploy over $1 million to help fill in some of the service gaps. That includes $500,000 for food vouchers, $500,000 in fuel assistance, $40,000 to a community soup kitchen, $50,000 for a senior meal program, $100,000 for a school backpack nutrition program and $40,000 for meals at Turtle Mountain College, the tribal council said during the meeting.
Native communities scramble to provide food with SNAP, WIC cutoffs looming

“We probably won’t feel a major impact for a few weeks into November, but it was important that we exhausted every avenue before we got to this point,” Azure said.
He said the tribe doesn’t expect the federal government to reimburse it for any of the expenses after it reopens.
Tribal governments are also encouraging members enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to switch to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Distribution Program, which provides food to low-income households living on reservations. Some Native American households living near reservations can also participate in the program.
The Spirit Lake Nation informed its members they had to close their SNAP account by Tuesday in order to be eligible for the Food Distribution Program for November.

Rep. Collette Brown, a Warwick Democrat and Spirit Lake Nation citizen, said Thursday that the tribe is worried about how to get food and supplies in the hands of members without reliable transportation.  
She said the Food Distribution Program offers healthy options and enrollees typically get more food per month compared to SNAP, but that it is less convenient since it requires people to pick up boxes in person at distribution centers.
Brown said the Spirit Lake Nation may establish a food voucher program for its grocery store, though the tribal government hasn’t decided yet.
“They’re still thinking it over, trying to identify where we can get funds,” she said.
Brown said the tribe will do whatever it can to keep its citizens warm and fed during the winter. They have firefighters splitting wood for fuel, and may also bring in hunters to help process game, she said.
In an Oct. 23 statement, Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Chair Steve Sitting Bear criticized the shutdown and its effect on federal programs as a violation of the federal government’s duty to tribes.
“Congress, your citizens need you to come together,” Sitting Bear said in the statement. “Our tribal nations need you to fulfill your promises and obligations written in treaties and trust agreements. The consequences of your divisive political rhetoric are putting unneeded stress on your countrymen and women.” 
A state of emergency declaration adopted by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe authorized the tribal council to use emergency funds to support social services during the shutdown.
The declaration notes that the tribe has more than 2,300 monthly participants in SNAP, about half of which are children. It has about 200 participants in the Women, Infants and Children Program, and about 900 participants in the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program during the winter.
Leaders of Turtle Mountain, Standing Rock and Spirit Lake, along with the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate and Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation adopted a joint resolution on Oct. 23 calling on the state to support the continuation of services like SNAP and the Women, Infants and Children Program during the shutdown.
“I grew up on these programs, and I know firsthand how critical they are for families working hard to make ends meet,” Rep. Lisa Finley-Deville, a Mandaree Democrat and citizen of the MHA Nation, said in a statement announcing the resolution.
The MHA Nation in a Thursday statement to the North Dakota Monitor said it has not declared a state of emergency, but is coordinating with food distribution organizations to address food insecurity during the shutdown.
North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong on Thursday announced the state is using $1.5 million in general funds from the Department of Health and Human Services to go toward the Great Plains Food Bank and to sustain the Women, Infants and Children Program through the month of November.
“In my talks with the Governor’s staff this morning, each tribe will receive a truckload of food,” Rep. Jayme Davis, a Rolette Democrat and Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa member, said in a Thursday Facebook post. She wrote that Turtle Mountain and Spirit Lake’s deliveries are expected Nov. 5.

(Camera trap photo by Bryan White/USFWS)Craig Sweet, president of Iowa Trappers Association, is set to begin his 53rd season fur trapping this fall, just as soon as he gets the rest of his crops out of the field. 
According to Iowa Department of Natural Resources, furbearer season, which begins Saturday in Iowa, has had an “uptick” in interest due, in part, to workshops led by Iowa Trappers Association. 
Sweet said the more than six-decade-old organization has always held trapper workshops, but has started to hold more beginner-friendly classes in regions across the state.
The result, according to Sweet, has been a diverse crowd -– men, women, “oldsters and youngsters” — interested in learning how to trap. He said most attendees are interested in trapping because they have fur-bearing critters causing problems on their properties. 
“A lot of it is coming from people that are owning property and are wanting to control populations on their property for nest raiders and stuff like that,” Sweet said.

There are 14 furbearer species that Iowans can hunt or trap from Nov. 1 through Feb. 28: raccoon, muskrat, coyote, red fox, gray fox, beaver, mink, opossum, badger, spotted skunk, striped skunk, weasel, river otter and bobcat. Beaver season, according to DNR, extends until April 15. 
Sweet said he traps “everything that’s harvestable” in Iowa. Many of these critters, he said, are also viewed as a nuisance because they can cause damage to crops, gardens or livestock. 
The Iowa Trappers Association also has a series of publicly available videos on YouTube that detail basic trap setups and more advanced sets.
Historically, fur trapping was a profitable industry in Iowa. According to reports from DNR, species like beavers were so desirable at one point that the populations were almost decimated in the state.
 Throughout the decades, various pelts were more desirable than others, depending on fashion trends. Skunk, for example was frequently warn by movie stars in the early 1900s until the 1930s, which led to a spike in skunk fur trade.

In the late decades of the 20th century, anti-fur harvest groups, a drought and weak global fur market led to a “crash” in furbearer harvests in Iowa. 
DNR reported harvest trends have remained low since. While still low, harvest numbers increased to nearly 92,000 in the 2023-2024 season, which was up from around 65,600 the year prior. 
Since 2020, roughly 15,000 Iowans participate in fur harvest season each year. 
Vince Evelsizer, a DNR biologist specializing in furbearers and wetlands, said species populations for the upcoming season are in “good shape.” Evelsizer said most species are trending higher except for gray fox populations.
Muskrat populations have historically been tied to season precipitation amounts, as the slinky rodents live in marshes and wetlands, but DNR’s trends in furbearers report said overall populations have been declining since the late 1980s. 
Evelsizer said water levels in streams, marshes and rivers are better this year than last year, which might mean there are higher muskrat populations. 
“A lot of north Iowa marshes have water in them, which bodes well for species like muskrats, and the weather outlook is favorable heading into the first two weeks of the season,” Evelsizer said in a news release with DNR. “We’re not expecting freeze up for water trappers.” 
Evelsizer said fur prices this year are similar to last year, with a slight uptick in badgers, wild mink and striped skunk pelts.
Sweet said most trappers participate in the sport for fun, or to control animal populations, rather than to make money on the fur. 
“With the current markets, you got to do it because you like it,” Sweet said. “Because in the long run, you’re going to end up losing money.”
Sweet said he tans some of the pelts he harvests to hang on his walls or to give away at Iowa Trappers Association events. 
Furbearer hunting and trapping season begins Saturday, and Evelsizer encouraged prospective trappers to review regulations and to have a “safe trapping season.”

Campbell plant was expected to save Michigan ratepayers $600 million by 2040. (Photo/Sarah Leach)This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.
The Trump administration’s emergency order to keep the huge J.H. Campbell coal plant on Lake Michigan operating past its planned retirement date has cost at least $80 million since May, its operator, Consumers Energy, told regulators and investors this week.
The company said in its third-quarter earnings report Thursday that it would pursue the process laid out in the U.S. Department of Energy’s order for collecting those costs: It will seek payment from ratepayers across the Midwest.
Even though the peak summer electricity demand season has passed, executives at Consumers, Michigan’s largest energy provider, said that they see no sign of let-up in the emergency orders.
“We expect those to continue for the long-term,” said CEO Garrick Rochow in a conference call for investors. “And we’re prepared to continue to operate the plant and comply with those orders.”
He said the costs—$615,385 per day—should be shared beyond the 1.9 million electricity customers of Consumers Energy. The company plans to propose the tab be split among ratepayers (an estimated 42 million to 45 million electricity customers) in the nine states served by the regional electric grid operator, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO).
“The benefits go to MISO,” Rochow said. “Not just to our customers, they go to MISO.”
Rochow said the Trump administration envisioned this approach. “That order from the Department of Energy has laid out a clear path to cost recovery,” he said. Consumers Energy will have to apply to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in order to pass the costs to the ratepayers, and states that oppose such a cost allocation could move to intervene in those proceedings.
U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright issued two consecutive 90-day orders—on May 23 and on Aug. 20—to keep the Campbell plant open under the emergency provisions of the Federal Power Act. In the past, such orders have been used to ensure energy delivery at times of natural disasters. But Wright used the act to execute Trump’s agenda to ramp up energy production, saying Campbell needed to stay open to minimize the risk of power outages and address critical grid security issues in the Midwest.
The Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Campbell cost figures, nor did MISO. When he extended the Campbell order in August, Wright said that he was directing MISO “to take every step to minimize cost to the American people.”
“This order will help ensure millions of Americans can continue to access affordable, reliable, and secure baseload power,” he said in that statement.
But critics say the operation of the 63-year-old plant is generating unnecessary costs as well as pollution. In a September regulatory filing challenging the DOE’s order, a coalition of environmental groups pointed out that even on the day of highest peak demand this summer, MISO had an unused surplus of resources greater than 10 times the power provided by the Campbell plant.
And indeed, according to recent Environmental Protection Agency data, two of the three units at the Campbell plant were not operating at all for about 30 days of the 131 days from the start of the DOE order through Sept. 30. The third unit at the plant only ran for 18 days. Such stoppages could occur for maintenance or simply because the grid operator did not call on the plant to deliver energy to the grid.
“Forcing this unnecessary coal plant to keep operating is bilking consumers for the benefit of the coal industry,” said Michael Lenoff, senior attorney for Earthjustice, which is representing the environmental groups.
Because DOE did not respond to their petition for reconsideration of the Campbell order within 30 days, the environmental groups and the states of Michigan, Minnesota and Illinois have asked the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to review the case. The purpose of the litigation, Lenoff said, is “to stop the administration from harming consumers, trampling markets and unlawfully usurping the authority of states and regulators to make decisions in the public interest.”
Campbell is by far the largest of three fossil fuel electricity plants that are staying open beyond their planned retirements under Trump administration emergency orders. Campbell released 6.6 million metric tons of carbon in 2023, the most recent year for which data is available. Talen Energy’s Wagner plant near Baltimore and Constellation Energy’s Eddystone plant just south of Philadelphia, both run on oil and natural gas. Some detail on their costs for keeping open may emerge next week, when Talen and Constellation report their third-quarter earnings.
Consumers Energy, which is continuing to work toward its previously stated goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, had projected that the retirement of the Campbell plant would save its customers $600 million over the next 20 years, or $30 million per year. Instead, running the plant for the past five months has cost close to three times that annual amount.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/unnamed-1-1024x600.jpg,,,2025-11-01 09:16:48.517280

The field vying for one of the state’s two U.S. Senate seats grew recently with a candidate announcement by Justin McNeal, a Republican from Rapid City. His announcement sets up a potential June 2, 2026, primary race pitting him against incumbent Republican Sen. Mike Rounds.
McNeal said he is a Navy veteran and businessman who most recently founded Dakota BioChar, which aims to convert forest waste into material that can be spread on agricultural fields to improve soil health.

In his announcement, McNeal said the largest threat to the nation is its debt, and he pledged to work against what he described as the “unholy trinity”: special interests lobbying elected officials, who in turn receive campaign contributions from special interests.
“This system will never benefit ‘We the People,’” McNeal said.
At least two other people have announced their intention to seek Rounds’ Senate seat: Julian Beaudion, a businessman, community activist and Democrat from Sioux Falls, and Brian Bengs, a park ranger, Air Force veteran and independent from Hot Springs.
Johnson, Jackley have leads in polls
South Dakota News Watch and the Chiesman Center for Democracy at the University of South Dakota released poll results this week.
Their poll of registered Republican voters found U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson leading the race for the 2026 Republican nomination for governor. He polled at 28%, followed by Gov. Larry Rhoden at 27%, Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden at 15% and state Speaker of the House Jon Hansen, of Dell Rapids, at 10%. Twenty-one percent of respondents were undecided.
The only declared Democratic candidate for governor so far is Robert Arnold, a college student. At least two independents have also publicly said they’ll run for governor: Allison Renville, a Lakota activist and member of the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate, and Terry Gleason, a Chamberlain man.
In the race for the Republican nomination to succeed Johnson in the U.S. House, Attorney General Marty Jackley led the News Watch/Chiesman Center poll with 57% support, followed by Madison state Sen. Casey Crabtree at 5% and Piedmont businessman James Bialota at 2%. Thirty-six percent of respondents were undecided.
Announced U.S. House candidates on the Democratic side are former U.S. Department of Agriculture official Nikki Gronli, of Dell Rapids, and Sioux Falls nonprofit executive Billy Mawhiney. Scott Schlagel, a Democrat from Dell Rapids, has filed a statement of candidacy.
Campaign finance update
Rounds’ campaign begins with a big fundraising head start in the U.S. Senate race, according to campaign finance reports that include data through September.
His campaign committee came into the year with a balance of $1.9 million and raised $1.45 million while spending about $506,000, leaving a balance of $2.8 million. Beaudion launched his campaign this spring, bringing in about $146,000 since April and spending roughly $115,000, ending with about $31,000. Bengs, who also began his fundraising in April, raised about $155,000 and spent about $125,000, leaving a balance of about $30,000.

In the U.S. House race, Jackley raised about $526,000 since July and spent about $23,000, leaving him with about $503,000. Crabtree reported raising about $206,000 since July and spending about $25,000, ending with about $181,000.
On the Democratic side of the House race, Gronli reported raising about $23,000 since August and spending about $2,600, leaving her with about $21,000. Mawhiney reported raising about $17,000 since July and spending about $8,600, ending with about $8,500.
Candidates for state-level offices don’t have to report on their finances until January. Federal reports show that in the governor race, Johnson has about $6 million to bring over to his state-level campaign.
More candidate announcements
Attorney general: Jackley’s candidacy for the U.S. House creates an opening that McPherson County State’s Attorney Austin Hoffman hopes to fill; he recently announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination, joining at least one other Republican who announced previously, Lance Russell, the state’s attorney for Fall River and Oglala Lakota counties.
State treasurer: Jeff Monroe, a former state legislator who served the Pierre area, recently announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination to succeed the current officeholder, Republican Josh Haeder, who is term-limited.
State auditor: Sioux Falls City Councilman David Barranco has announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination to succeed incumbent Republican Rich Sattgast, who is term-limited.
Secretary of state: Incumbent Republican Monae Johnson is seeking reelection and has at least one challenger for the party’s nomination in state Rep. Heather Baxter, of Rapid City, while former state trooper Terrence Davis has declared his Democratic candidacy.
Public Utilities Commission: Former legislator Don Haggar has announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination to succeed Republican Commissioner Gary Hanson, who will not seek reelection.

(Photo by John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)A recent legislative hearing left people involved in the state’s medical marijuana businesses paranoid, and it wasn’t because they had been sampling their own products.
A meeting of the Medical Marijuana Oversight Committee turned into an assault on the program that the state’s voters approved in 2020 and the state implemented in 2022. The roster of speakers was a travel agent’s dream come true with a law enforcement officer from Missouri, an emergency medicine doctor from Colorado, a professor from Oklahoma, an addiction specialist from Colorado and the Sioux Falls school superintendent.
All of them were on hand to warn against the evils of marijuana in general and in particular how those evils can flourish thanks to a medical marijuana program.
Emmett Reistroffer of Genesis Farms Cannabis Company in Sioux Falls said it looked like a concerted effort to restrict or repeal the state’s medical marijuana program. Rep. Josephine Garcia, a Watertown Republican and chairwoman of the committee, didn’t like Reistroffer’s conclusion.
In a South Dakota Searchlight story, Garcia said the meeting’s agenda was set “to follow what was not done when this program was first rolled out. That was my only intention here. If you’re insinuating that me, as the chair, have said something or orchestrated something, I have not done that. It is awareness for the public. This is a public safety issue.”

With Garcia’s Murderers’ Row of anti-marijuana speakers, it sure seems like an orchestrated effort. Or perhaps it’s the first salvo in a battle to overturn the will of the voters.
Those of us who can remember back to the 2020 election recall that the virtues and pitfalls of medical marijuana were pretty well litigated. In the end, voters chose to approve the program with 70% of the vote. Garcia’s excuse that these issues have never before been discussed shows a frightening lack of memory or a penchant for being disingenuous.
Those of us who can remember back as far as 2017 know why Reistroffer and his colleagues in the medical marijuana community are so upset. During the legislative session that year, it only took a few days for lawmakers to dismantle Initiated Measure 22, despite it being approved the previous November by South Dakotans with 52% of the vote.
Sold to voters as an anti-corruption measure, IM 22 was quite likely unconstitutional and its implementation had been halted by a judge. Lawmakers, however, weren’t content to let the case play out in court. Working at an unusually fast pace, it took just over a week for lawmakers to dismantle IM 22, implementing some parts of the measure via legislation while jettisoning others.
Oversight committee testimony sends ‘shock wave’ through SD medical marijuana industry

The ease with which legislative leaders explained away their disregard for the will of the voters has not been lost on the people who organize ballot questions. It was a ballot question that gave South Dakota its medical marijuana program.
In some cases, ballot initiative organizers have turned to state constitutional amendments rather than initiated laws because they know that it will be at least two years before lawmakers can put the issue back on the ballot. In the meantime, the Legislature can’t mess with a constitutional amendment the way they did with IM 22.
Whether Garcia likes it or not, marijuana dispensaries are part of the state’s medical community. It’s hard to imagine surgeons, chiropractors or nurses receiving such shoddy treatment at the hands of a legislative committee.
Anyone with an agenda that includes getting rid of the state’s medical marijuana program may find that there’s not much appetite for such a change. Abolishing the program would mean that all the licensing work done by local governments would be wasted. It would mean the shuttering of small businesses that were created in the wake of the 2020 election. It would mean a lack of relief for the 16,477 people who hold patient cards. It would mean once again overturning the will of the voters.

Amid the cuts to Medicaid and food stamps, exacerbated by the ongoing shutdown, advocates called on the state to take action. They said lawmakers should expand Medicaid, protect food assistance programs, create standardized paid parental leave, support midwives and doulas and invest in child care and early childhood education. 
Mississippi is one of the most dangerous places to give birth, especially for Black women, who are four times more likely than white women to die from pregnancy-related deaths, or deaths that occur during pregnancy or up to one year postpartum and are caused in part by the pregnancy. A combination of poverty, chronic diseases, provider shortages and policies that have shut out tens of thousands of Mississippians from health care contribute to bad outcomes for mothers and babies. 
Now, cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs threaten to walk back progress that has been made over the years, speakers said Thursday at the state Capitol. 
In the past three years, the Mississippi Legislature passed laws to give women an additional 12 months of Medicaid coverage postpartum, timely prenatal care as they wait for their Medicaid applications to process and paid parental leave for state employees. 
Democratic lawmakers and advocates in Mississippi had hoped to build on those policies by passing laws to guarantee all workers paid parental leave, and to expand Medicaid to cover those who currently fall in the coverage gap – making too much to qualify for the state’s strict Medicaid income threshold but too little to qualify for subsidies that make Affordable Care Act  marketplace insurance more affordable. 
Now, they worry that even keeping the current policies from shrinking might be an impossible feat. 
“We are facing dramatic cuts to Medicaid through the Big Ugly Bill and Donald Trump and Congressional Republican members’ efforts to gut this lifesaving health care program that covers so many births in your state and across the country,” said U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood of Illinois, one of the authors of “Momnibus” legislation aimed at addressing the Black maternal health crisis. Underwood attended the Mississippi event by video conference.
“To hear that you all are thinking about growing the workforce, investing in doulas, interested in taking a look at how to support community-based organizations and clinics across the state – these are the kinds of resources that our moms and our families need.”
Partisan disagreements over health care are at the center of the ongoing federal government shutdown. Democrats are fighting to renew Biden-era subsidies that are making health insurance more affordable for millions of Americans. If they are not renewed, premiums on  ACA marketplace insurance plans will more than double next year, KFF estimates. 
And it’s not just about having health insurance, Cassandra Welchlin of the Black Women’s Roundtable argued. Welchlin described a mother she knows who works at a diner making $10 an hour, has no paid leave and relies on others to transport her. She risked her job to attend prenatal visits and returned to work two weeks postpartum. 
“If you aren’t Danielle, you know Danielle,” Welchlin said of the mother. “It’s not just about the health care coverage but a string of policies that we have to co-create together in order to make strong babies and healthy moms.”

The federal budget bill signed into law by President Donald Trump over the summer includes the largest cuts to Medicaid and SNAP in history. The cuts to Medicaid are expected to trigger the downsizing of many rural hospitals – and labor and delivery units are often the first to go when hospital budgets shrink. 

Women in rural areas already have few options for giving birth. Half of Mississippi’s counties are maternity care deserts, and the state Health Department recently declared a public health emergency for the state’s infant mortality rate – the highest in the nation. 
Nobody knows that more than Shenelle Ball-Burks, whose pregnant daughter and unborn grandchild died in 2021 on the side of the road as her husband was driving her 28 minutes from their home to the closest hospital. 
“I come before you from Belzoni in Humphreys County, a place where our hearts are full but our health care is empty, a place where the difference between life and death can be measured not in miles but in minutes,” Ball-Burks said at the hearing. “I didn’t know what to say when I was asked to speak here today because how do you find words when your heart has been shattered? How do you strive after watching your child’s life fade because help was too far away?”
Ball-Burks said she worries for all the moms and babies who will continue to suffer as help becomes farther away through federal and state policy changes. 
“I don’t want another mother to hold her child’s obituary instead of her hand,” Ball-Burks said. “I don’t want another husband to kneel beside a little girl crying for help that never comes. I don’t want another child to walk across a graduation stage in search of a face that isn’t there.”
Research shows that when eligibility for social safety net programs is made stricter, women tend to lose the most. That’s partly because women more often participate in the programs – due to the wage gap and life events such as childbirth – but also because they are more often caregivers to those who use the programs.
“This is not just a statistic, not just someone else’s problem,” said Rep. Timaka James-Jones, a Democrat from Belzoni and the sister-in-law of Ball-Burks. “It’s a sacred responsibility. Because when we save our mothers, we don’t just save one life. We save families. We save our children’s futures. We save the heartbeat of our communities.”

Many of the legislators and health care providers who spoke about their experience living through or witnessing the statistics that put Mississippi at the bottom of nearly every list when it comes to the health of moms and babies. 
“Mississippi remains one of the hardest places in America to be pregnant and give birth, especially if you’re Black,” said Rep. Zakiya Summers, a Democrat from Jackson. “I speak to you not only as a legislator but as a Black mother who has carried life while carrying fear. Our survival should not be revolutionary. It should be standard.”
Women in rural communities don’t just suffer from a dearth of hospitals or obstetricians. They suffer from a dearth of reliable and affordable support in all forms, said Dr. Michelle Owens, maternal fetal medicine specialist in Jackson and the chair of the Mississippi Maternal Mortality Review Committee.

These include contests for city, county, school, fire district and court of appeals positions, along with one statewide ballot measure. In the state’s biggest city and county, that means deciding on the next Seattle mayor and King County executive.
There are also several competitive legislative elections that could signal how voters feel about decisions to raise taxes and pass contentious social policies this past legislative session. The outcomes in those races could skew, but not upend, the balance of power in Olympia going into 2026. 
To count, ballots must be returned to a drop box or voting center by 8 p.m. Tuesday. 
Voters can also drop their ballots in the mail, but they must be postmarked by Tuesday. 
Election officials had advised those looking to mail in their ballots to do so a week before Election Day, as the U.S. Postal Service may not postmark returned ballots on the day they’re first collected. 
With the election just days away, officials recommend using drop boxes, going to a voting center or visiting a Post Office location to turn in your ballot if you haven’t already.

The secretary of state maintains a map of Washington’s 554 ballot drop boxes. It’s also available in list form.
As of Thursday, about 14% of Washington’s registered voters had returned their ballots. Garfield, Columbia and Jefferson counties were leading the pack in terms of the share of voters who’d cast ballots, while Franklin, Grays Harbor and Clark counties were bringing up the rear.
This year’s turnout is so far lagging 2021, when about 40% of voters returned ballots.
Voters can register or update their information in person at an elections office before 8 p.m. Tuesday. Oct. 27 was the last day for online and mailed registrations. 
To track your ballot, visit voteWA.gov. 
What’s on the ballot?
Only one measure will appear on every ballot of the more than 5 million registered voters in Washington. 
Senate Joint Resolution 8201 is a question of whether to invest tax dollars collected for the state’s new long-term care program, known as WA Cares, in the stock market. This would be similar to how the state handles pension and retirement funds.
Currently, the collections for WA Cares are invested in more vanilla investments, like government bonds and certificates of deposit. 
Advocates of the constitutional amendment argue the stock market would lead to larger returns and keep premiums low. Opponents say it amounts to “gambling in the stock market” with taxpayer dollars.
A similar measure failed in 2020.
A slew of vacated seats in the state Legislature are also up for grabs. The most notable is in the 26th Legislative District, covering parts of Pierce and Kitsap Counties, where Democratic Sen. Deb Krishnadasan is looking to retain the seat against Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier.
This race in a purple district gives Republicans a rare chance to narrow the Democratic majority in the state Senate. 
Conservatives are also hoping for good news out of the 5th Legislative District in east King County. Former lawmaker Chad Magendanz is looking to unseat Democratic Sen. Victoria Hunt, who was appointed after the unexpected death of Sen. Bill Ramos earlier this year. Hunt won the primary comfortably. She was serving in the House before moving to the Senate.
A couple of Democrat-on-Democrat battles could also serve as a barometer of how voters feel about the more progressive turn the Legislature has taken in recent years.
State Rep. Amy Walen hopes to be a more moderate voice among Senate Democrats in her campaign against Sen. Vandana Slatter in the 48th Legislative District, representing parts of Redmond, Bellevue and Kirkland. Slatter led Walen handily in the August primary.

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
And in the 33rd Legislative District, Burien Mayor Kevin Schilling is more of a centrist Democrat, while Rep. Edwin Obras this year followed the Democratic party line in voting for tax increases, a cap on residential rent increases and other controversial policies backed by progressives. 
Those four races are the ones to watch, but five other appointed Democratic lawmakers appear on Tuesday’s ballot. 
Democratic Eastside Reps. Janice Zahn and Osman Salahuddin are expected to sail to victory over Republican opponents. And state Sens. Tina Orwall, D-Des Moines, and Emily Alvarado, D-Seattle, as well as Rep. Brianna Thomas, are running opposed.
Snohomish County judges Tam Bui and Karen Moore are also vying for a seat on the state’s Division 1 Court of Appeals.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thurston-county-ballot-processing-1-1024x716.jpg,,,2025-11-01 07:17:06.902174

Oct. 30. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. UM Health-Sparrow and East Lansing Public Schools have opened a youth health clinic, open to all patients ages five to 21, based at East Lansing High School. 
This is the second youth health clinic in the region, following another in Grand Ledge that opened in April 2024. The clinic will have three staff members, according to Patrick Sustrich, a director of operations at UM Health-Sparrow — an advanced practice provider, a medical assistant, and a social worker. 
There is no requirement to be a student at East Lansing Public Schools to visit the clinic — anyone in the region within the age range is welcomed, and the clinic will be open year-round. A side entrance to the building, separate from the entrance to the school, makes that feasible. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“This on-site health center removes many of the barriers that families have faced,” said Dori Leyko, superintendent of East Lansing Public Schools. “No longer will students need to miss a day of school, or parents will need to take significant time off of work just to get a physical or see a clinician for minor illness.”

“With the clinic right here in our school community, care is more accessible, efficient and family friendly,” Leyko continued. “It removes transportation challenges, reduces missed class time and helps ensure students are healthy, ready and able to learn.”
“The biggest impact I think we can have is with mental health,” said Dr. Gregory Holzhei, a family physician at UM Health-Sparrow based in St. John’s. “Many of our students are suffering with mental health issues.”
Sustrich, said that in the first location, two-thirds of all visits to the clinic were related to mental and behavioral health concerns. 
He also mentioned specific programmatic services targeted towards students, including education around safe backpack weights — which he noted should not exceed 10% of a student’s weight. Another specific training, which the Grand Ledge clinic has done to help lower stress levels among new middle school students, teaches how to use combination locks. 
Leyko called the opening of the center the start of a “new chapter of care, connection and opportunity.”
Sustrich also noted that this clinic had room to grow, including adding more staff like a dietician or an exercise physiologist.
“You can see how this could just grow and morph into something much greater,” he said. “We’re still in our infancy and we’re not there yet, but the sky’s the limit.”

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Cue the crickets. 
That’s the sound you hear from Montana’s congressional delegation — Steve Daines, Tim Sheehy, Ryan Zinke, and Troy Downing — every time Donald Trump opens his mouth and lies about tariffs. You’d think one of them might clear their throat, tug on their cowboy boots, and say, “Excuse me, sir, but that’s not how tariffs work.” 
Instead, we get synchronized silence worthy of a barbershop quartet audition for “Spineless: The Musical.”
Here’s the truth Trump doesn’t want you to know (and apparently our delegation doesn’t have the nerve to explain): Tariffs aren’t paid by foreign countries. They’re taxes — on us. American consumers. Montana families. Small businesses. Farmers. You, me, and the guy trying to buy a new tractor part that now costs more than a used pickup.
Trump’s trade war has been a disaster for Montana agriculture. China stopped buying our soybeans, opting for Brazil’s instead. Prices are up, markets are down, and Montana farmers are left holding the bag — or, more accurately, the unsold bushel. And now Trump wants to fix his mess by importing more beef from Argentina. So, while our ranchers are struggling, he’s literally saying, “Let’s buy from Argentina instead.”
That’s not America First — that’s America Fumbled.
And what do we hear from Sens. Steve “Silent as a Stone” Daines, Tim “Trump’s Echo” Sheehy, and Representatives Ryan “Photo Op” Zinke and Troy “Copy-Paste Talking Points” Downing? Not a whisper. Not a peep. Just the faint hum of ambition and fear — fear of offending the Mar-a-Lago Monarch who pretends tariffs are like magic money falling from the sky.
If these four men were truly honoring their oaths of office, they’d be correcting the record, not cowering behind it. They’d tell their constituents that Trump’s tariffs are one of the largest tax increases on American consumers in history — following, of course, his massive tax cuts for the wealthy. The billionaires got their bonuses. The rest of us got higher prices, a lecture about patriotism, and a larger national deficit.  It’s obscene. 
Thanks, Trump. Your lies have economic consequences. And thanks to Montana’s delegation, they’re having political ones, too — or at least they should.
Montanans value honesty, integrity and straight talk. We can smell nonsense from miles away — usually right around campaign season. But when our so-called representatives choose silence over truth, that’s not loyalty; that’s cowardice in a cowboy hat.
Maybe Daines, Sheehy, Zinke, and Downing think silence is golden. In this case, it’s more like gilded cowardice — a shiny coating over an empty core. Their refusal to speak truth to Trump’s lies isn’t just embarrassing; it’s dangerous. Because every time they nod along, the lie grows stronger, the damage deeper, and the con thicker.
Montana deserves leaders who’ll call a lie a lie, even when it’s politically inconvenient. Leaders who understand that tariffs aren’t patriotic — they’re punishing. And that silence, no matter how polite or strategic, is still complicity.
So, here’s my humble suggestion: Next time Trump starts bragging about his “beautiful tariffs,” maybe our delegation could find the courage to whisper back, “Sir, those are taxes — on us.”
Until then, Montana’s Trump Choir can keep humming their favorite tune: “The Sound of Silence (and Surrender).”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/senaterepublicans-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-01 06:56:31.651930

One guiding principle, passed along by her film editor son Jeremy came in handy while penning, participating or appearing in 5,832 career legal opinions: Don’t bore, don’t confuse.

Miller-Lerman bored few last year with an opinion in which she drew upon Patty and Selma of “The Simpsons” cartoon fame to make a serious point about separation of powers among government branches.
And there was no confusing her messages in dissents on rulings, including one that left the state immune from a lawsuit brought by three siblings for years of physical and sexual abuse while in foster care. 
Now, at age 78 — after serving six years as an inaugural judge on the Nebraska Court of Appeals and 27 years on the Nebraska Supreme Court — Miller-Lerman on Friday hung up her robe. 
The mother and grandmother of two said she approached her work with judicial “restraint,” careful to avoid politics and to not be too “frisky.” She enjoyed staying in touch with pop culture to connect with the masses and, when appropriate, drop a colorful reference into writings and conversations.
She believes she contributed to the “useful” role of a judge and takes pride in furthering the discussion of gender equality.
“When you look at the body of work, forget all the administrative stuff that eats up an enormous amount of time, I think you could say, intellectually, I was disciplined and didn’t have poor humor,” Miller-Lerman said in a sit-down interview with the Nebraska Examiner.

Her retirement follows what colleagues describe as a trailblazing run launched when a young West Coast swimming champion opted for a legal career and rose to partner status at a major Omaha law firm while working part-time raising two children. Then-Gov. Ben Nelson, the last Democrat to lead the state, named her in 1991 to the newly established appeals court, where she was the first woman to serve on a Nebraska court higher than the district court.
In 1998, he appointed her to the state’s highest court.
Nelson lauded the Miller-Lerman appointments as among his best, saying she was not “anxious to make law” but rather “has been steadfast with her resolve to find justice and to apply the law.”
Miller Lerman’s parting words at a courtroom retirement ceremony: “I took an oath, and I think I kept my promise.”
***
While packing up personal items from her chambers, located alongside other Supreme Court justice offices in a private section of the Nebraska Capitol, Miller-Lerman ran across career-spanning mementos.

There was a handwritten letter and drawing from a young visitor recounting her 1998 swearing-in ceremony. Of Miller-Lerman, little Hannah Hysack wrote: “She’s the first girl in Nebraska to be a Supreme Court judge.” Now an adult, Hysack showed up at the retirement open house, too.
The justice also kept a photo of a neighborhood youngster who, on one Halloween, donned a robe and carried a book, gavel and sign: “I’m Lindsey. I make the rules.”
Miller-Lerman said she’s never shied away from discussing gender inequities in the legal field and is pleased to have been in a position to be a role model for budding women attorneys — though she recognizes there’s a long way to go.
She referred to the recent history of the state Supreme Court, noting that of the last eight appointments since hers, one yielded a woman, sitting Justice Stephanie Stacy. 
“You be the judge,” quipped Miller-Lerman.
She pointed to a bathroom available for the Supreme Court in the Capitol that to this day she said has a wall lined with urinals and one stall. “Because justices are boys don’t you know?” she said with a sarcastic smile.

Miller-Lerman, while she requested no remodel, said she made clear from the start that she’d be using the facilities regardless. 
Carol Knoepfler, a professor at Creighton University School of Law, was Miller-Lerman’s former law clerk for eight years and shared anecdotes of how her former boss firmly yet courteously set the record straight on a woman’s place in high places. 
She recalled driving with Miller-Lerman to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln for an oral arguments session when a security officer approached their car to say they could not park in the area, as it was reserved for the Nebraska Supreme Court.
Said Knoepfler: “I can still hear the judge reply in a very polite, but very precise manner, ‘How fortunate — because I am on the Nebraska Supreme Court.’”
At the same time during her career, Miller-Lerman said she tried to “eliminate the impediment that gender may have” so that “we move on to substance.”
She cited an interview with Nelson for the first judgeship, when she wore a Navy blue suit with yellow pin stripes and a yellow silk blouse, seeking to strike a balance: “business-like, traditional, but feminine.”
It’s similar to her style today, she said. “I haven’t bought into being like ‘the guys.’ That is my brand, I think.”
Colleagues talked of a competitive spirit, noting that as a teen she represented the U.S. in the 1961 Maccabiah games, winning three medals, two gold and a silver. She beat a teammate for one of the golds, who, according to Swimming World, went on to win a silver medal at the 1964 Olympics in that same event, and later set a world record. 
Miller-Lerman, after graduating from a California high school in 1963, went to Boston area Wellesley College and was on her legal track.
She said she felt fortunate to have role models such as Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was her professor at Columbia Law School and, later, the second woman on the U.S. Supreme Court. Miller-Lerman clerked for Constance Baker Motley, a civil rights legend and the first Black woman to be named a federal judge.

Former U.S. Rep. John J. Cavanaugh, D-Neb., who also spoke at the retirement event, recalled meeting Miller-Lerman in 1980 when he joined Omaha-based Kutak Rock law firm after his time on Capitol Hill. He saw her as a rising star litigator and said it was unheard of at the time for a part-time practicing lawyer raising children to become a partner in a major law firm.
He reflected on current “vigorous efforts to remove diversity, equity and inclusion” and celebrated that his colleague’s influence and opinions “will forever remain a part of Nebraska law and justice.”
“A small Sturgis bike riding Jewish girl from Los Angeles with an Ivy League education and a heart of gold and a head of steel principles … a permanent fixture in our history,” Cavanaugh said of Miller-Lerman.

Fans described her legal clarity and human charity.  
Former Supreme Court Chief Justice Mike Heavican, who served 18 years with Miller-Lerman until his retirement last year, noted her role in cases of “first impression,” those that present a novel issue not tackled before by that court.
He said she drafted the opinion that capital punishment judicial panels must be unanimous to impose a death penalty and another that decided same-sex partners had standing to seek custody and visitation of a child they co-parented.

Standing out also are Miller-Lerman’s “laser-focused” questions posed to attorneys during oral arguments, Heavican, an appointee of Republican Gov. Dave Heineman, said at the retirement event. He recalled her remark to those lawyers who tried to dodge: “That is the answer to a different question.”
Cavanaugh lauded Miller-Lerman’s dissenting voice in a series of sovereign immunity cases that he said continue to “haunt our state,” with the latest not allowing children abused while in state custody to seek public compensation or redress. 
He said courts and lawmakers have her written dissents to draw upon in future efforts to change law.
Perhaps her best-known opinion, said Miller-Lerman, is the 2007 State v. Winslow ruling, which allowed DNA testing for two of the “Beatrice Six” convicted in 1989 of a 1985 murder. The results showed neither had committed the crime. All six eventually were exonerated. 
They spent a combined 75 years in prison and won a $28 million wrongful conviction judgement.
A response she hadn’t expected, she said, came after referencing Patty and Selma of  The Simpsons in a concurrence when state officials tried to circumvent a state law that restored voting rights to felons who had completed their criminal sentences. The twin sisters of Marge Simpson she mentioned are cynical career employees at the Springfield DMV. 











Patty and Selma at the Department of Motor Vehicles may not be constitutional scholars, but they know they are expected to follow the law.


– Nebraska Supreme Court Justice Lindsey Miller-Lerman



Miller-Lerman opined: “Patty and Selma at the Department of Motor Vehicles may not be constitutional scholars, but they know they are expected to follow the law.”
She went on, “Do we want to live in a world where every state employee who has a hunch a statute is flawed gets to ignore it?”
The Simpsons bit was picked up by national publications and podcasts, but truth be told, Miller-Lerman expected a different part of the opinion to gain more traction. It read: “If the statutes were declared unconstitutional as urged by some members of the court, the elected officials would choose their voters instead of the other way around.”
“Who knew?” she asked.

Nebraska voters have retained Miller-Lerman in four judicial elections, and she was up for retention next year. But she was ready for less “court noise” and demand from the job she said she took very seriously.
Having survived breast cancer in her 30s, she said, she has sought to “maximize my contributions.”

“I feel I’ve made a contribution,” Miller-Lerman said. “I’m not sure more years is necessarily going to enhance that.”
Chief Justice Jeffrey Funke, appointed by Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts, described her as a one-of-a-kind who enriched the Court. “Her legacy lives on, in all of our opinions.”
Upon her exit, Miller-Lerman said she had confidence that Nebraska’s Supreme Court won’t take the “easy wrong” and instead will “show the strength to demonstrate impartiality and justice.”
“In this time of instability, much depends on the strength and the authority of the courts,” said Miller-Lerman.
She plans to remain in Omaha, where her then-husband’s job first took the young family in 1975. Retirement allows more time with her grown children, Jeremy and Hannah, who live in other states. Still active and a gym-goer, Miller-Lerman is considering another level of service, including availability as a retired judge. 
“I’ll be useful,” she said.

(Photo: Karen Pulfer-Focht/Tennessee Lookout) There is a dangerous willingness among too many political, civil, and community leaders — and, anecdotally, far too many everyday citizens — to sacrifice civil and human rights on the altar of authoritarianism. It’s as if the mere mention of “crime” is enough to justify rolling back the very constitutional protections that are supposed to keep us safe.
This is exactly what has happened with the rollout of the so-called Memphis Safe Task Force initiative. From the beginning, its justification has leaned more on anecdotes than on actual data, relying on propaganda released by law enforcement agencies designed to reassert law-and-order politics every time a semblance of progressive criminal justice reform begins to take root. And disturbingly, it’s working.
The receipts are already here
We don’t have to speculate about what over-policing looks like in Memphis. We have the receipts. The 2024 United States Department of Justice pattern and practice investigation of the Memphis Police Department laid it out in black and white: MPD has engaged in unconstitutional policing tactics, including racial profiling and broken-windows policing, that disproportionately target Black communities. The DOJ made clear that these practices not only violate civil rights but also fail to reduce violent crime in any meaningful or sustained way.
In short, the report confirmed what many Memphians — especially Black Memphians — have long experienced: a system more invested in control than in safety. And now, instead of breaking with that harmful legacy, the Memphis Safe Task Force has doubled down on it by expanding the very practices the DOJ condemned.
Policing the public, not protecting it
This “task force” strategy has dramatically increased encounters between everyday citizens and law enforcement, primarily through racialized traffic stops. Citations are up. Arrests are up. But the violent crime numbers have not fallen at a rate commensurate with the manpower and resources the task force has touted. Available data shows that on one day alone, 51 individuals were arrested—and 37 of them were not charged with violent offenses, including seven for the civil offense of “unlawful presence.” These figures reveal a clearly misaligned strategy: diverting massive law-enforcement resources toward traffic stops and civil detentions while pursuing the claim of reducing violent crime.
Traffic citations outnumber federal task force’s arrests in Memphis; sparse data leaves impact murky

Even worse, transparency remains elusive. Many local outlets report that full arrest data is not publicly available. Meanwhile, multiple law enforcement agencies are routinely swarming the same traffic stops, improvising on the spot about which agency will take credit depending on what they “might” find. That’s not coordination. That’s chaos — and it borders on systemic Fourth Amendment violations through unreasonable searches and seizures.
A constitutional crisis, not a crime strategy
Let’s be honest: this isn’t just about crime. It’s about appeasing a convicted felon in the White House who has made a habit of bending, breaking and badgering the law to satisfy his own power-hungry, fascist impulses. What we’re witnessing is a local extension of a national project that normalizes state overreach and weaponizes fear.
Leaders like Memphis Mayor Paul Young have chosen compliance over courage, openly confirming that MPD is now working directly with ICE. This partnership has terrorized immigrant communities and further eroded public trust. It is not public safety. It is state-sanctioned overreach that tramples both the First Amendment’s protections for assembly and dissent and the Fourth Amendment’s protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.
Since this collaboration began, reports of federal enforcement activity have surged from a handful a day to hundreds each week, and nearly one in five arrests are now immigration-related, often involving nothing more than “unlawful presence.” This is not a targeted violent-crime strategy. It is the widening of a dragnet that places already marginalized communities in greater danger.
The cost of capitulation
When political leaders applaud superficial arrest numbers without interrogating what those numbers represent, they are applauding violations of civil and human rights. They are endorsing a two-tiered system where constitutional protections seem to apply fully only to white Americans. This is punitive populism in action: the exploitation of fear and punishment as a political performance, not a public safety strategy. This is not hypothetical; this is happening now.
As Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee recently stated, “we’ll figure things out along the way.” But “figuring things out” on the backs of Black and brown people is not governance. It’s experimentation with human lives. It’s dangerous. It’s unconstitutional. And it’s morally indefensible.
What real safety requires
Real safety is not built on surveillance, over-policing, or authoritarian force. It’s built on trust, transparency, and community investment. It’s built when the rights enshrined in the First and Fourth Amendments are protected instead of treated as collateral damage in a political spectacle of copaganda.
We should not, and cannot, accept an initiative that trades away constitutional rights for the illusion of security. If we care about safety, we must care just as fiercely about justice. Because the moment we normalize authoritarianism in the name of “safety,” none of us are safe at all.

The institution is unwilling to assert itself as an equal branch of government. (4X6, iStock/Getty Images Plus)Many Americans will be voting on Election Day — or have already cast votes — in races for statewide office, local positions and on ballot initiatives with major implications for democracy.
Congress is not on the ballot this November, but it will be in the 2026 midterms. A year from now, Americans in every state and district will get to vote for whom they want representing their interests in Washington.
But right now, Congress isn’t giving the American people much to go on.
As the shutdown of the federal government passes the one-month mark, the U.S. House of Representatives has been in recess for over 40 days. That’s the longest it’s ever stayed out of town outside of its typical summer recesses or the weeks leading up to their own elections.
Notably, the shutdown does not mean that Congress can’t meet. In fact, it must meet to end the shutdown legislatively. The Senate, for example, has taken votes recently on judicial nominations, a major defense authorization bill and a resolution on tariff policy.
Senators have also continued to hold bipartisan behind-the-scenes negotiations to end the shutdown impasse.
But with dwindling SNAP benefits, skyrocketing health care premiums and other major shutdown impacts beginning to set in, the House has all but abdicated its position as “The People’s Chamber.”
 
Long ‘path to irrelevance’
In addition to not meeting for any votes, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson has refused to swear in Democratic U.S. Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva of Arizona. Despite Johnson’s assurances, the shutdown does not prevent the House from meeting in a brief session to swear in Grijalva as a member for Arizona’s 7th District, which has been without representation since March.
Along with Casey Burgat and SoRelle Wyckoff Gaynor, I am co-author of a textbook, “Congress Explained: Representation and Lawmaking in the First Branch.” In that book, it was important to us to highlight Congress’ clear role as the preeminent lawmaking body in the federal government.
But throughout the shutdown battle, Congress — particularly the House of Representatives — has been unwilling to assert itself as an equal branch of government. Beyond policymaking, Congress has been content to hand over many of its core constitutional powers to the executive branch. As a Congress expert who loves the institution and profoundly respects its constitutionally mandated role, I have found this renunciation of responsibility difficult to watch.
And yet, Congress’ path to irrelevance as a body of government did not begin during the shutdown, or even in January 2025.
It is the result of decades of erosion that created a political culture in which Congress, the first branch of government listed in the Constitution, is relegated to second-class status.
 
The Constitution puts Congress first
The 18th-century framers of the Constitution viewed Congress as the foundation of republican governance, deliberately placing it first in Article 1 to underscore its primacy. Congress was assigned the pivotal tasks of lawmaking and budgeting because controlling government finances was seen as essential to limiting executive power and preventing abuses that the framers associated with monarchy.
Alternatively, a weak legislature and an imperial executive were precisely what many of the founders feared. With legislative authority in the hands of Congress, power would at least be decentralized among a wide variety of elected leaders from different parts of the country, each of whom would jealously guard their own local interests.
But Trump’s first 100 days turned the founders’ original vision on its head, leaving the “first branch” to play second fiddle.
Like most recent presidents, Trump came in with his party in control of the presidency, the House and the Senate. Yet despite the lawmaking power that this governing trifecta can bring, the Republican majorities in Congress have mostly been irrelevant to Trump’s agenda.
Instead, Congress has relied on Trump and the executive branch to make changes to federal policy and in many cases to reshape the federal government completely.
Trump has signed more than 210 executive orders, a pace faster than any president since Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Republican Congress has shown little interest in pushing back on any of them. Trump has also aggressively reorganized, defunded or simply deleted entire agencies, such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
These actions have been carried out even though Congress has a clear constitutional authority over the executive branch’s budget. And during the shutdown, Congress has shown little to no interest in reasserting its “power of the purse,” content instead to let the president decide which individuals and agencies receive funding, regardless of what Congress has prescribed.
 
Many causes, no easy solutions
There’s no one culprit but instead a collection of factors that have provided the ineffectual Congress of today.
One overriding factor is a process that has unfolded over the past 50 or more years called political nationalization. American politics have become increasingly centered on national issues, parties and figures rather than more local concerns or individuals.
This shift has elevated the importance of the president as the symbolic and practical leader of a national party agenda. Simultaneously, it weakens the role of individual members of Congress, who are now more likely to toe the party line than represent local interests.
As a result, voters focus more on presidential elections and less on congressional ones, granting the president greater influence and diminishing Congress’ independent authority.
The more Congress polarizes among its members on a party-line basis, the less the public is likely to trust the legitimacy of its opposition to a president. Instead, congressional pushback − sometimes as extreme as impeachment − can thus be written off not as principled or substantive but as partisan or politically motivated to a greater extent than ever before.
Congress has also been complicit in giving away its own power. Especially when dealing with a polarized Congress, presidents increasingly steer the ship in budget negotiations, which can lead to more local priorities — the ones Congress is supposed to represent — being ignored.
But rather than Congress staking out positions for itself, as it often did through the turn of the 21st century, political science research has shown that presidential positions on domestic policy increasingly dictate — and polarize — Congress’ own positions on policy that hasn’t traditionally been divisive, such as funding support for NASA. Congress’ positions on procedural issues, such as raising the debt ceiling or eliminating the filibuster, also increasingly depend not on bedrock principles but on who occupies the White House.
In the realm of foreign policy, Congress has all but abandoned its constitutional power to declare war, settling instead for “authorizations” of military force that the president wants to assert. These give the commander in chief wide latitude over war powers, and both Democratic and Republican presidents have been happy to retain that power. They have used these congressional approvals to engage in extended conflicts such as the Gulf War in the early 1990s and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan a decade later.
 
What’s lost with a weak Congress
Americans lose a lot when Congress hands over such drastic power to the executive branch.
When individual members of Congress from across the country take a back seat, their districts’ distinctly local problems are less likely to be addressed with the power and resources that Congress can bring to an issue. Important local perspectives on national issues fail to be represented in Congress.
Even members of the same political party represent districts with vastly different economies, demographics and geography. Members are supposed to keep this in mind when legislating on these issues, but presidential control over the process makes that difficult or even impossible.
Maybe more importantly, a weak Congress paired with what historian Arthur Schlesinger called the “Imperial Presidency” is a recipe for an unaccountable president, running wild without the constitutionally provided oversight and checks on power that the founders provided to the people through their representation by the first branch of government.

Those who miss that deadline have until Jan. 15 to sign up for coverage that starts in February. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)As Marylanders start to navigate the open enrollment period for health insurance, state officials are pointing out that higher costs aren’t the only changes that could trip people up.
“We encourage everybody to come back in and look at their plan, make sure the plan makes sense for your needs, for your family’s need,” Michele Eberle, executive director of the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange, said in a webinar Friday on the changes on open enrollment this year.
The Marketplace Integrity Rule out of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the federal budget reconciliation bill, often referred to as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” is bringing massive changes to health care.
But Eberle said that the expected expiration of popular federal tax credits for health care plans at the end of the year creates the “triple whammy” of factors that will jack up costs for some 300,000 Marylanders, which could lead to tough choices for some, including going without insurance.
While those federal policies bring in changes for the 2026 insurance year, not all will take effect right away. Here’s a run-down of what Marylanders can expect this open enrollment period, which runs from Nov. 1 through Dec. 31, and in the future.
Costs going up
Maryland Health Secretary Meena Seshamani said that raised premiums will “continue to be a problem if Congress does not take decisive action to extend tax credits.”
The enhanced federal tax credit was created in 2021 to help more people afford health insurance during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and are set to expire at the end of the year. Democrats, including Maryland’s congressional delegation have refused to vote a stopgap spending bill until Republicans agree to address the tax credits.
Health advocates, state officials brace for ‘sticker shock’ if ACA tax credits expire

“I’m a former head of the Medicare program,” Seshamani said. “I’m a physician. I’m also a mom. I’m a daughter — I know affordable and accessible health care is critical for us to protect.”
“We are in some very uncertain times,” said. “There’s a lot of headwinds to navigate, particularly with changes at the federal level, and we all see and appreciate the distress that this can cause for people in the health care system.”
Health care advocates say the credits brought more people into the insurance pool and helped keep premiums down.
For this year’s rate increase, insurance carriers asked for an average increase of 17.1%, accounting for the anticipated loss in enrollment if the tax credits expire. The Maryland Insurance Agency ultimately approved a 13.4% average rate increase, which applies to everyone on the health benefit exchange.
Some of the lower-income marketplace purchasers may be spared from the greatest premium hike this year. The General Assembly approved funding this past session that would partially replace the soon-to-expire federal tax credits for the upcoming year.
For the 2026 enrollment year, those state subsidies will be able to replace the extended tax credit for those under 200% of the federal poverty level. For those between 201% and up to 400%, the state subsidy will replace 50% of the value of the tax credits.
But the state’s fraught fiscal outlook means those state subsidies could be temporary, state officials say. Meanwhile, plenty of enrollees will see costs skyrocket.
“It’s a little bit better than losing that tax credit completely,” Eberle said. “For those who are over 400% of the federal poverty level, we are not able to do anything, so that will be a significant impact.”
DACA barred from marketplace
Some Marylanders will have a harder time accessing health care because of their immigration status.
The Marketplace Integrity Rule revoked a Biden-era decision that classified immigrants covered by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, as “lawfully present” individuals. Being lawfully present allowed DACA recipients, sometimes referred to as “dreamers,” access to the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange to shop for plans.
The last open enrollment period was the first time DACA recipients could use Maryland’s insurance marketplace. Without the classification, DACA recipients are again barred from the health insurance marketplace. That change took affect in August, affecting about 300 DACA recipients.
DACA recipients get access to state health care marketplace for the first time

Eberle also said that around 18,000 lawfully present immigrants with incomes lower than 100% of the federal poverty level will no longer be able to use tax credits that kept their health care costs down. They can still use the exchange to shop plans, but it will be more expensive.
She said that options are limited for DACA recipients and people who are not in the country legally because of the federal changes. She notes that the 2025 plans that people currently hold are still valid, and urges those who may lose coverage next year to take care of health needs now.
“We’re trying to encourage everyone to use their coverage,” she said. “If you need medical care now, go get it. Utilize your health benefits this year, and don’t put off things that you might have been putting off for next year.
What’s sticking around?
While much of the conversation around open enrollment involves increasing prices, Eberle noted that the state’s subsidy targeted for young adults is still in play, meaning that people aged 18-37 may still qualify for financial help that brings their monthly premiums down, which creates a healthier insurance pool.
In addition, some federal changes won’t take effect this year, meaning that Marylanders and state officials have some time to prepare for new hurdles in access to health care.
For example, Marylanders who don’t commit to a health care plan by the end of this year will still have a few weeks in January to determine what insurance best works for them.
That’s because this is the last year of an extended open enrollment window before federal policy shortens it.
Starting in the 2026 open enrollment year, people will have from Nov. 1 through Dec. 31 to commit to a new plan.
“That’s a big change,” Eberle said in an interview. “That’s not insurmountable. It’s just another barrier to coverage.”
Eberle says that with end-of-year travels and the holidays, many people struggle to deal with also shopping for insurance plans, so the extended enrollment window helps Marylanders enroll when things are a little more calm.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Fortunately, Marylanders still have that extra time this year. Those who want coverage starting on Jan. 1 will need to commit to a plan by Dec. 31. Those who need a few extra days have until Jan 15, and their plans would begin Feb. 1.
She also said that another change coming down the line is the end of auto enrollment in coverage. Right now, if someone has a plan from the ACA marketplace and does not do anything with it, they are auto-renewed in the same plan if available.
In 2028, a new federal policy means that people will have to manually indicate that they want to continue coverage each year.
Eberle said that without auto enrollment, “if people are not aware of that and they let their coverage lapse, then they may not be eligible until the next year to get health coverage.”
While Maryland still has auto enrollment for the next two years, Eberle still urges everyone to take a look at their coverage and see if their plans are still the best for their household, especially considering a hike in premium costs.
“We’re in the open enrollment period and that’s what’s at the forefront right now,” Eberle said “We are encouraging everyone to come back and look at their plan selection.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2024_dec13_openenrollment-newsletter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-01 04:16:32.118217

(Photo via State Archives of Florida)The white political elite in America – politicians, judges, lawyers, policymakers, businesses and corporations – has never as a whole acted in good faith towards its Black citizens. These “leaders” routinely moved electoral goalposts, added impediments to gum up the voting process, made promises they never intended to keep, lied, grudgingly made concessions and over time, always clawed them back.
Meanwhile, on the ground during the last century, mobs of white vigilantes used a campaign of terror, intimidating Black potential voters, beating, brutalizing and lynching African Americans, and burning down Black businesses and whole communities.  
Americans love to push out their chests and gloat about the freedoms citizens enjoy, but a dirty little secret is that being “American” has never referred to ALL Americans.
Throughout much of history, African Americans and their native brothers and sisters were forced to stand outside the proverbial shop window looking in, barred from entering by menacing gatekeepers and often forcibly removed, beaten, and killed if they tried to get inside.
The ability to vote is the sacred touchstone of American democracy but to this point, it is merely aspirational, frail, ethereal, because those opposed to electoral freedom have never quite figured out how to contend with America’s Original Sin.
For centuries, those in power found, and continue to manufacture, techniques to wage a relentless, multi-pronged war against a people.
The latest antagonists, in a long list of adversaries, are Gov. Ron DeSantis, the Republican-dominated Florida Legislature and the MAGA-Republican-led US Supreme Court.
The future of the Voting Rights Act
Earlier in October, justices listened to arguments in Louisiana v. Callais, a significant redistricting case that could determine the very future of the Voting Rights Act.
Voting Rights Act supporters rally outside Supreme Court as justices hear Louisiana case

If the high court overturns Section 2 – a provision that bans racial discrimination in voting — GOP-controlled legislatures would rush to redraw at least 19 more voting districts for the House of Representatives in favor of Republicans in the 2026 midterms, according to a recent report by the voting rights advocacy groups Black Voters Matter Fund and Fair Fight Action. 
The result, a National Public Radio story notes, could have “a cascading effect on congressional maps in mostly Southern states where Republicans either control both legislative chambers and the governor’s office or have a veto-proof majority in the legislature — and where voting is racially polarized, with Black voters tending to vote Democratic and white voters tending to vote Republican.”
New maps would deny racial minority voters a realistic opportunity of electing their preferred candidate, with Florida, Louisiana, Georgia, Missouri, North Carolina, and Texas possibly ending up with fewer Democratic representatives in Congress. 
Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee could lose all of theirs, the report finds. And as much as 30% of the Congressional Black Caucus and 11% of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus could also be lost.
It is not out of the realm of possibility that Republicans would cement one-party control of the House for at least a generation, according to Cliff Albright, co-founder and executive director of the Black Voters Matter Fund.

“Part of the point that we’re trying to make with this report is that what happens in the South doesn’t just stay in the South,” Albright adds. “This racial gerrymandering has the ability to not just disempower, disenfranchise Black voters and to eliminate Black elected officials and Latino elected officials. What happens in these states impacts the entire country.” 
In Florida DeSantis and his MAGA Republican accomplices have eagerly embraced President Donald Trump’s commands for Republican state leaders to hold special sessions to redraw electoral districts in favor of the GOP.
DeSantis has argued in favor of manipulating electoral mechanisms to ensure that Florida is one of those states.
“I think the state is malapportioned,” he said at a press conference in Bradenton. “So I do think it would be appropriate to do a redistricting in the mid-decade. So we’re working through what that would look like, but I can tell you just look at how the population has shifted in different parts of the state over a four-to-five-year period. It’s been really significant.”
Florida Chief Justice Carlos G. Muñiz (Photo via Florida Supreme Court)
Using population data from the US Census, legislators or independent commissions draw district lines once a decade to account for population changes. But Trump has upended the practice in an effort to pad the slim GOP majority in the House of Representatives.
The governor is proud of his actions in 2022 when he vetoed an original congressional redistricting map passed by the Legislature, labeling it a “disaster.” DeSantis then championed a proposal the Legislature agreed to pass that erased Black representation in Northern Florida and helped to flip Congress. 
While a variety of voting rights groups sued to strike down that map, the Florida Supreme Court ruledthat it was constitutional. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Carlos Muñiz said that legislators had a “superior” obligation to follow federal equal protection law, and not the Fair Districts Amendment passed by Florida voters in 2010. 
That amendment had a clause modeled after the Voting Rights Act now being scrutinized by the U.S. Supreme Court that said legislators could not diminish the ability of minorities to elect a representative of their choice. The Florida Supreme Court decision gives legislators in the future a way to sidestep that clause.
The Fair District Amendment also bans congressional districts from being “drawn with the intent to favor or disfavor a political party or an incumbent.”
But will DeSantis and the Legislature be able to use court rulings related to race to draw districts that accomplish the goal of flipping Democratic seats while at the same time eliminating minority representation in Congress? Time will tell.
Florida Supreme Court upholds congressional district maps

The League of Women Voters of Florida detailed the deliberate and expansive efforts by DeSantis and his cronies to use legislation, policies, programs and subterfuge to steadily reduce the electoral playing field for African Americans.  
“In recent years, the state of Florida has implemented an alarming series of policies that undermine voter participation, creating conditions ripe for mass voter intimidation, LWV officials said in the report. “State officials, led by Governor Ron DeSantis, have weaponized law enforcement to target voters across the state, from the arrest of formerly incarcerated individuals who believed they were eligible to vote to the harassment of citizens who signed petitions for a reproductive right ballot initiative.”
The report described these instances of systematic voter intimidation as a “a dangerous and deliberate attempt to disenfranchise certain communities – led explicitly by state institutions. They undermine both the rule of law and democratic norms. These actions create a chilling effect on political participation, discouraging people within the targeted communities from engaging in civic life. Fear and confusion around voter eligibility causes many to remain de facto disenfranchised even when they are legally eligible to vote.”
For years before the 2024 presidential election, DeSantis and legislative Republicans kept busy carrying out their part of their national party’s agenda to incapacitate parts of the state’s electoral apparatus to dissuade Black and brown voters, young people, seniors, and other Democratic constituencies from voting.
This meant passing a slew of laws that make it considerably harder to vote than was true four years earlier, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. Florida is now one of four states that have “used single bills to enact an array of restrictions, imposing limits across the entire voting process,” the center has reported.
The Sunshine State is among 11 Republican-dominated legislatures that have impinged on ways the electorate can register to vote, while also restricting voter registration drives. 
According to the Brennan Center report, DeSantis has given “partisan actors unprecedented authority over elections”; he has also created “election police” to investigate and prosecute supposed fraud and intimidate eligible voters.
We are living in a time when those responsible for upholding the law are doing everything but. DeSantis, Trump, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, the Supreme Court and phalanx of MAGA Republicans are making their moves with significant, concerted pushback from Democrats.
There is little expectation that the forces of regression, bigotry and retreat – who have plotted and schemed on ways to eviscerate not just the Voting Rights Act, but also to ensure that Black and brown voting power is permanently hobbled, disabled, demolished, will be slowed down.
And with this, we can expect these rogues to steal not just the 2026 midterm elections but the 2028 presidential elections as well.

For residents of the Yukon-Kuskokwim region who were displaced by Typhoon Halong, such losses are not so easily quantified.
In the region’s affected villages, which are among the most rural communities in North America, most residents are Yup’ik and adherence to Indigenous traditions is strong. Those traditions are tied to the harvesting of wild foods and materials for personal and family needs. And much of the labor performed to carry out those harvests falls outside of the usual American cash economy.
Losses inflicted by the disaster in Kipnuk, Kwigillingok and other storm-damaged villages include the stockpiles of wild fish, game meat, berries and greens that have been built over months of unpaid work.
While there is not a dollar number for the food that was lost, its value is high, said Kelsey Ciugun Wallace, president of the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.
“Our foods are just so important to who we are as Native people,” said Wallace, who is Yup’ik and from Bethel, the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta’s hub community. Traditional foods provide not just nutrition, but also emotional and spiritual support and “connect us to the land and water,” she said.
In response to the loss of subsistence food and access to food-gathering sites, the Alaska Native Heritage Center and the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium are funneling traditional foods to displaced families.
They are coordinating a program that is taking in donations from around the state. Through it, frozen foods, like sockeye salmon from the Copper River Basin, muktuk from the North Slope and berries from Southcentral Alaska’s mountain slopes, have been collected in a huge freezer trailer parked at the heritage center,
The volunteer response has been overwhelming, and it extends beyond donations to cooking, preparing and serving, Wallace said.
“All the aunties in Anchorage are wanting to cook,” she said.
For ANTHC, the emergency food collection and distribution adds to a year-round traditional foods program, said Shea Seigert, the consortium’s senior manager of external affairs.
Seigert said he does not know how long the emergency program will run. “As long as there’s a need, we will continue to fill it,” he said.
Some of the donated food is being used by the nonprofit World Central Kitchen, which has been providing hot meals to evacuees and emergency workers at the William A. Egan Civic & Convention Center in downtown Anchorage and the Alaska Airlines Center on the University of Alaska Anchorage campus. Both sites have been operating as assistance hubs for the evacuees in the Anchorage area, and the two sites were also used as temporary shelters, though by this week, most of the clients were set to be transitioned to longer-lasting and more private living quarters, according to state officials.
Government agencies providing economic assistance are also attempting to accommodate the cultural needs of the people displaced by the typhoon.
One is the U.S. Small Business Administration, which typically provides low-interest loans to help victims of declared natural disasters recover from economic losses.
Kelly Loeffler, the SBA’s administrator, said the agency recognizes that damages in the Yukon-Kuskokwim region are different from disaster damages in the Lower 48.
Loeffler, at a Wednesday news conference held in Anchorage with Gov. Mike Dunleavy, said the SBA has “modified some of the rules in order to speed relief to those survivors.”
Loans will be available to replace lost or damaged subsistence-related items, Loeffler said at the news conference, which was held outside the Alaska Airlines Center. That includes things like all-terrain vehicles, hunting knives and boats.
“We’re going to continue to respond to unique needs of the terrain, people and this culture and make sure that the funding meets the moment,” she said.
However, damages to subsistence camps are not eligible for such aid, according to an SBA statement issued on Monday.
The quandary of how to compensate for subsistence losses also affected the response to a similar disaster three years ago.  When remnants of Typhoon Merbok struck the same region and wreaked havoc farther north into the Bering Strait region, rural and mostly Indigenous Alaskans had to work through aid systems to get compensation for lost subsistence gear and equipment.
Federal agencies attempted to tailor aid programs to the needs of rural Alaska residents, and some of the relief effort focused on rebuilding and repairing traditional fishing and hunting camps. Additionally, the U.S. Geological Survey stepped up its mapping of the region and its identification of coastal hazards in Merbok’s wake.
But there were bumps, such as improper language translations provided by a contractor the Federal Emergency Management Agency hired.
The urgency for tailoring disaster response to the particular needs of Western Alaska is expected to continue into the future. Scientists project that climate change, by warming the ocean, thawing permafrost and thus causing the land to sink, raising sea levels and diminishing sea ice will trigger yet more regional disasters like Halong and Merbok.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC08537-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-31 22:56:41.418629

Dr. Jay Butler, who is a nationally recognized expert in infectious diseases, will start his UAA position on Dec. 28, the university announced on Friday.
Butler has experience in state, federal and tribal governments. Most recently, he was deputy director for infectious diseases at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. He held that position for six years. He left there in July, at a time when the CDC was being targeted for mass firings and cutbacks.

	Before then, he served as Alaska’s chief medical officer, chief of the Alaska Division of Health’s epidemiology section and director of the CDC’s Arctic Investigations Program. He also worked as senior director of community health services for the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, among other positions. And he served for 16 years as an affiliate professor at UAA’s WWAMI School of Medical Education, part of an educational partnership between Alaska, Washington, Wyoming, Montana and Idaho. The program enables students in those states to get medical degrees, giving them options for studying at six different universities.
In a statement, UAA Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs Denise Runge said Butler’s deep experience will be an asset to the College of Health.
“Dr. Butler joins UAA at an exciting time for our university,” Runge said in the statement. “His leadership and commitment to Alaska will be instrumental in strengthening UAA’s position as the state’s designated health university. We are thrilled to welcome him into a role supported by a strong team of faculty, staff and leaders within the College of Health.”
Butler’s work includes several years of research into influenza and other infectious diseases and their impact on Alaska Native people.

(Photo: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Seafood tissue samples taken from the Tangipahoa River last month contained harmful levels of arsenic in five of the 13 samples tested, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality reported.
It’s the latest update from state officials on the river’s health after the Aug. 22 fire and explosion at the Smitty’s Supply Inc. petroleum products facility in Roseland. The industrial disaster coated nearby homes and businesses with oily soot, while huge tanks filled with automotive oils and fluids spilled into the river and adjacent ponds. Cleanup efforts have collected 11 million gallons of liquid waste, according to state estimates. 
The state made its seafood test findings public late Friday in a news release, explaining Wildlife and Fisheries officials collected samples from fish, shrimp and crabs from the river as well as similar catch from Bayou Lacombe 40 miles away for comparison. 
The samples were taken Sept. 16-23 and submitted to the Louisiana Department of Health for testing. 
“With the exception of arsenic, no contaminants detected in seafood samples from the Tangipahoa River were present at levels expected to pose harm to public health,” the LDEQ statement said.
The agency explained further its analysis did not differentiate between organic and inorganic arsenic, the former being far less toxic. A 2016 study from the National Institutes of Health found human exposure to organic arsenic is most common through eating seafood though it is generally nontoxic.
Inorganic arsenic, when the heavy metal element combines with carbon or other materials, has been linked to different types of cancer and nerve damage. Exposure to this form is most common from drinking water contaminated with industrial products, according to the American Cancer Association. Fertilizers are also a recognized source of inorganic arsenic. 
State officials also pointed out there is already a state health advisory against eating fish from the Tangipahoa River for mercury levels that dates back to 2003. It covers black drum, bowfin, crappie, flathead catfish, freshwater drum, largemouth bass, red ear sunfish, rock bass, smallmouth buffalo and spotted bass.      
Earlier Friday, the Department of Environmental Quality and parish officials reopened a small lower stretch of Tangipahoa River to maritime traffic, though upper portions remain closed as cleanup crews continue to deploy spill containment booms.

Montana’s state Senate President, Matt Regier, has requested the first bill draft of the 2027 Legislature to rein in what he described as “political agendas” at teacher educational conferences. 
The move follows backlash from conservative Republicans after recordings from several sessions of the Montana Federation of Public Employees educator conference were released on social media about culture-war topics, including book bans, gender ideology, and censorship in art. 
The educator conference had more than 300 sessions educators could attend during two days in October and provided required professional development units for educators. 
Shortly after the conference and announcement from Regier, MFPE said it was proud of the presentations on topics in math, science, language, art and more. It said nearly 1,000 educators from public and private schools attended.
With the backing of State Superintendent Susie Hedalen, Regier requested the bill draft title “Revise education laws related to teacher training and education and meetings of teacher organizations,” which he said will be similar to a bill brought this session that failed on a final vote in the Senate during the 2025 session. 
“Coming into this session, we knew this was an issue with PIR (pupil-instruction-related) days. There had been reporting on it from the conference last year,” Regier, the Kalispell Republican, said. “We need to make sure that tax dollars aren’t going towards political agendas in our schools.”
The controversy over the educators conference arose earlier this month after an individual went “undercover” at the conference and recorded educators at several of the sessions, releasing snippets of conversation online and tagging elected officials. 
Amanda Curtis, president of MFPE, told the Daily Montanan that the recordings and subsequent backlash from Regier and Hedalen was disinformation and lacked context. 
“I think I just have to say they are outright lying about what happens at this conference, and I don’t really understand what good it’s serving Montana students,” Curtis said. “There’s a lot of heartburn and disappointment in the Senate president and superintendent grandstanding on the first bill title being a teacher attack bill when they really could be focusing on helping … recruit and retain Montana teachers.”

 Pupil-instruction-related days

Montana’s administrative rules require schools to close for two days every October for professional development pupil-instruction related (PIR) days, where teachers can attend annual meetings of various state associations. 
Teachers are paid for the two days when students are not in class if they attend an approved professional development meeting and earn professional development units, or PDUs, which are required to keep their license. 
The third week of October has been designated as a time for teachers to do their professional development for decades. 
The state’s largest union, MFPE, has put on its teacher education conference for more than 30 years, Curtis said, in cooperation with the Office of Public Instruction. But the educator’s conference is not the only conference that takes place during that week — other professional organizations hold their own conferences at the same time. 
The Montana State Literacy Association Conference, the Association for Career and Technical Education Conference, the Montana Conference of Education Leadership, the Montana Music Educators Association Conference all schedule their programs for the October PIR days. 
The MHSA All-State music festival, for band, choir, and orchestra students, also takes place during the two days off; as does the all-state youth hunt. 
In a joint press release, Hedalen and Regier said their legislation would “end the practice of Montana teachers receiving educational credit for their participation in conferences promoting extreme leftist ideology and classroom indoctrination.”
“Montana has been closing schools and paying teachers for two days every year to attend this conference in order to develop professionally and better serve their students. But instead of learning how to instruct students on core skills and prepare them for life, these conferences have been indoctrinating teachers with leftist political extremism,” Regier said in the release.
Curtis said that broad legislation that could remove PIR days from state law would have wide-reaching implications for educators and students, and said that MFPE was proud to stand behind the extensive curriculum offered at their seminar. 
“There’s a lot of righteous indignation from members who are teachers who have been attending this conference for all or part of the 30 years,” Curtis said. “There’s a new fervor to join MFPE, I think from folks who have maybe not been as excited about union membership and can clearly see through the crazy culture war attacks.”
 Undercover recordings 

The MFPE conference, held in Missoula, included more than 320 different sessions for educators to attend, mostly one- or two-hours modules capped at 20 to 30 educators. 
The sessions covered the full spectrum of opportunities for educators, including topics like “Dyslexia the Superpower;” “Bring the stock market to life in your classroom;” “Advancing proficiency in STEM: practical strategies with AI and socratic dialogue;” “Fostering curiosity in your classroom with live butterflies;” “Rockets in the science classroom, Grades 6 7 8 9;” and a panel on school funding sponsored by the Legislature’s Interim School Funding Committee. OPI also had exhibition booths and their own presentations.
But Hedalen and Regier’s legislation focused on four seminars “promoting radical gender ideology, DEI, nude child photography, and sexually explicit books.”
Finley Warden, who isn’t a teacher but on social media says he goes “undercover to expose the far left,” recorded parts of four seminars and released short pieces of audio. Warden is a young, Missoula-based conservative activist who has testified before the Legislature 
According to an MFPE spokesperson, Warden registered for the conference as himself. In various sessions he presented himself as an art education student and a math teacher, and was introduced as himself by Curtis in one session.
Curtis said the recordings lacked any context, couldn’t be verified, and might be illegal under Montana law, which requires all-party consent before making audio recordings in private spaces. She said the union is consulting with attorneys and would take steps to protect the personal and professional safety of anyone recorded without their consent. 
One seminar was “DEI &A in the 2025 Art Room,” which included a discussion about censorship of art, specifically the 2024 removal of photographer Sally Mann’s exhibition from a gallery in Texas by police. Mann, once named the country’s best photographer, has sparked controversy going back to the 1990s, over a series of her work depicting her young children, sometimes in the nude. The National Coalition Against Censorship in a statement about the controversy said the photos contain “neither sexual context nor sexual content.”
The recording of the teachers’ discussion includes references to how the Nazi regime censored abstract art, and how to have discussions with students over whether censorship in art is acceptable. 
Other seminars that drew ire included one, capped at 25 educators, that was a training on advocacy and law for librarians. The course description stated it would show ways librarians can “uphold the laws protecting libraries in the face of information and material challenges and the challenge to our profession as a whole.”
A portion of that seminar, released in a recording, centered around a librarian telling a “victory story” about a graphic novel that had been removed from a school library, and the librarian’s role in getting it put back on the shelf after numerous students had requested it. 
Regier and Hedalen described the situation as a story about “bringing a sexually explicit book back to her library to provide to middle school students.” 
The book in question, a graphic novel in the Heartstopper series, focuses on a fictional gay high school couple, and has been the focus of several book bans in other states. 
The press release from the state describes the book as including “multiple passages of explicit softcore pornography.” The nonprofit Common Sense Media, which allows parents to rate media content, lists it as appropriate for ages 14 and up, and says it includes passages of high school students in a sex education class, and “implied sexual activity.”
A third seminar that was recorded included a member of the National Education Association sharing that there are educational modules that educators can access online to learn about LGBTQ+ issues, including gender identity and gender expression. 
None of the MFPE sessions are mandatory for educators. 
Curtis told the Daily Montanan that lacking context and the extent of discussions which took place in each seminar, the recordings and their characterization amounted to “lying and misinformation” about the conference.
Regier told the Daily Montanan in a phone call Friday that he was “not demonizing the education system,” but wanted to make sure there were safeguards in place to protect Montana students. 
“If the unions are going to keep going with sexualized content for kids or DEI or any of this other stuff that’s being reported, at a minimum I want to stop taxpayer dollars from going towards these,” Regier said. “If we’ve got 300 great courses here, and one that will sexualize your kids, or if there’s one teacher that has one left-liberal agenda – and they’re there for that and not to teach the kids math — that’s a problem.”
He said the goal of his bill is to put the decision about teacher educational opportunities in the hands of school districts, which can decide whether to keep the October days and what conference teachers should go to, and keep the “bad apples from pushing their agenda.”
He added that the bill will be modeled on House Bill 557, legislation with similar content brought by Rep. Jodee Etchart, R-Billings. The bill passed the House but died in a final vote in the Senate, after two Republican senators changed their votes. 
Regier called out the two senators, who were members of the Nine Republicans who opposed Regier’s leadership during the session and worked with Democrats in the chamber to push through major pieces of legislation, including Medicaid expansion and the state budget. 
“I hope this bill highlights the frustrations of myself and the other legislators who knew about this last session,” Regier said. “The public should know that if they’re voting for parental rights and local control, we want to assure voters there are a lot of good Republicans who have insight who are pushing back.”

 OPI takes a stance 

Following the release of the audio from the teacher’s conference, Hedalen sent a letter to school districts, saying there had been “potential violations of state and federal law in public schools related to DEI and gender identity instruction.” 
The letter reminded educators “to remain in full compliance with the law and to uphold the responsibilities entrusted to us by Montana families,” and pointed to legislation from the 2025 session including House Bill 471, which requires parents opt-in to human sexuality and identity instruction. 
In the press release, Hedalen said she is “currently investigating MFPE and other professional development providers,” to make sure they are following state and federal laws. The release also said that MFPE had not publicly published its conference agenda and list of sessions.
But Curtis said that OPI had been invited to participate “in every step of the planning process” of the conference, as they are every year. 
“Our office took their unanswered emails and lack of attendance in any planning meeting to mean they had no concerns with the conference,” Curtis said. “The list of courses has been available for review since May of 2025. OPI could have just walked over one block to our office, picked up a phone, or sent an email asking us to send a list of courses before they were ever approved.”
In an email, the spokesperson from OPI said that while many sessions at the conference “could have been beneficial to educators, there were also many that were problematic; introducing instruction that would be in violation of state or federal law or the educator code of ethics.”
Asked about specific seminars, OPI commented on the librarian discussing bringing the graphic novel back to the library but said there has been no legal investigation into whether any rules or district or state policies had been violated.  
“The discussion about returning a sexually explicit book to school libraries is ultimately a decision that should rest with parents. They are best positioned to determine whether material of that nature is appropriate for their 12- or 13-year-old children to read,” OPI said. 
Hedalen said through an OPI spokesperson that they had no prior knowledge that anyone was going to make recordings of the MFPE conference and that no one “recommended, suggested, or promoted such actions.”
The spokesperson for OPI clarified that the office does not want to stop PIR days or limit professional development opportunities for educators. 
“Our goal is to end the outdated practice of requiring schools to close for a specific conference and instead empower local districts and teachers to decide how and when to use those days for professional growth,” the spokesperson said in an email. “There are many excellent professional development opportunities available beyond the MFPE conference, including the OPI Summer Institute, the Teacher Learning Hub, and locally-driven PD.”
On Thursday morning, Hedalen had a meeting with Curtis that Hedalen described as “cordial,” but did not offer details. Curtis said it was a “productive meeting” in a press release, and emphasized the organization has a “shared commitment to continue working with her to provide irreplaceable professional development for educators.”
In addition to the requested legislation lawmakers will consider in 2027, the Office of Public Instruction is working on their own changes to professional development for educators. 
“We are currently undertaking a major overhaul of all PDU providers, including removing those that have failed to comply with the MCA or have not provided the necessary information that is required by ARM,” an OPI spokesperson said. “This new system will allow us to offer high-quality professional development courses for our teachers, ensuring they receive the training they need to best support student learning.”

The Boise-based group Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho, which was created this year, announced Oct. 29 it is beginning to collect signatures attempting to qualify the Idaho Medical Cannabis Act to go before voters in the 2026 general election. 
The group filed an initiative petition with the state Aug. 29 and received ballot titles from the Idaho Attorney General’s Office on Oct. 20. 
Under Idaho state law, cannabis means marijuana, and the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably. 
The Idaho Medical Cannabis Act seeks to:

Allow qualifying patients with chronic pain or debilitating conditions like cancer, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, Crohn’s disease, post-traumatic stress disorder or Alzheimer’s to access regulated cannabis for treatment. In order to access medical cannabis, Idahoans would need to apply for a medical cannabis card by presenting medical records showing a diagnosis of a substantial health condition from a medical professional authorized to make such a diagnosis.  
Establish a regulated licensing system for Idaho-based producers and dispensaries.
Prohibit the public use of medical cannabis, prohibit the sharing of medical cannabis with others and prohibit impaired driving while under the influence of medical cannabis.
Reclassify cannabis from a Schedule 1 drug to Schedule 2 drug in state law in order to allow for research of medical cannabis.  

“This is about giving families and individuals options when nothing else has worked,” said Amanda Watson, communications lead for the Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho. “This initiative was created with Idaho values in mind. It would require strong oversight, measures to prevent recreational use and most importantly, it would provide relief for thousands of Idahoans suffering from serious medical conditions. It’s a compassionate, conservative approach to health care.”
The short ballot title for the Idaho Medical Cannabis Act reads: “Measure decriminalizing the use, possession, production, cultivation, transportation, distribution and sale of marijuana by medical cannabis cardholders and production licensees.”
 Idaho Legislature strongly opposes marijuana

The new medical cannabis initiative sets up the potential to have two, dueling cannabis questions on Idaho voters’ ballots in November 2026. 
The Idaho Legislature, which staunchly opposes marijuana, has already placed a proposed amendment to the Idaho Constitution called House Joint Resolution 4 on the November 2026 ballot in Idaho. If approved by voters, HJR 4 would make it so that only the Idaho Legislature – not Idaho voters – has the power to legalize marijuana or other narcotics. HJR 4 applies to the growing, possession, use, selling, delivering, dispensing, prescribing, manufacturing or transporting of marijuana or other narcotics.  
Idaho Gov. Brad Little signs $300 mandatory minimum fine for marijuana possession into law

“Too many legislatures across this nation have sat back and just waited as initiative after initiative would come after them, until they finally overwhelm it and overwhelm the legislature,” state Sen. Scott Grow, R-Eagle, said in March. “We are acting because that’s our responsibility.”
Days before adopting the proposed amendment to the Idaho Constitution, the Idaho Legislature also passed another law creating a new mandatory minimum fine of $300 for anyone convicted of simple possession of marijuana. 
 What is a ballot initiative and how does it work in Idaho?

In Idaho, a ballot initiative is a form of direct democracy where the voters of Idaho – not the Idaho Legislature – decide whether to pass a new law. 
To qualify the Idaho Medical Cannabis Act for the November 2026 election, supporters need to gather and verify signatures from at least 70,000 registered Idaho voters, with at least 6% of the registered voters in at least 18 of Idaho’s 35 legislative districts.  
Supporters have until April 30 to collect the required signatures and submit them for verification, Watson said. 
If the ballot initiative qualifies for the November 2026 election, it would require a simple majority of voters to approve it. 
All of Idaho’s neighboring states, other than Wyoming, either offer medical cannabis like Utah or recreational marijuana, like Washington, Oregon, Montana and Nevada. 
Since 2012, different groups in Idaho have tried and failed every two years to qualify a medical marijuana ballot initiative to go on the ballot, state records show. 
The Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho is a new, different group that launched this year. In an interview with the Idaho Capital Sun, Watson said the Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho will use paid signature-gatherers to collect the necessary signatures by the April 30 deadline. Signature gatherers will be paid up to $5 per valid signature, and organizers are focusing on recruiting signature gatherers at this time. Information about applying to be a signature-gatherer is available on the Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho’s website 
 What is the Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho?

Public records show that experienced, high-profile legal and communications professionals in Boise have been steering the Idaho Medical Cannabis Act to this point.
Watson, president and founder of Boise-based Atlas Strategic Communications, is serving as the communications lead for the Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho.
Jeremy Chou, a partner with the Boise law firm/public affairs firm Givens Pursley, represents the Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho and submitted official paperwork for the Idaho Medical Cannabis Act to the Idaho Secretary of State’s Office.
Records available through the Idaho Secretary of State’s Office indicate the Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho is a Boise-based limited liability company that was created Aug. 1. 
Givens Pursley Corporate Services, which has the same mailing address and a nearly identical name to Chou’s law firm, Givens Pursley LLP, is listed as the registered agent for the Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho.
In addition to the limited liability company, a political action committee, or PAC, has also been recently established in Idaho. 
Campaign finance records available through the Idaho Secretary of State’s Office indicate that the Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho PAC was created Oct. 23. Those records list Rob Cronin as the treasurer and chairperson of the Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho PAC, while the mailing address provided is the same address as Watson’s firm, Atlas Strategic Communications. 
The PAC, which is only a few days old, has not reported raising or spending any money as of this article’s publication deadline.

The leak is coming from a well located about 3 miles southeast of Golden Meadow, on the eastern end of Bayou Lafourche. The well is owned by Castex Energy, a Houston company, according to state Rep. Joe Orgeron, R-Golden Meadow.
U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Jaiden Hartley said his agency was notified of the incident around 7 a.m. Friday. Coast Guard crews responded to an area just east of Tidewater Dock and found a blown methane well head, he said.
Natural gas condensate was released, and a light sheening was observed on the bayou’s surface, Hartley said. 
It’s unclear when the leak began and how much gas has been released. Technicians were still on scene as of about 5:30 p.m. still working to plug the well head, while cleanup crews were deploying absorbent boom in the area, Hartley said.
Lafourche Parish Fire District 3 Chief Devin Dedon said his department has been on standby in case more personnel are needed to assist. 
“Right now, it seems like Coast Guard has it well under control,” Dedon said. “They got a cleanup crew on scene and will notify us if we’re needed.”",,,,2025-10-31 19:02:19.901360

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Not far from the security line at the Salt Lake City International Airport, a woman struggled, screaming for help as two plain-clothed Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers dragged her out. 
A video posted on social media shows one of the agents showing a badge to a Salt Lake City Police officer who observed the scene without interfering at about 4 p.m. on Wednesday. Not many details of the arrest were clear in the following hours, until Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall released a statement Thursday condemning it. 
“I am left wondering and aching from the fear and pain these types of operations keep striking in my heart and the hearts of so many of us,” Mendenhall said.

After watching footage from witnesses, the Salt Lake City Police officer’s body camera and airport surveillance — in which the woman is seen trying to break away from the officers, yelling “I have my papers” — Mendenhall said she had been made aware of the case, involving “multiple plain-clothed ICE agents.”
ICE initially denied being involved in the arrest on Thursday morning, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. But, after the Salt Lake City Police and the airport confirmed the arresting officers were from ICE, the agency released another statement acknowledging their involvement.
Officials with ICE confirmed the woman is a 39 year-old immigrant without permanent legal status in the country from El Salvador who had entered the U.S. in 2007 and had received a removal order in absentia in February 2020.
In a statement, ICE confirmed that the arrest was a targeted enforcement operation and that the woman will be held in their custody pending her removal to El Salvador.
“U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is executing its mission of identifying and removing criminal aliens and others who have violated our nation’s immigration laws,” the agency wrote. “All aliens in violation of U.S. immigration law may be subject to arrest, detention and, if found removable by final order, removal from the United States, regardless of nationality.”
A Utah court records search Friday showed only a winter parking infraction in 2022 under the woman’s name.
Mendenhall lamented the incident, saying that so much about ICE operations like the arrest in Salt Lake City remain unknown.



Let us know what you think...


 


“In this case, for example, why were the agents in plain clothes without visible identification? Why did they choose the lobby of the airport—the gateway to our state—where some 28,000 people enter every day?,” Mendenhall said. “What I do know is that nothing about this incident, like so many ICE operations, makes me feel safer as an American.”
The city reached out to federal agencies searching for answers, “in the interest of promoting transparency, accountability and the well-being of all who live in and visit our city,” the Salt Lake City Council said in a statement.
“Incidents like this create fear and uncertainty in our community. The operation was not coordinated with or directed by Salt Lake City Police,” council members said.
City clarifications
While Mendenhall said there are details the city still doesn’t know about the detainment, she said some factors needed to be clarified.
Despite being inside the airport, the pre-security area where the arrest took place is considered a public space. 
Also, the Salt Lake City Police officer who observed the arrest was responding to the commotion in the terminal and visually confirmed the agents’ federal identification, Mendenhall said. 
Local law enforcement is prohibited from interfering with federal immigration enforcement.
In other daily operations from the city police, immigration status doesn’t influence how officers handle the situation, the mayor said, “nor do officers screen for immigration status when placing a person under arrest.”

Shapiro declares disaster emergency over SNAP benefits suspension,Peter Hall,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/food-insecurity/gov-shapiro-declares-disaster-emergency-over-snap-benefits-suspension/,The state will make $5 million available for food banks to weather expected spike in people seeking assistance,"Pennsylvania Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding speaks at a news conference Friday at the Philabundance food bank warehouse in south Philadelphia, where Gov. Josh Shapiro announced $5 million in emergency funding to aid food charities as federal SNAP recipients miss their November assistance payments. (Photo by Commonwealth Media Services)As two federal judges ordered the Trump administration to release food assistance money, Gov. Josh Shapiro announced Friday the state will make $5 million available to a network of food banks across the commonwealth.
Shapiro also signed a disaster declaration to ensure the state money is available immediately, as 2 million Pennsylvanians who rely on the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) miss their November allocations. They would normally be paid Saturday.
“They made this determination even though they are sitting on billions of dollars of congressionally appropriated contingency funds,” Shapiro said in a news conference at the Philabundance food bank warehouse in south Philadelphia.
SNAP provides $366 million a month in food assistance, which benefits about one out of every eight Pennsylvanians – or about 15% of the state’s population.
Lori Jones-Brown, CEO of Philabundance, which is the largest non-profit food bank in the greater Philadelphia area, said food pantries across the region are already using reserves to meet increased demand. 
“Just today, one of my colleagues told me that a mother came to our warehouse North Philly with four kids in our car asking for help,” Jones-Brown said. “Pantries are seeing scared faces and longer lines, and this is happening at a time when we were already seeing record numbers.”

The $5 million in state funding will flow through Feeding Pennsylvania, a statewide association of the commonwealth’s nine food banks that serve more than 1.5 million people annually across all 67 counties.
Additionally, Shapiro said he has launched a private-sector fundraising effort to aid food banks through the SNAP Emergency Relief Fund that has already collected more than $1 million from Pennsylvania business leaders.
Shapiro noted the commonwealth  is part of the coalition of 24 Democratic states that sued the Trump administration this week, seeking a court order directing the U.S. Department of Agriculture to continue food assistance for 42 million people nationwide.
While the ruling is an important win, Shapiro said, the commonwealth still faces a potential crisis in feeding its most vulnerable people. It will take up to 10 days for the administration to get the money into SNAP recipients accounts, he said, and that’s if President Donald Trump obeys the dual court orders.

“Given this administration and its propensity to ignore the rule of law, I don’t trust that they’re going to follow this judge’s ruling,” Shapiro said.
Earlier this year, the Trump administration also canceled $13 million in USDA funding over three years to purchase locally grown food for food banks in the commonwealth. The state is also suing to enforce its contract with the USDA.
“Not only is President Trump harming people who are hungry, he is harming Pennsylvania farmers, and that’s on top of what he’s already done to them with his ill advised tariffs,” Shapiro said. “I think right now, we should be doing everything we can to feed Pennsylvanians and not making excuses as to why it can’t happen.”
State House Speaker Joanna McClinton (D-Philadelphia) said Shapiro’s actions show leadership and a responsible solution to the crisis, which she attributed to Republicans in Congress.
“While this solution is temporary, we can do more to ensure fewer Pennsylvanians rely on programs like SNAP, by increasing the minimum wage and investing in our schools and job training programs to give every person a path to success,” McClinton said in a statement Friday.
Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa (D-Allegheny) and Health and Human Services Committee Chairperson Art Haywood (D-Montgomery) said in a statement the loss of SNAP payments will place an extraordinary strain on food charities.
“My colleagues and I have been receiving a deluge of calls from concerned constituents, fearful that they will not be able to stock their pantries and refrigerators because of the heartless decision of the president and his enablers in the federal government,” Costa said.

SNAP, historically known as food stamps, allows low income families and individuals to purchase food from neighborhood markets. For many, SNAP benefits have been sufficient to put food on the table, said Julie Bancroft, CEO of Feeding Pennsylvania. That organization will distribute the $5 million in emergency state funding to its network of food banks around the state.
“Where will they turn? They’ll turn to food banks and pantries, many for the first time, because their SNAP benefits have been just enough to make ends meet,” Bancroft said, noting the sudden increase in people seeking food assistance is exacerbated by the federal government shutdown during which most federal workers are not being paid.
“Our network is using cash reserves to keep shelves stocked, but these resources are limited and will run out, making emergency funding critical. The funding announced today will help ease the pressure in a time of crisis,” Bancroft said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/28564_gov_SNAP_DZ_009-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-31 19:02:19.901360

Dianne Primavera, left, and Budget Director Mark Ferrandino, right, at the Governor's Residence in Denver on Friday. (Photo by Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Gov. Jared Polis on Friday presented his initial budget plans for the next fiscal year, including recommendations to curb growth in state Medicaid spending.
The budget proposal includes about $18.6 billion in general fund spending, up 2.3% from the current fiscal year, which began in July. The Legislature’s Joint Budget Committee is in charge of crafting the budget and lawmakers are in charge of passing it, but the governor’s office gives hefty input through this proposal and an updated one in January.
The proposal calls for a 13% general fund reserve, down from the typical 15% reserve in recent years.
“This budget is a reflection of our priorities and supports our students by fully funding our schools, improving public safety, and addressing the strained fiscal environment we’re in due to H.R. 1 and President (Donald) Trump’s reckless tariffs,” Polis said in a statement.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
H.R. 1, also known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is the federal tax and spending measure Trump signed in July.
Medicaid growth has vastly outpaced how much the state government is allowed to spend under the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights, a state constitutional amendment that pegs spending increases to population growth and inflation. The ballooning program was one reason lawmakers needed to trim $1.2 billion from the budget this year, and it is contributing to the expected $850 million gap next year.
Medicaid is a health insurance program operated jointly by federal and state governments that provides coverage to low-income families and individuals. Almost one-fifth of Coloradans receive Medicaid benefits.
Polis proposes an increase in Medicaid spending by about $300 million, versus the projected growth of about $630 million. He called that a “down payment” to get program spending closer to the TABOR cap rate — spending has increased about 8.8% per year over the last decade, according to his office, about double the TABOR cap growth. If that trend continues, Medicaid spending could eat up most of the state’s general fund spending ability.
“There’s two levers on Medicaid,” Polis said during the presentation at the Governor’s Residence in Denver. “One is how many people you cover and two is what you cover. There have been a number of benefits that have been added in recent years and some of those aren’t sustainable over time.”
He highlighted dental benefits. They were once capped at $1,500 per year, but then that cap was lifted. Polis wants to reinstate a cap at $3,000 annually.
He also wants legislation next year to set a year-over-year growth rate in Medicaid general fund spending. His office is working with a third party to compare Colorado’s Medicaid program with national benchmarks to give some idea of how to curb growth. A public report on those findings should be available late this year or early January.
Administrative cost cuts
The budget proposal also includes suggestions for changes in departmental administration costs, ranging from a 34% reduction in the governor’s office to an 8% increase in the Department of Public Safety. The Department of Early Childhood would see an 11% decrease, the Department of Local Affairs would have a 26% decrease and the Department of Higher Education would have a 16% decrease in operating costs. Overall, those cuts would save about $25 million.
“It doesn’t mean anyone is laid off,” he said. “It means openings wouldn’t be filled.”
Polis is once again calling for the privatization of Pinnacol Assurance, the the insurer of “last resort” for workers’ compensation, in order to cover the continuation of the senior homestead exemption and state building maintenance. His proposal predicts a $400 million profit from such a sale.
On education, Polis wants to limit in-state tuition increases to 2.6%. He also wants to raise per-pupil funding in K-12 to $413 and partially start to implement a new school finance formula intended to send money to districts based on individual student needs, instead of the five-year average number of students.

(Getty Images)Most individual health insurance plans sold in Missouri will increase in price next year even as customers prepare to dig deeper into their own funds to replace costs previously covered by federal tax credits.
The state Department of Commerce and Insurance on Friday released the approved rates for individual plans, most of which are sold on the health insurance marketplace. One carrier, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas City, is lowering premiums an average of 4.1% for its plans available in 30 western Missouri counties. Some plans offered by the company will see an increase of as much as 9%.
Premiums will increase for the other eight carriers offering plans in all or part of the state. Ambetter Health plans, available off the marketplace in 109 counties, will increase an average of 1.9%, while Cox Health Plans, available in five southwest Missouri counties, will go up an average of 30.4%.
The costs for some Missourians will increase 70% or more if Congress does not extend tax credits enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The federal government has been shut down since Oct. 1 because congressional Democrats refuse to vote to fund the government until Republicans add an extension of the credits to the spending bill. Republicans argue the government should be reopened before negotiations over subsidies resume.
Premiums will increase for the other eight carriers offering plans in all or part of the state. Ambetter Health plans, available off the marketplace in 109 counties, will increase an average of 1.9%, while Cox Health Plans, available in five southwest Missouri counties, will go up an average of 30.4%.
There are at least two companies offering health plans in every county, with a handful in the St. Louis area seeing seven vying for their business. 
“First and foremost, Missourians need to know our state continues to have a competitive market, which means they will continue to have meaningful choices when it comes to their health coverage,” Angela Nelson, department director, said in a news release. 
In addition to reporting the average change, the department also provided the largest change in cost for any single plan offered by the nine carriers. Those increases ranged from 6.4% for an Ambetter Health plan, to 110% for a Medica plan offered in 54 counties. 
Open enrollment for the individual health plans begins Saturday. Consumers who purchase coverage by Dec. 15 will have it start Jan. 1. Plans may be purchased until Jan. 15, but coverage will not begin until Feb. 1, the release stated.
Missourians will start considering their choices without knowing whether enhanced subsidies enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic emergency will be extended.
The original Affordable Care Act subsidies that took effect in 2014 tied the actual cost to consumers to a percentage of their income for people earning less than four times the federal poverty level. Consumers with poverty level income — $15,650 for 2025 for individuals, $32,150 for a family of four — paid 2.1% of their income as premiums, sliding up to 10% for households with income between three and four times the poverty level.
The enhanced tax credits put a cap on out-of-pocket premium costs for all consumers, with the highest earners paying 8.5% of their income and those with incomes below 150% of poverty level paying no premiums for their insurance.
“There is still a tremendous amount of uncertainty about whether Congress will extend the premium tax subsidies into 2026, and we are keeping a close eye on any developments at the federal level,” Nelson said.
Only two of the eight companies offering individual plans in Missouri through the federal marketplace will have plans available in every county or almost every county in the state. United Healthcare plans are available in every county and Ambetter from Home State Health plans can be purchased in every county except Clark, Lewis, Marion, St. Francois, Schuyler and Scotland.
The average monthly premium is about $755 for both the United Healthcare and Ambetter offerings, an increase of about 15% and 25%, respectively. 
An individual with an income of $62,600 a year or more would have to pay the full premium if the enhanced credits are not extended. That means paying $9,060 over a year for the average Ambetter or United Healthcare plan instead of $5,321, an increase of 70%.

 Cost increase impacts

A panel of community members and experts hosted by the Community Health Commission of Missouri in St. Louis on Thursday underlined potential impacts of the expiring subsidies.
Sheldon Weisgrau, vice president for health and policy advocacy at the Missouri Foundation for Health, said higher premiums could lead younger, healthier people to forgo insurance, driving up prices for those who continue to purchase plans.
“When folks can’t afford to buy insurance, it doesn’t mean they won’t get sick,” Weisgrau said. When they do enter the health system, providers pick up the cost, “and again, that eventually gets passed on to everybody else.” 
As Missourians confront higher insurance premiums, 650,000 low-income residents of the state could also be forced to cope with a loss of federal food benefits, with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, set to run out of funding on Nov. 1. Federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island on Friday ordered the Trump administration to use contingency funds to pay at least partial benefits, but SNAP recipients could still face delays.
Panelists on Thursday said instability across federal safety net programs means communities will have to fill in the gaps through mutual aid.
“I think the neighborhood, the village, needs to be recreated,” said Shanelle Woods, one of the community members.
“There’s someone probably on your block that has extra,” Woods said. “Maybe Miss Jones has a pot of soup and she’s willing to share with your children. But, you have to build a relationship with your neighbor first.”
Panelists said policy conversations don’t address the difficulty of accessing safety net programs even when they are not being cut or suspended.
Shellie Robinson, who went on medical leave after being diagnosed with an autoimmune disease, said she struggled so long to prove she was eligible to receive disability benefits that she eventually had to go back to work.
Her doctors vouched for her, but, Robinson said, “it still wasn’t enough.”
“Who has the time to wait online or wait on a call for nearly three hours to talk to someone, to get it?” Robinson asked.
Timothy McBride, a health economist at Washington University in St. Louis, said that despite a “myth” that people who buy marketplace insurance plans are “undeserving, or they’re lazy,” many working people don’t have access to affordable insurance. Older adults who don’t qualify for Medicare – for instance, due to a chronic condition – may also need marketplace plans.
“There are flaws in our insurance markets that put people in this situation,” McBride said. “That’s the truth of the matter, and you don’t hear that from Washington. It’s a blame game.”

Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency Friday and directed $5 million from the state’s budget reserve trust fund to food banks that are part of the Feeding Kentucky network.
This came on the same day a federal judge ruled that  the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s decision to halt funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) during the government shutdown is illegal. The Massachusetts judge gave the Trump administration until Monday to respond. SNAP benefits are set to run out Saturday. 
Kentucky to hold a state food drive as threat to food assistance looms, governor says

Beshear’s order is “to ensure Kentuckians have access to food over the next few days,” his office said. About 563,080 people in Kentucky rely on SNAP to afford groceries.
Beshear’s executive order instructs the Kentucky Division of Emergency Management to work with the Office of the State Budget Director to “identify, allocate, and transfer funds as necessary from available sources to support the food banks during the lapse of SNAP funding,” beginning with the $5 million. The Cabinet for Health and Family Services will then provide the identified funds to Feeding Kentucky.
The budget reserve trust fund, also known as the “rainy day” fund, contains $3.7 billion. SNAP benefits in Kentucky total about $110 million a month.
Feeding Kentucky has seven food banks around the commonwealth. They will use the funds to buy and distribute extra food during the state of emergency, according to the executive order. 
The Lantern has asked Feeding Kentucky for comment. 
A federal judge in Rhode Island also ordered the Trump administration to fund SNAP. But even with the court orders, there could be delays in benefits. The USDA has not said how it will respond to the judges’ orders.

The woman had suffered multiple blows to her head and falls at the hands of her husband over the years. He had wanted to disable her, to make it more difficult for her to keep her children if she tried to leave him, Echo-Hawk said.
Many Native women have traumatic brain injury symptoms as a direct result of abuse, Echo-Hawk said. Tribal health advocates and groups serving survivors have long been aware of the problem, she said, but there has been little national research documenting the extent of it.
“It’s a very difficult thing to see,” said Echo-Hawk, of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma. “This is a pressing concern.”
The Urban Indian Health Institute, an Indigenous health research group, this month launched a first-of-its-kind national survey of American Indian, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian women to determine the prevalence of brain injuries in Native survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence. The goal is to illuminate the extent of the problem, guide clinicians, raise public awareness and direct resources.
A 2015 study in Arizona found a higher incidence of traumatic brain injuries in Native women in that state, but the new survey is the first national, Indigenous-led study of its kind, according to the institute.
It comes as domestic violence groups across the nation are struggling with federal funding delays caused by the government shutdown. As the impasse continues, the Trump administration has furloughed grant workers at the Office on Violence Against Women, which is part of the U.S. Department of Justice.

Traumatic brain injuries can cause memory loss, confusion and long-term behavioral changes and raise the risk of dementia. Some abusers intentionally inflict traumatic brain injuries on their victims because it doesn’t leave visible bruises, according to the Brain Injury Association of America.
The link between domestic violence and traumatic brain injuries has been well-documented in women generally, and the effects of such injuries have been studied in former football players and veterans. But research on Native communities is lacking. Even when Native victims show up in ERs, their cases often go underreported.
In a previous survey of survivors, some Native women reported broken teeth, evidence of blows to the head, Echo-Hawk said. But pushing and strangulation also can cause traumatic brain injuries.
Lackluster investigations may perpetuate high Native infant mortality rate

Violence is a public health crisis among American Indian, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian women, who are overrepresented in intimate partner violence statistics. Fifty-five percent report experiencing intimate partner violence, and a disproportionate number of Native women and girls are murdered or go missing.
In a 2020 survey by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 44% of American Indian and Alaska Native women reported being raped in their lifetime.
“People are losing their children because of memory loss and dementia,” Echo-Hawk said. “When people are experiencing intimate partner violence, they end up in ERs. Their children suffer. The whole community suffers as a direct result. And the same with the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.”
Tribes, long shut out from their own health data, fight for access and sovereignty

Doctors other hospital staff should receive more training on brain injuries and should know which communities are most likely to experience violence, said Nikki Cristobal, policy and research specialist for Pouhana ʻO Nā Wāhine, a nonprofit domestic violence resource center for Native Hawaiians.
Cristobal said one survivor told her clinicians hadn’t performed a brain scan or traumatic brain injury assessment on her, despite her ongoing psychological and cognitive symptoms. “It never occurred to anybody,” she said.
“We have to talk more about it,” said Cristobal, who worked with Echo-Hawk on developing the survey and is the principal investigator for the Missing and Murdered Native Hawaiian Women, Girls and Mahu state task force.
Native communities, including Native Hawaiians, have endured long-term, intergenerational traumas during colonization and forced assimilation that can’t be ignored when targeting the disproportionate rates of violence, Cristobal said.
“It’s the undercurrent,” Cristobal said. “It’s the precursor.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-31 22:17:53+00:00,Mississippi Today,"JXN Water to move forward with rate increase, report says",Alex Rozier,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/31/jxn-water-to-move-forward-with-rate-increase-report-says/,The water rate increase Ted Henifin requested  this spring for Jackson customers may go forward..,"JXN Water, the third-party manager of Jackson’s water and wastewater systems, said in a quarterly report filed Friday that it will move forward with a rate increase on water bills it first requested this spring. The increase will go into effect by Dec. 15, the report said. 
The rate increase, on average, would raise Jacksonians’ monthly bills — which also include costs for sewer and sanitation — by 12%, the utility said. 
Ted Henifin, who heads the utility, has reiterated JXN Water is rapidly losing money because of inadequate revenue. In September, the utility said it was “currently insolvent.” 
Henifin could not be reached Friday to confirm the utility’s plans to raise rates. JXN Water communications officer Aisha Carson said the report does not serve as an official notice of a rate increase. The quarterly update said JXN Water will issue an official notice to customers by Nov. 15.
Both Jackson’s mayor and city council have spoken out against the proposal, arguing it’s unfair to ask more from those who are contributing while about 30% of customers aren’t paying their bills. The city council voted in April against the increase, and Mayor John Horhn reaffirmed his position last week during a meeting with state lawmakers.
But under a federal court’s stipulated order that outlines the scope of Henifin’s powers and responsibilities, the court allows the utility to proceed with a rate increase without the city’s approval and as long as more than a year has passed since the last rate hike. JXN Water first increased rates in February 2024.
U.S. District Court Judge Henry Wingate, who appointed Henifin to his role in 2022, said during hearings this summer the utility should explore all other avenues for funding, including collections from apartment complexes with large debts, before raising rates. Over the last year, JXN Water has pressured apartment complexes to pay their debts leading to shutoffs and ongoing lawsuits. It’s been months, though, since Wingate has last discussed the proposal, and it’s unclear if he plans to address the matter anytime soon.
Henifin’s frustration with the judge’s stance came out during a July hearing where the utility manager threatened to quit, although he walked back the statement soon after. 
In response to Wingate and city officials, Henifin maintained that even if all customers paid their bill at the current rates, JXN Water would still lose money. The utility estimated in September that it was losing $3 million a month.
The quarterly update also addressed $54 million the utility asked Congress to reallocate for operating funds. The money was originally part of $450 million in federal funding set aside for larger projects. 
While the money was held up as part of the ongoing federal government shutdown, JXN Water said it expected Congress to pass the funding bill “in the coming days,” and that the Environmental Protection Agency would issue the money to the utility in a new grant. But, the report added, the utility wouldn’t be able to access the $54 million until early 2026.

Ron DeSantis to step in to provide food aid being lost due to the government shutdown, hailed a pair of  federal court rulings late Friday that may allow the aid to flow again. 
But, they also warned it wasn’t enough to ensure food security for the nearly 3 million state residents who rely on the program.
A federal judge in Boston ruled Friday that the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s plan to pause a food assistance program for nearly 42 million people was illegal — but gave the Trump administration until Monday to respond to her finding before she decides on a motion to force the benefits be paid despite the ongoing government shutdown.
At nearly the same time Friday, a Rhode Island federal judge in a similar case brought by cities and nonprofit groups ordered the United States Department of Agriculture to continue payments and granted a request for a temporary restraining order.
Speaking on a Zoom conference call organized by the group Sabotaging Our Safety, state Sen. Shevrin Jones, D-Miami Gardens, said he was grateful for the judicial intervention but he cautioned that it was “only a temporary fix.”

 “We’re talking about a fund that could run dry in what, less than a month? Then that’s not stability, that’s survival,” he said. 
The USDA last week posted a notice saying SNAP benefits would expire Nov. 1 and put the blame on Democrats for not agreeing to pass a continuing resolution to keep the government funded. 
Democrats are against passing a funding plan that doesn’t extend the enhanced premium tax credits that lower the costs of so-called Obamacare plans purchased through the federal health exchange (healthcare.gov).
The partisan impasse has resulted in a month-long government shutdown.
“The best way for SNAP to continue is for the shutdown to end. If not for Congressional Democrats blocking government funding, November SNAP benefits would be paid on-time,” the USDA notice, first reported by Axios, notes.
SNAP has about $6 billion in contingency funds; $9 billion is needed to cover the costs of the program through November. But the federal memo says that SNAP contingency funds cannot be used to float the program during the shutdown.
The federal judges authoring Friday’s court orders disagreed with the USDA’s argument that contingency funds couldn’t be used.
SNAP provides nutritional support for low-income seniors, people with disabilities living on fixed incomes, and other individuals and families with low incomes. Florida has the fourth largest SNAP enrollment nationwide with 2.94 million relying on the assistance for their food security, behind California, Texas, and New York.

Nationwide, 41.7 million people rely on SNAP benefits, August 2025 data show.
“I know they want this plane to come in for a landing, but let’s be clear,” Jones continued. “Right now, the White House, the House, the Senate and the courts are run by the Republican Party. They have the power – right now – to ensure that millions of Floridians – not only don’t go hungry, but they do not lose their health care. And the fact right now that Democrats are holding the line right now, for the fact to ensure that we don’t have a nation of sick people, I will continue to push the line that the federal government should do what’s right and feed the American people and stop bargaining with people’s lives.”
“Cruelty is the point”
State Rep. Angie Nixon, D-Jacksonville,  joined Jones on the Zoom call and said she was “happy and grateful” with the court rulings.  But she worries that the administration will appeal the rulings.
“Because at this point, cruelty is the point, right?” she said.

Florida legislative Democrats sent DeSantis a letter earlier this week calling on him to declare a state of emergency over the impending loss of SNAP benefits and dip into the state’s “rainy day” fund to help cover the costs of the program. They also asked DeSantis to direct the Department of Children and Families to work to distribute food to local food banks and their partners.
Legislative Democrats urge DeSantis to declare emergency, fill food pantries

DeSantis dismissed that request a day later.
“Did those Democrats write a letter to Chuck Schumer asking him to stop filibustering the spending?” DeSantis responded at a Tampa press conference on Wednesday. “Come on.”
Meanwhile, Florida’s congressional Democrats also hailed the Friday rulings
U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a Democrat from Miami Gardens, called the ruling “good news and shows Republicans chose to illegally stop SNAP benefits this November.”
“The USDA must follow the court order and keep families fed. Now, Congress needs to come back to work, end the shutdown and save healthcare,” Wilson continued. 
U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost, an Orlando Democrat, posted in part “Mr. President, the cruelty stops here. Food for our people should never be a political bargaining chip,” in responding to the ruling. 

Trump chose not to use emergency funds to feed over 40 million Americans. A federal judge just ruled that it’s against the law.

Oct. 31, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceAround 50 individuals gathered in Portage, Mich. Friday afternoon, donning costumes and bearing treats, protest signs and handouts in opposition to the Palisades nuclear plant restart. 
Organized by a pair of anti-nuclear organizations, the “Zombies Against Palisades” protest aimed to call attention to several concerns as energy systems supplier Holtec International works to resurrect a previously defunct nuclear plant in Covert Township.
However the protest, located outside of Rep. Bill Huizenga’s (R-Holland Township) Portage office, also drew plenty of protestors in opposition to Republican policies and President Donald Trump’s administration. 
Speaking with the Michigan Advance at the first of two planned demonstrations, Kevin Kamps a radioactive waste watchdog for the anti-nuclear energy advocacy group Beyond Nuclear noted that the site was chosen both due to Huizenga’s support for reviving the plant and its location within the 50-mile emergency planning zone established to keep people and animals from eating contaminated food in the event of an emergency at Palisades.
While there are multiple paths to a potential meltdown at the plant, Kamps pointed to the plant’s steam generator tubes as one area of concern.

“They neglected to do safety maintenance for two years 2022 to 2024 making an already bad problem tremendously worse,” Kamps said, warning that if one tube blows, it will lead to a radiation release, while damage to enough of the tubes would result in a nuclear meltdown. 
An October 2024 report from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission found that 701 tubes in one steam generator and 248 in another were candidates for plugging or repairs, noting that the amount of tubes with stress corrosion cracking far exceeded previous estimates.
Nick Culp, Holtec’s senior manager of government affairs and communications, told the Advance that repairs on the steam generator tubes were successfully completed this summer. 
“Both the sleeving on the Steam Generator primary side system and cleaning on the secondary side will help ensure the system’s continued safe and reliable operation,” Culp said in an email. 
While Culp said the plant is undergoing “rigorous inspections, testing, maintenance, repairs, and upgrades” in preparation for its return to operation, Beyond Nuclear and other anti-nuclear groups have challenged the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s decision to approve the steam generator repair plan. 
Michael Keegan, the chair of Don’t Waste Michigan, which was formed in opposition to a nuclear waste disposal within the state, noted Palisades had also recently exceeded its allotted limit for releasing hydrazine into Lake Michigan. Hydrazine is a highly toxic chemical and expected carcinogen, which Palisades uses in its steam generators.

In a notice to the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, Palisades noted that the release occurred during a scheduled cleaning of the steam generators. It also listed several changes in its cleaning process to prevent future releases.
Josef Greenberg, a public information officer for EGLE, said the Department has reviewed the incident report filed by the facility and will be requesting additional information related to the incident and report. If there is a need for any additional corrective actions, EGLE will make that determination after reviewing all data and responses submitted by the facility. 
Although Culp said the release brought no risk to the health and safety of Palisades’ employees, the community or the environment, Kamps retained concerns about the plant’s impact on the community’s health. 
“Lake Michigan is drinking water for shoreline communities. Yes, [radiation and toxic chemicals] may dilute as it expands out into the lake, but the South Haven drinking water intake is four miles away,” Kamps said, citing high rates of thyroid cancer amongst residents living in nearby communities.
Nancy Falk, a Kalamazoo resident and former Western Michigan University professor was among the costumed protestors speaking out against the Trump Administration. 
When asked what concerns were at the top of her mind, Falk said “For heaven’s sakes, everything.”
“Look, I’m 87 years old. I’m on Medicaid. I’m on Medicare,” Falk said. “I have a daughter, recently divorced, who is going to have to get new health insurance. So that’s a concern. I have another daughter whose job is disintegrating, who has a disabled husband and two daughters in college and one to go, so there are many, many very immediate concerns besides the long range one.”
A former comparative religions scholar, Falk also had concerns about the president’s approach to foreign policy. 
“Trump seems very good at turning on the United States friends while cuddling up to the United States long-term, if not enemies, maybe rivals,” Falk said. 
When comparing Trump to other presidencies she had lived through, Falk said “Trump is the pits.” 
“I thought Nixon was bad. Trump is much worse. Nixon, at least, I think, knew when his time was up,” Falk said.

(Bill Lucia/Washington State Stadard)The first item on every Washington voter’s ballot is a proposal to add a few lines to the state constitution that would change how billions of taxpayer dollars are managed.
Senate Joint Resolution 8201 seeks to let the state make stock market investments with payroll taxes collected for its long-term care program, known as WA Cares. Any earnings would have to be used solely for the program’s beneficiaries.
If approved Tuesday, the Washington State Investment Board would be legally able to handle the program’s assets in a similar manner as it does pension and retirement funds. 
This will allow for the tax dollars to be invested in a “safe and risk averse way” while producing greater returns for the program, said Heather Weiner of the Approve 8201 campaign in a recent debate at the University of Washington.
She said that since 1992, annual returns for Washington’s pension funds have averaged 8.9%, which is several percentage points higher than investments in government bonds. In the long run that would translate to a lot more dollars for the program.
“This doesn’t mean day trading, taking big risks on a stock market,” she said. “This means smart long-term [investing] so that in 50 years when people in this audience today will need long term care, that fund will be there for you.”
State Sen. Bob Hasegawa, D-Tukwila, opposes the measure.
“Our fiduciary responsibility is to the people,” he told the debate audience. “No one is going to know when the economy or stock market crashes. So, this vote is about whether we keep prudent fiscal management policies of our tax dollars and retain those constitutional protections.”
The Legislature voted earlier this year to put the constitutional amendment on the ballot. It passed by margins of 86-9 in the House and 42-7 in the Senate and will become law if more than 50% of voters approve it on Tuesday.
WA Cares, created by a 2019 law, is funded with a 0.58% tax on the paychecks of most workers in Washington. Beginning in July 2026, those who qualify can begin accessing the benefit, a lifetime amount of $36,500 — a sum that is set to rise in future years to account for inflation. A pilot program will start in January in a handful of counties.
Collections of the payroll tax began in mid-2023 and more than $2.5 billion was banked in the Long Term Services and Supports Trust Account as of summer.
The state constitution generally bars investing public money in the stock of private companies. That means state and local governments are limited to fixed-income securities like government bonds, treasury bills and certificates of deposit that are less risky but typically deliver lower rates of return. The WA Cares account is now subject to this limitation.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
If the constitutional amendment is approved, the long-term service account would be added to the list of funds exempt from that prohibition alongside the state’s pension and retirement funds. The state investment board could then decide if it wants to invest in private equity funds and buy stock of private companies, or not.
In 2020, voters defeated a similar measure. It passed in only three Washington counties — King, Jefferson and Whatcom.
Weiner said this year’s proposal, unlike the one in 2020, mandates money made from investments must go into the WA Cares Fund. The intent is to prevent lawmakers from tapping those dollars for other budget needs.
Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson and Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia, back the ballot measure. So too do the Washington State Nurses Association, Washington State Council of Fire Fighters, AARP, and Washington Health Care Association.
Service Employees International Union 775 is underwriting the campaign. The union, which represents 55,000 long-term care workers in Washington, Montana and Alaska, had reported raising and spending $2.5 million as of Friday. That is five times more than it spent in a losing effort in 2020.
Hasegawa said there is no funded opposition campaign, just like the last ballot fight. He and three Republican state lawmakers penned the voters’ pamphlet statement opposing the measure.

Cecil Brockman submitted notice of his resignation.
Brockman, 41, was arrested and charged October 8 with multiple felony sex offenses with a minor.
Calls for his resignation came quickly from his own Democratic party as well as Republicans. But Brockman, who was initially hospitalized and is now jailed on a $1.05 million bond, has not publicly commented on the charges.
Late Friday afternoon, Republican N.C. House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) announced the formation of a bipartisan “House Select Committee to Investigate Alleged Misconduct and Other Matters Included in Charges Against Representative Cecil Brockman.”
A little over an hour later, House Democratic leader Robert Reives (D-Chatham) announced that Brockman had resigned. Reives lauded the move, which will help shore up Democratic defenses against a veto override in that chamber.
“The allegations against him are serious and made it impossible for him to adequately represent his constituents,” Reives said in a news release.
It’s now up to the Guilford Co. Democratic Party to name a successor to the seat.
Hall said Friday that Brockman’s decision to resign “is the right thing to do for his constituents and for the North Carolina House of Representatives.”

The executive order allows Wyoming’s governor to send emergency funds to charitable organizations, churches. 
The post Gordon declares public welfare emergency in light of SNAP lapse, OK’s $10 million in aid appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon declared a public welfare emergency Friday ahead of SNAP benefits lapsing Saturday amid the federal government shutdown. 
“When people can’t eat, and we’ve got dozens of people being turned away at food banks, and trying to find ways to feed themselves, I would qualify that as an emergency,” Gordon said during a press conference. 
Over 26,000 residents rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to buy groceries. But while the federal government is closed, the program will go unfunded, leaving thousands of Wyomingites, mostly children, at risk. 
The executive order issued Friday enables the governor’s office to send discretionary emergency funds to charitable organizations and churches to provide food via food banks and pantries. 
State law grants the governor the authority to spend up to $10 million from the legislative stabilization reserve account, also known as the rainy day fund, in the event of a public welfare emergency. 
SNAP benefits are distributed by the Wyoming Department of Family Services on a monthly basis to a reloadable EBT card, which functions like a debit card, for buying eligible food items. 
The state, however, is unable to move emergency funds to those cards “because we do not have a direct agreement with our provider who does the EBT transfers,” DFS Director Korin Schmidt told reporters. 
“So in the absence of that, we had to come up with a different methodology, which is to distribute the food or distribute dollars to food pantries, food banks so that they can purchase and provide food directly to our neighbors,” she said. 
As outlined in the executive order, DFS will provide grant agreements to those organizations “receiving funds and direct that they use reasonable efforts to purchase nutritional, healthy food with the distributed funds.” 
Gordon said officials anticipate spending about $1.4 million a week. 
“And may I add, this is not intended to supplant the excellent work that’s already being done by volunteers, churches and others all around the state,” Gordon said. “This is an adjunct to it, and we are trying to work as closely as we can to make sure that the needs are met.”
Meanwhile, Gordon signed an additional executive order Friday aligned with President Donald Trump’s “Make America Healthy Again” executive order, which directs DFS to begin the process of submitting a waiver request to further restrict what can be purchased with SNAP dollars. It targets foods such as candy and soda.
Earlier this month, the Wyoming Legislature’s Joint Labor, Health and Social Services Committee voted to adopt similar legislation. That measure must still pass the full Legislature, which convenes in February.

Tony Evers | Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin ExaminerGov. Tony Evers signed a bill Friday that will limit cell phones in schools, making Wisconsin the 36th state in the nation to do so, and a bill that will make it easier for candidates for office to remove themselves from ballots. 
A Wisconsin Policy Forum report from May found that most school districts already restrict student cellphone usage to common areas, though policies vary widely across the state.  
Under the new law, 2025 Wisconsin Act 42, school districts will have until July 2026 to implement a policy that bans cellphones during instructional times. The policy will need to include exceptions for emergencies, for educational purposes and cases involving student health care, individualized education plans (IEPs) or 504 plans (learning environment accommodations).
Evers said in a statement that the decision about whether to sign the bill weighed heavily on him, especially given his belief that “decisions like this should be made at the local level by local school districts”. However, he said he is “deeply concerned” about how cell phone and social media use are affecting students, including their mental health, school outcomes and social skills. 
“Our kids are struggling today, perhaps now more than ever. It’s really tough to be a kid these days, and we know that cellphones can be a major distraction from learning, a source of bullying, and a barrier to our kids’ important work of just being a kid,” Evers said in a statement. “While I wish the Legislature would have taken a different approach with this legislation, I will never stop fighting for Wisconsin’s kids and working to do what’s best for them, which is why I am signing this bill into law today.”
Evers also pointed to widespread support for cellphone ban policies in his statement. 
Pew Research recently found that 74% of U.S. adults support banning middle and high school students from using cellphones during class — an increase from 68% last fall. A Marquette Law School poll found that 89% of voters support banning cellphones during class periods. 
Evers also takes action on 19 other bills
Evers also signed Assembly Bill 35, now 2025 Wisconsin Act 43, to make it easier for candidates to withdraw themselves from a ballot. 
Under the law, candidates for office in Wisconsin will be able to withdraw their candidacy in a general or primary election and not be included on the ballot if they file a sworn statement. 
The change to Wisconsin law was proposed after Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was not allowed to remove himself from the presidential ballot in 2024 after he dropped out and endorsed President Donald Trump. State law then said that candidates could only have their names removed if they were dead. 
The new law will allow candidates to remove themselves, but they’ll be responsible for paying the Wisconsin Elections Commission a $1,000 fee. Non-statewide candidates will need to pay $250. 
Under the law, a person could face a Class G felony with a maximum penalty of up to $25,000 and imprisonment for up to 10 years if they intentionally filed a false statement withdrawing a person’s candidacy. 
Evers also signed Senate Bill 309, now 2025 Wisconsin Act 41, which clarifies statute to say that 911 call centers and dispatchers who transfer a caller to the national 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline are generally immune from civil liability for any outcomes resulting from the transfer. 
“Our 911 dispatchers play a vital role in the safety and security of our state, but they often don’t have the time or resources available to provide the response necessary for somebody experiencing a mental health crisis,” Evers said. “By offering much-needed protection to 911 dispatchers who transfer calls to the 988 Lifeline, this bill allows for a better and safer crisis response by ensuring crisis calls go to the service providers who are trained to provide appropriate care and resources to those who need it most.”
The law specifies that the immunity doesn’t apply if an injury is the result of an act or omission that constitutes gross negligence or willful misconduct by the dispatcher. 
Another bill signed by Evers, now 2025 Wisconsin Act 46, seeks to address the reckless driving issue in Wisconsin by allowing local governments to implement ordinances that will allow officers to immediately impound a vehicle used to drive recklessly and retain the vehicle until all outstanding fees, fines and forfeitures are paid.
Evers said in a statement that the law will “hold bad actors accountable” and help keep roads and communities safe.
“Whether it’s distracted driving, speeding, or erratic and aggressive behaviors, reckless driving puts our kids, families, and communities in harm’s way,” Evers said. “Tackling reckless driving has been a bipartisan goal in recent years, and I’m glad to see this trend has continued this session.” 
Evers also vetoed several bills. 

AB 5, which would have required school districts respond to material inspections requests within 14 days
AB 39, which would have required state employees to work in person for 80% of their week, 
A handful of bills — AB 162, AB 168 and AB 169 — that would have made changes to unemployment and workforce development programs. 
SB 25, which would have prohibited a court from allowing a complaint to be filed in a John Doe proceeding against a police officer who is involved in a shooting if the district attorney determines there is no basis to prosecute the officer. 
SB 184, which would have barred local governments from implementing restrictions on a cars and vehicles based on its energy source

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma officials said late Friday that a vote will be held Monday to give $1 million per week to Oklahoma’s food banks during the federal government shutdown, a fraction of what is needed.
Two federal judges ordered Friday that the Trump administration must continue providing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, also known as food stamps. The benefits are set to be cut off nationwide Saturday because of the federal government shutdown, affecting over 680,000 Oklahomans. 
Gov. Kevin Stitt, House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow and Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, said in a joint statement that the funding will be provided from the state emergency fund, which is currently at $7.8 million, for up to seven weeks and will prioritize support for the most vulnerable SNAP recipients. The plan is contingent on a lack of federal funding for SNAP during the shutdown, according to a news release. 
It was not immediately clear Friday how this plan would be affected by the orders from federal judges or how the funding would be divided between Oklahoma’s food banks. 
The vote will be held 5 p.m. Monday at a Contingency Review Board meeting. Stitt, Hilbert and Paxton are the only voting members on the board. 
The federal government has been shut down since Oct. 1 because Congress has failed to find a bipartisan path forward on a stopgap spending bill by the start of the federal fiscal year. A Republican proposal seeks to temporarily keep the government open through Nov. 21. Democrats back a separate plan to permanently restore health subsidies for those who buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.
“This targeted emergency support, alongside the tireless work of our local food banks, will provide weekly food provisions to elderly, disabled, and child SNAP recipients across our 77 counties during periods in which SNAP federal funding is unavailable,” Stitt, Hilbert and Paxton said in the joint statement. “We encourage every business and nonprofit in the state to join us and be a neighbor to those in need during this time of uncertainty.
They asked Oklahoma’s businesses and nonprofits to contribute to food banks either financially or through lending their workforce. 
House and Senate Democrats and members of the legislative Black caucus on Friday morning called for a special session to use Oklahoma’s savings to fund SNAP during the shutdown. Oklahoma’s “rainy day fund” currently sits at more than $1.3 billion, but its uses are limited by state law. 
Stacy Dykstra, CEO of the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma, which serves 53 counties in central and western Oklahoma, said it will cost the group $5.5 million per month to double its efforts. It will also cost the Food Bank of Eastern Oklahoma, which serves the rest of the state, the same amount to double their efforts. 
She said on Wednesday that food banks only provide one meal for every nine that SNAP provides. 
SNAP costs over $100 million per month in Oklahoma, according to a lawmaker. 
“Funding from the State of Oklahoma is extremely helpful as the Regional Food Bank for Oklahoma works to be as deliberate as possible to find every food resource we can and distribute it to our network in an intentional manner,” Dykstra said in a statement. “This amount represents only a fraction of what will be required; however, it will provide critical support allowing us to begin getting meals to the most vulnerable Oklahomans.” 
Jeff Marlow, president and CEO of the Food Bank of Eastern Oklahoma, said in a statement that while the funding will help reach some Oklahomans affected by the freeze in SNAP funding, a long-term solution will require immediate federal action to restore full support for the food assistance program.

As gridlock in Congress continues over the end of expanded health insurance subsidies, thousands of Vermonters will begin to confront an impossible choice about what to do in 2026: pay more or go without health insurance.

When the window to buy 2026 plans on Vermont Health Connect opens on Saturday, nearly 30,000 Vermonters will face what for many is an impossible choice: pay double or triple what they have been paying for their health insurance or go without.
Meanwhile, the federal government remains shuttered and Congress is gridlocked over extending the current subsidies that have made this insurance more accessible.
For Allison Mindel and her family, there is no real choice.

Since February, her 17-year-old son, Lei DeGroot, has been in intensive treatment at University of Vermont Medical Center for acute myeloid leukemia.
AML is a brutal cancer. It requires rounds of intense chemotherapy. It starts in the bone marrow and moves to the blood, which gives the cancerous cells a highway to spread throughout the body. 
Over the past seven months, Lei has spent a total of 174 days in the hospital. Mindel and her husband Matthew DeGroot split up the weeks, dividing time between their home in Worcester and UVM Medical Center’s inpatient rooms. In total, Lei has gone through five rounds of treatment,  cycling through one week of the system-blasting therapy, followed by three to four weeks of recovery, his immune system made raw and vulnerable to infection.
Two weeks ago, Lei was officially declared cancer-free. Last week, his central line for treatment was removed. The next day, he was able to go back to school in person.
On Friday, Mindel, her husband, and two of their children joined Sen. Peter Welch, Vermont hospital leaders and other families hit by the high cost of care in a press conference to advocate for the extension of the federal subsidies.
Mindel estimates that her son’s care cost between $1.5 million and $2 million. With the insurance her family of five has bought from Vermont Health Connect, she estimates they will end up paying $19,192 for the year: the $1,066 monthly premium for their top-tier MVP Gold plan, plus the $6,400 maximum deductible.
“When you’re [in the hospital] you see all the other people with all the other stories, and you realize, we are so grateful that we didn’t have to worry about our insurance coverage, and that it covered things.” Mindel told VTDigger. “There were so many other kinds of nightmare scenarios to worry about.”
Now, she is confronting a new nightmare as she weighs the costs of next year’s insurance. This coming year, without the enhanced subsidies for marketplace health insurance, the premium for the same MVP Gold plan will cost $3,386.47 a month — an annual total over $40,600.

Mindell runs her own consulting business, and her husband had worked for a small lobbying firm that didn’t provide its employees with insurance before he was laid off in July. He’s seeking a new job, but they are not optimistic he will find one that offers insurance for a full family anytime soon.
They can’t imagine going without health insurance. Her son will continue to need monthly blood tests and followup appointments, bone marrow biopsies, and expensive prescription drugs to manage and monitor his health.
“The care and the expenses don’t end,” Mindel said. 
Expanding affordability
The tax credits that made Mindel’s insurance — and the care it paid for it—affordable have only been available for a few years. They are on track to sunset soon, on Dec. 31, 2025. 
The 2010 Affordable Care Act, or ACA, laid the regulatory foundation for Vermont Health Connect, as well as the special marketplaces created by other states and the federal government for people to buy commercial insurance. The law also put in place a system of tax credits that have subsidized purchasing insurance plans for households making between 138% and 400% of the federal poverty level. (Anyone below that income level is eligible for Vermont’s Medicaid insurance program). 
In 2021, the American Rescue Plan expanded those tax credits, making ACA marketplace insurance plans newly affordable for millions of Americans, including thousands of Vermonters.
These “enhanced tax credits” became available to households earning more than 400% of the federal poverty line. The law capped the cost of premiums purchased by individuals and families on the marketplaces at 8.5% of a household’s income. Subsidies were also increased for many individuals already receiving credits, making health insurance premiums very low cost, or effectively free, for those households at the lowest income levels. 
In 2015, soon after Vermont Health Connect opened, 22,500 people on the marketplace received tax credits, according to an analysis by the Montpelier-based research group Public Assets Institute. Today, with the enhanced credits, that number is closer to 27,000. The amount each recipient receives in credits has jumped significantly in that decade as well: in 2015 a Vermonter’s average credit was $3,300. Today, that’s $11,400 in support, the Public Assets Institute found.
Without these expanded subsidies in the future, households will experience steeper costs in two different ways. Households making more than 400% of the federal poverty line will lose the subsidies entirely, and those under that income threshold, who will still receive subsidies, will see the amount of assistance shrink. 
Nationally, subsidized enrollees on the marketplace are seeing an average increase in their monthly premiums of about 114%, estimates the health news outlet KFF. 
In Vermont, the increase is even more stark. Because Vermont has some of the highest insurance premiums in the country, the state stands out as one of the states in the country poised to lose some of the most federal assistance — nearly $65 million, a 2024 report to the legislature found. Premiums for some families could increase nearly 300%. 
Vermont’s Health Care Advocate Mike Fisher outlined some examples of just what this means for families in the state during a mid-October legislative committee meeting. 
He said a family of three, for instance, earning $86,000 a year — 323% above the federal poverty level, would have paid $121 with the enhanced tax credits in 2025 for a standard Gold Plan through MVP and $330 for one from Blue Cross Blue Shield VT. This coming year, those same plans will cost $291 or $856, respectively.
Or, consider Cameron Chapman, a freelance writer and editor in Hardwick. 
In 2025, Chapman paid a little less than $500 a month for a Gold Plan through MVP, she told VTDigger. Next year, without the subsidies, the cost will increase to $1,135 a month for the same plan — more than she pays each month for housing.
Chapman is not planning on purchasing insurance at all next year and instead intends to put money aside each month and “keep (her) fingers crossed,” she said.  
At 41, she knows it’s a gamble, but one, for now, she is going to take. She plans to stop smoking this winter, eat more vegetables and get more exercise in an effort to keep her own healthcare costs down.
Her most expensive health care year, she says, was in 2022, when she was in and out of doctors’ offices trying to get a diagnosis for an ongoing issue. After 28 visits and nearly nine months of diagnostics, she estimates her care would have cost between $18,000 and $20,000 if she needed to pay out of pocket. That’s the same amount, she calculates, as what she would need to pay in 2026, counting $13,620 a year just in monthly insurance premiums, plus the plans’ $5,000 deductible. 
“I think for me, the biggest piece is not paying out money that I’m never going to see,” Chapman said. “I might as well take the money that I’ve been paying, put it into savings every month.”

‘A death spiral’
Insurers and policymakers expect that thousands of Vermonts will follow Chapman in her choice to forgo health insurance altogether. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont has estimated that 3,017 members will drop their marketplace plans, while MVP (which operates in Vermont and New York state) estimates it will lose 22,052 members with the end of the enhanced tax credits.
That kind of shift not only hurts the individuals who go without insurance, but it impacts everyone else in the insurance pool, Fisher, the state consumer advocate, explained to VTDigger. The people who remain insured are generally those who cannot do without insurance and are less willing to take the gamble— individuals like Alison Mindel and her family.
“Health insurance is about spreading risk; it’s about all of us [being] in the same boat and only by all of us being in the same boat, that those of us who have real health care needs have a fighting chance of paying for it,” Fisher said. 
When fewer healthy people buy health insurance, insurers have to raise premiums to cover the costs of those remaining in the insurance pool. That’s because healthy people, generally, require less care and pay more money to the insurer than the insurer pays out for their health care. When insurers raise prices, more healthy people drop out. Policymakers literally call this a “death spiral.”
So, in addition to the loss of the expanded subsidies, people who buy their insurance on the marketplace are facing higher premiums that aim to accommodate this downward trend in enrollment. Nationwide, KFF, the health news outlet, calculates that —tax credits aside — the true cost of premiums across the country is increasing 26% in 2026.
In Vermont, for individuals and families, Blue Cross Blue Shield of VT plans will increase by 9.6%, while MVP’s will go up only 1.3%. Both increases are far less than what both insurers had initially requested from the state’s health care regulator. The difference in that increase is part of why MVP plans cost so much less than those from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont, which has struggled with solvency, on Vermont Health Connect.
When people lose or forgo insurance, hospitals suffer too, Owen Foster, the chair of the Green Mountain Care Board, told lawmakers at the mid-October meeting. People will still face healthcare emergencies regardless of whether or not they have insurance. When they do, they show up in a hospital’s emergency room. When hospitals provide care to these patients, most cannot afford the entirety of an out-of-pocket bill. So, when patients they treat don’t have insurance, hospitals are more likely to not receive payment at all. 
For Vermont’s already precarious hospitals, the loss of that revenue could be catastrophic. UVM Health, though a network of some of the state’s healthiest hospitals when it comes to revenue and cash reserves, could stand to lose up to $80 million in revenue with the end of these subsidies, estimated interim CEO Steve Leffler during Friday’s press conference with Sen. Welch.
“It’s a difficult cycle that we’re really hoping to avoid,” said Addie Strumolo, the deputy commissioner of the Department of Vermont Health Access, which oversees Vermont Health Connect. “But, that is a real concern when you have affordability challenges, like the ones we’re anticipating for open enrollment, or other obstacles to being able to remain in coverage.”

Enrolling in a precarious marketplace
Strumolo’s team is trying to help people navigate this steep change in affordability ahead of, and during, the open enrollment period on Vermont’s marketplace.
Open enrollment runs, as it does every year, from Nov. 1 through Jan 15. But to secure coverage that begins on Jan. 1, 2026, individuals need to buy their plans by Dec. 15. 
Congress may approve a measure before the end of the year to extend the enhanced tax credits for 2026 health insurance plans. Strumolo said her department is ready to act quickly to get those credits to people who have already signed up for plans.
The federal government may also enact those measures later in 2026. If that happens, the state has the power to authorize a special enrollment period, she said. 
For now, the department has a plan comparison tool up and running. The interactive webpage allows people to see what the costs of various plans will be in 2026, incorporating whatever subsidies they may still be eligible to receive. 
“We think it’s really important for people to have coverage,” she said, even if that coverage is at a lower coverage tier “and so I think just knowing that there are options (is important).”
Fisher similarly encourages people to explore their options and shop around for one that fits their budgets. “It’s good for Vermont and good for Vermonters to have coverage, and I am afraid that many Vermonters are in plans they can’t afford,” he said. 
“I worry that many Vermonters will be forced into an economic choice or financing choice when we really want them to be making a healthcare access choice,” he said.
Alison Mindel is going into 2026 making a healthcare choice for her family, and hoping the financial details work out somehow. Knowing that the ongoing care for her son is going to continue to be costly, she and her husband intend to keep buying the Gold MVP plan, just without the enhanced premium tax credits. It will cost more than their mortgage.
“I don’t know how we’re going to manage paying for this going forward,” she said. “But, at the same time, I didn’t know how we were going to get through the past year either.”

A Rhode Island federal judge ruled Friday that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) must use available contingency funds to cover food stamp funding while the lingering government shutdown leaves the program unsubsidized.
The federal government needs to submit a report by noon on Monday to the court, and explain how it will at least partially fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), colloquially known as food stamps, for the month of November. The agency must tap into $6 billion worth of contingency funding. 
“There is no doubt, and it is beyond argument, that irreparable harm will begin to occur, if it hasn’t already occurred in the terror it has caused some people about the availability of funding for food for their family,” Chief Judge John J. McConnell, Jr. said during a Friday hearing held over Zoom and livestreamed by the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island.   
USDA also needs to explain if it will additionally cover the benefits by using Section 32 funding — an appropriated but flexible USDA fund created in 1935 that has been used to keep another food security program — the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) — afloat during the shutdown. The fund had over $23 billion in it as of Oct. 8, according to court documents.  
“It’s clear that when compared to the millions of people that will go without funds for food, versus the agency’s desire not to use contingency funds in case there’s a hurricane need — the balances of those equities clearly goes on the side of ensuring that people are fed,” McConnell said. 
A need for haste prompted the virtual hearing Friday for the case, which was filed in the court by a 20-plaintiff coalition led by the Rhode Island State Council of Churches. 
“Its unusual in a [temporary restraining order] that we do hearings publicly,” McConnell said, but added that the expected shutoff of food stamps on Saturday gave a valid reason for broadcasting a hearing that would normally happen behind closed doors.    
The named plaintiffs include the cities of Providence, Central Falls, Central Falls, Pawtucket, plus national groups and cities such as Baltimore; Columbus, Ohio; Durham, North Carolina; New Haven, Connecticut; and Albuquerque, New Mexico. The East Bay Community Action Program, United Way Of Rhode Island, and Amos House, are also plaintiffs. The legal team for the plaintiffs included attorneys from DeLuca, Weizenbaum, Barry & Revens in Providence and Democracy Forward, a national group.

This just in from Boston
McConnell’s ruling came almost simultaneously with a similar outcome in a case in Massachusetts’ federal court. Near the end of the approximately hourlong virtual hearing, McConnell interrupted his own comments to remark that Judge Indira Talwani had just ruled on a case brought earlier this week by a coalition of states’ attorneys general, which also sought to reinstate SNAP funding, which is set to expire Saturday, Nov. 1, as it has not been allocated any emergency funding during the shutdown.  
Trump administration blocked from cutting off SNAP benefits as two judges issue orders

“I’m sure you’re all anxious to read Judge Talwani’s opinion,” McConnell said before he granted his own temporary restraining order on the government agency’s actions.
Like McConnell, Talwani ruled that the agency must submit by Monday whether it “will authorize at least reduced SNAP benefits for November.” If so, the USDA also needs to submit a timeline for its plan, and whether the SNAP money will come from contingency funds or other sources.  
McConnell said he was already familiar with the Massachusetts case assigned to Talwani. So, at the beginning of the hearing, he first gave the floor to Counsel to the Assistant Attorney General Tyler Becker, who represented the feds. A representative for the USDA attended part of the hearing but did not speak during her time on camera.
Becker argued for the nonexistence of SNAP without funding. That which is unfunded cannot exist, Becker proposed, because SNAP’s funding is what constitutes the program — therefore, a nonexistent program cannot receive contingency funding. 
“The government may not provide those benefits because there is not a funding allocation, an appropriation for those benefits, as a result of the current shutdown in the government,” Becker said. “It would be an extreme remedy at this point to force SNAP, the government, to rely on a contingency fund.”
“Those are to maintain program operations when there is a program,” Becker said. “There is no program.”
The argument did not persuade McConnell, who pointed out that a government shutdown does not automatically make a program defunct. This narrative has played out before during previous shutdowns, the judge recounted, and to different results.   
“SNAP benefits have never, until now, been terminated,” McConnell said. “The United States has, in fact, admitted that the contingency funds are appropriately used during a shutdown, and that occurred in 2019.”
Like the vast majority of cases involving President Donald Trump’s funding mandates, there was much talk of the “arbitrary and capricious” from both parties — the legal labels frequently invoked in anti-Trump litigation to indicate the administration’s non-specfiic or wide-ranging rationale for its funding directives. The plaintiffs’ legal team further argued that the federal government, in rejecting the use of contingency funding to keep SNAP afloat, ignored the very purpose for which those contingency funds had been created. 
Michael Torcello, a senior staff attorney with Democracy Forward, said the statute which authorizes SNAP includes “mandatory language that Congress uses when it intends to create a duty.”
“Congress foresaw that there might be an emergency, and it designated specific funds to be used in that situation,” Torcello said. “So I think that completely undermines the government’s position that there’s no funds at all that we could use. I think Congress very, very clearly and very directly contemplated that when there is a contingency or an emergency, ‘Here’s $6 billion that is to be used for this vital program.’” 
USDA’s decision not to use the contingency money, Becker argued, was within the range of discretion allowed the agency, especially since the current lack of funding is not an emergency proper.
“This shutdown is not an emergency,” Becker said. “This crisis, to the extent it is a crisis or an emergency at all, has been created by Congress.”
“It is something that could be, by Congress reopening the government tomorrow, could be resolved,” Becker added. “There is no mandate that the SNAP program actually be funded on Nov.1. …The government cannot just add funding when no program exists.”
Torcello offered a retort later in the hearing: “Counsel’s contention that the shutdown is not an emergency, although I think counsel also said that this is a crisis. So their position is a bit inconsistent on this.”
But Becker urged the court to leave the matter to Congress, as only an appropriation can restart SNAP issuance. Forcing USDA to issue November benefits with contingency or Section 32 money would misallocate carryover balances and “actually cause immense harm to the SNAP system itself.” The use of Section 32 money could also affect WIC’s shutdown funding. 
“I don’t think we’re even transferring into WIC for next month at this point, because there’s just a lot of considerations that go into this,” Becker said.

Focus on food driving cities’ resources
The plaintiffs’ legal team, meanwhile, was concerned about the harm that would come from the cessation of SNAP benefits. Approximately a quarter of the population of Central Falls receives SNAP benefits, said Democracy Forward Senior Counsel Jyoti Jasrasaria. She mentioned a food drive being held Saturday to help mitigate the shutdown’s effect on food stamps.  
“Doing that is requiring [the city] to divert resources and staff directly from the police department, the Department of Public Works and the office of constituent services, and it will continue to do things like that,” Jasrasaria said.  
Another portion of the plaintiffs’ argument involved USDA’s move to end existing work-requirement waivers for able-bodied adults without dependents. Congress’ overhaul of SNAP eligibility in July still did not OK retroactive cancellation, the attorneys argued, but that’s what an Oct. 3 memo by USDA tried to do.  
The Justice Department countered that no irreparable harm would come from the new waiver rules, because no recipients would see a change in benefits until March 1, 2026.
“The failure to honor existing waivers is contrary to law,” McConnell ruled from the bench. His ruling orders USDA to keep those waivers in place through their stated end dates while the case proceeds.
Attorney Kevin Love Hubbard appeared on behalf of DeLuca, Weizenbaum, Barry & Revens — a stark change from July, when Hubbard still worked in  the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Division and defended the feds in court. Whether benefits expire in March or not does not make the time in-between any less important, Hubbard argued, as the time spent finding a job to satisfy the lack of a waiver cannot be returned. 
“Even if people are able to find jobs by March,” Hubbard said. “It eliminates their ability to use that time later on.”
“Time is our enemy here on so many levels,” McConnell said at one point.
Earlier in the hearing, he gave a “shoutout” to the courthouse staff who had stayed on with him to work on the case, which was filed less than a day before the hearing began.  
“I have two very, very tired law clerks, so I just want to publicly thank them,” McConnell said.

The group considered several kinds of mergers that would reduce costs across the state, including for school districts that provide families choice when there are public schools in neighboring districts.

Protect Vermont’s school choice system. That was the loud and clear message to the Vermont school redistricting task force during its Oct. 22 public forum at Rutland High School.
But some task force members see putting guardrails around school choice as one way to reduce costs for public education across the state.
At the same forum in Rutland, task force members also heard from Barstow school district board chair Debbie Singiser, who testified about the impact of school choice on her community. State taxpayers were “increasingly funding education for students with limited or only temporary ties to our community,” she told them.

Indeed, in the past five years, half of the 122 students who received public funding to attend private schools through Barstow Unified Union School District did not graduate from Barstow Memorial School’s 8th grade. And nearly half of the students using the tuition system from Barstow’s district in the past five years attended Killington Mountain School, a ski academy.
The data, compiled by task force members, supports Singiser’s comments at the public forum suggesting families are “moving into our school district to take advantage of that school choice and the tuition for high school.” That raises costs of taxpayers statewide, task force members argued.
“None of this is technically illegal. I mean, it’s just, is this what we want for our public school system?” Singiser said in an interview earlier this year. “We’re talking about how public education is getting expensive, and our property taxpayers are struggling, and when I look at that happening, I feel like we should fix that problem.”
During the task force’s Tuesday meeting, David Wolk, Gov. Phil Scott’s appointee to the task force, said it “shocked” him when he saw the data around tuition out of Barstow. He called it a problem that the Legislature “has got to change.”
“There has to be guardrails. There has to be some way to change this,” Wolk said. “It’s not right.”
As the state’s school redistricting task force continues its work to craft new school district maps, members are taking a microscope to the intricacies of the state’s 119 school districts and 52 supervisory union or supervisory districts, and highlighting some of the inefficiencies in school districts like Barstow.
The 11 members of the body have spent three months analyzing the state’s complex public education system, with one month left to go. The group is tasked with developing no more than three maps of new school boundaries for the Vermont Legislature to consider for the upcoming legislative session, which starts in early January.
So far, the task force has three map proposals in development. One creates 13 school districts to emphasize broader access to existing career and technical education opportunities. Another focuses on creating regional comprehensive high schools for underserved (and over-served) regions.
The third seeks to organize merged districts around regional BOCES, or a Board of Cooperative Educational Services, a type of educational governance entity used widely in New York and other states to help school districts collaborate on services such as special education and transportation.
That map, drafted by task force members Jennifer Botzojorns and Rep. Rebecca Holcombe, D-Norwich, takes the first stab at highlighting in detail where the state could target mergers and why.
Among other suggestions for mergers is Barstow, which Botzojorns and Holcombe said could be absorbed by the Rutland City School District as a way to control costs.
But time is limited. The task force has only two meetings left before it is required to finalize a report with three maps. Rep. Edye Graning, the co-chair of the task force, on Tuesday called it a “herculean” task for the body.

“I just keep coming back to the time crunch. We don’t have enough time,” Graning said. “We just don’t have the time to do the work … with the quality and level of detail that we would all love to be able to do it in. It makes me sad, because this is a big deal.”
‘Half baked’
At the task force’s meeting on Tuesday, Botzojorn and Holcombe discussed three examples of areas where enrollment and resources were either declining or not being used efficiently, and where the state could look to merge districts.
These different cases were meant to show the kind of detailed analysis needed to determine where specifically to draw district lines in a way that both reduces the cost to taxpayers and increases access to opportunities for students, they said. 
Those merged districts would then be overlayed with cooperative education service areas to allow collaboration on shared expenses like travel and special education.
Rep. Rebecca Holcombe, D-Norwich, listens to a presentation during a meeting of the school district redistricting task force in Winooski on Tuesday, Oct. 28. Chief Operation Officer Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
One example is typified by the state’s capital region, which “has a unique opportunity to coordinate” high schools in Barre, Montpelier and Twinfield, Botzojorn said.
This kind of area has “stranded costs,” where student enrollment was dropping faster than the disparate school districts’ ability to decrease costs. Costs at these school districts remained the same despite enrollment declines, putting financial stress on the overall system.
Merging districts could also improve access and save costs in districts like the Bennington-Rutland Supervisory Union. There, public school funds are being used to pay tuition for private schools in choice systems, siphoning tax dollars spent by the state away from the public school, Holcombe and Botzojorn argued. 
In that supervisory union, the Winhall School District, a non-operating district, could be merged into the neighboring Taconic and Green School District to bolster overall enrollment and per-pupil-spending.
And in their third example, Holcombe and Botzojorn discussed areas with “sparsity loss,” where schools have become so small they may be considering closure. The proposal pointed to towns like Danville, Windham, West River, Twin Valley, Readsboro, Stamford and Halifax as examples. Merging in these districts would strengthen the isolated public schools, so they don’t close and potentially create regions with public school deserts.
Task force members on Tuesday also looked again at a map first proposed by Wolk and Sen. Scott Beck, R-Caldeonia, earlier this month. That map would create 13 school districts that closely mirror the state’s 15 career and technical education regions, each identified by the technical education center that anchors it.
The proposal aims to expand career and technical education opportunities to students and honor “school choice where it presently exists,” Wolk said.
A revised version tweaked some of the boundaries in existing districts, but little else was changed from the map’s first iteration. District sizes remained lopsided. One district covering Chittenden County and a part of Grand Isle County would have nearly 22,000 students, while the smallest, the River Bend Area District, would have just over 2,000 students.
Another proposal, developed by Holcombe and Jay Badams, would center a new map around comprehensive regional high schools.
By identifying and targeting construction aid at regional high schools, the state could incentivize neighboring districts to collaborate on the design and development of new regional high schools and potentially access state construction aid. Shared governance would then ensure communities retain a voice in how schools meet the needs of students, Badams said.
“If we were to designate the areas that we identify as likely sites for comprehensive public high schools, we could give (school districts) their own designation and give them priority in school construction funding and other things,” Badams said.
Badams, like the other presenters, called his proposal “half baked.” The exact number and location of the regional high schools has not yet been finalized. But he noted on Tuesday that the three map proposals shared so far all have elements that could be worked into each other. 
“I think if we could weave them together a little better, we might be on to something that can be actionable,” he said
All three proposals, however, have yet to address how new districts would be governed. Specifically, which district governance model would be used, supervisory districts or supervisory unions.
Both models provide back office functions such as accounting and payroll and may oversee the provision of special education services and curriculum coordination. But the two systems differ in their structure. Supervisory unions are made up of school districts that each have their own board of directors, while supervisory districts have only one governing board.
Badams called governance the task force’s stumbling block. “We have three maps on the table right now that don’t really get to the whole idea of governance in a way that was contemplated” by the legislature, he said.
“We’re tinkering,” he said. “We’re trying to make an omelette without breaking a single egg.”
The task force will continue to flesh out its proposals for their Nov. 10 meeting. Members are expected to vote on which maps to recommend to the legislature at its final meeting next month.
“None of us wants to upset anyone,” Graning said, “and at the same time, that’s what we’ve been asked to do, is to make recommendations.”

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)A Pulaski County judge ordered House District 70’s special election moved to March 3, 2026, rejecting arguments from the state that Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has complete discretion over special election dates.
On Oct. 10, Sanders called a special election for June 9, 2026, to replace former Republican Rep. Carlton Wing, who resigned on Sept. 30 to become the new executive director and CEO of Arkansas PBS.

HD70 RULING-103125 
In a lawsuit filed Oct. 21, the Democratic Party of Arkansas and four District 70 voters said Sanders violated the state’s special election laws when she scheduled the special general election for that date. They called it “taxation without representation” as it would prevent the district from having House representation during the Legislature’s 2026 fiscal session, set to start in April.
The petitioners asked for the special election to be moved to March 3, which Sanders had set as the special primary, via a writ of mandamus. A writ of mandamus is a court order compelling a government official to perform a duty they are already legally required to do.
Under Arkansas law, the governor is required to schedule a special election date to fill a vacancy within 150 days unless she found it was “impracticable or unduly burdensome” to do so. Further, if the election couldn’t be held within 150 days, it had to be held on the earliest practicable date after that statutory deadline.
A June 9 election would be 252 days after Wing’s Sept. 30 resignation — or 152 days after the 150-day mark. The average number of days a special election has been held after the 150-day mark since 2011 is about 25 days, according to an unpublished Senate memo.
In Friday’s 18-page ruling granting the writ, Circuit Judge Shawn Johnson was not swayed by arguments from Attorney General Tim Griffin’s office that the governor has “complete discretion on how and when to set a special election — whether it is before or after the expiration of 150 days following a legislative vacancy.”
Johnson said that, while the governor was granted discretion to determine whether holding a special election within 150 days of a vacancy was “impracticable or unduly burdensome,” the exception required her to then schedule it on the “earliest practicable” date — not the “most practicable.”
And while “someone has to decide what date after the 150-day vacancy period is ‘as soon as practicable’ thereafter,” Johnson wrote, that person was not Sanders.
“If that were true, then it would render the statutory scheme meaningless. In other words, if the Governor has complete discretion over when to hold a special election — whether before or after the 150-day mark — then there would be no reason to have a 150-day limitation at all,” Johnson wrote.

If the governor sets the date after the 150-day mark, the law takes away any discretion Sanders would otherwise have, Johnson wrote. After that point the special election date should depend on the ability of the locality to “well and capably accomplish the election.”
Johnson was also “not convinced” by Griffin’s office that state laws regarding absentee voting made the March 3 date proposed by the petitioners impracticable. He pointed to testimony from Pulaski County Circuit Clerk Terri Hollingsworth and other Pulaski County election officials, who stated they had successfully conducted a special election for House District 34 on nearly identical dates as those proposed by the petitioners.
“I am disappointed in the ruling and will expeditiously appeal the decision,” Griffin said in a text message via his spokesperson.

Johnson’s ruling is the second judicial decision to push back on Sanders’ recent special election proclamations. Another Pulaski County judge ruled against Sanders and Secretary of State Cole Jester earlier this month after a voter in Senate District 26 filed a lawsuit over an identical special election schedule, alleging that it violated state law and deprived the district’s voters of representation during the 2026 fiscal session.
However, that ruling did not go as far as Johnson’s did, only ordering Sanders to change the special election dates so it would occur prior to the April fiscal session.
‘Far-reaching ramifications’: Judge says special election dates violate constitutional rights

When asked for comment, a spokesperson for Sanders gave the same statement as was given after the SD26 ruling.
“Governor Sanders is confident that on appeal, the law clearly giving the Governor the authority to set special elections will be upheld and ultimately save taxpayer dollars and ensure the election is free, fair, and secure,” spokesperson Sam Dubke wrote in a text message.
DPA Chair Marcus Jones called the ruling a victory for HD70’s 30,000 residents.
“The time has come for Governor Sanders to move up the Special Election dates and give the hardworking taxpayers of North Little Rock and Sherwood the representation they deserve,” Jones wrote in an emailed statement provided to the Advocate. “The Democratic Party of Arkansas stands with Arkansans from across the political spectrum to oppose taxation without representation. Mark our words: We won’t stop fighting for every Arkansan to have a say in our state budget.”
Griffin’s office is appealing the SD26 ruling to the Arkansas Supreme Court as well, as is the plaintiff, who is asking the court to rule the 150-day exception unconstitutional, among other things.

Mike Braun threw his support behind Fort Wayne City Clerk Lana Keesling to chair the state GOP. (Photo courtesy Indiana Republican Party)Allen County Democrats want the Indiana Republican Party’s leader to resign from her publicly funded day job, arguing that holding both roles at once presents “conflicts of interest.”
Fort Wayne City Clerk Lana Keesling criticized the Allen County Democratic Party’s motivations in an open letter that revealed she plans to leave her city position soon — but not yet.
She ascended to the state GOP’s top job in February, becoming the party’s fourth chair in two years.
Indiana governor summons lawmakers for redistricting session amid national GOP pressure

County Democratic Party Chair Chad Wierzbinski said that, at that point, it was expected that Keesling “would follow the precedent established by previous Indiana Republican Party chairs who also served as elected officials, by resigning her elected position and releasing taxpayers from the burden of subsidizing a high-level political official.”
Kessling pushed back.
“The Allen County Democrats are simply trying to divert attention from their party’s abysmal track record in our city, state and nation,” she wrote in a missive addressed to Fort Wayne residents, which she shared with the Capital Chronicle.
Fort Wayne is the seat of Allen County.
County Dems point to redistricting and roles’ demands
Wierzbinski cited an impending special legislative session — called primarily for Indiana lawmakers to redraw the state’s two blue congressional districts red — as the impetus for a Friday news conference.
“I felt it was important to call this press conference today to shed light on how … Keesling is playing a role in disenfranchising voters,” Wierzbinski said, according to a news release.
The criticism went beyond Keesling’s support for early redistricting.
He commended her for visiting all 92 counties in less than a year as party chair, but said it’s “not a task befitting of a local city clerk.”
“The citizens of Fort Wayne deserve a full-time city clerk whose attention is singularly focused on the city, not someone spending her time at political events across the state while maintaining taxpayer-funded employment,” Wierzbinski said.
State GOP leader says commitment to city ‘has not wavered’
Keesling’s letter indicated she’s been planning for her departure since the month she was named GOP chair.
“I will continue serving my community, finishing projects in the office, and moving the office forward,” the note concluded. “Since February we have been working on a transition plan, and I look forward to sharing that plan soon.
Keesling began, however, by calling it an “honor and a privilege” to have worked as clerk for about a decade.
In 2015, she became the first Republican city clerk of Fort Wayne since 1971. She also previously served as vice chair of the Allen County Republican Party and treasurer of the 3rd District Republican Congressional Committee.

“During my time in office, my staff and I have transformed the City Clerk’s Office to become more efficient, effective and transparent along with being an office our community can be proud of,” the letter continued.
She highlighted the modernization of downtown Fort Wayne’s parking system — parking meters that accept credit cards, mobile app payment options and more accessible parking for the disabled — as “one of the accomplishments I am most proud of.” Those changes were made without the use of taxpayer dollars, according to the letter.
Keesling — who has served on a variety of boards for transportation, civil rights and disabled advocacy groups — said she was “humbled by the opportunity to serve Hoosiers in a different capacity” when Gov. Mike Braun asked her to lead the Indiana GOP.
“My commitment to the residents of Fort Wayne has not wavered,” she wrote. “My office and I continue to provide the highest level of service to our community each and every day, and I could not be prouder of the dedication and accomplishments of my team over the past 10 years.”

,California,2025-10-31 20:52:00+00:00,CalMatters,Head Start programs begin closing in California due to shutdown,Carolyn Jones,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/2025/10/california-head-start/,"As funding deadlines approach, one Head Start program has closed and three others are about to. More closures are expected in the coming weeks.","In summary
As funding deadlines approach, one Head Start program has closed and three others are about to. More closures are expected in the coming weeks. 


One California Head Start program has closed and three others face imminent closure due to the federal government shutdown, affecting about 1,000 very-low-income children and 270 teachers. 
The closures would leave families scrambling for child care and teachers without income. The longer the shutdown drags on, the more programs are at risk of shuttering. 
“Losing a Head Start program has detrimental effects not just on children and families, but also has immense ripple effects on the community,” said Melanee Cottrill, executive director of Head Start California. “Head Start is far more than a safe place for children to learn and grow — it’s a community hub … The negative effect on regional employment and the local economy would be felt many times over.” 
A Head Start program in Santa Cruz County has already closed, upending child care arrangements for hundreds of families.
Encompass Community Services, a Santa Cruz nonprofit, was forced to close all 11 of its Head Start centers on Thursday because no one at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services was available to process the group’s Nov. 1 grant renewal or send money.
“Head Start is part of the fabric of this community,” said Elaine Johnson, chair of the Encompass board. “This is about babies, children, and families not having access to basic needs.”
The centers, mostly clustered in the farmlands around Watsonville, serve some of the lowest-income families in the region. About 300 children are enrolled in its program.
3,000 children at risk 
Three more Head Start programs in California — in Los Angeles, the Central Valley and the far northern part of the state — also have Nov. 1 grant deadlines and face imminent closure. Another four programs with Dec. 1 deadlines would be the next to shutter if the government shutdown continues. 
In all, more than 3,000 children and hundreds of teachers at those eight centers would be affected within the next month if Congress fails to adopt a budget.
Nationwide, about 134 programs serving 65,000 children face closure this week due to the shutdown — with Florida, Georgia, Ohio and Missouri having the highest numbers of children affected, according to the National Head Start Association. Even if Congress agrees to fund the federal government this week, re-opening would not happen immediately: It could take up to six weeks for the money to reach individual Head Start centers.
Popular and effective
Founded in the mid-1960s, Head Start is a free child care program providing meals and a play-based academic curriculum for children from birth through age 5. Families can get prenatal visits, referrals for medical and dental care, housing and job assistance and other services. 
To qualify, families must earn below the federal poverty level — $26,650 a year for a family of three. In California, that bar is very difficult to meet due to the higher minimum wage. Last year, the state’s Head Start centers enrolled about 83,000 children at 1,835 centers.
Head Start, created to give low-income families a boost, has largely been successful: Alumni have higher graduation rates, higher college-going rates and are less likely to live in poverty as adults, one study found.
It’s also very popular. When President Donald Trump threatened to cut the entire program this past spring, Head Start supporters flooded Congress with urgent pleas to save it from the budget axe. They succeeded, although other government cuts have left a deep impact on the organization and its families.
Potential cuts to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and Medicaid would have an immediate impact on Head Start families, while other recent cuts have already hampered Head Start’s day-to-day operations, Cottrill said.
The U.S. Health and Human Services Department, which oversees Head Start., closed half of its regional offices in April, leading to long delays in processing paperwork. For Head Start centers, that’s meant months-long holdups for routine purchases such as dishwashers, Cottrill said, along with delays related to minor program changes.
Back-up plans
In Santa Cruz, Encompass was able to partner with the Pajaro Valley Unified School District in Watsonville to temporarily provide child care to most of the families enrolled in Head Start, starting next week. But the past few months of budget uncertainty have been nerve-wracking, Kim Morrisson, interim executive director, said.
The organization has been in talks with a slew of state and local agencies to come up with back-up plans for funding the $9-million-a-year program..
“We’re trying to roll with the punches and just focus on serving our families,” Morrison said. “Head Start is a big, national program. We just can’t imagine a world where it doesn’t exist.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/120924_RalphHawleyHeadStart_FM_CM_22.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-31 17:02:32.120949

(Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)North Carolinians who plan to buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act’s marketplace are set to see significant cost hikes as the open enrollment period begins Nov. 1.
That increase could soon be twofold. Providers are raising premiums by an average of 28.6% in North Carolina, and the tax credits that significantly lower costs for many enrollees are set to expire at the end of 2025 unless Congress decides to extend them.
Almost 1 million North Carolinians are enrolled in the ACA, which provides federally-approved private health care plans to those without employer-sponsored insurance.
Around one-third (34%) of uninsured North Carolinians are eligible for Medicaid or public coverage, according to Kaiser Family Foundation data. And more than a quarter (28%) are eligible for tax credits, which are set to expire at the end of the year.
Individual rates in North Carolina will increase between 16.88% and 36.4% in 2026, Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey said in a statement Wednesday. Small group rates will increase between 12.66% and 17.5%.



Those hikes exceed national trends: the average proposed premium increase is 20%, according to the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker. That’s the highest rate change requested by providers since 2018, fueled by higher costs of labor, drugs and the uncertain future of tax credits.
“Increased costs in health care as well as the expiration of federal subsidies result in premiums going up for many on the individual market,” Causey said. “It’s more important than ever to begin researching your health insurance options early.”
A spokesperson for the NC Department of Insurance did not respond to inquiries about whether the department was seeing an increase in calls or concerns about rates ahead of open enrollment.
How politics have put ACA tax credits in peril
Providers have raised 2026 rates in part because of the looming expiration of enhanced premium tax credits. Those tax credits,established in 2021, were later extended through the end of this year. They have led to a massive expansion of the ACA marketplace, and drive down costs for many enrollees.
Earlier this year, Congressional Republicans voted to allow the tax credits to sunset on schedule, d saying they’re too costly to extend.
Congressional Democrats, who are in the minority in both chambers, are using the budget continuation bill as leverage to convince Republican lawmakers to change their minds. In the Senate, Democrats are using parliamentary rules to block the passage of the spending bill unless it contains a provision to extend the ACA credits again.
So far, Republicans have refused to negotiate that issue. That’s what caused the current federal government shutdown standoff that has now dragged on for a month.
The standoff has fueled political battles around the country, including in North Carolina.
In a news conference Thursday, state Sen. Gale Adcock (D-Wake) said the majority party was “shutting down the government instead of fixing the health care crisis they created.”
Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has called the tax credits “subsidizing bad policy.” He said GOP lawmakers “believe in the private sector and the free market and individual providers.”

Executives at the network said the change will make way for more news coverage throughout the day. 
The last broadcast of “Mississippi Edition” was Friday morning, according to a statement on MPB’s website. Starting Monday, MPB radio will air news segments at the beginning of every hour from 6 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays.
Anna Neel, MPB’s chief operating officer, said the new approach will allow for more coverage of news as it develops.
“We’re hoping the new format gives reporters more flexibility to tell quality stories throughout the day,” Neel told Mississippi Today. “They’re not going to be as rushed to try to put together a 30-minute package.”
In July, the Republican-controlled Congress approved President Donald Trump’s request to cancel $1.1 billion in federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the nonprofit organization that helped fund the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio. The corporation shut down when the federal budget year began Oct. 1. 
Mississippi Public Broadcasting is one of over 1,500 locally-owned radio and television stations that lost money. Neel estimated that MPB lost about 15% of its funding with the federal cuts. She said state funding and donors pay for MPB’s locally produced content, including state news coverage.
MPB continues to air emergency weather alerts along with local programming and will change its mix of PBS and NPR programming sometime next year, Neel said Friday.  She said MPB plans to add more local programming in the future.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/01164000/Mississippi-Public-Broadcasting-3.jpg,,,2025-10-31 17:02:32.120949

(Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — Political analyst Amy Walter views the campaign by President Donald Trump to gerrymander congressional districts as a gamble unlikely to blunt historical precedent and prevent a Democratic takeover of the U.S. House after the 2026 midterm election.
“I like to say in midterm elections there are three options if you’re the party in the White House. It’s going to be bad. It’s going to be really bad. Or, it’s going to be catastrophically bad. There is nothing else that is likely,” she told a crowd Thursday at Dole Institute of Politics at the University of Kansas.
Walter, publisher of Cook Political Report and a guest on PBS NewsHour, NBC’s Meet the Press, CNN’s Inside Politics and the Fox News Channel, said Trump would be a substantial motivator in terms of Democratic turnout in the midterm scheduled for one year from now. It’s unclear whether Trump could likewise inspire dramatic turnout among GOP voters in November 2026, she said.
“Midterm elections are a referendum on the party in power,” Walter said. “The challenge for a president is to turn out his winning presidential coalition.”
Walter said at this moment it might be possible for Republicans to expand by a half dozen or so the number of seats in the U.S. House through redistricting. Those gains are unlikely to compensate for anticipated losses by other GOP House candidates, she said, but politics of the midterm could be unpredictable.
Walter was interviewed at Dole Institute of Politics at the University of Kansas by Jerry Seib, a journalist with The Wall Street Journal for almost 45 years. He said the unprecedented redistricting battle illustrated what Trump’s advisers expected in the upcoming election cycle.
“That tells you that the White House, Trump-world, is worried,” Seib said.
Walter said a Democratic Party majority in the House or Senate would use committees to challenge Trump’s use of executive power or investigate the president’s actions.
“The president also knows quite well the last time Democrats were in charge while he was there, they impeached him twice,” Walter said.
Trump’s plan for mid-decade redistricting has created political turmoil in Kansas, where Republican leaders of the Legislature want a special session to realign the state’s four congressional districts. The goal would be to pull the re-election rug out from under Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, who serves the Kansas City area.
 
‘Battle for control’
In the U.S. House, Republicans hold the smallest majority since 1931. If Democrats flipped three seats in the midterm, Republicans would lose control of the chamber.
The 53-47 U.S. Senate could change hands if Democrats secured four additional seats, but Walter said that Republican majority appeared to be solid because opportunities for Democrats were limited in 2026. If Democrats failed to grab the Maine Senate seat held by Republican Susan Collins, in a state won by Democrat Kamala Harris, there could be no path for Democrats, she said.
“The battle for control of Congress is something that is very consequential, especially if your party currently has all three branches and it’s a lot easier to get a whole lot done when you don’t have to negotiate with your opposition,” Walter said.
The historical record revealed in 18 of 20 midterms since World War II the party of the sitting president lost an average of 27 seats in the U.S. House during midterm elections.
The two exceptions came after the 2001 terrorist attack under President George W. Bush and amid President Bill Clinton’s impeachment controversy in 1998.
In those rare midterm elections, Bush and Clinton had robust approval ratings of at least 60%. Recent polling indicated 43% of Americans approved of Trump’s performance in the second term. That’s the statistical territory Trump occupied in the 2018 midterm when Republicans lost 40 seats in the U.S. House.
 
Feckless Democrats
Walter said the biggest wild card in 2026 was the gerrymandering of U.S. House districts to benefit either Republican or Democratic candidates. Texas and California would cancel each other out, so it could come down to the Florida, Ohio, Virginia, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri and North Carolina.
Walter said another complicating factor in sorting out the next midterm was the Democratic Party lacked fervor of a decade ago.
The position of Democrats in the federal government shutdown was driven by criticism from Democrats who questioned what lawmakers were doing to push back against Trump, she said.
“That is driven in large part by pressure from rank-and-file Democrats who say, ‘What are our leaders doing? They’re feckless. Why don’t they fight back more against Donald Trump?’ There is this worry among Democrats that their weak party brand big and this intraparty friction may have an impact on turnout,” she said.
Another factor could be timing of a U.S. Supreme Court decision on whether the Voting Rights Act required districts with a majority of minority residents. The outcome could come too late in 2026 for states to adjust boundaries before candidate filing deadlines, she said.
 
Trump in 2028?
Walter said Congress wasn’t going back to a past era that included a spirit of bipartisanship.
“It’s pretty clear that more and more we do have two Americas,” she said. “The job of the parties now seems to be more of, ‘How can I make sure my America turns out to vote and crushes their America.'”
To put it another way, she said: “The idea of the two sides figuring out, ‘Alright, well, this is a priority and let’s work on a bipartisan bill to address it. It seems pretty far-fetched.”
In response to an audience question, Seib and Walter said they doubted Trump would have the audacity to seek a third term as president during 2028 in violation of the U.S. Constitution.
“I think this is a tease right now. I think that even for Trump it would be a bridge too far,” Seib said. “Why? If you think you’re having a wonderful second term and you’re going to go on Mount Rushmore, why would you want to tarnish your legacy by starting a fight with the Supreme Court you’re probably going to lose.”
Walter: “I absolutely agree with you.” She theorized there was no longer a Republican Party in the United States, because it should be regarded as a Trump Party. “Whether it is the name Donald Trump on the ballot in 2028, or someone else, they will come from Donald Trump and he will endorse that candidate and they will be the nominee.”
She went on to suggest it wasn’t probable Trump or the federal government could reschedule or cancel the 2026 election. She’s prepared for local and state governments, organized to diffuse power in election management, to conduct free and fair elections across the country.
“I’m still optimistic that, yes, that will be the case,” she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amy-Walter-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-31 17:16:32.267661

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.
Federal judges in two separate cases, including the multistate lawsuit that Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark joined on Tuesday, have rejected legal arguments made by the Trump administration against releasing emergency funding for November food assistance.
In Massachusetts District Court on Friday, Judge Indira Talwani said Clark and colleagues from 24 states and the District of Columbia were “likely to succeed” in their claims against the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Though Talwani stopped short of issuing the temporary restraining order sought by states against the USDA, in an order on Friday she found the USDA’s argument that existing contingency funding is not legally available for its Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program “erroneous.”
“While this case isn’t over, today is a good day in our fight,” Clark said in a statement on Friday following Talwani’s order.
Talwani gave federal officials until Monday to “advise the court whether they will authorize at least reduced SNAP benefits for November.”

In a separate decision in Rhode Island District Court, Judge John McConnell ordered the Trump administration to use its contingency funding to continue distributing food benefits. McConnell ruled in favor of a group of city officials and community organizations, who sought a temporary restraining order against the USDA’s actions along the same lines as Clark’s lawsuit.
“Two federal courts today told the Trump Administration what they are doing with SNAP benefits is wrong,” Clark said in her statement. “I couldn’t agree more and we will keep fighting.”
These decisions occur as Vermont takes steps to provide state-funded stopgap measures while federal funding remains in question for food assistance. 
On Wednesday, the state’s Emergency Board approved a $6.5 million plan that funds 3SquaresVT — Vermont’s version of SNAP — for the first half of November. The board will reconvene on or before Nov. 13 to weigh further steps.

The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, in coordination with the Tangipahoa Parish government, reopened the southernmost portion of the river Friday. The span ranges from the unincorporated community of Lees Landing down to the river’s mouth in Lake Pontchartrain, according to an LDEQ news release. A far larger section of the river, stretching north from Lees Landing to Louisiana Highway 10 in Arcola, remains closed until further notice.

Officials closed the Tangipahoa River following the Aug. 22 chemical fire at the Smitty’s Supply Inc. facility in Roseland. It took firefighters two weeks to fully extinguish the blaze. The disaster  contaminated nearby properties, land and waterways with millions of gallons of oil and other hazardous chemical products. To date, cleanup crews have recovered more than 11 million gallons of liquid waste, according to state estimates. 
Cleanup operations continue in other parts of the river north of Lees Landing, and oil absorbent boom will remain in place at select locations, the LDEQ statement said.

(Patrick Lohmann/SourceNM)Leaders of New Mexico’s largest food banks said they’re seeing sharp increases in demand for food donations in distribution lines amid the looming disappearance of federal food assistance funding beginning Saturday.
Approximately 250 people lined up Friday morning at the weekly Roadrunner Food Bank distribution in Albuquerque ,about 100 more than usual, organizers told Source New Mexico. 
And earlier this week in Santa Fe, The Food Depot ran out of food after serving 135 people at a distribution that typically serves less than 100, Executive Director Jill Dixon told Source in a text message.
Organizers said the uptick in demand reflects the widespread uncertainty about what the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will look like beginning Nov. 1. 
Trump administration blocked from cutting off SNAP benefits as two judges issue orders

Two federal judges issued orders Friday that block the Trump administration from cutting off SNAP benefits. In one case, the judge gave the Trump administration until Monday to respond to her findings. 
On Wednesday Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced $30 million in emergency funding to cover SNAP recipients through approximately the first 10 days of the month.
Over the weekend, the state’s roughly 460,000 SNAP recipients will receive a payment equaling 30% of their typical monthly food assistance benefit, Health Care Authority Secretary Kari Armijo told Source New Mexico on Friday in a phone interview. The money will arrive to all SNAP recipients, including those who typically receive their benefits later in the month.
Recipients can expect text messages soon with more details, as well as phone numbers to call in case issues arise, she said. 
“At this point we are not anticipating any delays,” she said. “We’re telling New Mexicans that if they don’t have their benefits by Monday, they should give us a call.”
As they stood toward the front of a growing food line around 9 a.m. Friday morning in Albuquerque, Keith Pounds struck up a conversation with Jeana Morgan and her son Jimmy about how they’re going to feed their families in November. They could be overheard planning how to make do with one-third of what they typically rely on in November amid rising grocery prices.

“Something’s better than nothing,” Jimmy Morgan said. “Yeah, it’s something,” his mother said.
But Pounds, who is disabled, said he is supporting his three brothers, who’ve been unable to get food assistance. He worried aloud about how they’ll all eat in November. 
“I try and catch every food bank I can, even with my feet and my legs the way they are,” he said. “Life is hard, dude. You can’t afford to eat.” 
Armijo also told Source on Friday following the federal rulings the state will still proceed with  payments because she anticipates at least a few days before the money arrives here, even if Trump accedes to the judicial orders.
“That could really eat into next week,” she said. “And so in order to make sure that New Mexicans have food on the table over the weekend, we’re going to issue those benefits.”
Even with those benefits, Joseph Greenwood, a programs manager at Roadrunner Food Bank, told Source that the food bank expects continued high demand through November. He looked over the growing food line Friday and said it reminded him of lines during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.
NM’s biggest farmers’ market manager says SNAP cuts will be ‘devastating’

He anticipated the food bank would give out an entire truckload of food by noon. 
He said the state’s $30 million stop-gap, along with an $8 million investment for statewide food banks the Legislature approved during a special session at the beginning of the month, provide a “shot in the arm” to help feed New Mexicans, but it’s doesn’t come close to satisfying statewide hunger needs.
But Edmundo Maestas, who grew up in the International District, was relieved to learn Friday morning from a reporter that the state would give him about $35 for food over the weekend. Even though it’s one-third of what he normally gets, he thought he wasn’t getting anything through Thanksgiving.

Phaneuf and Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/31/trump-ordered-to-pay-snap-benefits-ct-officials-still-want-to-help/,The rulings didn’t stop CT state legislators’ demands to reserve hundreds of millions to shore up SNAP and other human service programs.,"Two federal judges ruled separately on Friday that President Donald Trump’s administration must continue to fund SNAP, the nation’s biggest food aid program, using contingency funds during the government shutdown.
The judges, in federal courts in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, gave the administration leeway on whether to fund the Supplementary Nutrition Assistance Program fully or partially in November. The U.S. Department of Agriculture planned to stop SNAP benefits entirely for 42 million Americans — including 360,000 Connecticut residents — starting Saturday.
Those rulings, though, didn’t stop Connecticut state legislators’ demands to reserve hundreds of millions in state funds to shore up SNAP and other human service programs harmed by stalled federal aid.
Gov. Ned Lamont and state legislative leaders indicated Friday they would continue negotiating a plan to use Connecticut resources to ensure all vulnerable residents are protected.
In U.S. District Court in Boston, Judge Indira Talwani ruled in a written opinion that the USDA must pay for SNAP, calling the suspension “unlawful.” She ordered the Trump administration to advise the court by Monday as to whether it would use the contingency funds to provide reduced SNAP benefits for November or fully fund the program using both contingency funds and additional available funds.
The SNAP program entered October with about $6 billion in contingency funds, though that reserve likely now stands between $5 billion and $6 billion, with some used to cover SNAP administrative costs in October. A partial federal government shutdown starting Oct. 1 has blocked any new funds into the program.
But Talwani noted federal agriculture officials could supplement those dollars with customs receipts on all imports, which might allow for full benefits to be paid in November.
Meanwhile, in U.S. District Court in Providence, Judge John J. McConnell ruled from the bench in a case filed by cities and nonprofits that the program must be funded using at least the contingency funds, and he also asked for an update on progress by Monday.
Still, it wasn’t immediately clear how quickly the debit cards that beneficiaries use to buy food could be reloaded after the ruling. That process often takes one to two weeks.
And the rulings are likely to face appeals.
Connecticut officials applauded the rulings Friday but acknowledged the SNAP crisis is far from over.
“Donald Trump now has a stark legal and moral choice before him — he can keep fighting this losing battle, he can insist on starving American families for political leverage, or he can release the funds now,” said Attorney General William Tong.
Connecticut, 24 other states and the District of Columbia filed the lawsuit heard in federal court in Boston, arguing the White House has a legal and a moral obligation to spend contingency funds at least.
“While this ruling may offer last-minute relief for the many who rely on SNAP, I urge the federal government to honor it now and for [Agriculture] Secretary [Brooke] Rollins to use not only the department’s contingency fund but also her transfer authority to increase benefits,” Lamont wrote in a statement shortly after the rulings, adding that state social services officials would issue November benefits as soon as the USDA authorizes payments.
“In Connecticut, we take care of our own and will continue to stand by our residents until this federal shutdown is resolved,” the governor said.
But state legislative leaders from both parties have chastised the Democratic governor this week, saying he did too little to prepare for a benefits stoppage that had become evident weeks ago.
Lamont dedicated $3 million for an emergency grant to support food pantries while governors in several other states dedicated tens of millions of dollars in provide state-backed food benefits to replace the vanishing federal aid to needy households.
State House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, and House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said they both remain committed to designating a huge state reserve, likely involving hundreds of millions of dollars.
This could be used to replace stalled federal SNAP benefits if federal court appeals lead to more delays, or if federal contingency funds eventually are exhausted. With the General Assembly expected to go into special session on Nov. 12-13, legislative leaders say they want to ensure enough state reserves as designated to protect programs, if necessary, until the regular 2026 legislative session opens on Feb. 4.
“This is about more than just SNAP,” Candelora said. “I think that we need to act as if this government shutdown is going to continue.”
And even after the shutdown is over and federal agency operations return to normal, Ritter said, many state legislators also want to review human service programs that face ongoing reductions in federal funding in 2027 and 2028 due to cutbacks ordered by Congress in July.
“The shutdown has only made it more important to do this [reserve] fund,” Ritter added. “It’s not just SNAP that’s at risk.”
Some state legislators already have said they want to bolster Connecticut’s winter heating assistance grants, which traditionally have been paid using only federal aid, with some state funding.
Lamont, a fiscal moderate, has traditionally objected to using state funds to supplement programs normally funded by the federal government, a stance that sometimes leaves him at odds with his fellow Democrats in the General Assembly’s majority.
State Rep. Josh Elliott of Hamden, who is challenging Lamont for the 2026 Democratic gubernatorial nomination, said Friday the fiscally moderate governor would find himself at odds with nearly the entire General Assembly unless he agrees to dedicate more state dollars to help feed hungry families and keep homes heated this winter. Simply giving $3 million to food pantries, Elliott said, won’t cut it.
“It would astonish me, given the amount of suffering that we’re hearing from our constituents across the board, that we wouldn’t have super-majorities in both chambers” ready to spend state funds on nutrition and home heating assistance, Elliott said.
The Hamden lawmaker said the legislature should even consider a state tax rebate if that is the only way to get extra resources in November to poor families that cannot afford groceries.
The average Connecticut household on SNAP receives about $324 per month, or about $81 per week.

During a special meeting Friday the DMACC board of directors appointed Liang Chee Wee as the college’s interim president, with his term set to run from Jan. 1 through June 30, 2026. The vote was nearly unanimous, with board member Angela Jackson abstaining because she said she didn’t have time to review Wee’s resume.
Some members of the board met with Wee earlier this week, board president Kevin Halterman said during the meeting, and they were impressed with his willingness to get involved in DMACC life and keep the institution moving forward during his tenure.
“I am very positive about his appointment as our interim,” board member Trish Roberts said.

When DMACC first launched a national search for President Rob Denson’s successor after his retirement at the end of 2025, the plan was to select a new president who would take over at the start of the year. However, after two of three finalists for the presidency dropped out, the board decided to extend the search into next year and hire an interim president in the meantime.

Wee has led multiple Iowa community colleges in the past, according to a news release announcing his appointment, including more than a decade of serving as president of Northeast Iowa Community College and two years of being interim chancellor of Eastern Iowa Community Colleges.
As he is currently living in Decorah, Halterman said during the meeting Wee will look for a residence in the Des Moines area to have “boots on the ground” at DMACC during the week. Wee will consult with the college’s senior team members on practices like hiring during his time at the college, Halterman said, and he will assist in representing the college and its needs during the legislative session.
He also agreed with board members that DMACC is a large institution and “we should not slow down the ship,” board member Felix Gallagher said during the meeting.
“DMACC is a remarkable institution with outstanding students, faculty, and staff,” Wee said in the release. “I am honored to serve in this interim capacity and look forward to supporting the College’s impactful mission of providing accessible, affordable, and outstanding educational experiences while working alongside the talented DMACC community.”

(Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansans purchasing health insurance on the Affordable Care Act marketplace are likely to see their premiums increase in 2026, some by as much as 34%, and that’s without calculating the additional dollars they will pay if subsidies aren’t reinstated by Congress. 
ACA marketplace open enrollment starts Saturday for 2026 insurance plans, and Kansans are concerned about what to expect after seeing national estimates that health insurance rates may double. 
Health insurance rates are going up across the board, and many factors contribute to that, including use, cost of care and advances in types of care, increased prescription costs and renegotiated provider reimbursement contracts, said Kyle Strathman, deputy chief of staff at the Kansas Department of Insurance. 
On the marketplace, Kansans also are being hit with the expiration of 2026 marketplace subsidies, said Maci Mishler, owner of Rural Health Advisors, a health insurance agency in Ness City and with an office in Nebraska. 
“I’m really concerned that people in the marketplace have their heads buried in the sand and they’re not realizing what’s about to happen,” she said, adding that she’s getting more calls from clients about Medicare rates than from those who buy marketplace insurance. 
 
 Kansas ACA

Of the seven companies offering ACA coverage in Kansas, one is new to the market and has no previous rates to compare. Another, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City, showed an average rate decrease of 6.14%, according to the Kansas Department of Insurance’s 2026 overview of the health insurance market, released Thursday. 
The remaining five reported the following average rate increases among 2026 marketplace plans:

11.74% – UnitedHealthcare Insurance Co.
14.44% – Oscar Insurance Co.
16.65% – Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas Inc.
30.76% – Medica Insurance Co.
33.66% – Ambetter from Sunflower Health Plan insured by Celtic Insurance Co.

The four companies offering small business insurance plans through ACA reported that rates will increase, on average, from 8.4% to nearly 10%, the study found. 
The insurance market study also said the numbers of Kansans using the marketplace have steadily increased, topping 200,000 in 2025, up from 171,000 in 2024. In 2017, 98,780 people were enrolled. 
Strathman said it’s challenging to predict how the insurance market will be affected. National experts expect many people who see significant cost increases to go without insurance. 
“It is difficult to project as we do not know if people will leave the ACA for other options such as short-term limited duration plans or group plans, but projections of enrollment to the individual ACA plans are expected to decrease significantly,” he said. 
A decrease would negatively affect the market, as insurance companies depend on the number of people enrolled to decrease risk, Mishler said. 
Cindy Samuelson, spokeswoman for the Kansas Hospital Association, said any decrease in the number of Kansans who have health insurance is concerning. 
“When they’re uninsured, that’s not good for their health care because they don’t get proactive health care,” she said. “It also means when they have urgent care, they’re going to come to the emergency room, and they’re uncompensated, so they have no insurance.”
When hospitals face rising uncompensated care costs, those challenges begin to affect the entire medical system. Kansas has the highest number of rural hospitals at immediate risk of closing of any state, at 25 hospitals, according to the March 2025 report from the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform.
 
Hitting Kansans’ budgets
Kansan Laura Mead is self-employed, and she’s nervous about what to expect from her marketplace plan when she sees rates on Saturday — that’s even after an initial exploration showed her annual health insurance cost may decrease. 
At age 60, she currently pays about $1,100 a month for health care through ACA, which she says has an actual premium of $1,427 a month. The additional $327 is covered by the ACA subsidies, which are ending unless Congress takes action. 
“For the first time in my adult life, I’m facing a real serious prospect of not having health care,” she said.
After researching, Mead said she expects that her insurance costs may double, which would leave her paying an unsustainable $2,000 each month. 
Mead is considering a catastrophic policy, which would cover her if a significant health problem occurred. She’s frustrated at how difficult it is to weigh her options. The ACA marketplace can be confusing, she said, and she’s finding that even Kansas U.S. legislators don’t understand what’s happening. 
She called one representative’s office and the staff person told her that “we’re trying to get people who aren’t working off those programs,” Mead said. 
Carolyn McKee, a small business owner in Holton, posted on Facebook Friday that she received a letter saying her private Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan would increase by $700 a month. Within an hour, her post had more than 40 comments, with some complaining they were also seeing their rates double. 
Many self-employed individuals like McKee and Mead, including an estimated 27% of farmers, get their health insurance through the marketplace. 
 
More than subsidies
Mischler said people need to also be aware of the “cliff” that’s part of ACA marketplace rules, as that will also affect many Kansans. 
“Pre-Covid, if you had income over 400% of the federal poverty level, you weren’t going to qualify for a subsidy at all,” she said. “Then during Covid, they expanded subsidies and even people who made a ton of money could qualify for some subsidies.”
Mischler said consumers have gotten used to paying those reduced rates for health insurance and that 400% requirement is now going back in place. 
“That’s going to hit hard, right now especially,” she said. “Even if we estimate their income as under that 400%, if they make one penny over that 400%, then they’re going to pay back all the subsidy that they’ve received at tax time.”
With farmers and others who are self-employed, it can be difficult to estimate income, and Mischler said she’s concerned about people needing to repay thousands of dollars in subsidies. 
 
Political chaos
The government shutdown is tied to the ACA marketplace subsidies, with Democrats saying they won’t support a spending bill until Republicans agree to continue marketplace subsidies set to expire at the end of the year. 
Republicans maintain the Democrats are fighting to keep undocumented immigrants on ACA marketplace insurance. The right-wing group Public Policy Solutions posted on Twitter — and Kansas Speaker of the House Dan Hawkins reposted — that “Democrats chose to shut down the government to fund healthcare for illegal immigrants and keep pandemic-era ObamaCare subsidies flowing to insurance giants.”
Anyone who isn’t in the country legally is not eligible for marketplace insurance.
Gov. Laura Kelly, during a press conference Friday in her role as chairwoman of the Democratic Governors Association, called on Congress to return to session and reinstate ACA subsidies, as well as address Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits that are delayed because of the federal shutdown. 
“We’re here today because our country is at a dire inflection point starting tomorrow,” she said. “Twenty-two million Americans will wake up to see their health care premiums increase by an average of 75%, and 42 million people will lose SNAP benefits and go hungry because DC Republicans sold them out at the behest of Donald Trump.”
Rural communities will be hit the hardest, she said, noting that “dozens” of rural health clinics nationwide have shut down. She also said that Freeman Health System’s plans in Kansas to build a new hospital in Frontenac have been dropped. 
In a statement three weeks ago, Freeman said conditions weren’t feasible to open the hospital at this time, pointing to changes in the One, Big Beautiful Bill Act.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Kansas-Ins-Dept-1024x562.jpeg,,,2025-10-31 17:02:32.120949

On Monday, the Alabama Department of Human Resources (DHR) announced that benefits for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will be suspended in November. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the program, said it would not pay benefits starting Nov. 1, and would also not tap into a contingency fund to pay benefits, even removing mentions of the plan from its website. 
More than 726,000 Alabamians rely on the service, according to DHR, about 15% of the state’s population.
A federal judge in Rhode Island on Friday ordered the USDA to continue paying SNAP benefits through November. It was not immediately clear if the Trump administration would appeal the ruling. 
Local providers prepare
Elmore County Food Pantry has provided more than 25 emergency boxes to furloughed federal employees and SNAP recipients in the last two days, director Jade Skinner said on Friday. Typically, she said the pantry distributes one emergency box per week.
“Anytime someone comes in and says, ‘Hey, I really need help, this is what’s going on.’ We’ve got a box ready for them, for their family members,” Skinner said in an interview Friday.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
According to data from DHR, about 8,100 (8.9%) Elmore County residents received SNAP benefits in September. The food pantry serves both SNAP recipients and those that make less than 185% of the poverty level. That’s an annual income of about $28,900 for an individual and $49,000 for a family of three.
The boxes come to the food pantry from Heart of Alabama Food Bank, each filled with 25 pounds of food for families. Skinner and volunteers add an additional 25 pounds of food to each box.
“In my opinion, that’s not enough for a family to get by with. It’s probably four or five canned goods, two cans of peanut butter, a big thing of applesauce,” she said. “What we’re doing is taking from our inventory and our supply and beefing those boxes up. We’re giving them like some rice, some pasta, dried beans, frozen meats, to supplement and get them by.”
The food pantry allows its customers to shop like a grocery store once every month for free, but there are limits on how much of each item can be taken. Skinner said the pantry usually has about 600 shoppers every month, with each one getting 150-165 pounds of groceries.
With the influx of need, Skinner said the pantry needs volunteers, donations, monetary and items, but to prioritize donating food that could be used more than once.
“When someone donates money to us, we can buy in bulk from the Heart of Alabama Food Bank, and $1 can provide five to six pounds of food. Whereas, if you or I were to go to the grocery store and buy just a simple can of food, it’s going to be $1 and some change,” Skinner said. “We accept food and monetary donations but, monetary donations go a lot further.”
A message seeking comment from the Heart of Alabama Food Bank was left Friday.
West Alabama Food Bank is another food pantry that has seen increased operations.
“We have increased our mobile pantries. Instead of doing three a week, we’re doing between five and six a week,” West Alabama Food Bank Director Jean Rykaczewski said Friday.
Rykaczewski also said grocery stores across the state are offering deals for SNAP recipients and said those who still have funds available will be able to use them.
“The SNAP machine doesn’t turn off in the state of Alabama. Some states it does. In the state of Alabama, it does not. So you can still utilize your funds. We urge everybody to get on the app and set their card up and lock it so that their funds can’t be stolen if they have money on there,” she said.
Laura Lester, the director of Feeding Alabama, who works with food banks across the state including West Alabama Food Bank, said Friday while food banks began preparing at the beginning of the government shutdown, they alone cannot supply enough meals to families.
“For every one meal we provide, SNAP provides nine, right? That is a gap that cannot be filled, and we will do what we can with what we have for as long as we can,” Lester said. “But I can’t tell you what’s going to happen, or how long you know we’ll be able to help feeding the communities, because we’ve never, ever thought about or experienced anything like this before.”
Lester also said holiday food items are already being used by some food banks.
“One of our food banks explained that the food that she had ordered and had on stock for the holidays, she’s already had to pull that to hand out earlier than they had anticipated, and she’s simply hoping that they can backfill it,” she said.

Alabama Democrats call for state aid

Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), Alabama officials were aware that federal funding for SNAP would be reduced in fiscal year 2027, increasing the state’s share. According to estimates in August, the federal cuts to the program would increase DHR’s budget request by $35 million in FY27 and $208 million in FY28 when the state is responsible for 10% of SNAP benefits. 
The suspension of benefits for the 100% federally-funded program comes amid a month-long federal government shutdown, which is primarily a dispute over health care. Republicans in Congress lack the votes to overcome a budget filibuster. Democrats say they want a bipartisan agreement to extend subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans. Republicans said they won’t negotiate that until a stopgap spending bill is passed. 
Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin announced Thursday he would pull $1 million from the city’s reserve fund to help the 86,318 Jefferson County residents, about 13% of the county, who receive SNAP benefits. 
“Birmingham will not sit around and let our children and families starve. We are taking immediate action because we have a moral obligation to take care of the general welfare of our residents,” Woodfin said in a statement posted to Facebook. “We are launching an emergency food relief fund and a citywide food drive starting next week in partnership with United Way, Christian Service Ministries, and faith and community groups across all 99 neighborhoods.”
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is giving the state’s food banks a $4 million boost from its DHR budget. 
Alabama Democrats are calling on Gov. Kay Ivey to use state emergency fund to feed those losing assistance. Gina Maiola, communications director for Ivey’s office, did not directly respond to a question about the emergency fund. 
“Gov. Ivey remains hopeful U.S. Senate Democrats will come to their senses and do their job to reopen the federal government,” Maiola said.
Democrats in the Alabama Legislature are holding a press conference Monday morning at the State House, urging Ivey to call a special session to address funding for SNAP in the state. 
“We all recognize that this is a federal issue, but we cannot ignore its impact on Alabama where over 750,000 of our neighbors could go hungry,” Sen. Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro said in a statement. “The governor needs to call a special session so that we can deal with this crisis immediately and then we can use our rainy day funds to feed families until the federal government reaches a solution.”
About half of SNAP recipients in the state are children, according to DHR.
“No kid should go to bed hungry in Alabama simply because politicians in Washington can’t reach an agreement,” House Minority Leader Anthony Daniels, D-Huntsville said in a statement. “As legislators, we have a moral obligation to address this crisis and use state resources to bridge the gap.”
Maiola said Monday that funding SNAP is not the governor’s job.
“As Alabama DHR noted, SNAP benefits are 100% federally funded, and therefore, U.S. Food and Nutrition Services controls the issuance of these benefits on EBT cards. While the state does not have extra money to do Congress’ job, Governor Ivey hopes to see U.S. Senate Democrats get on board to reopen the federal government,” she said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gettyimages-1287472642-2048x1365-1-1024x6831746533271-11761149882.jpg,,,2025-10-31 17:02:32.120949
,DC,2025-10-31 20:13:04+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Effects of government shutdown spread on day 31, from health costs to food to flights","Ariana Figueroa, Shauneen Miranda",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/effects-government-shutdown-spread-day-31-health-costs-food-flights,,"WASHINGTON — By Saturday, millions of Americans are expected to face a drastic spike in health care premium costs during open enrollment, though a hunger crisis may have been temporarily averted, both tied to the ongoing government shutdown.A federal judge in Massachusetts Friday afternoon found that the U.S. Department of Agriculture acted unlawfully in deciding to withhold billions in emergency funding for 42 million people who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, amid a government shutdown.But while the ruling does not order USDA to immediately tap into its roughly $6 billion contingency fund, a separate ruling from a federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the agency to continue the payments after a coalition of religious and advocacy groups sued.Prior to both rulings, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins defended USDA’s decision to not use the contingency fund during a Friday press conference at the U.S. Capitol with House Speaker Mike Johnson on day 31 of the government shutdown. “We are here today because SNAP benefits run dry tomorrow, so the truth has finally revealed itself, hasn't it?” Rollins said. “Democrats’ support for programs like SNAP is now reduced to cynical control over people’s lives.”It was not yet clear midday Friday how the two court rulings would be carried out by the administration.The move to cut off SNAP would leave millions hungry, nearly 40% of them children, and is an effort by the Trump administration to put pressure on Senate Democrats to accept the House-passed GOP stopgap spending bill to fund the government until Nov. 21. Senate Democrats have held out demanding action on tax credits that will expire at the end of the year for people who buy their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, hugely driving up costs. They have tried to spark negotiations, but Republicans have maintained that talks on health care subsidies will only begin after the government is funded. Flight delays, filibuster fate As the government shutdown continues, millions of federal workers are furloughed, or have continued to work without pay, including air traffic controllers. Flight delays and cancellations are starting to mount, with 3,739 delays within, into or out of the United States and 364 cancellations within the United States by midday Friday, according to the FlightAware delays tracker.Another shutdown complication emerged when President Donald Trump, who has spent most of the week abroad in Asia meeting with foreign leaders over trade and tariff talks, Thursday night urged Republicans to eliminate the Senate filibuster, which requires a 60-vote threshold. “Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!” Trump wrote on his social media platform. Senate Republicans have been lukewarm on the idea, since Democrats then could do the same if they regain control of the chamber now held by the GOP with 53 seats.Lacking 60 votes, the Senate has failed 13 times to pass the House-passed stopgap spending measure and left Capitol Hill Thursday night. Democrat Sen. Jacky Rosen from Nevada tried to keep the Senate in session, but was overruled by Republicans. Another critical deadline approaching Friday was pay for active duty military members. Vice President JD Vance said the Trump administration would shuffle funds to ensure pay, but did not detail those plans. According to Axios, the Defense Department pulled billions from several accounts to ensure the troops could be paid. Rollins defends USDA refusal to pay benefitsCongress failed to fund SNAP and nearly every other discretionary federal program for the 2026 fiscal year that began Oct. 1.In order to receive SNAP benefits, a household’s gross monthly income must be at or below 130% of the federal poverty guidelines. A family of four would receive a SNAP maximum monthly allotment of $994, according to USDA.Rollins sought to justify her agency’s refusal to shuffle the contingency funds to pay for SNAP, saying that money “is only allowed to flow if the underlying program is funded,” and “by law, a contingency fund can only flow when the underlying fund is flowing.” The Agriculture secretary said that “even if it could flow, it doesn’t even cover half of the month of November.” USDA said in a memo earlier in October that it would not tap into the contingency fund to keep the program afloat in November, despite its since-deleted Sept. 30 shutdown plan saying it would tap into this reserve. The memo said the contingency fund “is a source of funds for contingencies, such as the Disaster SNAP program, which provides food purchasing benefits for individuals in disaster areas, including natural disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods, that can come on quickly and without notice.” Democrats have objected. Friday’s decision from a federal judge in Boston stems from a lawsuit brought by 25 states and the District of Columbia against the Trump administration to force USDA to use the contingency fund. USDA secretary recounts conversation with waiterAt the Capitol press conference, Rollins also recalled a recent encounter she had at a Louisiana restaurant with a “wonderful” waiter named Joe, who she said took on that job after being furloughed as a federal government employee due to the shutdown. “He didn't know who I was. And I said, 'Well, Joe, I can appreciate that. You know, I'm sort of in that world as well.' And I said, 'Where do you work?' And he said, 'Well, I work for the U.S. Department of Agriculture in their New Orleans office as part of the financial team.'""Rollins said that encounter “just really brought home for me ... to echo what Mike (Johnson) said, just thanking so many thousands of federal workers who are showing up, who are still doing their job, who aren’t getting paid, those that are now concerned about putting food on the table and making their mortgages and paying their rent.” Rollins, along with the rest of the president's Cabinet, is still getting paid.Health premiums skyrocketAs open enrollment begins Saturday, those enrollees in the Affordable Care Act marketplace who currently receive a tax credit are likely to see their monthly premium payments more than double to about 114% on average, according to an analysis by KFF. For the last month, Democrats have warned of this, as the tax credits that help pay for individual health insurance are set to expire at the end of the year. The top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, said in a statement that many families will see an increase in their premiums on Nov. 1.“The sticker shock many families will face when they shop for health coverage is unacceptable, and it’s why Congress must act,” Pallone said.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that if Congress does not extend the tax credits, insurers expect healthy, younger people to drop their marketplace coverage plans, which will lead to increased premium costs. Anxiety over WIC programMeanwhile, USDA’s Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, or WIC, a program separate from SNAP, got a $300 million infusion from the agency, using tariff revenue, to keep the program running through October. The program provides nearly 7 million women, infants and children with healthy foods, breastfeeding support, nutrition education and other resources. Advocates are calling on the administration to supply additional emergency funds for WIC. Led by the National WIC Association, more than three dozen national organizations signed on to an Oct. 24 letter to the White House urging the administration to provide an additional $300 million in emergency funding. Head Start affectedThe consequences of the shutdown are also hitting Head Start — a federal program that provides early childhood education, nutritious meals, health screenings and other support services to low-income families and served more than 790,000 children in the 2023-2024 program year. The National Head Start Association estimates that 140 programs across 41 states and Puerto Rico serving more than 65,000 children will not receive their operational funding if the shutdown continues past Nov. 1 — a reality that appears certain.Six of those programs serving more than 6,500 children did not receive this funding on Oct. 1 and have had to look to outside resources and local funds to keep their programs afloat. SNAP, WIC and Native communities American Indian and Alaska Native communities are also scrambling to fill the anticipated gaps in food security and assistance due to funding uncertainties for SNAP and WIC. Advocates and U.S. senators across the aisle say these funding uncertainties for the key federal nutrition programs are putting particular pressure on Native communities. At an Oct. 29 Senate Indian Affairs Committee hearing on the shutdown’s impacts on tribal communities, Minnesota Democratic Sen. Tina Smith said she is hearing from tribal nations in her state about people switching from SNAP to the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations, or FDPIR, a separate USDA initiative.FDPIR is an alternative to SNAP and, per USDA, provides foods “to income-eligible households living on Indian reservations, and to American Indian households residing in approved areas near reservations and in Oklahoma.”",,,,2025-10-31 16:17:03.636531

(Photo by Jeffrey Sauger for General Motors)General Motors is set to lay off 3,400 workers at facilities building electric vehicles, including more than a thousand employees at a plant in Detroit, according to a report from the Detroit News on Wednesday.
While GM, one of the Detroit Three automakers, did not respond to a request for comment, the News reported that 1,200 workers at the Factory Zero Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center would be left without a job, with cuts based on seniority.
Jesse Lee, senior advisor for Climate Power, a strategic communications organization focused on promoting progress on climate issues, laid the blame at President Donald Trump’s feet, with his administration working to eliminate federal support for electric vehicles.
“Trump’s full-scale assault on clean energy manufacturing is serving Americans with pink slips and skyrocketing energy bills, while giving China a competitive edge in the automotive industry,” Lee said, arguing that Republicans will answer for their support of Trump’s anti-electric vehicle policies in the 2026 midterm election.
Earlier this month, GM canceled plans for a $55 million hydrogen fuel cell factory in Detroit, which was set to create 140 new jobs. Crain’s Detroit Business reported that the decision was based on a lack of hydrogen infrastructure and longer-than-expected transition to electric vehicles, alongside the Department of Energy’s plans to eliminate funding awards supporting 223 unspecified projects.

(Photo courtesy of West Virginia Department of Health)Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s $60 million sale of West Virginia’s four long-term nursing homes closes Friday, placing the facilities under private ownership after many lawmakers for years have said no to the change.
The hospitals, which mostly serve elderly patients using Medicaid, were operating at $6 million annual financial loss to the state. 
The buyers, New York-based developer Marx Development Group and its subsidiary, Majestic Care, are contractually required to build at least three new hospitals on a set timeline, according to documents obtained through a public records request. The four hospitals need $3.9 million in deferred maintenance. 
Majestic Care could potentially build the new hospitals in undetermined locations because it isn’t required to rebuild at the current hospital sites. 
In Beckley, local officials still have many questions and concerns about the future of FRMS Health Systems that operates on the same property as Jackie Withrow Hospital, which is being sold. 
“FMRS is on the same tract of land, and I guess nobody even considered that when they decided they wanted to sell this thing to somebody,” said Raleigh County Commissioner Daniel Hall. “FMRS provides tons of valuable services through Raleigh County and three other counties. We just can’t allow this to just go away.”
FMRS offers adult and children’s behavioral health services, including outpatient psychiatric services. It’s one of the state’s 13 comprehensive behavioral health centers and includes crisis stabilization that helps people get stabilized to prevent them from being hospitalized. 
“We keep a lot of people out of the hospital and keep them functioning in the community,” said Randy Venable, chief executive officer at FMRS.
With the sale being finalized, Venable said it was unclear what would happen in the future.
“To have to relocate with short notice, it would be very difficult for sure, because I don’t know of an existing building that we could move into in short notice,” he said. “Of course, the financial strain would be pretty significant as well.”
“You don’t really know what’s going to happen with a private entity,” he added.
Majestic Care did not respond to an email with questions for this story. 
The Raleigh County Commission sent a letter to the governor earlier this month asking that the FMRS facilities be carved out from the sale of Jackie Withrow, but the sale wasn’t changed.
Del. Carl “Bill” Roop, R-Raleigh
“What I had proposed to the governor’s office is there’s 9.2 acres, what I call below the road that separated from the Jackie Withrow hospital, then that could easily be cut out of this sale,” said Raleigh County Attorney Bill Roop, who also serves in the state House of Delegates.
The state’s contract with MDG requires the company to assume the lease agreement between FMRS two years with the possibility to renew. If they terminate it, the company would have six months to relocate, according to Venable. 
“If two years from now they decide to use this property for something else, we’ve been given a six month period to try to figure out how to relocate, which would be probably next to impossible,” he said.
Jackie Withrow hospital also contains incarcerated individuals with the Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation. The state’s jails are overcrowded, and DCR would have to absorb the inmates should Majestic Care decide that it no longer wants to operate a floor for corrections. 
Hall said Raleigh County officials spoke with the governor’s office over the issue ahead of the sale closing date. 
“They’ve listened to what we’ve told them … but, there’s been no response really, no direction of what’s going to happen,” he said.
Morrisey didn’t return a request for comment about communication issues surrounding the sale of Jackie Withrow.
“I think it’s very important that everybody knows what’s going to happen — FRMS and [corrections], because this is not something that we can just pack our bags and move out tomorrow,” Roop said. “I think the sooner that we have a permanent plan, the better. I mean longer than two years.”
Sen. Rollan Roberts, R-Raleigh
Sen. Rollan Roberts, R-Raleigh, also hoped that there’d soon be a long-term plan for FMRS.
“With COVID and the challenges of society these days, I think, more than than ever, we need to have these kinds of facilities available so that we can help people with their mental health issues,” he said. 
Earlier this week, a judge ruled that Morrisey and Department of Health Facilities Secretary Michael Caruso had legal authority to sell the long-term care hospitals without the Legislature’s approval based on a 2023 bill that created the facilites department. 
During the hearing, lawyers representing Morrisey said around 90% of employees are staying on to work with Majestic Care. Additionally, the company has committed to keeping current patients. 
Morrisey told reporters that the sale “is a better deal for all the people that are getting care of those facilities.” “I’m excited about that,” he added.

The beginning of open enrollment comes as the federal government shutdown continues amid disagreements in Congress about the future of federal subsidies for these health insurance policies, which are available under the Affordable Care Act. 
These tax credits are set to expire at the end of the year without an extension from Congress. Democrats have refused to vote to end the shutdown without Republicans agreeing to extend the subsidies. 
Premiums for individual insurance bought on the Washington Health Benefit Exchange are rising an average of 21%, due in part to the loss of these enhanced tax credits, which started during the COVID pandemic. This increase is in line with similar hikes nationwide. The average growth rate last year was 10.7% in Washington.
The state Office of the Insurance Commissioner estimates the increase this year would be 6% or 7% less if the tax credits continued.
Though at this point, it’s unclear how ​​Congress deciding to extend the tax credits would affect premiums now that open enrollment is beginning. 
The Washington exchange’s CEO, Ingrid Ulrey, said last week that if Congress takes action, “we are committed to delivering that relief to our customers as quickly as possible.” 
Nearly 300,000 Washington residents buy insurance on the exchange. About three-quarters of them qualified for the federal tax credits, helping them decrease annual premiums by an average of $1,330. For seniors, those savings jump to more than $1,900 annually.
The exchange is used by people who do not have access to health insurance through their jobs or from government programs, like Medicaid. 
In some parts of Washington, enrollees who benefit from the tax credits could see their premiums double without them. The hardest-hit spots are in rural areas of eastern Washington, according to a report from U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash.
State officials expect 80,000 people to now forgo health insurance if the credits aren’t extended. Washington’s uninsured rate has been improving for years, to 4.8% in 2023. Officials worry the end of the subsidies will cause the state to backslide on that progress.
“That means higher costs and strains on our health care system as people put off preventative care,” state Insurance Commissioner Patty Kuderer said Thursday. “These effects will be felt by people across the state, but will hurt some of our rural communities the hardest.”
Those who choose to go without insurance are more likely to be healthy, likely fueling further premium hikes for those who remain insured, as the insurance pool would be less healthy overall and more risky for insurers.
The state still offers options for financial help, including Cascade Care Savings for people who make up to 250% of the federal poverty line. The premium assistance program, launched in 2023, helps nearly 100,000 residents.
Washington’s exchange is seeking $130 million per year in state funding for Cascade Care Savings to mitigate the loss of the federal tax credits. This would require legislative approval.
Open enrollment will run through Jan. 15. To begin coverage by Jan. 1, enrollees should sign up by Dec. 15. Those who apply later will have their plans begin Feb. 1. Existing customers will be automatically renewed, but can still shop around and compare plans.

(Getty Images)Louisiana intends to step in for the federal government in November and provide food aid for most of the state’s needy. But those benefits will trickle out in weekly installments instead of all at once.
Plus, the federal government shutdown that will halt Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program payments starting Saturday has also led the state to furlough 786 employees who help distribute benefits, the Louisiana Department of Health announced Friday. They have been told not to report to work Monday. Another 298 LDH workers in its SNAP section are considered “essential” and will remain on the job. 
The elderly, disabled and children are typically first in line to have SNAP funds loaded on their electronic benefits transfer cards at the start of the month. Everyone else who qualifies for assistance then receives their assistant in numerical order based on their Social Security number. 
Starting Saturday, Louisiana will issue SNAP recipients 25% of their typical monthly benefits. An additional 25% will be loaded onto their EBT cards each week as long as the government shutdown continues.
Average monthly SNAP payments for an individual in Louisiana are just short of $400. A family of four receives around $950, with income and other factors impacting the amount.
Louisiana is poised to handle food aid for some 793,000 SNAP recipients as federal courts weigh in on lawsuits from Democratic state and city leaders and nonprofit groups against the Trump administration for withholding the benefits. 
In Boston, a judge ruled Friday the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s plan to pause SNAP payments is illegal, but she gave the government until Monday to respond to her findings before she orders payments to be issued. A Rhode Island judge in a similar case has issued a temporary restraining order that requires the USDA to dole out SNAP starting Saturday.          
In an emergency declaration last week, Gov. Jeff Landry has directed the state health department to redirect $147 million of its resources to cover SNAP benefits for November. He said this week the benefits will be made available to the elderly, disabled and children from qualifying families, who together total about 793,000 recipients. Another 53,000 SNAP recipients, who the governor described as “able-bodied,” will not receive assistance and are being directed to food banks to meet their needs. 
Landry also encouraged those who won’t get SNAP benefits in November to apply for jobs, though his administration has not said how many people within the group of 53,000 are already working but still rely on food aid.    
Should the government shutdown last beyond November, Landry said he would draw from a state reserve revenue account to continue providing food benefits.

Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland) speaks at a ""Yes to Wind"" news conference in Baltimore on Oct. 31, 2025. Van Hollen joined a group of elected officials and advocates backing Maryland's offshore wind project, which already has all of its federal permits, amid attacks by the Trump administration.Advocates and lawmakers gathered in Baltimore on Friday to punch back at President Donald Trump’s assault on offshore wind projects, including one planned for Maryland’s coast.
Until Friday, the battle had largely played out in warring court documents traded between the Trump administration and US Wind, the company behind the proposal for up to 121 turbines off the coast of Ocean City.
In September, Trump’s Department of the Interior told a federal judge that it plans to revoke a critical federal permit issued to the US Wind project in the dying days of President Joe Biden’s administration.
The permit had been challenged by the Town of Ocean City, which welcomed the permit reversal. But the judge is still considering the government’s request, which has been ardently opposed by US Wind.
The event in Baltimore was the first of several “Yes to Wind” events planned for states across the country, and attracted two Maryland Democrats: U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen and U.S. Rep. Johnny Olszewski.

“What you’re seeing here is people power. Because what you’re seeing from President Trump in the White House right now is a tip of the hat to the Big Oil guys,” Van Hollen said. “They don’t like the competition.”
Earlier this year, a coalition of Maryland climate groups, labor unions and renewable energy advocates joined to form the Offshore Wind Alliance. They’ve squared up against the Stop Offshore Wind coalition, sponsored by the Town of Ocean City, Worcester County and business groups from the beach town.
But not everyone on Maryland’s Eastern Shore opposes the project, said Jared Schablein, chairman of the civic organization Shore Progress.
“This project injects new life into our local workforce by bringing real jobs, real investment and real hope into my community,” Schablein said. “It’s about making sure the next generation of shore kids don’t have to move away to find opportunities.”
Much of the messaging on Friday was focused on the economics behind the wind project, with supporters arguing that the project will lower utility bills by bolstering power supply.
“Offshore wind means lower utility bills. Let me say it again: Offshore wind means lower utility bills,” Olszewski said. “Blocking these projects will not lower costs, it will raise them.”
The project’s opponents have argued that, in addition to hurting Ocean City tourism and coastal fisheries, the project will raise power bills, partly because of construction costs.
Paul Pinsky, director of the Maryland Energy Administration, said it’s possible that the wind farm could cause a “blip” for ratepayers, but urged Marylanders to take a long-term view of the project’s economics.
“With many of these energy projects, whether it’s rooftop solar or offshore wind, there’s an upfront cost, but it can get recovered fairly quickly, and once it’s recovered, the price drops considerably,” Pinsky said.
A January study from the Energy Administration indicated that Maryland is “below trajectory to meet its existing clean energy targets, in particular those renewable targets set for 2030.” The state has an overall goal of reaching 100% carbon-free energy by 2035.
The Trump administration began by halting the issuance of any new offshore wind leases off the coast of the United States. But the administration has since begun targeting projects that already received federal approval — and in some cases, had already started construction, unlike Maryland’s project.
The Trump administration has issued “stop work” orders to Empire Wind in New York (which was rescinded after negotiations with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul) and to Revolution Wind in Rhode Island (which was overturned by a federal judge).
In Maryland, the administration requested to revoke the project’s approval, citing a need to review impacts on coastal fisheries and search-and-rescue efforts in the area.
“It wasn’t enough to raise taxes on clean energy. It wasn’t enough for them to stop offshore wind leases,” said Maryland Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D- Montgomery). “They had to actually do stop work orders on projects that were 80% complete, because that’s how much their billionaire fossil fuel buddies are threatened by offshore wind.”

The administration also rescinded $679 million in grant funding for port projects in the U.S., including some tied to offshore wind manufacturing. That included $47.4 million bound for the Sparrows Point Steel turbine manufacturing hub planned for Baltimore County.
“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy said in a news release at the time.
“This is an administration that has explicitly gone after clean energy projects in Democratic-led states and Democratic-led districts,” Olszewski said. “That is not who we are as Americans. We are better than that.”
Friday’s news conference was held at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 24 office in Baltimore, which also includes a training center for future electricians.
The center trains about 600 apprentices each year, said Rico Albacarys, political director for the union. In high-voltage training courses taught toward the end of apprentices’ four years of study, the students work on the types of thick cables that run through wind turbines, Albacarys said.
To work on building Maryland’s first offshore wind farm, though, electricians will need a special certification that isn’t offered at the center on Patapsco Avenue in West Baltimore.
Called global wind organization training, the certification costs about $2,000 per person, and it only lasts for two years, Albacarys said. So the Trump administration’s efforts to slow the US Wind project have made it more difficult for the union to plan when it will train its members, Albacarys said.
“We’re trying to thread the needle,” Albacarys said. “We don’t want to start training them too early [so] that they have to get recertified before they actually are able to work on the turbines.”
Regardless of the recent obstacles, Albacarys said he’s confident that Maryland will eventually gain a wind farm on its Atlantic coast.
“It’s only a matter of time,” Albacarys said. “I know it doesn’t feel that way right now, but I think 20 years from now, we’re looking back at: ‘Oh, remember that speed bump?’”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)State officials on Friday delivered a Halloween treat for Rhode Island: The potential that Bryant University may serve as a base camp for one of the national soccer teams competing in the 2026 World Cup.
Tournament hosts FIFA on Oct. 1 added the private university in Smithfield to its list of potential base camps when the quadrennial tournament comes to North America next summer — the only location in New England to make the global soccer organization’s brochure.
The region already has a confirmed role in tournament play, with seven matches scheduled from June 13 to July 9 at Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, Massachusetts, which is roughly 30 miles from Bryant.
“I see this as a great opportunity for Rhode Island,” Gov. Dan McKee told reporters and officials gathered inside Bryant’s new 43,000-square-foot field house. “When we build things, excitement comes.”
Which team could call Bryant its temporary home will be made clear over the winter after FIFA’s World Cup draw at The Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. on Dec. 5. The draw will divide 48 teams into 12 groups of four. FIFA will then release a schedule of which teams will play at Gillette.
McKee and Bryant officials are certain FIFA will keep Rhode Island in the mix because of the $40 million field house that opened in August. 
Bill Smith, vice president of athletics and recreation for the university, highlighted the building’s glass-enclosed treatment rooms, classroom-sized film room, ample locker space, and easy access from the second-floor press box to Bryant’s grass soccer fields.
“I promise that whatever national team is fortunate enough to select us as their team base camp, we are going to bring that same energy and commitment to excellence as them as well,” Smith said.
McKee pointed to the university’s history as the New England Patriots’ training camp site from the late 1970s to 2002 and as the first home of Rhode Island FC before the state’s only professional team moved to Centreville Bank Stadium in Pawtucket.
“We know that Bryant can get it done,” McKee said.

A team’s commitment does not have to be made until February, former Rhode Island Commerce Secretary Liz Tanner told Rhode Island Current after the press conference.
Tanner is heading Ocean State 2026, a nonprofit formed by the state in June to lead business sponsorship efforts on tournament-related activities in Rhode Island. State officials predict the Massachusetts matches will generate more than $330 million in local economic impact. Ocean State 2026 does not yet appear to have an active website.
But there’s a possibility the games won’t come to Gillette. 
President Donald Trump on Oct. 15 threatened to move World Cup matches out of the Boston area over what he called “street takeovers” in the city. FIFA has acknowledged that the U.S. federal government does ultimately have the final say on World Cup host cities.
Tanner said that despite those threats, the state’s World Cup nonprofit is continuing with the assumption that matches will continue in Foxboro.
“Contracts have been signed, commitments have been made,” she told Rhode Island Current.
Providence Mayor Brett Smiley is already pitching the capital as a destination for visiting fans and athletes, with plans for citywide viewing parties and celebrations during the tournament.
“The hospitality that visitors will experience in our capital city, and really throughout Rhode Island, will be second to none,” he said. “They will know and experience our incredible restaurants, our amazing hoteliers, the arts and culture that define us as a city and a region.” 
“This is our moment to shine,” General Treasurer James Diossa, who also serves as chairman of Ocean State 2026, said.

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-31 19:55:14+00:00,Mississippi Today,Gov. Tate Reeves seeks ban on sugary food and drinks paid for with SNAP benefits,Gwen Dilworth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/31/reeves-snap-benefits-sugar/,"Mississippi will seek a waiver that would restrict the use of food assistance benefits to purchase sugary food and drinks, Republican Gov. Tate Reeves announced Friday.","Mississippi will seek a waiver that would restrict the use of food assistance benefits to purchase sugary food and drinks, Republican Gov. Tate Reeves announced Friday. 
The announcement comes as thousands of Mississippi families face the loss of Supplemental Food Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits beginning Saturday as a result of the ongoing federal government shutdown.
In addition, purchasing hot prepared chicken with SNAP benefits would be allowed if the federal government accepts the state’s waiver application. If approved, the changes will take effect in January 2027. 
“In a nation that is printing money daily just to make our debt payments, it doesn’t make sense to throw your tax money at anything other than the true necessities,” Reeves said in a statement. 
“So it makes no sense at all to fund sugar instead of hearty nutritious meals. That’s why we’re amending our food stamp rules to allow good sustaining food like rotisserie chickens and disallow sugary candy and drinks.”
Federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ordered the Trump administration Friday to use emergency funds to continue SNAP payments. It was not clear how quickly people would be able to access their benefits, a process that can take one to two weeks, according to the Associated Press.
The Mississippi Department of Human Services said it could not yet comment on how the ruling will impact distribution of SNAP benefits in the state for November.

Food assistance has continued to flow in past shutdowns, but the federal government has said it cannot use emergency funds to pay for the program during the ongoing shutdown. 
Reeves has not indicated he will move for Mississippi to bridge the gap in the food assistance program until the federal shutdown ends. Democratic and Republican governors in a handful of other states, including Louisiana, have pledged to use state funds to cover all or part of the program.
Dr. Patricia Tibbs, the president of the Mississippi Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said she shares Reeves’ goal of promoting healthy eating, but believes that state leaders must first address the loss of benefits that will begin Saturday. 
“While efforts to encourage healthier food choices are commendable, restricting options without ensuring consistent access to food first risks worsening hunger in already vulnerable homes,” she said in a written statement to Mississippi Today. 
“It is difficult to talk about ‘healthy choices’ when families face empty refrigerators.” 
Twelve other states, overwhelmingly led by Republican governors, have been approved this year for waivers that ban the purchase of sugary foods and drinks by the United States Department of Agriculture, which oversees the food assistance program. The approved changes will take effect next year. 
Some states have been approved for or requested waivers that allow for the purchase of hot chicken. SNAP benefits can not currently be used to buy any foods that are hot at the point of sale.
Mississippi’s waiver asks the federal government to approve the following changes to SNAP: 

Banning purchases of processed foods that list sugar, cane sugar, corn syrup or high fructose corn syrup as the first two ingredients. The restrictions do not include foods with granulated sugar, raw sugar, and other single-ingredient sugars used for cooking and baking listed as the first two ingredients.
Banning purchases of beverages that list carbonated water and sugar, cane sugar, corn syrup or high fructose corn syrup as the first two ingredients. Drinks that list aspartame or other low- or noncaloric sweeteners as the first two ingredients will remain eligible.
Making hot prepared chicken eligible for purchase using SNAP benefits, including items like rotisserie and non-fried, non-breaded chicken. The state also plans to collaborate with the Double Up Food Bucks Program to encourage people to buy fresh fruits and vegetables with purchases of hot prepared chicken.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has pushed for the changes as a part of his “make America healthy again” agenda and encouraged states to apply for waivers. 
“For years, SNAP has used taxpayer dollars to fund soda and candy — products that fuel America’s diabetes and chronic disease epidemics,” he said in a statement on Aug. 4. 
About 1 in 8 Mississippians — or about 400,000 people — receive food assistance through SNAP. Two thirds of participants are in families with children, and about 41% are in households with older adults or adults with a disability. 
An August report from state Auditor Shad White found that Mississippi taxpayers would save $22 million annually and improve the health of its citizens by restricting the purchase of certain junk foods with SNAP benefits.
“President Trump is focused on making America healthy again, so we need to make Mississippi healthy again,” said White in a statement. 
“That means a renewed commitment to exercise and teaching our children healthy habits, but it also means using a little more common sense in how we spend taxpayer money on food stamps.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/05132428/3X0A8974.jpg,,,2025-10-31 16:01:31.338899

Oct. 30, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska’s projected budget hole just widened to approximately $451 million following new economic forecasts.
Nebraska’s Economic Forecasting Advisory Board met Friday to update state revenue projections for the current two-year budget cycle. Members lowered their previous tax revenue projections from April by about $367 million over the two years.
The current projected deficit listed in Nebraska’s general fund financial status stands at about $95 million, which would bring the new deficit up to about $462 million if the tally were added straight from Friday’s meeting.
However, Legislative Fiscal Analyst Keisha Patent said several other factors contributing to state finances mean the projected deficit is expected to rise about $355 million, to reach an estimated $451 million gap.
State Sen. Brad von Gillern of Elkhorn, chair of the Legislature’s Revenue Committee, said he expected the deficit would grow prior to Friday’s forecast, based on various signs. The state’s monthly tax receipts have been a mixed bag, and the Nebraska Department of Revenue released a report in September estimating that the “One Big Beautiful Bill” would cost Nebraska’s state government about $216 million over the next two fiscal years.

“We can kind of do the math before we get here,” Von Gillern said after the meeting.
Gov. Jim Pillen, in a statement, acknowledged the lower receipts and said he had anticipated the need for belt-tightening, which is why he said he seeks “critical” work to trim $500 million a year from the budget over the next two years.
“It’s a big number, but it’s necessary as we work to fix the broken property tax system, end special interest carve outs and exemptions and balance our budget,” Pillen said.
In addition to the monthly tax receipts reported on the state Department of Revenue’s website, the forecasting board also got preliminary estimates for October’s receipts. Patent said October revenues are expected to be between $22-$40 million above forecasts.

While the increase in the projected deficit is significant, several board members said they were feeling more optimistic about Nebraska’s economic future than what the current signs indicate.
Some members said the recent decline in revenues are more linked to structural policy decisions than an economic slowdown, a read with which Von Gillern agreed.
“When you cut through the noise, things are actually, from my perspective, really stable and quite optimistic for the state as a whole,” said board member John Kuehn.
Patent and other state officials have noted that some declining revenues that have recently been reported is more due to the timing of when revenue is reported. Larger-than-expected claims of ImagiNE Act tax credits — an economic incentive program for businesses expanding in or relocating to Nebraska — contributed to lower corporate revenues in September, for example.
State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Appropriations Committee, previously told the Examiner that the program was expected to dole out about $36 million in credits over 12 months, but instead it distributed roughly $22 million over the past three months.
Von Gillern said the ImagiNE Act credits are also expected to raise sales tax refunds in the coming months. Sales tax revenues were the only category that rose at all from the forecasting board’s April projections. The board’s sales tax estimates rose by $60 million for fiscal year 2025-26, but dropped $123 million for fiscal year 2026-27.
Regardless of the new forecast, Von Gillern said state lawmakers’ job remains the same when the next session convenes in January — balance the state budget by the time they adjourn in mid-April.
Lawmakers will have updated numbers while they are debating budget adjustments. Patent said the state’s Tax Rate Review Committee meets in November, which will update the exact projected deficit in Nebraska’s financial status. The forecasting board also meets once more, on Feb. 27.

(Photo by Galina Zhigalova/Getty image)Amid uncertainty over the availability of federal funding for food benefits for new moms and young children, Rhode Island is the latest state to tap into its own coffers to keep the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program afloat.
Gov. Dan McKee announced Friday that $600,000 in state funds will be used to ensure the benefit program, typically funded by federal dollars, remains available through November despite the government shutdown.  
“WIC provides essential nutrition and support for women, infants, and children across our state,” McKee said. “Whether it’s standing up for Rhode Islanders being cut off from SNAP by President Trump or protecting families who depend on WIC, Rhode Island will not stand by and do nothing while this crisis hurts the people we serve.” 
The program provides food, education and other resources to nearly 7 million at-risk pregnant, postpartum and breastfeeding individuals nationwide — and 18,000 in Rhode Island —-  nationwide, as well as infants and children up to 5 years old. 
As a discretionary program, WIC is subject to congressional approval each year — making it particularly vulnerable to the ongoing funding lapse. A $300 million federal infusion, including tariff revenue, kept the program afloat through October. And as the shutdown extends into a second month, there are growing concerns that the initial appropriation will run dry.
Similar fears surrounded the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which helps a broader swath of low-income and vulnerable residents afford groceries. On Friday, a pair of federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island separately ordered the Trump administration to tap government contingency funds to keep the food assistance program afloat, though compliance remains unclear. The court orders do not apply to WIC, leaving states scrambling to cover the gap.
McKee’s office did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment Friday afternoon regarding the source of state funds. 
The initial state injection is expected to fund benefits for pregnant and breastfeeding women and young children through the end of November, according to McKee’s office.
If the shutdown continues past Nov. 30, the governor’s office said it will assess the situation.
Community nonprofits that serve as providers where applicants can sign up for the state program praised McKee’s decision in a series of statements Friday afternoon.
 “This program is a vital resource to families, and disruptions in their ability to receive benefits impacts their overall health and well-being,” said Alison Croke, president and CEO of Wood River Health, noting that the medical clinic is the only provider for WIC in Washington County.
Without the contingency funding, 1,400 infants and children who receive food assistance through Meeting Street’s early childhood programs would go hungry, John Kelly, Meeting Street president, said. 
“I am proud to live and work in a state that shares Meeting Street’s values of compassion, respect and inclusivity, by demonstrating — through its actions — that all children in our community have a right to basic nutrition,” Kelly said.

(John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Department of Human Services expects to furlough up to 1,534 employees and temporarily close its local offices within the next week and a half if the federal government does not reopen, the agency announced in a Friday news release.
The government shutdown that began Oct. 1 remained unresolved this week after Congress failed to pass a proposed deal to fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). 
If DHS cannot administer SNAP by Nov. 1, the agency will furlough 34 employees, “and multiple programs that receive federal funding through grants administered by DHS will have to cease those services,” according to the news release.

Food assistance funding cliff approaching as shutdown persists


Those programs include Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Social Services Block Grant (SSBG), and Community Service Block Grant (CSBG) initiatives.
The 34 employees set for immediate furlough are in DHS’ Office of Payment Integrity; Division of Aging, Adult, and Behavioral Health Services; and Division of County Operations.
DHS furloughed 37 employees in the Division of Provider Services and Quality Assurance on Oct. 1, and they remain furloughed, the news release states.
If the shutdown continues through Nov. 7, DHS will temporarily close its offices in all 75 Arkansas counties and furlough 1,500 Division of County Operations employees starting Nov. 10. All of those positions and operations are federally funded.
“The government shutdown has put enormous strain on many services we offer, and we are deeply concerned that important benefits Arkansans rely on will suffer as a result,” DHS Secretary Janet Mann said in the news release. “First and foremost, this will be painful for the beneficiaries we serve, and we regret that we have been placed in this position. It will also be painful for the hundreds of employees within our agency who will not be paid for as long as this shutdown continues.”
SNAP benefits will cease on Nov. 1 without federal action, but DHS’ electronic benefit transfer (EBT) system will still be operational in November in case SNAP recipients have some previous benefits saved, according to the news release.
More than 222,000 individuals and over 118,000 households received SNAP benefits as of Sept. 1, according to another DHS news release.
To alleviate the impact on families losing food assistance, Arkansas will distribute $500,000 among six regional food bank networks, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced Friday morning.
Six Arkansas Head Start locations to close Nov. 1 due to funding loss from government shutdown

The government shutdown’s impact on Arkansas government services has not been limited to DHS.
The Pulaski County locations of Arkansas’ federally-funded early childhood education program, Head Start, will temporarily close Saturday due to a lack of funding, the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences announced last week. The six facilities in Little Rock and North Little Rock serve 446 children from low-income families, and 130 employees will be furloughed.
Another impact of the shutdown on child care is the Department of Education’s lack of access to funds supporting the School Readiness Assistance Program, which helps low-income families access child care. The program was already financially insolvent and had a waitlist of over 1,100, department officials said in September. That waitlist has grown to 1,569, according to the program’s website.
An emergency working group of child care experts proposed a months-long financial solution that the department will decide Friday whether to accept.
The Arkansas Department of Health will continue administering Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) benefits until mid-November if the shutdown does not end by then, department officials said last week.
The eventual reopening of the federal government is expected to cause delays in processing SNAP cases, according to Friday’s DHS news release.
Medicaid benefits will continue uninterrupted because the program is federally funded through the end of the calendar year.

A version of this story by Adora Brown was published on Oct. 29, 2025 by NOTUS. Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.
In Washington, Democrats and national advocates are warning about the growing consequences that the government shutdown will have on Head Start programs across the country.
On Saturday, another wave of funding lapses is set to affect nearly 60,000 more children across 41 states, according to the National Head Start Association.
In Vermont, none of the state’s seven Head Start programs will need to shutter in November, according to Christy Swenson, the Head Start Director at Capstone Community Action and board chair of the Vermont Head Start Association. 
However, several will face temporary closure in early December if the shutdown wears on, Swenson said. Leaders of programs serving two Vermont regions — the Champlain Valley and the Northeast Kingdom — anticipate running out of federal funds by then, they said. 
The federal Head Start program, which provides child care and nutritious meals to more than 700,000 children across the country, and around 1,250 in Vermont, has already faced funding lapses that forced some locations in other states to close completely and others to look for interim funding elsewhere. 
Head Start, together with Early Head Start, aims to serve children from birth to age 5 living in foster care or households with incomes below the federal poverty line, or who are experiencing homelessness. In Vermont, almost one-fifth of children enrolled are unhoused or experiencing housing insecurity, according to an analysis of federal data by a national advocacy group.
“It’s an absolute tragedy,” Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who caucuses with Democrats, said about the upcoming lapses. “And it is beyond comprehension that you have a Republican House, which is now in its fifth week of vacation. Maybe they want to come to work and help us resolve this crisis.”
Head Start is funded on annual cycles, which have starting dates that vary from program to program, Swenson said. Once the commitment is renewed, the process of “drawing down” federal funding as it becomes necessary is not affected by the shutdown, she added.
Champlain Valley Head Start in Burlington is only guaranteed funding through Nov. 1, which means their grant ends on Saturday, Sandra Graves, the program’s director, said on Friday. Her program would be able to stay open through November under a continued shutdown, although only by exhausting its financial reserves, she said.
The program, which is operated by the Champlain Valley Office of Economic Opportunity, serves Chittenden, Addison, Franklin, and Grand Isle counties. Graves’ staff of 63 provides care and programs to 233 enrolled children and their families, she said.
On Dec. 5, in the absence of federal funding or other support, all of the program’s offerings will need to pause, and all staff will be furloughed, Graves said. The annual grant from the federal Office of Head Start is roughly $7.2 million, she said, which represents the program’s entire operating budget save two small state-level grants.
The Head Start program run by Northeast Kingdom Community Action, or NEKCA, has a Dec. 1 funding cycle, but does not possess the financial cushion that Champlain Valley has available, said NEKCA Executive Director Jenna O’Farrell. The program may be able to keep running for a short time after Dec. 1 with a fraction of its previous capacity, but O’Farrell said that isn’t guaranteed.
That program operates eight physical locations across the rural Northeast Kingdom. It serves 160 children and their families, and employs 78 staff members.
Champlain Valley Head Start filed its annual federal funding application on time in August, Graves said. Ordinarily, the request should have been approved in September. But the Office of Head Start has seen cuts to staffing under the Trump administration, and every aspect of Graves’ interaction with federal officials has slowed, she said.
Even once the government opens, Graves has been told her organization’s funding approval might take several weeks. It may be hard to avoid the Dec. 5 deadline even if the shutdown ends in mid-November, she said.
Graves has not heard from the federal Office of Head Start since the shutdown began. Even though reimbursement for stopgap measures would be customary, she said recent federal actions toward other service programs have made her nervous.
The program’s closure would be a “huge, huge loss for our children and families,” Graves said. Apart from being a source of food and services for kids, Champlain Valley Head Start provides child care that allows parents to stay in the workforce, Graves added.
Graves has applied for temporary state funding from the Vermont Emergency Board, which on Wednesday approved a state-funded stopgap for lost federal food assistance. Champlain Valley Head Start will need about $1 million to remain stable over the next two months, Graves said.
O’Farrell said she too plans to apply for funding from the state’s Emergency Board. NEKCA’s Head Start program’s monthly expenses total roughly $450,000.
A closure would cause an “immediate, severe impact on low-income families across our service area,” O’Farrell said. 
Federal finger pointing
Outside of Congress, pressure from nonprofit groups is starting to pick up as Head Start programs look for solutions elsewhere.
“They are working with their states, working with their counties, working with their school districts, looking within their agencies, talking to philanthropic partners, just really trying to do everything that they can to avoid children and families being the collateral damage of the political fights in Washington,” said Tommy Sheridan, the deputy director of the National Head Start Association, a nonprofit that represents Head Start organizations and programs in Washington, D.C.
“They’re not gonna be able to hold that back forever,” Sheridan added.
Across the country, some Head Start programs already lost funding on Oct. 1 when their fiscal year ended, but the Saturday Nov. 1 deadline will have an even bigger effect because programs in the vast majority of states will lose their federal funding.
More than 100 organizations signed a letter released Tuesday, led by the First Five Years Fund, a nonprofit that supports child care and early education programs. In it, they asked Congress to end the shutdown.
“We cannot allow political gridlock to take away opportunities from our youngest learners and their families,” the letter reads.
But the pressure appears to have little effect on Republicans on Capitol Hill, even though lawmakers are aware that programs in their states could close. The Florida Head Start Association wrote in a press release that seven grantees won’t get a federal check on Saturday, bringing the total number of affected children in the state to almost 9,000.
“Isn’t it awful that the Democrats are doing this?” Sen. Ashley Moody, R-Fla., told NOTUS. Her comment is in line with Republicans’ messaging strategy of placing blame on Democrats for the shutdown as they withhold votes due to expiring health care subsidies.
In a statement to NOTUS, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services also tried to place the blame on Democrats.
“More than 58,000 children are on course to lose access to Head Start funding and programs on November 1 due solely to the Democrat-led government shutdown,” a spokesperson for the federal department said in a statement to NOTUS.
Despite the fact that many programs for low-income families are barrelling toward losing federal funding, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and WIC, senators seem no closer to ending the shutdown stalemate.
The home state of Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., would be one of the most affected by Head Start funding lapses. 
When asked what people in Florida are saying about losing programs that help low-income families, Scott said, “They’re fed up with the Democrats shutting down the government.”

Coming the day before federal nutrition support is set to be suspended on Saturday, Horhn said the city is pledging $150,000 for meals and targeted food assistance throughout the metro area. The funding will chiefly support two nonprofits – the Community Foundation of Mississippi and supper meals provided by Jackson Public Schools.
“When neighbors are in need, we rally,” he said. 
The mayor also called on Jacksonians with the means to donate nonperishable goods and money to these efforts, noting he had already pledged $1,000 of his own money. The city funds will come from a suspended program, he said. 
“Let’s make sure no one faces an empty refrigerator or dining table,” he said. 
Fire stations throughout the city will accept donations of nonperishable goods. The National Folk Festival, set for Nov. 7-9, will also have a donation box next to the guest services booth. 
City leaders said food pantries in the metro area need volunteers. 
“One of the things that will constrain us most is if we don’t have the staff and the manpower to meet the needs,” said Jill Buckley, the executive director of Stewpot Community Services. 
In an example of the coordinated effort, Karla McCullough, executive director of the Juanita Sims Doty Foundation, said the nonprofit has over 250 volunteers who can help the pantries process food donations. She also thanked Horhn for his leadership. 
“Youth and community, those are our north stars,” she said. “So wherever they go, whatever they need, this is where we go and we provide what we can to fill the need.” 
In a press release, JPS said it was expanding its supper meal program beginning on Monday. Meals will be available from 4-5:30 p.m. at eight schools in the metro area. Students can eat for free at the schools, and adults can take a meal to go for $4.
“We have long known that our work does not end with the education of our scholars in our classrooms,” Superintendent Errick Greene said at the press conference.
Horhn called on federal lawmakers to “come to their senses” and end the government shutdown. 
“You hear the news about what’s going on with the federal shutdown, but a lot of times we don’t really connect with the impact the shutdown is having on people, on citizens, everyday folks who are just struggling from day to day to make ends meet,” he said. 
Even in times without a crisis, food insecurity is an issue in Jackson, with 33,000 people in Hinds County relying on SNAP, the mayor said. With the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill mandating changes to food assistance to include work requirements for older people and more parents with teenagers, some Jacksonians could lose SNAP even after the federal shutdown ends.
But the wholesale pause of SNAP benefits in November is an extraordinary moment, said Bill Washington, the food pantry manager at New Horizon Church, one of the largest pantries in the metro area.
“So we’ve got to do extraordinary things to overcome this situation,” he said. 
About $6.5 million comes into Hinds County every month because of SNAP, and every dollar spent has nearly double the impact on the local economy, said Jane Alexander, president and CEO of the Community Foundation of Mississippi. This means Hinds County is facing a potential loss of nearly $18 million. Grocery stores will be impacted by the SNAP suspension. So will the city’s sales tax collection. 
To counter this, Alexander said the Community Foundation of Mississippi is looking at restarting an initiative from the pandemic in which they provide about $25 on bulk grocery cards. She has already been in touch with grocery stores throughout the metro area and hopes the foundation will be able to offer the cards as soon as it has the funding. 
“The one single tenant of disaster emergency response is to try to keep the money flowing through the local economy as much as you can,” she said. 
Many food pantries in the metro area limit residents to one box a week, Alexander said, and will be quickly overwhelmed by the need. 
“For an economy that’s very fragile, it has very narrow margins already,” she said. “We want to make sure that when benefits are restored and when some of these efforts pay off, that these outlets are still available in our community.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/31130306/DSC_0549.jpg,,,2025-10-31 16:01:31.338899

William Lawrence, Democratic congressional candidate in Michigan’s 7th District, is holding a 30-hour vigil and food drive outside of the district office of U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte), in protest of the expected lapse in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, also known as SNAP, starting on Nov. 1. 
Lawrence’s team is collecting food to donate to the Greater Lansing Food Bank, and as of about 1 p.m. Friday, had raised an additional $800 in online and cash donations since the vigil began, at that point about 19 hours prior. 
“We’re here in front of Barrett’s office because he is responsible for the SNAP benefits expiring, along with the rest of the Congressional Republicans,” Lawrence said. “If he’s not going to do his part to keep Michigan families fed, we’re gonna do so.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Tom Barrett would rather take food from the hungry than provide care to the sick,” he added. “The easy solution here is to save the Affordable Care Act and keep necessary food assistance.”

“People are going through far worse,” Larence said as it started to rain. “I’m more than happy to sit in the cold for a few hours to call attention to the fact that other people are going hungry and are going bankrupt because of their medical bills. That’s what’s at stake here, and it’s a real pleasure to draw attention to these issues.”
Another Democrat in the race to unseat Barrett, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink, stopped by the vigil, which will last until midnight on Friday, to donate food. 
“I’m really happy to see all of the candidates come out in support of this, on the Democratic side, to call out Tom Barrett and ask him to show leadership with the Republicans in D.C., because all of these things are hurting the people of our community,” Brink said. “We should and we must take care of our most vulnerable.”
Kimberly Phillips, a retired nurse in the Lansing area, also brought food donations to Lawrence’s event. 
“Whatever we can do to get food out there for people who need a helping hand,” she said as to why she came out.

Around Lawrence’s food drive, messages in chalk were scrawled on the sidewalk, which were there when Lawrence and his team arrived. The chalk messages were condemned by Barrett’s office in a statement, where he said, “my congressional office in Lansing was vandalized by a group of trespassers during a political rally of left-wing activists.”
“There is a clear distinction between peaceful protest and harassment, and this failed attempt to intimidate me crossed a line and will not be tolerated,” he continued, adding that the vandalism had taken place during a rally held by Climate Action Campaign, Michigan Families for Fair Care, and Sierra Club Michigan.

Messages in chalk included “Don’t let our kids starve Tom!” and “Show your face Tom.” 
Lawrence noted that he had not yet seen Barrett while hosting his food drive, but that the Congressman’s staff had called the police on Lawrence and his team, who were seated on public property.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Most students who applied for South Carolina’s private K-12 tuition aid program this year were either already attending private school or homeschooled, according to data from the Department of Education.
The law signed by Gov. Henry McMaster in May provided $7,500 scholarships to 10,000 students this school year. It’s unknown exactly how many parents received state aid for tuition they previously paid for themselves. It appears the education agency didn’t actually collect that information.
Instead, the Education Scholarship Trust Fund application asked whether students were entering kindergarten, attended a public school last year, or something else — officially, “other.” Parents selected that “other” category on 59% of the 16,127 applications submitted by mid-August, according to agency data provided to the SC Daily Gazette through a public records request.
They likely attended a private school, though some may have been homeschooled, said Felicity Ropp, whose job with Palmetto Promise Institute involves helping parents sign up for the program. The law does not allow state scholarships for homeschooling.
Also unclear is how many — and which — students ended up on a waitlist. This year, the 10,000 slots were filled on a first-come, first-served basis. According to the application data, at least 10% of parents reported making too much to qualify. But the education agency has not provided a breakdown of how many applicants were deemed ineligible or other specifics about students accepted into the program, including their previous schooling.


Applicants for 2025-26
By mid-August, parents submitted applications for 16,127 students. Here’s the type of school they attended in 2024-25:

None — incoming kindergartener: 2,078
Public school: 3,692
Public charter school: 775
Other: 9,582

Source: S.C. Department of Education


It makes sense that parents of students in private school were quick to apply, said Patrick Kelly, lobbyist for the Palmetto State Teachers Association.
Private schools and private choice advocates were providing information to parents, and getting a scholarship would save them money, he added.
But public schools weren’t spreading the word. The details were also unknown when sign-ups started in mid-January under the previous law — just as debate on the legislation started.
“No one’s going to apply for a program they don’t know exists,” Kelly said, adding that public schools should do a better job of telling parents the money is available.
Application windows
For students getting a scholarship this year — as well as any of their siblings — the early application period for slots next school year opens Saturday, as required by the law passed in the spring. Legislators put priority windows in the law for first dibs on the state-funded scholarships.
The next application round starts Jan. 15 for students attending a public school this year, families making up to 300% of the federal poverty level, and/or children of active-duty military personnel stationed in South Carolina.
Everyone else who’s eligible can start applying Feb. 9. For next school year, that means all families with incomes up to 500% of the federal poverty level. A family of four, for example, qualifies as long as the parents’ income is no more than $160,750, according to the latest poverty guidelines, which increase annually.
By law, at least 15,000 students will be enrolled for aid in 2026-27. The scholarship amount, which rises with state increases in public school spending, is expected to be at least $7,600, according to the Department of Education.
How many students get the taxpayer aid will likely be part of next year’s budget debate. The law set 15,000 as the minimum availability for 2026-27 and beyond. If more eligible students apply, as occurred for this year’s 10,000-student cap, legislators can fund more scholarships.
Up to 1,000 ineligible SC students booted from voucher program, report finds

That is, unless another legal challenge brings payments to a halt.
A state Supreme Court ruling in September 2024 stopped payments for private tuition soon after the program’s start. Justices found those scholarships violated the state constitution’s ban on public money directly benefiting private education. Private donors paid tuition for about 800 students so they could stay in their private schools last school year.
Republican legislators made passing a law to restart the state aid their top priority for 2025. Whether the law signed in May legally skirts the constitution’s rule will likely again be a question for the state’s highest court.
Another lawsuit is coming, said Dena Crews, president of the South Carolina Education Association, which sued last time.
Its lawyers are still gathering and reviewing data as they seek to prove the money still provides a “direct benefit” to private schools.
“Who’s getting the money?” Crews said about the aid. “Is it truly going to families who want to move their child from public school to private school, or is it helping out private schools and their budgets?”
She had no estimate for when the association will file the suit.
Who applied
Under the previous law signed in 2023, students entering the program had to be leaving a public school or entering kindergarten.
The new law threw those limitations out the window.
As long as families meet income eligibility rules, they can apply. For the 10,000 slots this school year, families couldn’t earn more than 300% of the federal poverty level, which is $96,450 for a family of four.
SC House passes bill to revive K-12 vouchers. The bulk of this year’s money will go unused.

The scholarships will be a big help to many parents with students in private school, Ropp said.
Just because they were paying for tuition doesn’t mean they’re well off financially. They may have been scraping by to put their child in private school, she said.
The state aid can also be used for other expenses, such as tutoring and computers, she noted.
“Having any kind of financial relief is just a huge deal for these families,” Ropp said.
According to the application data, just over half of the students, or 8,500, were eligible for Medicaid. That means their parents made less than 210% of federal poverty levels, or $66,900 for a family of four. For over 10% of students, or 1,700, their parents reported incomes above this year’s limits, according to the data.
When legislators passed the 2023 law, supporters presented it as a lifeline for poor children stuck in a failing school because their parents couldn’t afford any other option. But opening it up to existing private school students changes the mission, said Sen. Russell Ott, who opposes the program.
“This is clearly not about trying to help poor kids escape failing schools,” the St. Matthews Democrat said. “What this has morphed into is subsidization of private schools and doing it with public dollars.”
Sen. Wes Climer said his support was never limited to any income bracket. He wants to expand the program even further to make all children eligible for a state scholarship — what’s known as universal school choice.
“The purpose of the program is to provide for robust competition in the education arena,” said the Rock Hill Republican, who’s running for Congress.
SC K-12 school voucher program hits 10,000-student cap, with thousands more rejected

According to the application data, the parents of about 70% of the students reported their children would attend a private school this year. Less than 15% reported wanting to use the money to enroll in a different public school. The rest marked “other,” without clarifying.
If most of the students accepted into the program used it to pay private tuition, those schools might increase tuition, pricing out the students least able to pay the difference, Kelly said.
During debate on the legislation, Republicans repeatedly rejected proposals to cap tuition or bar price hikes on students in the program.
“This time next year, no one should be surprised that the average private school tuition went up in South Carolina,” Kelly said. “That’s the next step.”
Where the money went
For the first half of last school year, Best Buy received far more money than any other single vendor, with families spending nearly $1.4 million there. Another $240,000 went to Staples, according to data from the education agency, which stops on Jan. 17.
That’s the date Rep. Neal Collins, R-Easley, requested a report to share for debate on the House floor. The SC Daily Gazette asked for spending figures through the end of the school year, but the agency wanted more than $2,300 to provide it.
About half of the report’s spending came after the state Supreme Court’s Sept. 11, 2024, ruling, which immediate stopped payments to private schools. The rest of the law stayed intact, allowing families to use their money for other eligible expenses, such as computers.

Even though payments for private tuition had to stop just one month into the school year, a handful of private schools were among the top recipients of money the first semester.
Among schools, Westgate Christian School in Spartanburg topped the list at $63,236, indicating a lot of its students received scholarships. Tuition at Westgate ranges from $5,600 for elementary school to $5,800 for high school, according to the school’s website. Administrators did not respond to a request for comment.
“It’s up to the parents to decide where to send their students,” Ropp said.
Who’s running the program
The new law added a trustee to oversee the program as a response to the state Supreme Court’s concerns. Putting a third-party trustee in charge of scholarship transfers, supporters argued, gets around the constitution’s ban of a “direct benefit” to private schools. Whether justices agree will be for them to decide.
The Department of Education selected Columbia accountant Mark Hobbs on May 28, just three weeks after the law was signed, according to a contract the SC Daily Gazette obtained through a public records request.
It shows that accountants at Hobbs’ firm, The Hobbs Group, will receive $400 per hour to work on parents’ accounts. All other staff will make $125 to $200 per hour.
The agency did not respond to a request for Hobbs’ resume or answer questions about how many people applied.
The law allows the trustee to take up to 5% of the trust fund as payment for overseeing the accounts. The agency must report the actual dollar figure to the Legislature’s budget writers by Dec. 31.
Parents access the scholarship money through an online portal. They do not actually receive any dollars, and they can’t get reimbursed. They must direct through the portal where to send the money.
Hobbs’ job is to move the money to parents’ accounts through four equal installments and then pay the approved vendors, according to his contract.

A retired state judge on Friday denied requests from embattled McKinley County District Attorney Bernadine Martin for an extension in her case. Rather, Martin must respond by early November to the New Mexico Department of Justice’s petition to remove her from office in advance of a three-day trial starting Dec. 1.
The state Supreme Court ruled earlier this month it would move forward with a trial in response to Attorney General Raúl Torrez’s August petition, which cited alleged violations of state law by Martin, among other concerns.
For instance, the petition alleges Martin created a hostile workplace environment; failed to prepare or subpoena witnesses in McKinley County; breached procurement law, despite a prior settlement with state ethics officials; had an “improper reliance” on contract attorneys; and said she continued to work in private legal practice while serving as district attorney, in violation of state law.
In September, New Mexico Department of Justice attorneys took over prosecution of two cases in the Eleventh Judicial District, alleging Martin had improperly dismissed the cases and failed to send them to an outside prosecutor.
State law for the removal of public officials requires a trial without a jury before the Supreme Court justices and establishes the court’s decision as final.
The state’s Supreme Court appointed Special Master Alan Malott, a retired Albuquerque district judge, to act as a trial judge.
In a virtual hearing on Friday, Malott told Martin’s attorney Kathryn Hardy that the court could not accommodate the request for an additional 30 days to respond to the state’s requests for documents, saying the case, which he called a matter of “extreme public interest, has “very tight timelines.”
Malott also noted that any formal objection to the Supreme Court’s order to hold a three-day trial in Santa Fe beginning on Dec. 1, or any other deadlines, would be due by Tuesday, Nov. 4.
Martin has denied all allegations in court filings. A voicemail and text message to Martin were not returned before publication.
In court filings, Martin has argued that the state law allowing for removal of district attorneys should only apply to her current term, which started in January of 2025, after her reelection to office in 2024. She argued it would be “obviously unjust” for the New Mexico Supreme Court to hear evidence “for misconduct [that] may have occurred during a previous term.” She further said the removal of district attorneys should be left either to the state Legislature or voters “when the public official stands for reelection.”
The New Mexico Department of Justice has disagreed, citing state laws that district attorneys may be removed from office in a court proceeding, for certain reasons including: “failure, neglect or refusal” to perform the duties of the office.

Due to the ongoing federal government shutdown, recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, have been informed they would not receive November benefit allotments, if the shutdown persists. 
Iowa food banks said they anticipate “unprecedented” need, across the state, as SNAP benefits cards are empty. Reynolds said the state’s pledged match, along with plans to deploy National Guard troops to help with food distribution, will provide “interim support” to Iowa’s six food banks.

Reynolds joined other GOP lawmakers in blaming the shutdown on congressional Democrats, who have withheld their votes on Republican stopgap spending measures in an effort to address the expiration of tax credits that help reduce the cost of health insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act.
“Dems in the United States Senate don’t seem to care that everyday Americans are suffering while they force the shutdown into another month,” Reynolds said. “We do care here in Iowa, and I know that Iowans do too.” 
Beginning Saturday, existing state funds from the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services will be used to match monetary donations to Iowa food banks, up to $1 million. 
Food banks purchase food in bulk and are able distribute it to food pantries and other organizations throughout designated regions.

Reynolds said she believes the $1 million match will be met based on the “generosity of Iowans and corporate partners” in the state. 
Already, several local businesses like Big Grove Brewery, Hy-Vee, Fareway and Iowa Pork Producers Association have contributed, or pledged, more than $130,000 in cash and food donations to food banks. 
Iowa’s three Medicaid managed care organizations have each committed to donate $100,000 across the six food banks. 
Some states plan to utilize their funds to continue issuing SNAP benefits during the government shutdown. Asked why she chose to match food bank donations instead of using emergency state funds for SNAP, Reynolds pointed to the ongoing shutdown.
“It’s ridiculous,” she said. “Democrats could have voted to keep the government open, and they did not,” the governor said. 
Reynolds opposed the Senate Democrats’ use of a government shutdown as a “negotiating tactic” to try and extend funding for the Affordable Care Act, which she called the “unaffordable” care act. 
“We need to get the government open, we need to continue the budget as is, and then come to the table and negotiate what they want to talk about moving forward,” Reynolds said. 
Democratic attorneys general from nearly two dozen states have sued the Trump administration, urging it to use U.S. Department of Agriculture contingency funds to keep the program afloat during the shutdown. Reynolds also called this lawsuit “ridiculous.”
Iowa alone receives close to $45 million in SNAP benefits each month, according to USDA. 
“We can’t just shift it to the state,” Reynolds said. “States don’t have the funds to be able to do that.” 
Iowa Democrats submitted a letter Thursday to Reynolds and Attorney General Brenna Bird, urging Reynolds to take “immediate action” to protect SNAP benefits in the state and Bird to join other states in the lawsuit calling for the use of contingency funds.
Senate Democratic Leader Janice Weiner, D-Iowa City, Republican leaders are “playing political games” with the country’s well-being.
“Legislative Democrats have spoken in unison and outlined to Gov. Reynolds and Attorney General Bird a plan for state government to step into the gap and prevent Iowans – our friends and neighbors – from going hungry.”
National Guard deployment 
In addition to matching monetary donations to the food bank, Reynolds said National Guard troops will be deployed “as needed” to conduct food distribution missions. 
Adjutant General of the Iowa National Guard Stephen Osborn said the guard will take direction from HHS, but he anticipated the soldiers would help with the movement of food across the state and packing boxes of food for distribution. 
Osborn said he will first ask for volunteer soldiers, but will bring soldiers and airmen onto active state duty. 
While National Guardsmen on federal missions are unpaid during the government shutdown, Reynolds said these soldiers would be paid since it is a state mission. 
In addition to soldier support, the state’s Volunteer Iowa division is working to gather volunteers for food banks and pantries across the state. 
Reynolds has advocated for reform to the SNAP program in the past. In May, her proposed waiver to eliminate foods like candy and soft drinks from SNAP eligible food items was approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
Reynolds said Friday that SNAP, and other federal support programs, have “so much fraud and abuse” that there is a risk of not having the funds to “help those who really need it.” 
According to USDA, nearly 42 million Americans, or 12.3% of residents, received SNAP benefits in 2024. The program serves nearly 270,000 Iowans each month. 
Reynolds said a program of that size needs a “comprehensive review.” 
“My hope is that first of all, the Senate Democrats will stop keeping the government closed and open it back up and really start having those kind of conversations about what we do moving forward,” Reynolds said.

(Photo by Amanda Brown for New Jersey Monitor)[2025 governor's race Voter Guide: Where NJ’s governor hopefuls stand on the issues]POINT PLEASANT — Fox News host Sean Hannity riled up a crowd in this Ocean County town Thursday by reading off polls that show the governor’s race in New Jersey is a dead heat between Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Democrat Mikie Sherrill. 
“I came up here because this is a huge political earthquake. It will rock the nation. It will reverberate all across the country. I really believe it, and I’m fascinated by it, and the country’s fascinated by it,” Hannity said ahead of the taping of a town hall for his nightly show at the Crystal Point Yacht Club. 
Once Ciattarelli joined him on stage, Hannity asked the gubernatorial hopeful how he’s feeling going into Election Day on Tuesday.
“All I can tell you is when I go around the state, the energy is electric. The reception of minority communities has been overwhelmingly positive. And when Democratic mayors across the state are endorsing the Republican nominee, it does a world of good,” Ciattarelli said. 
Hannity’s appearance attracted an enthusiastic crowd. The influential conservative commentator told the crowd before the taping began that he had spoken to President Donald Trump and confirmed Trump would be watching the town hall later.
Hannity asked the crowd of 200 people if they could trust Sherrill. They booed and said “no.” He also referenced allegations that Sherrill was caught up in a cheating scandal during her time at the Naval Academy (she did not participate in her 1994 graduation ceremony, an act she says was punishment for not turning in her classmates).
“We invited Mikie Sherrill on this program to respond to these allegations, but her team just never gets back to us. They must be very busy,” Hannity said.
A spokesperson for the Sherrill campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

Most public polling shows Ciattarelli trailing behind Sherrill by single digits. They’re vying to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy, a term-limited Democrat who will leave office in January.
Both campaigns have brought out big names for the final stretch of the election cycle. Ciattarelli has made stops with Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Florida) and Vivek Ramaswamy of Ohio, and held a tele-rally with Trump last week. Sherrill is set to appear with former President Barack Obama in Newark on Saturday.
Throughout the hour-long taping with Hannity, Ciattarelli repeated much of his regular stump speech, touting his plans to do away with the state’s Immigrant Trust Directive, get rid of cashless bail, pull out of the regional greenhouse gas initiative, and prevent wind turbines from being constructed off the Jersey Shore. 
“Executive order No. 1, on day one, no town in this state will be a sanctuary city. We will not be a sanctuary state,” Ciattarelli said. 
He added that many of Murphy’s policies were done by executive order, like the Immigrant Trust Directive, and never became law, which means he can do away with them immediately.
“Having sanctuary cities and us being a sanctuary state encourages illegal immigration, and it handcuffs our local police in certain ways. We’re not doing that,” he said.
Hannity criticized New Jersey’s high taxes, reading off the corporate business tax, gas tax, inheritance tax, and top individual tax rate. 
“I refuse to be the governor of that state. We’re going to change that when we win, I’m telling you that right now,” Ciattarelli said.
The two men were joined by Harris Faulkner, a Fox News anchor and New Jersey resident. She said New Jerseyans are worried about affordability, lamented about her utility bills, and griped about a gas station in Edgewater that charges $5 a gallon. The Lukoil on River Road in Edgewater was charging $4.55 a gallon for premium gas on Friday (regular was $2.89).
“It feels like they’re trafficking in high taxes, because the current governor said when he ran the last time, ‘If taxes are your issue, then New Jersey is not for you,’” she said.
Ciattarelli stressed the importance of attracting independent voters and people who typically only turn out for presidential elections every four years.
“We say to them, ‘Do you love this state? Are you angry about everything that’s going on? You got to turn out in the governor’s race too,’” he said. “We’ve done a magnificent job.”

(Photo: Lynn Bonner/NC Newsline)Pat Hurley Thornburg, a former state legislator from Randolph County, wants state government retirees to get cost-of-living adjustments, often called COLAs. 
As a member of the boards that make recommendations on state and local government pensions, she’s in a position to push for them. 
Thornburg came to the trustees meeting Thursday prepared with a chart showing that retired state employees and teachers received COLAs nearly every year from 1981 to 2008. From 2009 on, they’ve received small increases, one-time bonuses, or nothing at all. 
“I don’t understand why it happens,” she said. “It really bothers me.” 
Retirees have lost purchasing power to rising inflation, she said. 
The state pension trustees could be in a position to recommend that the legislature grant state retiree cost-of-living increases in the next budget. It all depends on how pension fund returns perform through December.
Before 2008, it was easy for the pension fund to reach its earnings targets. That allowed the financial breathing room to increase pension checks for retired state government employees and teachers. 
That changed with the 2008 financial crisis. 
“We were in a very different economic environment,” said Sam Watts, executive director of the NC Retirement Systems. 
For years, North Carolina’s pension returns ranked at or near the bottom compared to other states’ pensions. But earnings have improved since January, with investment returns hitting 10.8% through Sept. 30. That’s close to the average performance of other large public pension plans. 
The state and local pension funds have separate trustee boards, but the boards meet at the same time and some members serve on both boards. 
The state pension board tells the legislature whether there’s enough money to finance cost-of-living adjustments from the fund for state retirees and teachers. It makes the recommendation, but legislators don’t have to accept it. 
The local government pension board makes decisions on COLAs for those retirees. 
Trustees must balance a number of factors in determining whether the respective funds can afford to pay COLAs, including investment returns, liabilities, and salary increases for people still working.
The boards will make those decisions in January. 
State Treasurer Brad Briner says as it looks now, it’s more likely that the state pension trustees will be able to recommend the legislature include COLAs in the next state budget than it is for local pension trustees to give local government retirees cost-of-living increases.
Neither the state retiree pension plan nor the local government retiree plan are what’s called “fully funded,” meaning that they have enough to pay current beneficiaries as well as meet future obligations to people still working who will qualify for pensions. But the local government plan is a few points further from the mark than the state retiree plan. 
Tim O’Connell, whose Retired Government Employee Association represents both state and local retirees, reminded trustees that local government retirees have gone nearly 20 years without COLAs.
“It’s been a tough 15, 20 years,” he said. 
“Everything you can do in this room, please do it for the retirees,” he said. “We’re working for the future as well, but the current retirees really bear the burden of some tough times.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4832-1024x569.jpg,,,2025-10-31 15:17:06.194158

The lawmakers’ request, sent in a letter to the Virginia Office of the State Inspector General Sept. 29, stems from campaign ads for Miyares and public events that seek to tie specific reoffenders to Democratic opponent Jay Jones’ past vote in favor of a law that allows inmates to trim their time behind bars. 
The letter was signed by Sens. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, and Dels. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, and Vivian Watts, D-Fairfax. Together, they expressed a series of concerns: whether Miyares had access to confidential information and if it violated laws to disclose the details, whether the information sharing was a “use of state resources” for campaign activities, and whether public confidence could be undermined that release decisions and sentence credits are determined by law, “not by political convenience.” 
The inclusion of a particular offender’s status, “coupled with the Attorney General’s claims regarding earned sentence credits, suggest information not otherwise available to the public,” the lawmakers wrote. “This position clearly indicated that the information could not be disclosed under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act.”
Dubbed Enhanced Earned Sentence Credits, the five-year old law has allowed inmates with good behavior the ability to be released early. Though it passed in 2020 — when Miyares and Jones were both members of the legislature — its implementation was blocked for years by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, at Miyares’ request. With last year’s reconviction rate at 19% and reincarceration rate at 5%, the program is under fresh scrutiny this year amid the Miyares and Jones matchup. 
Despite the lawmakers’ request, OSIG said that it can’t investigate the data sharing between VADOC and Miyares because Miyares, the governor or a grand jury would have to request such an inquiry, per state code. 
“We were trying to get them to investigate the VADOC side of it,” Simon said in a recent call. 
 Inconsistent information

In ads and on the campaign trail, Miyares claimed that 70 Virginians had died as a result of the program, but a Cardinal News analysis of data from his office refutes that claim. 
Miyares spokesperson Shaun Kenney told Cardinal that absent a state-directed study, “VADOC remains partially equipped with the tools or resources to accurately measure the full impact of EESC and is only able to offer a fractional view by which the public can ascertain its impact.”
What data has been shared with Miyares and the media offers some insights, however. 
VADOC data shared with The Mercury by House Republican Caucus communications director Garren Shipley shows percentages of EESC recipients who reoffended broken down by different types and whether or not they were reincarcerated — but it does not identify specific offenders by name. In that data, reoffenses for murder or manslaughter were minimal, much like the Cardinal inquiry found.   
Records requested by The Richmond Times-Dispatch — which prompted lawmakers’ letter to OSIG — yielded a response from VADOC that qualification for EESC was a “protected record” and that a list of recipients’ names “does not exist.” 
The Times-Dispatch had been looking into reoffender Tabias McClain, who should have been disqualified from using EESC due to a malicious wounding charge from when he was a minor, but was able to use the program because the charge didn’t transfer over when he aged out of Department of Juvenile Justice and into VADOC. Miyares singled McClain out during a July press conference hosted with the family of a woman McClain hit and killed with his car while speeding through a residential neighborhood after his release.
Meanwhile, The Mercury had asked for information about serial sex offender Daniel Vanover, a man also mentioned at Miyares’ conference and the subject of advertisements for Miyares’ re-election campaign. The ads claim was Vanover was able to rape a minor “because of Jay Jones’ law.” 
When asked by The Mercury, VADOC confirmed that Vanover received EESC while serving a 2022 sentence for a probation violation — the year the sex crimes happened after his release. However, court sentencing records indicate the rapes occured between May 9, 2022 and Dec. 8, 2022 — over two months before VADOC confirmed his Aug. 17, 2022 release date in emails. 
Additional court records that are available in an online database also indicate Vanover’s sexual assaults of a minor began on May 9, 2022.
Spokespeople for VADOC did not further elaborate when asked about the discrepancy in the dates, but said that the record “reflects the data of the offense for all 11 counts of rape as a range” for those dates. No additional documentation was provided and calls to VADOC director Chad Dotson went unanswered. Multiple calls to Vanover’s defense attorney from that time also went unanswered. 
While further details about the discrepancy could not be gleaned by the time of this publication, there still may have been a reason, American University professor TaLisa Carter explained.
She said “the first and last dates don’t necessarily sync with the first and last incidents” and noted how the criminal justice system is “inclusive rather than exclusive.” 
 Politics vs. people

Though questions have lingered among journalists and lawmakers alike, the highly politicized early release program still stands as campaign fodder — to the dismay of EESC beneficiaries who have successfully reformed their lives and worry the door they walked through could eventually be closed behind them. 
Lynchburg-area resident and former inmate Reece Neenan, who used EESC, previously described the new chapter of life as a “whirlwind of goodness” as he’s landed a stable job, reconnected with family and started college. 
“Of course” there are fellow EESC beneficiaries who have reoffended, Neenan said. 
“But for the most part, people I know out here are staying out of trouble because it’s easy now.”
Hampton Roads resident Sam Harris, who started a nonprofit and was recently hired in Suffolk’s public defender office to counsel people navigating the criminal justice system, told The Mercury that he wants to “be a face for second chances.” 
Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, has previously suggested Miyares and the governor may have tried to “undermine the effectiveness of the program” to fit political narratives.
When The Mercury recently examined the program’s effectiveness since fully implemented in the past year, neither Jones or Miyares followed through on requests for interviews.
In his own letter to Dotson earlier this summer, Surovell suggested the legislature explore ways to ensure EESC functions appropriately rather than dismantle it. As courts have previously ruled that VADOC unlawfully kept certain inmates behind bars in violation of EESC, paired with Miyares’ and Youngkin’s previous blocking of the program, Surovell posited that the “whipsawing” had made it difficult for VADOC to “plan and implement the existing system.”
Democratic colleagues Simon, Ebbin, Watts and Locke wrote in their letter to OSIG that they are “deeply concerned” Miyares may have pressured VADOC “to adjust its practices in ways that advantage” his campaign. 
“If true, this would represent a profound breach of the public trust,” they wrote.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Indiana philanthropic organizations and an anonymous donor have pooled $1 million to launch a food aid fund, the United Way of Central Indiana announced Thursday — with federal grocery benefits for low-income Americans set to run dry Nov. 1 amid a government shutdown.
“Food is not a privilege; it’s a basic human right,” said Fred Payne, United Way of Central Indiana’s president and CEO. “United Way is proud to stand alongside its partners and other funders to respond to this critical need and help hard-working families put food on the table.”
GOP squashes food aid for Hoosiers impacted by SNAP disruption

More than 571,000 Hoosiers were receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program as of September, according to the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration.
Approximately 150,000 SNAP recipients reside in central Indiana alone — Boone, Hamilton, Hancock, Hendricks, Marion, Morgan and Putnam counties — according a news release. About half of participants are in families with children.
Beginning next week, the new Central Indiana Food Relief Fund will distribute the money to groups that supply food to hundreds of pantries across the region and state: Gleaners Food Bank of Indiana, Midwest Food Bank of Indiana and Second Helpings.
The fund was launched with a $500,000 donation from an anonymous donor, which was intended to encourage the community to match or exceed that amount, according to the release.
The Indianapolis Foundation, Lilly Endowment and the Lilly Foundation contributed, quickly meeting that match.
Indiana residents are also encourage to donate to the fund directly — United Way will manage the account, but 100% of gifts will be distributed — or to the three food organizations.
“Philanthropy alone cannot fill this gap,” Payne said. “But we are calling on our community right now to join us, support our food banks and help our neighbors in need.”
Those in need of food assistance can use Indy Hunger Network’s Community Compass to find free food and groceries near them, along with other resources.

Free.,Trump administration blocked from cutting off SNAP benefits as two judges issue orders,"Jacob Fischler, Ariana Figueroa",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-blocked-cutting-snap-benefits-two-judges-issue-orders,,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge in Boston ruled Friday that the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s plan to pause a food assistance program for 42 million people was illegal — but gave the Trump administration until Monday to respond to her finding before she decides on a motion to force the benefits be paid despite the ongoing government shutdown.At nearly the same time Friday, a Rhode Island federal judge in a similar case brought by cities and nonprofit groups ordered USDA to continue payments and granted a request for a temporary restraining order.In Massachusetts, in a Friday afternoon order, District Court of Massachusetts Judge Indira Talwani said she would continue to take “under advisement” a coalition of Democratic states’ request to force the release of funds from a contingency account holding about $6 billion.Her ruling came a day before a cutoff of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits to low-income households.Because Congress is locked in a stalemate over a stopgap spending bill and did not appropriate money for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, administration officials say the program cannot provide federal funds beginning Saturday. In states, SNAP benefits are loaded onto cards on varying dates, but the cutoff would be effective for November benefits.Talwani, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, called the administration’s conclusion it can’t provide SNAP funding “erroneous,” and said the reserve fund was sufficient for SNAP benefits to flow to states and the vendors that add money to debit-like cards issued to the program’s beneficiaries that are used to purchase groceries. The law creating the program mandated that benefits continue, she said.“Defendants are statutorily mandated to use the previously appropriated SNAP contingency reserve when necessary and also have discretion to use other previously appropriated funds,” Talwani wrote.Talwani ordered the administration to say by Monday whether it would provide at least partial benefits for November.The 25 states that sued were Massachusetts, California, Arizona, Minnesota, Connecticut, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington state, Wisconsin Kansas, Kentucky and Pennsylvania. The District of Columbia also sued. In Rhode Island, where the judge granted a temporary restraining order, the advocacy group Democracy Forward, which was among those bringing the suit, praised the move.“A federal court today granted a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump-Vance administration’s unlawful effort to halt the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) during the ongoing government shutdown,” the group said.”The decision ensures that millions of children, seniors, veterans, and families will continue to receive essential food assistance while the case proceeds.”The judge in that case, John James McConnell Jr., said the administration’s actions violated a key federal administrative law against arbitrary and capricious executive action and federal spending laws “by disregarding Congress’s direction that SNAP must continue operating,” Democracy Forward said.McConnell also was appointed by Obama.Shauneen Miranda contributed to this report.This is a developing report and will be updated.",,,,2025-10-31 14:57:04.840890

Idaho Attorney General’s Office asks judge to dismiss fired attorney’s whistleblower lawsuit

In September, Idaho 4th District Judge Jonathan Medema dismissed Huang’s lawsuit, preventing the case from going to a jury trial. In his ruling, the judge wrote “no rational juror could find” that Huang “had proven any of her claims.” 
Many of her lawsuit’s claims revolved around Labrador’s investigation into the Department of Health and Welfare’s handling of $72 million in child care grants. 
In her appeal to the Idaho Supreme Court filed on Oct. 23, Huang’s attorneys wrote that the ruling “erred by holding that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact” related to her lawsuit’s claim under the state’s whistleblower law, called Idaho’s Protection of Public Employees Act. 
Labrador’s spokesperson, Damon Sidur, declined to comment on the appeal. The Attorney General’s Office has argued Huang was fired for misconduct.
Hours before Huang’s firing in March 2023, she expressed ethical concerns about the ethics of the Idaho Attorney General’s Office new management, according to records released in the lawsuit. 
Before firing her, Labrador didn’t look into Huang’s concerns, he said in a deposition. 
“I had no concerns. It was clear that she was not acting in good faith. And it was clear that she was already preparing for litigation,” Labrador said.
Huang filed her lawsuit in September 2023.

To understand the resolve of salmon advocates — and the frustration so many of us felt when the federal government recently reneged on a historic agreement, reigniting litigation — it’s helpful to review the legal history associated with protecting Columbia Basin salmon.
In a recent story about plaintiffs returning to court to protect Columbia Basin salmon, the Washington State Standard described the court battle as “long-running.” So true. 
The initial shot was fired in 1991 after Snake River sockeye salmon became the first Columbia Basin salmonid to be listed as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act . That listing requires federal agencies to ensure the protection and recovery of the fish. 
Federal agencies involved with the federal dams in the Columbia Basin include the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (which operates dams on the lower Snake and lower Columbia rivers), the Bonneville Power Administration (which markets power from the dams), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (which issues rulings on whether fish protection and recovery plans comply with the Endangered Species Act).
Since 1992, they’ve put forth no fewer than eight plans for operating the hydropower system while ostensibly protecting threatened and endangered salmon and steelhead in the Columbia Basin. (By 1999, 12 more salmon and steelhead stocks had been listed under the Endangered Species Act.)
Over three decades of litigation, three different federal district judges have declared six different federal dam management plans illegal for their failure to protect salmon and steelhead. That includes every plan since 2000. The very first plan was invalidated in 1994 by U.S. District Judge Malcolm Marsh, who proclaimed that the “situation literally cries out for a major overhaul,” but found that the federal plan failed to deliver any such fundamental change.
Fast forward to 2005, when District Court Judge James Redden struck down a 2004 federal plan, a plan he later called a “cynical and transparent attempt to avoid responsibility for the decline of listed Columbia and Snake River salmon and steelhead.” 
In the following years, new plans were issued by the federal agencies in 2008, 2010, and 2014. Each was promptly struck down. After Redden’s retirement, Judge Michael Simon struck down the 2014 plan. Twice, the federal agencies tried appealing the district court rulings to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Twice, the circuit court upheld the district court.
The most recent plan, issued in the waning days of the first Trump administration, was promptly challenged, and was headed for the same fate as the prior plans, when the Biden administration decided not to defend the indefensible and entered into settlement talks with plaintiffs and Northwest states and tribes, with input from other stakeholders as well.
Those talks led to the adoption in 2023 of the Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement, a package of investments, changes in dam operations, and studies on replacing the services of four especially lethal dams on the lower Snake River (so that the dams could be breached and 140 miles of free-flowing river restored). Litigation was stayed while that agreement was in place.
In June of this year, the second Trump administration unilaterally renounced the agreement, leaving nothing to replace it save the illegal 2020 Trump salmon plan. So, it’s back to court.
In various rulings over the years, the courts have ordered modest changes in dam operations, but the federal agencies have repeatedly refused to produce the “major overhaul” Judge Marsh called for 31 years ago. 
As a result, not one of the 13 listed populations is on a path to recovery. Despite misleading claims from federal agencies, public utilities, and other river user groups, most of those stocks are on a path to extinction.
It’s past time for the court to find a way to end more than three decades of stubborn evasion of the law by the federal agencies and direct them to, finally, produce a plan that will lead to restoration of abundant, harvestable populations of these iconic creatures.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/salmon.jpeg,,,2025-10-31 14:57:04.840890

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – About 280 new laws take effect Saturday, including an income tax cut.
House Bill 2764 reduces the state’s top income tax bracket by .25% from 4.75% to 4.5%. Most Oklahomans fall within the top bracket.
It also has a path toward elimination of the state’s income tax through revenue triggers.
It was a top priority of Gov. Kevin Stitt during the last legislative session.
The fiscal impact in fiscal year 2027 is $340.5 million.
House Bill 1389 expands insurance coverage for diagnostic mammograms.
Stitt vetoed the measure, but lawmakers overrode it.
Another measure, Senate Bill 1019, prohibits insurers from putting a time limit on the use of anesthesia during a medical or surgical procedure. It also bars insurers from restricting coverage or payment for time under anesthesia.
Senate Bill 176 gives women access to a six-month prescription of birth control.
House Bill 2263 makes it illegal to use a cell phone in a school zone or work zone. It has  exceptions for hands-free or voice-operated functions and to communicate with emergency or medical personnel.
Violators are subject to a fine of not more than $100.
Lawmakers overrode Stitt’s veto of the measure.
House Bill 2674 creates the Statewide Official Compensation Commission to set the salaries of statewide elected officers, such as the governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general. The commission is prohibited from reducing salaries that were in effect as of Jan. 1, 2025.
Senate Bill 50 provides for a sales tax exemption for firearm and gun safety devices. Safety devices include a gun safe, lock box, trigger lock and barrel lock.
Lawmakers return to the Capitol on Feb. 2. 
It will be Stitt’s final session due to term limits.

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)As Trump administration officials move to suspend federal food assistance for 42 million Americans starting Saturday, New Jersey residents looking to food pantries for help have plenty of options.
About 813,000 low-income New Jersey residents across more than 436,000 households are expected to lose benefits they receive under the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly called food stamps.
Need help? New Jersey food banks can connect you to a food pantry near you:

The Community Food Bank of New Jersey partners with more than 800 agencies and community groups that run food pantries in Atlantic, Bergen, Cape May, Cumberland, Essex, Hudson, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset, and Union counties. Search by zip code for food pantries in those counties here.
The Food Bank of South Jersey has a searchable map here of over 150 food distribution sites in Burlington, Camden, Gloucester, and Salem counties, as well as a list of locations of mobile and school food pantries.
Fulfill provides food to nearly 300 pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, group homes, and more in Ocean and Monmouth counties. Check out Fulfill’s list of food pantries and soup kitchens here and mobile food pantry sites here.
Mercer Street Friends in Trenton partners with more than 100 pantries in Central Jersey. They have a free food-finder tool here.
Norwescap provides supplies for food pantries, soup kitchens, and child care and senior centers in Warren, Hunterdon, and Sussex counties. For Warren, look here, Sussex here, and Hunterdon here.
To find food assistance through the Southern Regional Food Distribution Center, which is based in Vineland, call 856-327-3145.

The state lists food pantries in 18 of New Jersey’s 21 counties here.
Many universities — including Rutgers, Rowan, and Ramapo — have food pantries on campus. Many are open to staff and administrators, as well as students.
Several counties direct residents to food assistance on their websites, including:

Bergen County lists food pantries in about 40 towns here.
Camden County lists pantries, home-delivered meals, related resources, and even a bagel cafe offering free bagels during the federal government shutdown here.
Cape May County offers this list of pantries.
Essex County lists eight pages of food pantries and soup kitchens here.
Gloucester County lists 10 churches and groups that provide food assistance here.
Hunterdon County’s pantries are listed here.
Middlesex County has a 29-page list of food assistance resources here.
Morris County lists its food pantries, meal services, and volunteer shopper programs here.
Somerset County offers this list of food assistance programs.
Union County lists about 50 pantries and kitchens here.
Warren County has more than 25 pantries, from Allamuchy to Washington, here.

Catholic Charities also runs food pantries in Dover, Franklin, Trenton, Brick, Burlington, Paterson, Phillipsburg, and more.
The New Jersey Food Council has also put together a list of groups and agencies that provide food assistance information and resources for shoppers affected by the SNAP funding lapse.
People who need assistance are recommended to call first, because hours vary. While some sites welcome walk-ins, others require appointments and may ask for proof of residency and/or income. Some distribute pre-packed bags of groceries, while others are set up more like supermarkets, where visitors can select what they want.
Most food pantries, soup kitchens, and other programs that help people in need welcome both financial donations and volunteers to stock shelves, distribute food, serve meals, and help with holiday drives.
The government’s SNAP suspension comes during the fifth week of the government shutdown. The Trump administration has held a hard line on funding for the program, refusing to release contingency funds meant to ensure payments continue through shutdowns, as a way to force Democrats to agree to a GOP plan to reopen the government.
State officials rushed $42.5 million in already-budgeted state funding to the state’s six biggest food banks on Friday to better prepare for the surge of visitors expected at food pantries and soup kitchens. 
A coalition of states, including New Jersey, has sued the federal government over the SNAP lapse.
The fate of federal benefits paid through the federal Women, Infants, and Children, or WIC, program also remains uncertain. But New Jersey Department of Health officials said this week they expect funding for WIC benefits and services will continue without interruption through November. About 186,000 women, infants, and children were enrolled in WIC in New Jersey in 2024, according to Advocates for Children of New Jersey.

(Photo courtesy of Tiger Rag) LSU is parting ways with its athletics director hours after Gov. Jeff Landry publicly blasted him at a news conference and in a series of local and national media appearances this week.  
Scott Woodward is the sixth top administrator at the university to leave amid tense political circumstances. His exit follows that of President William Tate, Provost Roy Haggerty, LSU Health Shreveport Chancellor David Guzick, chief administrative officer Kimberly Lewis and general counsel Winston DeCuir. 
Tate, Lewis and DeCuir are Black and left their posts as Landry pushed to remove the university away from diversity, equity and inclusion policy. Their departures constituted a purge of nearly every top Black administrator at the university. Several deans have also left, including Alena Allen, the first Black dean of the LSU Law Center.

Woodward’s downfall had been rumored for months. 
While adept with those on both sides of the aisle, Woodward’s own political history, having begun his career as a lobbyist, placed him at odds with the arch-conservative Landry, observers noted. 
Landry hit Woodward with both barrels after the weekend firing of football coach Brian Kelly after a resounding loss to Texas A&M. Kelly’s dismissal put LSU on the hook for the $54 million buyout provision in his contract. 
Landry hosted several board members, university officials and athletics administrators Sunday at the Governor’s Mansion to discuss Kelly’s contract. Neither Woodward nor interim LSU President Matt Lee were included in those discussions. 
“No, I can tell you right now, Scott Woodward is not selecting the next coach,” Landry said at a news conference Wednesday. “Hell, I’ll let Donald Trump select it before I let him do it.”
LSU Board of Supervisors member John Carmouche, a Landry appointee who chairs the board’s athletics subcommittee, denied Landry’s involvement in the decision to fire Woodward. 
“The governor is worried about the state of Louisiana. His concern had to do with the state contract,” Carmouche said.
Landry has said his interest in LSU’s coaching search protecting Louisiana taxpayers. He’s pointed to language in Kelly’s contract he said “makes the State liable for any debt” if private donors can’t or won’t cover the $54 million buyout.


As a public university, Landry is correct that the university, as a subdivision of the state, is ultimately liable. LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard said Friday private donors and self-generated athletics revenue would cover Kelly’s buyout. 
While not tax dollars, the athletic department’s self-generated revenue is public money. All public universities in Louisiana like LSU are primarily funded with self-generated revenue, such as tuition and fee revenue. The spending of that revenue has to be approved by the legislature. Of the LSU System’s $1.2 billion budget for the current fiscal year, more than $800 million comes from self-generated revenue. 
Significant concern has been voiced recently at LSU over growing buyouts for college coaches. 
At a September meeting of the Board of Supervisors, Vice Chairman Lee Mallett, a Landry appointee and major campaign donor, brought up the financial impact to the university of buying out poorly performing coaches. It cost $17 million for the university to part ways with Ed Orgeron in the middle of the 2021 season. Mallet argued LSU should be the first to break the mold and drop the buyouts.
Landry has suggested LSU use an incentive-based contract to hire its next football coach, rather one with a guaranteed payout if the person is fired before their deal expires.  
Verge Ausberry, who was named interim athletics director Thursday, said the LSU board has not placed any constraints on him with regards to contract structure when tasking him to find Kelly’s replacement.
“I was told to get the best football coach there is, and don’t worry about that at all,” Ausberry said. “So my thing is, we’re going to go out there together as a team and get the best contract, get the best coach we have, and whatever it takes to get that person here, we will do.” 
Ballard said the search for Kelly’s replacement would not slow down for the hiring of the next president. The winning candidate for that position is slated to be announced Tuesday after three days of campus visits by the three finalists: McNeese State President Wade Rousse, former University of Arizona President Robert Robbins and University of Alabama Provost James Dalton. 
“Verge is going to move forward and knows what he needs to do,” Ballard said. “But depending on how that works out and when the new president starts … the new president will absolutely have input and hopefully hit the ground running.” 
Though he said his only focus is on hiring a football coach, Ausberry is considered to be a contender to replace Woodward on a permanent basis. A former player on the LSU football team in the mid-1980s, he has risen through the ranks of the athletic department over 24 years, the past six as its executive deputy director.
LSU suspended Ausberry from his job for 30 days without pay in 2021 for failing to properly report that LSU football player Drake Davis had admitted to Ausberry in 2018 that he had punched his girlfriend. 
Before that suspension, Ausberry was part of an LSU presidential search committee in 2020 but resigned when questions arose about what consequences he might face as part of his role in Title IX violations at the university. 


Landry’s involvement in forcing out Woodward and Kelly is not the first time he has taken an interest in LSU athletics. 
Last year, the governor called for universities to strip scholarships from athletes who didn’t participate in pregame national anthem ceremonies. His stance came after LSU women’s basketball coach Kim Mulkey was criticized in conservative circles when her team was not on the floor for the anthem before a high-profile NCAA Tournament game against Iowa. It is commonplace for college basketball and football teams to be in their locker rooms at that time.
Mulkey, who Woodward hired away from Baylor University in 2021, did not appear for a routine postgame recap with reporters after her team’s Thursday night exhibition game against Langston. In her place, assistant coach Bob Starkey was asked by a reporter to explain her absence.
“Yeah, she’s heartbroken,” Starkey said.    
Also in 2024, Landry called on LSU to resume its tradition bringing its live mascot, Mike, to the sidelines of Tiger Stadium for football games. When LSU declined, Landry arranged to rent a tiger, named Omar Bradley, from a Florida wildlife center to attend the LSU-Alabama game. The Crimson Tide wallopped LSU, 42-13, and Landry was criticized by fans who said he brought bad luck to the team. 
Landry was also displeased with Woodward’s refusal to rehire men’s basketball coach Will Wade, who Woodward had fired in 2022 amid a recruiting scandal, Yahoo Sports reported. Wade was hired at McNeese State, which played twice in the NCAA Tournament during his stay, and he is starting his first season this year at North Carolina State.

Ibarra, Deborah Brennan, Phoebe Huss and Chrissa Olson",,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/2025/10/cal-fresh-snap-november-cliff/,More than five million low-income Californians are expected to lose their CalFresh food assistance benefits starting Saturday. States are suing the Trump administration to reinstate aid.,"In summary
More than five million low-income Californians are expected to lose their CalFresh food assistance benefits starting Saturday. States are suing the Trump administration to reinstate aid.


Each Thursday, food pantry workers in the city of Bellflower sort through breads, fresh produce and canned goods. Early risers line up with their bags, cardboard boxes and carts outside St. Dominic Savio Catholic Church, ready for distribution at 8 a.m.
For some, that routine became more urgent this week. Five-and-a-half million low-income Californians are enrolled in CalFresh, the state’s version of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. With the federal government shut down and the Trump administration refusing to tap funds to keep food assistance on schedule, refrigerators are emptying, cupboards are running bare and fears are rising.   
“Without these food banks providing, I don’t know what we’re going to do,” said Miriam Hernandez, a Paramount resident who rushed to St. Dominic’s after dropping her children at school. 
Around the state, food pantries expect demand for goods to surge over the next several weeks. To help meet the need, California, county agencies and private groups are pouring in tens of millions of dollars in backfill funding. California Attorney General Rob Bonta this week joined other states in suing the federal government, seeking to restore federal financial support for SNAP programs, including CalFresh. The program was formerly known as food stamps, and now functions through debit cards. 
For about 3.5 million senior citizens and children who use CalFresh, food planning has already changed. 
Waiting in line, tote in hand, Hernandez said she’s been feeling nervous. To prepare for delays in receiving CalFresh benefits, she’s stopped by multiple food pantries in Los Angeles County, grateful for anything she can get her hands on.
Hernandez has six children, four of whom are still in school. Her husband is the main breadwinner, and with the rising price of groceries, she said CalFresh has been a huge help in her household — it’s largely how she buys meat and poultry. She is hopeful benefits will return soon, but in the meantime, she’ll have to make do with what she can find at pantries. Items like rice, lentils and beans can go a long way, she said. 
“Moms, we work it out with the little that we have, and we try to make a meal no matter how little it is,” she said. 
California, counties intervene
California has released $80 million to support food banks across the state. Gov. Gavin Newsom has also sent the California National Guard to help food banks pack and distribute food. 
Bonta joined National Guards and volunteers packing bell peppers and potatoes at the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank to make a point on Thursday. While the U.S. Department of Agriculture says it lacks funding to provide SNAP benefits to 40 million Americans, Bonta said the federal government has more than $5 billion in contingency funds earmarked for the program. A multi-state lawsuit demands that the federal government use those funds to avoid shutting the program down for the first time since it began in 1964. 
“Those funds are sitting there unspent and it is unconscionable, it is immoral, it is illegal,” Bonta said.

A federal judge in Boston has signaled that she may intervene. 
Even if the judge sides with California, Bonta said it could take “about a week” before benefits are reinstated to electronic debit cards.
Counties and local governments are also working to gather resources and aid. In San Francisco, supported in part by a private donor, the city will provide gift cards to CalFresh members to fully cover their November food benefits.
With millions of families across the state and country in limbo, food banks and pantries are becoming a lifeline for many more people. 
In North County San Diego Thursday, hundreds of families showed up to Interfaith Community Services in Escondido for an emergency food distribution with a regional partner, Feeding San Diego.
People waited in their vehicles for the drive-through food bank in a snarl of traffic that backed up outside the center. Each family received one or two boxes filled with fresh strawberries, apples and cucumbers, along with peanut butter, bread, canned beans and tuna, and a few treats, such as fruit popsicles and chocolate cake pops.
The organizations expected to serve 250 families, but stretched that to 270. On a normal day the Interfaith food pantry might serve 30 to 40 families.
“Today, people are panicked,” said Carissa Casares, a spokesperson for Feeding San Diego. “They’re thinking, how am I stocking my fridge? How am I filling my pantry?”

At the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, which partners with organizations across the county to bring pantries to churches, senior centers and schools, several factors have contributed to increased demand this year, said CEO Michael Flood.
In January, historic wildfires devastated Los Angeles communities. “And because those fires were so huge, that ripple effect is still there,” Flood said. Then in October, federal workers who aren’t getting paid because of the shutdown began requesting food boxes. Now with the suspension of CalFresh benefits, that need is likely to surge. About 1.5 million Angelenos rely on food assistance. 
His food bank is planning large distribution events for thousands of people similar to those organized during the pandemic. “This is a disaster type of situation for us here in Los Angeles County, throughout the state of California, and throughout the country,” he said. 
College students, recent graduates seek stability
Beyond the senior citizens and children who make up the majority of program participants, veterans, people with disabilities and young people are also trying to make ends meet. 
About 200,000 college students use the assistance program, and some continue to do so even after they graduate.
A third-year international development student at UCLA, Jade Duarte, said her entire family relies on CalFresh. 
“My grandfather just had open-heart surgery,” she said. “He’s dependent on good nutrition to recover, right? So things like this would hinder, essentially, his way of recovery, because they’re cutting his money.”
For her own needs, Duarte seeks support beyond her family’s CalFresh. A food pantry at UCLA offers quick meals like ramen. But demand exceeds what food banks can provide, she said. “It’s not going to be able to take care of the whole situation.”
On college campuses around the state, demand is growing at basic needs centers that serve as resource hubs, connecting students with food assistance and other support programs. At UC Berkeley on Wednesday, the online queue to access free food opened at 1 p.m. It was full by 1:01 p.m. The pantry also opened another time slot on Mondays.

While basic needs centers are meant as a short-term solution, some students return again and again. Temuujin Sarangerel, a second-year Berkeley City College student studying business administration and finance, stops at his school’s center one or twice a week as one of his main sources of food. 
He and his mom share a CalFresh debit card, and they will have to cut back on meat and other foods if their benefits don’t come in. The prospect makes him “sad and stressed.”
In Los Angeles County, 22-year-old Dante Thomas, a recent graduate of the University of San Francisco, stopped by St. Dominic’s food pantry for the first time. Living now in South Gate, Thomas said he knows how to stretch CalFresh benefits strategically to last the entire month. 
Under the pressure of student debt and keeping up with rent, Thomas said food assistance supports his mental well-being: It’s one less thing to worry about. 
“It’s a little demoralizing as a young person,” he said. “Benefits are being cancelled and I can’t find a consistent role in my career, so things are definitely a little hard right now.”
Preparing for the possibility that CalFresh won’t come through starting Saturday Thomas said he has been even more judicious about what he buys. “I’d go to the store and get a salad or something … and now I don’t even think that’s something that makes sense to do financially,” he said. “It’s very hard.”

Annette Sweeney, left, Mike Klimesh and Sarah Trone Garriott heard public comments on a bill related to pharmacy benefits managers. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa’s law putting new regulations on pharmacy benefits managers is temporarily blocked from enforcement for Wellmark Blue Cross-Blue Shield health plans and insurance policies.
Chief U.S. District Judge Stephanie Rose issued a temporary injunction Wednesday in the case, brought earlier this month by Iowa’s largest health insurer against the state insurance commissioner. The case challenges enforcement of Senate File 383, the measure signed into law in June that regulates certain business practices by PBMs, the entities negotiating prescription drug costs between manufacturers, health insurance companies and pharmacies.
The law restricts PBMs’ ability to set certain cost-sharing rates, fees, or other financial means to incentivize a person to fill their prescription at a certain pharmacy. It also requires independent pharmacies to be reimbursed at the average national acquisition cost of a drug plus a $10.68 dispensing fee.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The law was supported by many advocates and business owners of small and rural pharmacies. Pharmacists and some health care advocates said the PBM practices targeted by the Iowa law contributed to the closure of more than 200 rural and independent pharmacies across the state, including 31 pharmacies that closed in 2024.
But business leaders and health insurance companies have said the measure will lead to higher health care costs for Iowans. The Iowa Association of Business and Industry warned the measure could result in an additional $340 million in costs for private-sector health insurance plans, resulting in an increase of $169 for the average insured Iowans’ pharmaceutical costs each year.
The Iowa Association of Business and Industry also filed a lawsuit in June to block enforcement of the law. Rose, who also oversaw this case, issued a temporary injunction on July 21 applying to plaintiffs of the ABI lawsuit.
In that decision to issue a temporary injunction, Rose wrote that several parts of the PBM law exceed state authority in regulating health care plans, conflicting with the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. She also found the law could conflict with First Amendment protections for commercial speech “without adequate constitutional justification.”
Wellmark’s October lawsuit referenced Rose’s decision in the ABI case, saying the injunction order brought into question whether Iowa Insurance Commissioner Doug Ommen can legitimately enforce the state’s PBM law if it conflicts with federal ERISA regulations. The lawsuit specifically pointed to guidance Ommen issued in September that stated he planned to enforce the new law “in its entirety” against entities that are not plaintiffs in the ABI lawsuit.
Rose’s temporary injunction in the Wellmark case pauses the $10.68 dispensing fee for prescriptions filled at pharmacies in Iowa under Wellmark covered plans and policies, including those working through CVS Caremark, the PBM that works with Wellmark.
In a news release on the decision, the company said the preliminary injunction provides benefits like offering “clear compliance guidance” on the law, and shielding more than 1 million Iowans from “significant increases in prescription medication costs” under the law. The company had estimated individuals covered by Wellmark policies would face increased costs of nearly $40 million annually.
The Iowa Insurance Division did not respond a request for comment Friday on the injunction. Provisions of the law not blocked under the court order will continue to be enforced. The temporary injunctions blocking parts of the law, set in the Wellmark and ABI lawsuits, will remain in place until a decision is made on in the cases about the law’s constitutionality.

In the complaint, Molnar, recently ousted as president, asks the Commissioner of Political Practices to estimate the money Bukacek owes ratepayers for her alleged abuse of state resources and levy penalties accordingly.
Bukacek is a licensed physician based in Kalispell, according to the Montana Board of Medical Examiners. She is on the Logan Health Medical Center receptionist directory.
In the complaint, Molnar said he has observed Bukacek “dragging a valise or an even larger suitcase” into the PSC office building after returning from her home in Kalispell.
At the office, Molnar said he often couldn’t use the copier because Bukacek was using it “for long periods of time.” One night, looking for a document he thought he might have thrown out, Molnar discovered “the first tranche of evidence” under fax cover sheets, the complaint said.
In a phone call, Molnar said the cover sheets largely show correspondence to Logan Health from other medical offices, such as Walmart Pharmacy or the Deer Lodge Medical Center.
“It became obvious the suitcases contained her business documents so she could perform her business functions while at the PSC offices,” the complaint said.
Until last week, Molnar served as president of the Public Service Commission. The PSC regulates public utilities and has five commissioners elected by district.
Molnar was ousted as president after his colleagues alleged he repeatedly interfered with an internal investigation into professional misconduct, and the PSC needed a reset.
Molnar himself announced the investigation in July and has admitted only to being unpolished.
Molnar said he was still president when he first discovered the medical printouts sometime the first week of April.
“I’ve got hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of these,” Molnar said.
He said he didn’t want bad publicity under his watch, and Bukacek had refused to talk with him, so he asked Commissioner Jennifer Fielder, vice president, to talk with her.
But he said Bukacek continued the practice.
In a phone call, Fielder said she recalls Molnar pointing out “a stack of trash” to her, but she believed Bukacek had been cleaning out her office.
Fielder said she doesn’t recall asking Bukacek directly about whether she was using state equipment for personal business, but she has in general offered that guidance to all her colleagues.
Fielder also said Molnar himself was free to talk with Bukacek himself or send her an email.
In state law, rules of conduct for officers state that they may not “use public time, facilities, equipment, state letterhead, supplies, personnel, or funds for the officer’s or employee’s private business purposes.”
Molnar himself was found to have violated that ethics law multiple times by using public facilities and equipment in his first stretch as a member of the Public Service Commissioner, according to a 2010 decision by the Commissioner of Political Practices.
In the current complaint, Molnar said Bukacek “dragging her bags of business documents has diminished” since the legislative session adjourned.
However, Bukacek still “uses the copy rooms exponentially far more often than I,” even though as president, Molnar said he needed more copies than most commissioners on most days, the complaint said.
“Apparently, she’s short on toner where she works,” Molnar said.
Molnar said “it’s not like I’m a dumpster diver,” but the bins can be overflowing with cover sheets, and he has collected a stack of them that’s as thick as a ream of paper.
Just a couple of days ago, Molnar said he went to throw away some bad copies, but the waste basket was overflowing, and he realized it had more medical facility cover sheets.
He said he believes Bukacek is copying the records, tossing out the cover sheets, and keeping many more pages of documents that are printed with them — on state equipment and taxpayer time, he said.
“You can hear the printing machines whirring for a frickin’ hour in there,” Molnar said.
He said he believes some of the documents include private patient information, potentially in violation of HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, because some cover sheets state, “Confidential,” and some include prescription information or reference EKGs, for example.
In response to a voicemail requesting comment, Bukacek sent a text message directing the Daily Montanan to the PSC executive director.
Bukacek did not answer a follow-up text message asking if she used equipment in the PSC office for private medical business.
Fielder, however, said she believes Molnar is disgruntled with his ouster, and the allegations against Bukacek are motivated by his dissatisfaction.
“I think Commissioner Molnar has started trying to besmirch other members of the commission and the department who don’t necessarily go along with his views, particularly related to his removal from office and his conduct,” Fielder said.
The internal investigation into Molnar is pending, as is a request Fielder made to Gov. Greg Gianforte on behalf of an internal “response team” to temporarily suspend Molnar, alleging interference with the investigation.

Molnar has argued he has only availed himself of his free speech rights in speaking out about the allegations.
His lawyer argued Molnar’s recent demotion made the suspension request to the governor moot, but the response team said he can still be disruptive, including through “media activity.”
In a phone call, Molnar said he volunteered to provide the cover sheets to the Commissioner of Political Practices as evidence, but he was told to hold off at this point in the complaint process.
“When Commissioner Bukacek is at the commission, she is supposed to do commission related work,” the complaint said. “Instead, she is doing personal business-related work.
“Since she is often in the office for only one or two hours per week … she is paid about $2,000 per hour of actual commission core functions and treating her elected position as a side hustle.
“Therefore, the time she spends at the commission working on her personal agendas is an insult to the ratepayers as the time would be far better spent doing her public job.”
Fielder said she believes Bukacek works at her medical practice Thursday, Friday and Saturday, and otherwise, works long hours at the Public Service Commission, as evidenced by her deliberations at public meetings.
“She’s demonstrated that she studies the material, she studies the law, she studies the evidence in the record,” Fielder said.
In a phone call, Commissioner of Political Practices Chris Gallus said he is still conducting an initial evaluation on the complaint, which includes confirming whether his office has authority in the matter.
Gallus said he can request additional information from either the complainant or the respondent, assess whether he or a previous commissioner has issued a decision in a similar case, and then issue a summary decision or proceed to a hearing.

Kelly Ayotte said she is “deeply committed” to pushing for state investments in child care amid ongoing funding obstacles and workforce shortages. 
During a forum on investing in child care Thursday in Manchester, Ayotte told child care advocates, stakeholders, and business owners that despite the “challenging budget environment,” New Hampshire remains committed to the recently expanded Child Care Scholarship Program. The state reported that as of summer more than 5,000 families were enrolled in the program, which is a state-federal partnership.
“There’s so much work to do on this issue,” Ayotte said of child care in general. “It goes hand in hand with our housing issues when it comes to our quality of life here in New Hampshire. I want to be a partner, and I want to work with the ideas that come out of this group.”
While government investments like the scholarship program aim to make child care more affordable, supply does not meet the current demand. Families across the Granite State struggle to enroll in and afford early education and care for their children, and providers are often unable to find the workforce necessary to boost capacity. A New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute study published in January found that between 2019 and 2023, the state was short of an average of more than 9,000 child care slots annually.
Ayotte said it is “exciting” that more Granite Staters are using the scholarship program, and that she will continue working with the Department of Health and Human Services to keep the program funded. 
She said that while the state tries to improve the workforce pipeline through its education system, she is also looking to expand incentives for businesses and nonprofits to invest in child care. 
“We need everyone at the table to bring more affordable child care options to our state,” Ayotte said. “Together, we’ll make sure New Hampshire stays the best place to raise a family.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ayottechildcare-1024x610.jpg,,,2025-10-31 14:16:32.345056

Like many parents, dropping off her children there in the mornings allows her to keep her job as a human resources worker. She trusts the teachers, and the kids have made friends. And, equally as important, she can afford it.
But, at pickup time on Tuesday, a daycare staff member handed her a letter informing her that Salt Lake County’s daycare programs had been terminated, scheduled to shut down at the end of the year.

“That was the first I had heard of it. The staff seemed also in shock about it. I mean, everyone seemed very emotional and in shock,” Walker said. “We had received no prior notice, anything, that this was even up for debate.”
That notification came through just hours after the Republican-majority Salt Lake County Council voted 5-4 to end the $2 million annual subsidy that kept four centers, mostly located on the west side of Salt Lake County, afloat.   
Why did the Council shut the program down?
Council member Aimee Winder Newton led a presentation during the Tuesday council meeting arguing that the county isn’t legally mandated to provide daycare — but it’s also not its role. Those who need help affording these services, she said, can apply to the Utah Department of Workforce Services’ child care stipend. 
Quoting a report the county commissioned earlier this year that evaluated the child care programs in the county, Winder Newton said, “the programs face mounting operational and financial challenges. Each center operates with limited coordination, leading to inconsistencies in staffing, budgeting and service delivery.”
Rates in county-sponsored centers are 50% to 60% below market averages, she added, which forces the county to subsidize $2 million a year for about 270 children. 
“I know sometimes it feels nice when you can try to help other people, but we’re not being equitable in how we’re helping people with this program,” she said. “We’ve got $6,000 to $10,000 a child subsidy that we’re giving, and it’s not helping enough kids in the valley.”
Childcare Service Analysis Salt Lake County Division of Parks & Recreation 10.29.25
Monthly rates for the program are about $200 per child, depending on ages. Walker, for example, pays $1,014 a month for her three kids aged 11, 8 and 5. Other programs she has considered would be at least twice that amount in the school year, and even more during the summer. 
“I don’t see a way that we can afford it. To be honest, it’s not even ‘it’ll be tight, but we can make it work.’ We don’t have double the budget for daycare, and to also be able to afford groceries and things like that that are also getting more expensive,” Walker said.
With a two-month notice, she doesn’t have much time to save up for it either. She worries many parents are in her position and will have to forgo child care altogether.
Dozens of parents are organizing online to take action, contacting their council members and planning to attend next council meeting on Tuesday.
“I just want people to know that they’re affecting real families and real people, that we’re not just a list of names in a center, that we are real families, and this will impact us all very negatively, and we were not given a voice in this decision at any point, or any heads up that it was even up for debate,” Walker said. “So I think we just want to make sure that we’re heard.”
‘It’s mean’
The news of the termination shocked and disappointed Utah Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City, who has advocated for more child care resources in the state. She said she’s actively working to find solutions to help the affected families.
Utah won’t expand child care access this year

“At the very moment families are losing SNAP benefits and working longer hours just to feed their children, the council’s recommendation to eliminate childcare options creates even greater barriers for working families trying simply to survive,” Escamilla said in a statement.
She added that suggesting families find other providers ignores that neighboring nonprofit providers have month-long wait lists, and they may not offer the same services.
“These centers offered more than supervision; they provided quality, affordable care with wraparound supports like transportation and meal services,” Escamilla said. “Expecting parents to find comparable care within a month is not just unrealistic, it’s mean.”
For-profit centers say they can fill the gap
Johnny Anderson, a Utah Private Child Care Association board member and president of Great Beginnings Academy — which owns nine daycare centers in the county — told the council that licensed child care centers are between 50% and 60% occupancy in the area, and they have plenty of space for any family looking to fill the gap the termination will leave.
He also highlighted that for-profit child care centers are struggling after taking several hits — first when the state implemented full-day kindergarten, and then when unlicensed home providers were allowed to have eight unrelated children in the home. 
“Those of us that are in the for-profit child care business, we are paying property taxes to this county to fund county services, and of course, the county is running child care programs that compete with us,” he said. “So I think that’s worth pointing out and recognizing, as you deliberate this with that.”



Let us know what you think...


 


However, Democratic council members expressed concern about the affordability dilemma families are about to face. 
Council member Jiro Johnson said that while for-profit child care centers have the capacity to fill the gap, they aren’t really available to families that can’t afford them. 
The decision also comes at the same time county leaders have proposed a nearly 20% tax property tax increase, which has drawn criticism across the valley.
Even if the state-sponsored stipend covers most of the bill for families switching child care centers, some of them may still not be able to cover even a $100 or $200 monthly increase in daycare bills.
“If we’re getting so much heat about $88 for the average family household per year,” Johnson said about the volume of public comments on the proposed tax increase, “imagine what that means to a family who now has to make similar payments per month to get child care, which may be absolutely necessary for that family to survive.”

But all the county’s voters have one choice to make Tuesday: who will be the next coroner.
The race hasn’t been competitive in over two decades. But this year, six candidates from different sectors of the emergency services and death care fields are vying to be the county’s next chief death investigator. The pay is $900 per month with an additional $185 per case, according to the current office holder.
Coroners are called to car wrecks and murder scenes, and wherever else a death has occurred that may be natural, sudden, unexpected or unnatural. They determine the cause and manner of death. They are also responsible for keeping records of death investigations for the last five years and coordinating with the state medical examiner’s office during investigations.
Coroners must make “reasonable efforts” to notify next-of-kin. At least seven Hinds County residents were buried without adequately notifying relatives from 2022 to 2023. Most families believed their loved ones were missing until they learned of their burial in a pauper field behind Raymond Detention Center. Hinds County Coroner Sharon Grisham-Stewart later admitted she struggled to find relatives of missing people. She retired soon after in December 2024. 
Jeramiah Howard, her chief deputy for five years, is interim/acting coroner and, along with five other candidates, is running to finish the last two years of  her four-year term.
Candidates must be at least 21, have a high school diploma or its equivalent and be eligible to vote. Only a handful of states have fewer prerequisites to become a coroner. Louisiana, Kansas, Ohio and North Dakota alone require that a coroner in most of their parishes or counties have a medical degree. 
Coroners must attend the Mississippi Forensics Laboratory and State Medical Examiner Death Investigation Training School upon election. Mississippi law mandates ongoing training by the state medical examiner’s office on specimen collection and locating next-of-kin every four years along with 24 hours of continuing education each year.
Most candidates in this election have worked crime scenes in some capacity. The candidate pool includes those who have done work in the private and public sector. All are Hinds County natives, though they’ve lived in other states and counties.

Crystal Houson has worked in law enforcement the last 22 years, including stints at the Hinds County Sheriff’s Department and Jackson State University. She got her start in community policing, getting to know repeat offenders and the neighborhood families. She spent four years as captain in the Warrants Division.
She said her work as both a patrol captain and a public information officer taught her the importance of record management and how to preserve and organize evidence. She also took an advanced course in death investigation to aid her on visits to crime scenes.
“Throughout my career, I have investigated numerous deaths, crime scenes, and traumatic incidents — developing the skills necessary to determine facts accurately and without bias,” she wrote in a statement to Mississippi Today.
She said she wants to restore trust and integrity to the office and would strive to be accountable to the public if elected. Her goal would be to speed up the process of identifying next of kin and to provide more regular updates to grieving families on the status of autopsies. Finding families spread across the county was once part of her job.
She plans to lobby the Hinds County Board of Supervisors to approve the burial of more unclaimed bodies to address a backlog. She would allow families without an initial preference for a funeral home to keep loved ones stored at the morgue while they research options.
She has canvassed the community as a patrol officer.
“I believe that this role is not simply a position of duty; it is a profound commitment to assisting families during some of the most challenging times in their lives,” she said.

Jeramiah Howard joined the Pocahontas Volunteer Fire Department after a tree took out his electricity and the volunteer fire chief arrived to help and proceeded to recruit him.
“If you get my power on, I promise I’ll be at the next meeting,” Howard told him.
He’s been with the department 17 years, including 10 as fire chief. He lives in a home in Pocahontas.
“I don’t want to be the president or the governor or anything at all,” Howard told Mississippi Today. “I want people to genuinely remember me as a good dude. If I could do good, I stop and help. That’s always been my MO.”
TV shows such as “ER” got him interested in becoming a paramedic when he enrolled at Holmes Community College. He enjoyed learning about how even obscure illnesses can alter the human body.
The job had him entering homes engulfed in flames in search of pets and family heirlooms, and prying victims from wrecked cars. It was a departure from his day job as a project manager for a government contractor. He enjoyed helping his regulars like a woman who was prone to falls and often required help getting up.
For many years in the coroner’s office, he operated with only the White Pages and Google to identify family members of the deceased. It was challenging when the deceased had lost touch with family or come from a fractured one. He also had to remove the bodies of those abandoned at funeral homes by financially struggling families.
Howard’s latest initiative is to secure similar databases used by law enforcement to aid in body identification and next-of-kin notification. He depends on technology afforded the Capitol Police to provide fingerprint identification to bodies. Otherwise, if a death occurred on a Friday evening, he would have to wait until Monday for results from an ink fingerprint scan. 
Howard has knocked on hundreds of doors to notify families of dead relatives. He has been on hours-long group calls with grieving relatives.
“You never think you can find the right words to say,” he said. “Everyone takes death differently. I am always happy to tell the relatives everything I know.”
His job involves difficult decisions made on little sleep. He says he once got a call from hospital staff that needed help identifying a grandmother’s relatives. They were close to “pulling the plug,” he said. He visited every address listed for the woman’s relatives in central Mississippi, and eventually found next of kin. The grandmother spent her last three hours with her grandchildren. 
He also dissuaded a mother from visiting the morgue where her daughter was transported after a car wreck on the interstate.
Howard said he aims to improve transparency surrounding pending investigations and departmental shortcomings. If elected, he hopes to procure a backgrounding database and a contractor to renovate the county morgue. His goal is to be the “gold standard” for death investigation in the state, and rebuild trust with Hinds County residents.
“The ones for whom this race means something are those who have felt loss.”

Stephanie Meachum was office manager for the Hinds County Coroner’s Office from 2005 until 2016. The job taught her how to organize agency records and log bodies. She sometimes had to fill in as a deputy coroner and collect information from a crime scene as part of investigations. She also set the office budget.
She has run the death division at the state Department of Health’s vital statistics office since 2016. In this role, she coordinates with coroners across the state and ensures death certificates are issued on time and filled out properly. She regularly phones funeral home directors, nursing homes and other stakeholders that may not understand the paperwork required for death registration. She also regularly speaks with the state Crime Lab, ensuring that deaths resulting from domestic violence and drug abuse are correctly labeled. 
“The job is basically understanding what you’re seeing and reading, and answering the questions to the best that you can,” Meachum said.
In her current job, she has observed that Hinds County, even considering its larger intake of bodies in relation to other counties, lags in processing  death certificates. 
As coroner, she said she would strive to make people more aware of crime victim services. She also envisions the role as more of a presence in the community, traveling to ensure that families have a plan during hurricane season.
“I feel like I’m much more qualified because I have done every aspect of the coroner’s office,” Meachum said. “I’m not learning what to do. I’m coming in with over 20 years of death investigation experience. I’ve been on the on-the-street investigation side. I’ve done hospital calls. I’ve been through mass fatalities and mass disasters.”
She would like more candidates to speak about what occurred in 2021 when the coroner’s office caught heat for its next-of-kin notification policy. She believes the office should be more transparent about its shortcomings, providing regular updates on social media and at forums.
When she worked as office manager for the Hinds County coroner, deputy coroners sometimes had an uneven distribution of work, which Meachum said contributed to a case backlog. She also grew frustrated with deputy coroners who relied on email and fax to ensure important records were shared, when the people could’ve just dropped the paperwork in-person. 
“I’m not just a person who’s going to come out and declare someone deceased without doing the investigative work,” she said.

Schwanna Roberts has worked in funeral homes since she was 17. She was so young that her mother had to sign a release form before she could start. She was initially an embalmer but for the past decade has worked as a funeral home director in Jackson and Chicago.
She remembers when she first got interested in the death care industry. She was attending the wake of her grandmother’s husband and was put off by the embalming work. His skin was discolored, and his body was poorly positioned in the casket. She vowed to her grandmother that she could do a better job. 
Her grandmother continued to take her to funerals for inspiration. Her favorite part of a funeral is the two-minute remarks given by family at the end to “lighten the mood.” 
Roberts became the grief counselor soon after she started working at the funeral home. She said supervisors and colleagues have praised her clear and calming presence.
She hopes to establish a family liaison role within the office to provide “a single, compassionate point of contact during difficult times.” Another priority is establishing protocols to ensure families receive timely updates with empathy and respect.
“The coroner needs to be someone who is for the people,” Roberts said. “You need someone who can tell the truth. You need someone that has great character.” 
When her brother died seven years ago, she couldn’t speak his name without crying. The experience, more than over a decade of funeral home work, made her realize how critical clear communication and a dedicated staff can be for mourners. She started Doves of Peace Ministry to cater the meal after the funeral for two grieving families each month. During difficult times, the 38-year old mother of one daughter said she leans on her family and her faith.
“The main thing is to have someone with a heart in that position,” Roberts said. “Trust has been broken. When there isn’t a communication breakdown or outdated procedures, families aren’t frustrated.”
Her campaign flyer reads: “for the families no one’s checking on, for the families still waiting for answers.” She said she regularly calls random Hinds County numbers in the White Pages as part of campaigning and knocks on dozens of doors.
“There will be no growth if the wrong person is elected,” she said. “I don’t have big plans of wanting a state-of-the-art facility. We should be focused on the basics like identifying and contacting families”

Davista Tillman has wanted to be coroner since she was in fourth grade. Grisham-Stewart spoke to her classroom for career day at Wells Power APAC. She was only 10 years old, but was inspired to see a woman in a county position.
“I told myself I was going to put in some work until that time comes,” Tillman told Mississippi Today.
After graduating from Lanier High School in Jackson, she attended mortuary school where she obtained certificates in mortuary science and funeral services. She later obtained her license as both an embalmer and funeral director. She received her associate degree in criminal justice from Holmes Community College. 
Tillman began her career as an orderly in the adult emergency department at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, the only Level 1 trauma center in the state. She later became an autopsy technician, assisting the pathologist in thorough examinations.
She worked as a funeral director in Jackson and around the state. She currently works as a funeral home director/coroner liaison and post-mortem anatomical donation technician for the Mississippi Organ Recovery Agency. Once a body comes in, she removes, preserves and transports tissue to be used in some cases for what she calls “life-improving surgery.”
“When doing this for so long, you as a person can become numb to death,” Tillman said. “It has also taught me to be more delicate with people’s feelings. Most people’s emotions are all over the place. You learn not to take it to heart when families lash out at you. You become their support in their hardest days.”
She is always on call as a technician for MORA and for the funeral home. She sometimes comes in to work at 10 p.m. or 2 a.m. Her schedule is already similar to that of the coroner and coroner’s deputies, she said. 
“My life experience has given me the knowledge to succeed in this role,” she said. “When I worked as an autopsy technician, you would see the difference between a heart attack and other ailments on the body. Seeing homicides as an embalmer, you see entrance and exit wounds and learn to look for the ligature marks.”
She would make renovating the county morgue a priority. She also envisions an opportunity for mortuary students to embalm bodies that spend excess time at the morgue. If she is going to be the face that parents see on the worst day of their lives, she wants to be more active in the community to offset that shock.

Bryan White joined the candidate forum hosted by the Hinds County Democratic Party Executive Committee on Thursday. Dressed in an emergency services uniform, White wanted attendees to know that he was not a “career politician.”
He reminded candidates that he had a law enforcement background, which he deemed important given Hinds County’s high crime rate.
He envisioned an app that would track the progress of death certificates for loved ones. He expressed a desire to work closer with the Hinds County Sheriff’s Department. If elected, he said he would track homeless people through a database.
The pauper burial controversy was a reminder of how many homeless people live in Jackson, he said.
While on a wellness check, he said he solved a difficult case by determining a deceased person died of carbon monoxide poisoning. He identified a nearby lawn mower as the problem. The mower had recently run out of gas.
“You have to look for the smoking gun,” he said.

The verdict is in: Idaho ranks 14th and Washington ranks 37th when lining up the most religious states in the nation.
How the Pew Research Center got the results is straightforward: it judged a state’s religiosity based on residents’ answers to four questions on a survey. The reasons leading to a state’s place in the list are a lot harder to conclusively determine. In fact, it’s mostly guesswork, sociologists said.
“One of the things is, when you have descriptive data like this, you can really only start to create hypotheses,” Mark Killian, Whitworth University sociology professor who studies religion, said.
Sociologists of religion have some theories, though: the historic presence of certain religious groups, political migration and a state’s laws and regulations.
The most mentioned theory was the role of migration due to political beliefs and its connection to religion.
One reason people choose to move to other states is due to an alignment between an individual’s political beliefs and the state’s political leaning, Killian said. Because politics are becoming increasingly correlated with and tied to religious identity, migration due to politics turns into migration due to religion, he added.
Pew’s 2023-24 Religious Landscape Study found that 61% of those who have a high level of religiousness tend to lean Republican compared to 32% who lean Democrat. Eight percent had no leaning.
The study also found that 67% of people who have a low level of religiousness lean Democrat compared to 27% who lean Republican. Five percent had no leaning.
Over the past decade, Scott Draper, College of Idaho anthropology and sociology professor who studies religion, said people have increasingly been identifying as both Republicans and conservative/evangelical Protestants.
The connection between both identities could go back even further than that, Killian said. Prior to the mid-20th century, he said that evangelicals had a variety of political leanings or were nonpartisan. Then some people, most notably American pastor and televangelist Jerry Falwell,  worked to merge religious identification with specific political stances — especially the pro-life movement.
“Up until that point, a lot of evangelicals weren’t necessarily pro-choice, but there was no pro-life movement” in evangelicalism, Killian said, because the pro-life movement was primarily Catholic and evangelicals wanted to keep themselves ideologically separate.
Then, Killian said, Falwell worked to consolidate political power by commingling religious views with certain political stances, primarily abortion and sexuality.
“All that to say, now three generations later, we have those reverberations and these worldviews have spun off,” he said. “There’s some who think you cannot think of faith apart from your politics.”
 How evangelicals merged faith and politics

Political identification and its correlation with belief systems, or the lack thereof, seems to go both ways. Desiree Brunette, a Boise State University sociology lecturer who studies religion, said liberal people tend to be less religious. That trend could explain why Washington, a liberal state, ranks low overall on religiosity in Pew’s study.
The Religious Landscape Study judged the “overall religiousness” of people through a combination of four factors: prayer frequency, belief in God or a universal spirit, religion’s importance to people’s lives and religious attendance. It determined that 37% of people in Idaho are highly religious compared to 25% of people in Washington.
Determining the religiosity of a state can also change based on how it is measured. Draper said the study measured overall religiosity pretty reasonably, but that many sociologists of religion determine people’s religious commitment based on frequency of religious attendance.
“People can talk about what they believe or how strongly they feel or think something,” Draper said. “It’s the actual behavior – are you actually going to church?”
The percentage of people who attend religious services at least monthly tells a similar story for Washington, which also ranks 37th in the nation with 27% of people attending religious services at least monthly. The alternative idea of religiosity changes Idaho’s line in the list slightly, moving up to 11th in the nation with 40% of people attending religious services at least monthly.
No matter how it is measured, sociologists said the connection between politics and religion and the migration of people based on partisan ideologies could be driving the levels of religiousness in each state.
Californians migrating to Idaho is an example. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that, in 2023, almost 82,000 people moved from another state to Idaho, and over 20% of those people, the largest percentage of any state, came from California.
Anecdotally, Draper said conservative Idaho residents often despair about the in-migration of Californians due to perceptions of conflicting political views.
“I often want to point out that I think those Californians are probably a little more conservative than you think,” Draper said. “It’s geographical sorting based on partisanship.”
“Now, this is very hypothetical,” Draper said, adding that he didn’t think people were moving in between states solely due to religious views.
 
Lasting influence of the ‘Mormon Corridor’

Past migrations of religious groups and their continued presence in a state could also influence the state’s religious ranking, Draper said.
Idaho and Utah both tend to be pretty religious when compared to other western states, which Draper said might be due to the influence of Latter-day Saints, who are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. “They’re instrumental in our state, for religious identity,” Draper said.
Driven by a desire for religious freedom, Latter-day Saints began migrating beyond the borders of the United States in the mid-1800s, looking for a place with a low population, and settling primarily in Utah and the surrounding area, now known as the “Mormon Corridor.”
When Brunette moved to the state 20 years ago, she said she noticed how many laws seemed tied to religious views — things like not being able to buy liquor on Sundays in some places, the near-total abortion ban and the faith-healing exemption to child abuse and neglect laws.
“That felt really informed from the Latter-day Saints population, ” Brunette said.
The religious-based laws in Idaho seem to be based on a Christian worldview rather than other religious belief systems, Brunette said. For example, abortion bans are widely viewed as a violation of Jewish religious freedom, she added.
Differences in the religious ranking of states could be tied to these types of laws and views on religious freedom, which tend to attract certain religious communities, Brunette said.
“There’s more protections here for people that might be considered a little fringy,” she said, mentioning fundamentalist groups like the Followers of Christ. “That would be my guess.”
The study’s data gets more granular, and the findings indicate potential trends in the way people engage with and experience religion in their lives.
In Washington, 30% of people say religion is very important in their lives compared to 45% in Idaho. Only eight states had 50% or more of people who said religion was very important in their lives.
Although religion can often be seen as very important to people and influencing their political reasoning and discussions, Draper said it was interesting that most people weren’t ranking it as very important in their lives.
Although not directly comparable due to changes in how the survey was conducted, Pew’s data found that the amount of people who say religion is very important in their lives is dropping.
In 2007, 58% of adults in Idaho said religion is very important in their lives, compared to 51% in 2014 and 45% in 2023-24.

The decline is true for Washington, as well. In 2007, 48% of adults in the state said religion is very important in their lives compared to 44% in 2014 and 30% in 2023-24.

The decline of religion’s importance directly conflicts with the rise in people’s perception of religion’s importance in American life.
According to Pew, people’s perception of whether religion is gaining influence in American life jumped up significantly in 2025, although 68% of people still feel it is losing influence.

Just like overall religious trends, it’s all guesswork on why religion is seen to be gaining influence in American life, while fewer people are ranking it as very important to them.
Brunette speculated that the people influencing politics are both the most religious and have the loudest voices. Killian said his hunch is that people aren’t ranking religion as very important in their lives because they’re replacing it with politics.
“Religion becomes less important because politics is religion for some people now in these conservative states,” Killian said. There are others who ascribe to religion who view the uplifting of political views based on Christianity as a form of idolatry, he added.
 Evangelical growth as mainline churches shrink

The breakdown of people who ascribed to certain religions in 2023-24 and its comparison to previous Religious Landscape Studies also reveals trends in religious demographics.
In Idaho, Draper pointed out that Catholics and mainline Protestants have dropped from 18% and 16% respectively in 2007 to 9% and 7% respectively in 2023-24.
At the same time, evangelical Protestants increased in the state from 22% in 2007 to 31% in 2023-24.
Latter-day Saints have also declined in Idaho, from 23% in 2007 to 14% in 2023-24, despite the way Draper said they have “historically characterized my state.”
The drop could be due to the outmigration of Latter-day Saints, or attrition, Killian said.
Washington has seen drops in identification with Christian religious sects and some growth in populations of “other religions,” but Draper said the most notable change for him was the increase in people identifying as religiously unaffiliated, often called “nones” because they believe in nothing in particular.
In 2007, 23% of surveyed Washington residents identified as religiously unaffiliated compared to 38% in 2023-24.
“I’m really struck by that,” Draper said. “That’s really high.”
There are often a lot of reasons nones could be growing, Draper said, adding that how the groups are measured or whether people understand their own affiliation can affect the data. He said the Pew Research Center’s data tends to be reliable.
The growth of nones can be hypothesized to be tied to politics, Draper said. Other sociology of religion scholars have proposed that people are disaffiliating from specific religious groups because of how the religion is becoming associated with politics, he added.
“A lot of younger people who grew up in evangelical Protestant families, they become sort of disgusted with their family’s politics and they might back away entirely from religion and might identify less strongly, and might prefer a different term,” Draper said. “They might be devout still, but not want to identify.”
The growth of nones in Washington could also be tied to partisan geographical sorting, Draper said.
At the end of the day, the sociologists said interpreting the data is all speculation.
“There are so many different layers to this,” Killian said.

Wade Andrew Robinson of rural Madison County, running against board President Kevin Halterman of Indianola for the board’s fourth-district seat, was arrested at 7:47 p.m. Oct. 30 and charged with extortion with the intent to expose to ridicule, hatred or contempt, according to inmate booking information from the county. Extortion is a class D felony in Iowa.

Halterman said in an interview he filed a complaint against Robinson with the sheriff’s department regarding alleged election violations, but declined to discuss details of the complaint. He also requested a no contact order against Robinson, according to Warren County court documents.
Robinson was released on $5,000 bond and is scheduled for an initial court appearance on Nov. 12. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Warren County Attorney Douglas Eichholz said he had no comment.
According to the affidavit included in court records, Halterman reported to the Warren County Sheriff’s Office that he had received an email from Robinson on Aug. 14 in which Robinson allegedly requested a “release settlement and non-disclosure agreement” and $1 million. On Aug. 20, according to the affidavit, Robinson emailed again, telling Halterman “he was planning to run for District 4 Board Seat and was going to start things that weekend.” In order to have his name in consideration for the seat, Robinson needed to have his election paperwork submitted by Aug. 25.
Robinson allegedly said in his email to Halterman he would “hold off” on launching a run for the seat if Halterman agreed to his wishes, according to the affidavit.
“It is believed Wade Robinson is extorting the victim to agree to the money request and he won’t run for the board seat,” the affidavit stated.
Robinson previously served as dean of Student Resources and Ankeny Student Success at DMACC, and has filed complaints against the college and others connected to it for alleged Title IX violations and retaliation against him as a whistleblower. He also accused former board president Joe Pugel and DMACC President Rob Denson of having mishandled university resources in a past election.
Elections for the seat, which covers the Carlisle, Indianola, Interstate 35, Martensdale-St Marys, Melcher-Dallas, Norwalk, Pleasantville, Southeast Warren, Van Meter and Winterset school districts and part of Waukee, will take place Nov. 4.
This is a developing story.

Mike Shower, R-Wasilla, speaks Friday, April 12, 2024, on Senate Bill 187, the capital budget. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Senate Minority Leader Mike Shower, R-Wasilla, will resign from the Alaska Senate on Monday, according to a resignation letter submitted to Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak.
The resignation was expected. Shower was named the lieutenant governor candidate for Republican gubernatorial candidate Bernadette Wilson in September, and he said he would resign from his seat early.
Shower did not immediately respond to a phone call and text messages seeking comment on Thursday afternoon.
Under Alaska law and Republican Party rules, party officials in Shower’s district will nominate possible replacements to Gov. Mike Dunleavy, who will select the replacement. 
It’s a process Dunleavy will be familiar with: Before being elected governor in 2018, Dunleavy served in the Senate and resigned early to focus on his election. Then-Gov. Bill Walker nominated Mike Shower to fill Dunleavy’s seat and Shower went on to win the next election in his own right.
Shower’s possible replacements must be Republicans, because Shower is a Republican, and otherwise meet the Alaska Constitution’s requirements for office.
The governor’s selection must be confirmed by the Senate’s other Republicans before being seated. That includes the other five Republicans in the Senate’s six-person minority caucus, as well as the five Republicans in the bipartisan Senate majority caucus.
Confirmation isn’t guaranteed: In 2018, Republican senators rejected Walker’s first choice to replace Dunleavy. Walker’s second choice withdrew his name from consideration. 
In 2019, Republicans rejected Dunleavy’s first choice to replace Anchorage Republican Sen. Chris Birch, who died in office.
Each of Alaska’s state senate districts consists of two House districts. Reps. George Rauscher, R-Sutton, and Kevin McCabe, R-Big Lake, respectively represent each of the House districts within Shower’s Senate district, and both men said they will be putting their names forward for consideration.
Rauscher had already announced his intention to seek Shower’s seat in the 2026 election.
It was not immediately clear on Thursday if additional candidates would be proposed for consideration by party officials.
If either Rauscher or McCabe are chosen, it would set off a domino effect: Dunleavy would then be able to select a new House representative to replace the person who moved to the Senate.
Sen. Robert Myers, R-North Pole, said he believes Shower has been talking to Dunleavy about possible options.
“I think the expectation at this point is Rep. Rauscher, but I don’t want to weigh in any further than that,” Myers said of his preference.
Myers said the resignation makes sense. 
“Honestly, it makes some relationships a little bit awkward if you’re still in the Legislature while running for a statewide seat like that. It could have potentially complicated next year’s session a little bit,” he said. “I wish him well on what he embarks on for the future, whether that’s politically or personally.”
While the Senate minority caucus will now need to pick a new leader, Myers said he doesn’t expect the next legislative year will have other significant changes because there’s someone new in Shower’s seat.
“The (senate) majority has already laid out what their priorities are,” he said. “I don’t see votes changing, numbers changing, majority-minority votes on major bills, or anything like that.”
At least one more Senate resignation is expected soon. Sen. Shelley Hughes, R-Palmer, is running for governor and has said she will resign in time for a replacement to be selected before the legislative session begins in January.
“I typically put in about 40 hours of work, even during the interim, 40 hours or more. And so, juggling that along with the governor electoral campaign is tricky, but there’s certain things I want to finish up and make sure I’m leaving things in good order as I pass out of the district,” she said.
At the same time, she wants to leave time for Dunleavy to pick both her replacement and a replacement for a House member if he selects either Reps. Cathy Tilton, R-Wasilla, or DeLena Johnson, R-Palmer, to replace her.
Tilton has already filed to run for Senate in 2026. 
Hughes said that regardless of the replacement, she doesn’t think the Senate will change significantly. She also said that she’s going to stay out of the discussion of who will replace Shower as Senate Minority Leader.
“That’s up to that group to decide,” she said. “I’m not going to be one of them. I’m not going to meddle and try to tell them who should or should not be Senate Minority Leader.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/240412-Mike-Shower-copy-1024x717.jpg,,,2025-10-31 14:02:34.575980

(Photo by Rosanne Skirble for Maryland Matters)Lincoln Smith’s food forest is next to a gas station and a church off a highway in Bowie.
Smith says his mission as the director of Forested is to rewild this former cornfield, stripped in the course of Maryland’s agricultural history of its trees, its soil depleted and biodiversity drained by industrialized single-crop food production.
“We’re trying to restore [the] forest and produce food for people in a forested agroecosystem,” he said.
When he rented 10 acres from the neighboring church in 2012, the first thing Smith did was to take note of what was already there. Luck would have it that a stand of mature native trees formed a natural border, and beneath their canopy were wild black raspberry bushes and persimmon trees, whose seeds were spread into the field by wildlife that ate the fruit.
Now, on this fall day, Smith and crew harvest those persimmons, plus other native and nonnative fruits and berries from the bushes, gardens and trees that cover the landscape.
“We have over 100 species that we’ve planted, as well as many species that we didn’t plant, that are wild and that we’ve allowed to come in and grow here,” Smith said.
“We grow in layers,” he said. “We have big trees together with understory-size trees and shrubs and vines and patches of vegetables, and native flowers to support beneficial insects and habitat for the birds that eat those insects.”

Smith says that as the forest grows, people come, just to walk around, pick its fruits and attend workshops and other events like the twice-yearly Forest Feast, a multicourse, forest-to-table chef meal.
“[This fall] we had baklava made from butternuts, chestnuts and hazelnuts and dried persimmons. We had acorn crostini topped with berry jam, imitation crab cake made from a beautiful lion’s mane mushroom together with our hot peppers and herbs, and sweet potatoes seasoned with some of our nuts,” he said.
Growing an urban food forest network
Forested is part of a growing food forest network in the U.S. In Maryland, that includes the Maryland Forest Service and Queen Anne’s County Edible Forest Trail in Centreville, Long Creek Nursery in Frederick, the Reed Center for Ecosystem Reintegration in Middletown, and a food forest behind a Brunswick food bank.
Add to that list the Takoma Park Elementary School, and two sections on the Takoma Park/Silver Spring Montgomery College campus. Those projects are led by Miles Amoore, co-founder of the nonprofit Community Food Forest Collective, and Tierney Acosta, a Montgomery College horticulture student, who leads the college permaculture club.
Over the weekend, both were giving tours at the Community Food Forest Collective Fall Food Festival. The three-quarter-acre college site at the corner of a busy intersection includes broad sections filled with herbs, vegetables, wildflowers, berry bushes, grape vines, hops and nut trees.
Work at the site began in 2023 with 450 cubic yards of leaf moss, wood chips and compost. Amoore says the earth responded with early signs of an emerging diverse ecosystem.
“It turned grass into soil and insects and bees and fungal life came back almost overnight,” he said.
The rest of the food forest, with the exception of a mature stand of oaks and holly trees already there, went in by design, with the help of nearly 500 volunteers, many recruited by  Acosta from her peers at the college, students and friends.

“We’ve planted several thousand plants and over 100 different species found within our watershed,” she said. “Now it is alive and thriving, not only for humans, but for wildlife, and the amazing thing about planting this way in multiple layers is that it really feeds itself, and is really resilient.”
Acosta says the food forest also plants an opportunity.
“It is really just a fun place to connect with your community,” she said. “[This] is a time when we are so polarized, we really wanted a place where you can just come and be who you are.”
Whether that means attending any of the day’s workshops that range from how to make acorn flour, pickle cucumbers, brew Ethiopian coffee, use fig leaves in a range of Turkish dishes or pasta making with freshly picked garden herbs, Amoore says, the food forest can also sow seeds of change.
“It’s about bringing people in relationship to the land and with each other. We want thriving spaces that are hubs for education, gatherings, celebration, ritual and joy,” he said.
Amoore’s vision is to expand food forests into communities and schools across the region.
“These hubs can have a ripple effect by reconnecting people to the land, to each other and to the source of food,” he said.
‘Mother Nature takes care of us’
Smith, trained in landscape design, says, the food forest mimics the structure and function of a natural forest. Unlike the cornfield, its diverse biosystem helps protect it, and keeps it thriving. A diverse population of predatory insects helps control pests.
It’s here that Smith brings clients, including private landowners and municipal officials, to show them how to adapt his ideas to their properties.

“We need to have healthy, thriving ecosystems full of biodiversity and wildlife habitat and water filtration, building soil and sequestering carbon. All that needs to happen in our production lands,” Smith said, adding that each new food forest is a step in that direction.
Smith works with a small paid staff as well as dedicated volunteers who take on multiple tasks year-round, from pruning to planting. On this day, volunteer Jenn Mott is harvesting the last of the hot peppers, among the many chores she’s taken on since January, when she discovered Forested.
She says here she can step outside of her daily work routine into the restorative powers of the forest.
“Mother Nature takes care of us,” she said. “With just a tiny bit of effort, she rewards us and sustains us with so much abundance, not just with food, but also, emotionally and spiritually.”
Arman Milanian agrees. The University of Maryland graduate student is among the longest-serving volunteers, coming regularly for over a decade.
Today he is helping supervise homeschooled children and their parents in removing vines and picking a large haul of sweet potatoes. He says the space pulls him in.
“[It’s] the amount of birds, the amount of insects, the amount of flowers, the amount of food. Those are gifts from Nature,” he said. “[We’ve] invited Nature in, and Nature provides.”

(Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)The group behind a statewide push to legalize recreational marijuana filed suit against the DeSantis administration Friday for allegedly slow-walking the process to put its proposed amendment on the Florida ballot.
Smart & Safe Florida is hoping the Florida Supreme Court will force the Secretary of State and Director of the Division of Elections to complete the next step in the amendment process: issuing a letter acknowledging that Smart & Safe has enough support for the marijuana amendment to advance.
This is its second lawsuit this month against the election officials.
“It is nonsensical, and contrary to the express constitutional and statutory mandates, to allow the Secretary and Director to indefinitely refuse to issue the…Letter and frustrate the constitutional order,” wrote Tallahassee attorney Glenn Burhans, Jr. in his 25-page request for a writ of mandamus.
He pointed out that Smart & Safe has secured more than three times the number of verified petitions (over 660,000) needed to make it to the ballot, and in August asked Secretary of State Cord Byrd and Division of Elections Director Maria Matthews to issue a letter to the Florida Attorney General confirming that the group has enough verified forms to continue.
But three months later, in an unusual move, the department still hasn’t issued the required letter. This throws the fate of the proposed amendment into a dubious light due to a state law requiring the Florida Supreme Court to sign off on the amendment before April 1, for clarity’s sake. The court can’t do that if Byrd doesn’t submit his letter to the AG, who then can’t ask the court to offer an opinion.
Byrd’s office declined to comment on “pending litigation” to the Phoenix.
‘Withholding the letter’
DeSantis and his allies, including DeSantis-appointed Byrd, have been vehemently opposed to legalizing recreational marijuana in Florida. During the 2024 cycle when Smart & Safe first attempted to legalize the drug with Amendment 3, DeSantis encouraged a multi-million dollar campaign against the proposal.
Alongside his wife, First Lady Casey DeSantis, the two toured the state decrying the drug’s smell and insisting big corporations were trying to write themselves into the constitution. Attorney General James Uthmeier, the governor’s former chief of staff, has come under fire after his political committee to defeat the amendment received millions that originated from a Medicaid settlement doled out to Casey DeSantis’ charity, Hope Florida.
Separate grand juries are now allegedly investigating the DeSantis administration’s role in defeating the 2024 measure and Hope Florida’s shadowy financials.
In his petition, Burhans suggested that Byrd and Matthews may be purposely roadblocking the marijuana amendment by attempting to stall out Smart & Safe’s proposal by both waiting out the clock and ordering county supervisors on Oct. 3 to trash as many as 200,000 signatures — nearly one-quarter of what’s needed to qualify for next year’s ballot — because organizers failed to provide the entire amendment to people it reached out to by mail.
This allegedly “unlawful” move was the basis of Smart & Safe’s Oct. 19 suit against the administration in Circuit Court. Now it’s saying this is part of a larger push to smother the amendment before it gets to the ballot.

“Respondents appear to be withholding the…Letter on the hopes that the county supervisors’ compliance with the Secretary’s Directive might result in the Petition falling below the statutory threshold,” Burhans wrote. “There is no source of law that grants Respondents this authority.”
This is Smart & Safe’s second attempt to legalize recreational marijuana in Florida. Although its amendment received 56% support in 2024 among Floridians, it wasn’t enough to reach the 60% threshold needed to amend the state constitution.
“The Director did not respond to Smart & Safe’s August 12 letter requesting issuance of the…Letter or explain why the letter had not been issued,” the petition says. “As of the date of this filing…Smart & Safe’s Petition has met the threshold for issuance of the…Letter. The Respondents must therefore be compelled to perform their indisputable legal duty.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/marijuana.jpeg,,,2025-10-31 14:02:34.575980

The advertisement of the amendment comes amid a national wave of redistricting fights, with Republican-led states such as Texas, Missouri and North Carolina having recently pursued mid-cycle map changes — a trend Virginia Democrats say threatens to weaken the commonwealth’s leverage and representation in Congress.
The underlying amendment would leave intact the independent redistricting commission created via referendum in 2020, but carve out an “option” for the legislature to act between Jan. 1, 2025 and Oct. 31, 2030 if another state redraws its congressional districts for non-census or non-court-ordered reasons.
 Democrats defend effort as safeguard

The Senate floor debate quickly expanded beyond the procedural question at hand, becoming a broader clash over the future of redistricting in Virginia and nationally. 
Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, who chairs the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee, cast the amendment as a safeguard against what he described as a coordinated attempt to weaken democratic systems. 
Rouse said Virginia had already “seen the purge of voting rolls,” efforts to “restrict access to the ballot box,” and bills seeking to limit early voting — all part of a national pattern he tied to President Donald Trump. 
“We do see evidence that the system is being rigged by a wannabe-dictator out of Washington,” he said.
Rouse said Virginians struggling under the effects of the federal shutdown — from unpaid workers to families losing SNAP benefits — “may want to say something about that” in the years ahead, and this amendment simply gives them the choice to respond. 
“What it does not do, it does not eliminate or dissolve the Virginia redistricting commission,” he said. “It is not a mandate, but it gives (voters) a say on how their country is being run, and how their representatives are representing them.”
Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, said Virginia was confronting a reality voters could not have predicted when they approved the redistricting reform five years ago. He warned that states such as Texas and Missouri were now using mid-cycle redistricting to lock in power, while Virginia remains “unable to fight with one hand tied behind its back.”
“The Republicans doubled down on gerrymandering,” Surovell said, arguing the result would be a decade of congressional dominance even if Democrats won more votes nationwide. “That’s not democracy. It’s not what we signed up for, and it’s not sustainable.” 
He added that in an ideal world, Congress would ban partisan gerrymandering nationwide, but until then, “we can’t allow a certain partisan tyrannical majority to continue to gerrymander itself in a permanent power while we sit around and say our commitment to principle.”
Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, said the amendment was a proportional response to “opportunistic, mid-decade redistricting” now being encouraged by the Trump-Vance administration. 
“We’ve never had a president threaten and strong-arm state governors and legislators for changes to their state’s maps, for partisan games,” he said. “Yet that is exactly what we are seeing now.” 
VanValkenburg argued that what Republicans truly feared was that voters might approve the amendment: “I feel pretty confident that if this thing does go to them, they’re going to pass it. And Donald Trump will have to face the music in 2026.”
 GOP calls move “a power grab” that bypasses voters

Republicans countered that Democrats were misrepresenting the amendment’s reach — and more importantly, its consequences. 
Sen. Glen Sturtevant, R-Chesterfield, called it “a violation of the public’s trust,” pointing to the amendment’s release date just days before the election. 
“Over a million Virginians have already cast their ballots,” he said, arguing that voters never had a chance to know where candidates stood on the proposal. The move, he said, “completely undermines the intervening election safeguard that our Constitution requires.”
Sturtevant also pointed to the 2020 constitutional amendment, approved by 2.3 million Virginians, which created the redistricting commission and removed lawmakers from the map-drawing process. 
“They said very clearly that politicians should not be drawing the maps,” he said. “Yet this amendment would strip that commission of its authority and give that power back to the very politicians that the voters removed from the process.”

Sen. Mark Obenshain, R-Harrisonburg, echoed that argument, saying the amendment violated the constitutional requirement that an intervening election must occur before lawmakers can approve a proposed amendment for the second time. 
“That is being violated by virtue of the fact that this election is already underway,” he said, calling the move “a deliberate and clear effort to disenfranchise those million Virginia voters.”
Sen. Danny Diggs, R-York, argued the proposal represented a shift away from fair representation and toward national partisan strategy. 
“It takes the authority to redraw congressional districts away from the independent redistricting commission that the citizens voted to create in 2020,” he said, and “gives it instead to the General Assembly … to use congressional redistricting as a means of manipulating power in Washington.”
Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, accused Democrats of attempting to engineer a 10-1 congressional split in their favor. 
“This is not about options, this is very direct. We don’t care about fair districts, we care about making sure that there will be 10 Democratic congressional seats from Virginia next November. That’s what this vote is,” he said, referring to his colleagues across the aisle. 
Gov. Glenn Youngkin blasted the vote in a statement Friday afternoon, calling the entire process “shameful, fundamentally wrong, and illegal.” 
He accused Democrats of pushing the amendment through “in a party-line vote, in an eleventh-hour special session at the tail end of the election,” and said lawmakers did so “with debate silenced, members threatened with removal, and resolutions against political violence shot down.” 
But Democrats rejected the argument that the resolution was a partisan effort, insisting the public would still hold the final say. 
Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, noted that even if lawmakers pass the amendment a second time in 2026, “the same citizens who voted two to one against partisan gerrymandering will still have the final say.” She argued the proposal “in no way takes away any decision-making authority from the public. We’re giving them an option.”
 Senate rejects GOP bid to keep maps with commission

Earlier on Friday, the Senate rejected, by the same 21-16 margin, an amendment offered by Sen. Chris Head, R-Botetourt, that would have instructed the redistricting commission rather than the General Assembly to redraw maps if the HJR 6007 passes. Head contended the commission, rather than legislators, should retain the power if voters approve the amendment.
Surovell pushed back against Head’s proposal by arguing that the redistricting commission was never the impartial body its supporters claimed. 
He said the panel was “not independent,” noting that it was composed of “half legislators, and half people that are picked by legislators.” The structure, he added, was effectively “designed to generate gridlock — which is why the Supreme Court had to draw the maps.”
Virginia currently has an 11-member U.S. House delegation — six Democrats and five Republicans. Some political strategists believe new maps could shift one or more seats toward the Democrats, enhancing the party’s national position, but critics warn it could erode public trust in the fairness of the electoral system.

The occasion marked the beginning of Día de Muertos — Day of the Dead — season around Hartford. This event was organized by Helena’s Casita, a community cultural organization, in collaboration with vintage shop Gentle Bull, the Wadsworth Museum of Art, the Connecticut Science Center and the Connecticut Museum of Culture and History.
The Day of the Dead originated among indigenous peoples in Mexico, who celebrate their ancient ancestors, family members who passed away, and sometimes even pets, on Nov. 1 and 2. Other Central and South American countries have similar traditions such as El Día de los Difuntos in Ecuador and Peru, or El Día de Todos Santos in Guatemala.
Over the years, this tradition gained popularity in the United States as it migrated to this country with its people. In Connecticut, Mexicans are the second-largest Hispanic group, after Puerto Ricans. Nearly half of Hartford’s residents are Hispanic, according to the latest national census.
The Pratt Street celebration was open to all. There were Boricua accents singing Vicente Fernandez songs, and Creole speakers commenting “Kèt!” and “Mezanmi!” as they savored the traditional hot chocolate.
Founder of Helena’s Casita, Helena Delphina, along with other organizers, said she took care to honor the tradition in Hartford with respect, by providing a space for art, culture and memory in downtown.
Delphina, who is of Salvadoran and Mexican descent, organized the first event of its kind in 2022, which she called a “love letter to Hartford.” She didn’t grow up celebrating Día de Muertos, but when her sister Charlie Gonzales died in 2015, her family began honoring her with this tradition. Now the celebration is a more personal and intimate part of her life.
For some Mexican families who attended, this event was pleasantly nostalgic. Some said they might not have celebrated Día de Muertos if it weren’t for these gatherings.

Such was the case of Ana Jimenez, a Mexican woman who has lived in Connecticut for more than 30 years, and convinced her two daughters to accompany her to enjoy the festivities in the city.
“I actually don’t set up an altar here, but I’m left with a longing for the traditions of my country,” Jimenez said. “This event makes me happy because it allows us to teach our children about the traditions and the importance of our deceased loved ones, that we don’t forget them even if we move away, and that they can still be united with the family.”
Jimenez recalled that in her hometown, Xochimilco, her mother would set up the Día de Muertos offering on Oct. 30, while her siblings visited the cemetery for a vigil. During the ceremonies, her mother typically gives out bags with bread, fruit and a sugar skull, which they then distribute to the neighbors.
Although Saturday’s event in Hartford wasn’t the same, Jimenez said she hoped Delphina will do it again next year, and so she can continue to encounter Mexican traditions on the street — and other Latinos in the city who celebrate and embrace them.

Juana Hurtado from Bolivia, has been in Hartford for just over a year. For Hurtado, the Day of the Dead each year brings intense grief and deep affection for the people she misses who passed away.
“It is always important to hold these events so that we do not lose what is culture, the traditions of always loving the people we have lost. As a community, it makes us fraternize and share the hard moments we have lived through,” Hurtado shared, holding back tears.
Hurtado sets up an altar in her home in honor of her parents and her husband, who recently passed away. She arranges chocolate breads and candles to light the way for them when they visit on the night of Nov. 1.

Tammy Ramos, a Meriden resident with a Mexican family, also sets up an altar in her home. Since her grandmother died, her mother began preparing one annually, and although she knows her grandmother will always be present, the Day of the Dead offers a different type closeness to her.
“I remember her much more than usual on this day. I feel her closer,” Ramos said. “Opening the doors of our home to her gives me a certain calm and peace to think that she visits us through the altar.”
Ramos brought her 4-year-old daughter to the event, who jumped around and showed off her painted face, which was made to look like a skull. Ramos’ younger son stayed home with her mother. Ramos said she wants to pass along her culture to her two children by setting up altars each year.
Lexi Grant

Lexi Grant drove from Manchester to pick up her grandmother in Vernon. Together, the two of them placed a photo of Grant’s deceased grandparents on the community altar on Pratt Street.
Grant’s Puerto Rican grandmother, Olga Iris De Jesús, has lived in Connecticut since she was 15 and had never celebrated Día de Muertos or set up an altar. When her granddaughter learned about the event, she encouraged her to participate.
“Putting the photos on the altar means that they died, yes, but on this day I remember them, I remember everything about them,” said De Jesús, as she paused and looked through the photos of her deceased husband.
Between mourning and celebration, Grant said her feelings were bittersweet. She reminisced about her grandparents. But, as she spent time visiting with people on Pratt Street, the dancing, candles, food and live music became like a comforting embrace.
“It is beautiful to bring together different communities and ethnicities, especially in the current political climate, to honor and feel proud of who we are, our roots and traditions,” Grant said.
“I think Hartford is very multicultural and I feel like it’s a place where one can be proud to say, ‘I’m from Hartford, Connecticut.’”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1018_SR_DiaDeLosMuertos_111-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-31 14:02:34.575980

(Photo via Getty Images)The Iowa Court of Appeals has upheld a $1.8 million civil penalty against a company that for almost 21 years failed to obtain the required permits for 750 miles of hazardous-liquid pipelines in Iowa.
Enterprise Products Operating had appealed a district court’s ruling that affirmed a decision by the Iowa Utilities Commission to fine the company $1.8 million for nine separate violations of a law requiring permits for interstate hazardous-liquid pipelines and underground storage facilities.
In its appeal, Enterprise argued the commission and the district court erred in deciding that Enterprise’s pipeline system required nine permits, rather than one, and had therefore committed nine violations of the law rather than one.

The company also claimed the commission lacked the authority to impose a civil penalty of more than $200,000 because the nine violations were each part of a “related series of violations” as defined by state law.
The appeals court ruled it could not consider Enterprise’s first claim because it did not preserve error by arguing that point when the case was before the commission and then the district court. The appeals court also found that the commission correctly interpreted the legal cap on penalties.
Enterprise owns and operates a hazardous-liquid pipeline system that crosses several states, Iowa included, and carries butane, propane and natural gas. The pipeline system — known as the Mid-America Pipeline System — was originally built and owned by the Mid-America Pipeline Company in the early 1960s.
In November 1997, Williams Natural Gas Liquids acquired Mid-America Pipeline, and in July 2002, Enterprise purchased a 98% ownership interest in that company and with it the entire Mid-America Pipeline System, which then included 750 miles of pipeline and underground storage facilities in Iowa.
In 1995, the Iowa Legislature then amended the state law in a manner that required pipeline operators to obtain new permits from the state. It is undisputed that Mid-America Pipeline Company — and then Williams, and then Enterprise — never sought those permits.
On Feb. 6, 2023, the commission notified Enterprise that it had discovered 750 miles of hazardous-liquid pipeline in Iowa were owned and operated by Enterprise and lacked the necessary permits. The commission demanded an explanation and scheduled a hearing at which the company could argue why it should not be subject to civil penalties.
Case turns on singular or plural use of ‘series’ 
At the hearing in March 2023, Enterprise explained that it was unaware of Iowa’s permit requirements and asserted that Williams had warranted that all state permit requirements were satisfied.
One month later, in April 2023, the commission issued an order imposing $1.8 million in civil penalties on Enterprise, alleging Enterprise had been operating nine hazardous-liquid pipelines and underground storage facilities without permits for almost 21 years.
It calculated that each of the nine violations had continued for 7,535 days — from when Enterprise acquired the pipeline system until it initiated efforts to obtain a permit – and that each of the nine violations warranted a $200,000 penalty.
At the time, the commission noted that due to the 21 years of daily violations, the penalty could have resulted in a total of $67.8 million in penalties had it not been for the Iowa law capping penalties at $200,000 per pipeline and underground storage facility.
In deciding to impose the maximum penalty, the commission took note of Enterprise’s market capitalization of $55.9 billion and its long record of working in the pipeline industry.
After Polk County District Judge Scott D. Rosenberg upheld the commission’s ruling, Enterprise filed its appeal, sending the case to the Iowa Court of Appeals.
In ruling in favor of the commission, the appeals court noted that Iowa law caps penalties at $200,000 for “any related series of violations,” with Enterprise arguing that its nine permit violations were all part of one “related series” since they were all tied to the same interconnected series of pipes.
“Even if we assume that Enterprise is correct that nine separate permit violations at different locations across Iowa — some for pipeline and others for underground storage facilities — can be considered related, this argument falters,” the court ruled. “It assumes that the word ‘series’ is being used as a plural noun rather a singular one — both forms are spelled the same. Only if ‘series’ were plural could the statute be capping multiple related series. If ‘series’ is singular, then the statute caps a single ‘series of violations’ that is ’related.’”

(Photo by Susan Tebben/Ohio Capital Journal)The Ohio Redistricting Commission passed a congressional map in a Friday morning meeting, increasing Republican advantage in the state and blocking a referendum effort.
The commission unanimously approved the map to raucous disapproval from the crowd gathered in the Ohio House Finance hearing room.
The map was introduced at Thursday’s meeting by commission co-chair and state Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville.
Republicans currently hold 10 out of 15 Ohio U.S. Congressional districts.
The map gives Republicans the advantage in 12 of the 15 districts in the state, with Republican U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan’s 4th district seeing the biggest GOP advantage at 72%.
Democratic U.S. Rep. Shontel Brown’s 11th district sees the biggest advantage in her party, according to the map, at 78%.
U.S. Reps. Marcy Kaptur, Greg Landsman, and Emilia Sykes would all see significant impacts to their district.
Landsman’s 1st district would lean Republican with a 54% to 47% breakdown.
Kaptur’s 9th district would lean Republican with a 54.5% to 45.5% Republican to Democratic ratio.
Sykes’ 13th district would lean Democratic, 52% to 48% Republican, according to data provided by the commission.
Stewart said the bipartisan passage was a mark of success for redistricting reforms that were passed in 2015 and 2018, and for the commission itself.
“I think there was a very real incentive and a desire amongst the legislative leaders … that we want this process the voters approved to work,” Stewart said.
“I think there is an intention that there would be some compromises, there would be some recognition of the fact that we would like to come out of here with a deal that both parties could move forward with for multiple years.”
Democrats on the commission voted to adopt the map because they said they were in an “impossible” situation in which they were provided worse options and felt they needed to take the opportunity to get the best map available.
House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati, said the process was out of their control, so they did what they could to preserve Democratic opportunities.
“This is not the congressional map that Ohioans deserve, however, I do believe with this map we have averted a disaster,” said Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood.
The previous map, adopted in March 2022, had a breakdown of 10 Republican districts and five Democratic districts.
In September, Democrats proposed a map that would have had eight Republican and seven Democratic districts.
That map heard hours of supportive testimony in the Joint Committee on Congressional Redistricting, but never received a vote.
Republican leaders on the commission, including Gov. Mike DeWine, approved of the commission-created map, saying it was a proper compromise across the aisle.
They also acknowledged motivation that a referendum would not happen with passage by the commission.
Without bipartisan approval by the commission, the congressional redistricting process would have headed back to the General Assembly.
Once there, legislators could have passed a map with a simple majority in the Republican supermajority that makes up both chambers.
Auditor of State Keith Faber said the argument that the state’s voting trends, 55% Republican to 45% Democratic, would bring a map with eight GOP and seven Dem districts doesn’t represent “Ohio’s political geography.”
“This concept that you’re going to be able to draw districts within that range without gerrymandering is false,” Faber said. “… You can’t get to an 8-7 map without unnecessarily splitting and dividing (cities, counties and townships).”
Ohioans expressed their disagreement with Faber, saying state leaders and legislators just hadn’t worked hard enough to get to maps that match that ratio.
Testimony at Thursday’s and Friday’s meeting had a unified message: Ohioans who attended the meetings greatly disapproved of not only the 12-3 map, but the process to get to the adoption.
“This isn’t a compromise, it’s a threat,” Julia Cattaneo, of Columbus, told the commission.
Stewart on Thursday had referred to the people who attended the meeting — many of whom have regularly attended meetings over the several years of the congressional and statehouse redistricting battles in Ohio — as “paid actors.”
On Friday, some citizens pinned “not a paid actor” labels on their shirts.
They continued their shaming of the commission for “ignoring the law, ignoring the voters,” as Mia Lewis of Common Cause Ohio put it, and emphasizing the need to take politicians out of the redistricting process.
“I wish that the argument between committee members had been about how to fairly draw up county lines that would have fine-tuned those districts to be more accurate,” said Columbus resident Beth Lykins.
“…I think what I say here doesn’t really matter in the end. You will do what you want to do and I have to live with the realization that our government doesn’t work in the way I was taught in my Youth in Government program.”
The map has the potential to be legally challenged, which would be done at the Ohio Supreme Court.
Previous map challenges in the redistricting process, including the 10-5 redistricting map used for the most recent elections, have been struck down as unduly partisan.
The makeup of the state supreme court has changed since then, however.
Current Chief Justice Sharon Kennedy stood in the minority in previous votes on redistricting maps, saying she would have kept the maps in place.
The current supreme court is made up of six Republican justices and one Democratic justice.

LAKE CLARK NATIONAL PARK AND PRESERVE — The two floatplanes circled beneath low clouds before landing on an alpine lake, deep in the mountains west of Anchorage.



They carried employees of the state of Alaska — footsoldiers in a long-running turf war with the federal government.It was early August, but the high peaks above the lake were already dusted with fresh snow. On a beach at the water’s edge, the passengers climbed out.They carried guns — but only for bears, not for federal bureaucrats. The lake was deserted.
One of the state workers, Danny Hovancsek, looked down at the sand.
“Welcome to contested land,” he said.
From the two planes, Hovancsek and his colleagues unloaded bags and boxes of gear, including the documentary tools that serve as the real weapons in their war: drones, notebooks, a sophisticated sensor to measure river flow and current.
Two Lakes, the body of water they’d flown into, and the Necons River, which drains it, both sit within the boundaries of federally managed Lake Clark National Park and Preserve.
But Hovancsek and his colleagues were there to assert a legal claim to them on behalf of the residents of Alaska, based on precedent that entitles the state to land beneath navigable waters.

The following day, the group would inflate the rafts they’d flown in with and begin floating the river, gathering data they may ultimately need to try to prove the Necons’ navigability to a judge in an Anchorage courtroom.
Other groups from the same state agency, the Department of Natural Resources, had taken similar trips on different rivers in the preceding weeks — part of a renewed, professionalized push to confirm ownership of land within federal parks and preserves that Alaska’s government says became state property at statehood.
The department’s Public Access Assertion and Defense team is a group of roughly a dozen state workers who have, arguably, Alaska’s best public sector jobs. They spend large parts of their summers flying into and floating the state’s remote rivers and lakes, then spend the winters wielding the data they’ve gathered in court.
I was along for the ride. Top department officials — one of whom would sit in a raft along with me — had invited me to observe the state’s efforts, which they say could ultimately help settle the ownership of thousands of miles of Alaska riverbeds, plus millions of acres beneath the surface of lakes.

The work is often done quietly, with the state-sponsored flotillas keeping an intentionally low-profile to avoid giving federal land managers a head start on fighting Alaska’s claims.
But the stakes are substantial, as state and federal regimes can diverge when it comes to managing access and setting rules for boaters, hunters and fishermen, and small-scale miners.
“Anyone who’s looking to paddle a river doesn’t know who to look to for jurisdiction,” Hovancsek said.
“I believe in good governance,” he added. “And right now, we don’t know who owns the rivers of Alaska.”
A decades-long fight
At the beach, 130 miles from the national park’s headquarters in Anchorage, there was no indication of federal ownership — no informational kiosks or park rangers.
But the federal government’s resistance to Alaska’s land claims, both through active opposition and simple inaction, was the reason we were all there.
For more than a half-century, Alaska land managers have been fighting successive federal administrations through the courts as well as lengthy administrative processes — battling what they describe as an unwillingness to negotiate from officials of both political parties at the U.S. Department of the Interior, the federal land management agency.
The state has notched numerous wins, including affirming control of land beneath the Stikine River in Southeast Alaska, the Knik River outside Anchorage and multiple forksof the gold-bearing Fortymile River in Alaska’s Interior.

(Alaska Department of Natural Resource/Public Access Assertion and Defense Section)
But thousands more miles across dozens of rivers and creeks are still in limbo. And state officials say that in spite of their commitment to the cause, there’s no way each of those stretches will be litigated.
Instead, they aim to file enough lawsuits to make the process painful enough to force the federal government into broader settlement discussions.
“The goal is to sit with them at a table and decide this,” said Jim Walker, the public access team’s chief.
The state’s efforts made little headway during the Biden administration, which clashed often with Alaska officials on resource extraction and land management.
But now, the team sees an opening in Donald Trump’s return to power.
In line with the state’s push, Trump, in an early, Alaska-focused executive order, directed the Interior Department to review the state’s waterways and land ownership.
At a June news conference, the department’s secretary, Doug Burgum, said that as a former governor of North Dakota, he worked on the same issues through the end of his term last year.

“We need to get this thing resolved,” he said. “Even though, right now, there may be differences of opinion, I think we can find some common ground.”
But months later, the Interior Department has not announced any concrete steps to advance negotiations with the state. Alaska’s land-related lawsuits against the federal government remain active. And members of the public access team continue their work in the field.
“Everything starts at zero”
The day after our arrival at Two Lakes, as team members took down tents and washed dishes, one of them passed me a handheld luggage scale and jokingly deputized me as an “agent of state sovereignty.” My task: finding 800 pounds of gear to load into one of the rafts.
Those instructions rested on a century and a half of federal law and jurisprudence that set out legal standards the state must meet to confirm its ownership of what are known as “submerged lands.”

The paper trail starts with the Daniel Ball case — an 1870 U.S. Supreme Court ruling holding that waterways are considered navigable if they can be used as “highways for commerce.”
The Submerged Lands Act, in 1953, solidified states’ ownership of property beneath rivers and lakes that were navigable at the time of statehood.
And a key 1980s federal appeals court case helped establish which types of watercraft could be used to float down an Alaska river — and the amount of weight they should carry — to support a finding of navigability. Hence the 800 pounds.
The public access team can present data they collect on their trips, and records of successful floats, to judges considering the state’s arguments in lawsuits over stretches of particular rivers.
The state can also request that the federal government issue what’s known as a “recordable disclaimer of interest” in submerged lands through a separate, administrative process handled by the Interior Department.
But that process takes five years, on average, to resolve each application — and in some cases it can take more than 10 years, according to federal data. Lawsuits also typically wind through the courts for years.
The glacial bureaucratic processes leave maps of Alaska rife with areas of underwater land where the ownership is in legal limbo — and where the public access team is trying to solidify the state’s title.
Their work is focused largely on the areas, like Lake Clark, that were formally protected by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980, or ANILCA.

That landmark bill set aside more than one-fourth of the state as federal park or preserve.
But while those areas are now generally understood to be federally managed, ANILCA came after statehood — meaning that land beneath navigable rivers and lakes inside those areas had, legally, already been set aside for the state.
Alaska officials complain that the federal government has long drawn out the process of acknowledging the precise extent of the state’s ownership within national parks and preserves. Federal lawyers, they say, continue to argue over issues that have already been settled by previous decisions, like the size or weight of boats that are used to prove navigability.
“It’s just frustrating to have to argue the same things again and again,” said Ron Opsahl, the state’s main navigability attorney, who floated the Necons with the public access team. “Everything starts at zero.”

Criticism like this has a whiff of the hyperbole that Alaska politicians often employ when complaining about federal bureaucrats.
But in this case, there’s evidence Opsahl is right: In a 2016 navigability ruling frequently cited by state officials, a judge ruled that federal attorneys had acted in “bad faith” by making frivolous legal claims — arguments that had been previously refuted by federal appeals court and U.S. Supreme Court judges.
In conversations with team members on our wilderness trip, I came to see state land managers’ feud with the federal government as something like appealing a claim denied by your health insurance company: counterparts who won’t acknowledge your presence, endless wait times.
“It’s hard to beat an opponent that won’t fight you,” said Hovancsek. He conceded: “In the chess game of landownership, they’re making good moves.”
The public access team had invited me along on the Necons River to show me what one of them described as the “senselessness” of the federal government’s arguments over navigability.
I finished loading the raft and jumped in. As an icy drizzle soaked our raincoats, we turned from the beach toward the lake’s outlet and the start of the river.
“Fighting the big man”
Our group on the Necons was a flotilla of four rafts; I’d loaded up with Walker, who runs the public access office.
Before Walker, the team was led by Scott Ogan, a Republican former state senator from the conservative Mat-Su region; his scouting missions involved more camouflage gear and canned chili than the state’s trips do today.
Walker, an attorney with a silver goatee and an impish sense of humor, looked like he’d be more comfortable in a business suit and a courtroom than in a boat cockpit.

Jim Walker, who once worked as a defense lawyer on death penalty cases, leads Alaska’s public access team. “I’ve spent a lot of time on death row, and this is better,” Walker said during an August 2024 float trip. “Smells nicer.” (Nathaniel Herz/Northern Journal)
But even as the rain soaked through his gear, Walker was relentlessly cheerful as he pushed on the oars. He described how he sees his work for the state as an extension of his previous career as a defense lawyer in the South, where he sometimes handled death penalty cases.
“When I took this job, people said, ‘You made a career fighting the man. Now, you are the man,’” said Walker. His response: “I’m the little man fighting the big man.”
Walker started with the team in 2014. Soon after, amid a state budget crunch, lawmakers cut the public access team’s budget to near-zero.
In the past several years, it’s been largely restored amid a broader effort by GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy to assert state sovereignty in disputes with the federal government. The team’s current budget is some $1.3 million a year, according to figures provided by the Legislative Finance Division.
Without exception, Walker describes his team members as “hard chargers” — the type who, in one case, will spend a vacation bikepacking over snowy mountain passes in Kyrgyzstan rather than lounging on a beach.
Employees are granted ample autonomy and independence, with blocks of time off to make up for long hours in the office and in the field. While scenic, their float trips should not be confused with recreation, according to Tisha Valentine, a team member who was part of the group on the Necons.

“I’m up at 11 o’clock at night, on weekends, doing data collection,” Valentine said. “It’s not all fun and games.”
The team works in a few areas in addition to navigability; one is assembling records of historical trail use that the state can used to assert public access across federal or private land.
On their trips, employees like Valentine get periodic company from attorneys like Opsahl, who want to familiarize themselves with rivers in advance of representing the state in lawsuits over the lands beneath them.
Other top officials at the public access team’s parent agency, the Department of Natural Resources, also tag along occasionally. Brent Goodrum, a deputy department commissioner and retired Marine, is known for his eagerness to contribute to group tasks — or, as colleagues joke, to “storm the beaches.”

A little downstream from Two Lakes’ outlet, Walker nosed our raft to shore, pulling up next to the other boats that had beached there. I stepped into the muck as team members unloaded gear: a waterproof laptop and a duffel bag carrying a tool nicknamed Antonio.
Antonio is a sensor that collects data — stream flow measurements — that the state uses to bolster its navigability claims. It consists of a small, cylindrical device attached to a miniature plastic catamaran that runs back and forth on a cable across the river — meaning that we’d have to fix a line to the far shore some 50 yards away.
I took one end and jumped back in a raft with Jon Fuller, a hydrologist from Arizona who works as a state contractor.

Fuller furiously paddled the boat to the opposite riverbank, where I jumped out and clung to the willows to keep from sliding down the steep bank — suspecting, at least a little, that this was the team’s way of showing me that their raft trips aren’t just sightseeing.
In the meantime, other team members sent up a drone with a camera that they use to document the group’s progress down the river, along with key geographic features. Hovancsek, who was controlling the camera, at one point looked down at his feet, which were planted not on dry land but in a few inches of Necons River water.

At left, Tisha Valentine launches a drone. Inside national parks, where drone operation is generally barred, public access team members operate them while standing on what they assert is state property — riverbanks or submerged lands beneath navigable waterways. (Nathaniel Herz/Northern Journal)
Drone operation, he explained, is not allowed in national parks. But it is allowed on state property — which, the state says, includes the submerged land over which the Necons flows, and into which Hovancsek had stepped.
Over the course of our trip, we made several stops like this one, gathering stream flow data and imagery that the state could ultimately cite in a lawsuit.
What are the stakes?
After two days on the Necons, it arrived at its confluence with the Stony River — a broad, pebbly waterway that spills out of the mountains.
The next night, as the chill drizzle finally gave way to high, broken clouds, I found myself standing at the water’s edge, looking at far-off mountain ranges and pondering the fact that I couldn’t say for certain who owned the mud beneath my Xtratuf boots.
That prompted some deeper reflection and conversation about the public access team’s work — and how management of Alaska’s lands might differ under state ownership.
Our route, by that point, had taken us out of the national park. As we crossed the boundary into state territory, Goodrum, the deputy natural resources department commissioner, had asked mischievously: “Don’t you feel freer, Nat?” Walker added his own joke: “There’s a coal mine just behind the willows there.”
In truth, though, little seemed to change. Inside the national park, no rangers had passed by to check our campsites, and permits and entry fees aren’t required for recreational trips.

Given how far the Necons is from roads and other infrastructure, it’s also hard to imagine much industry moving in, even under a more flexible state management regime.
But the Necons is probably an extreme case, where its remoteness means there’s less at stake.
A change in ownership could have larger impacts on busier waterways with contested stretches, such as in the Kobuk and Noatak watersheds in Northwest Alaska.
There, affirmation of state ownership of submerged lands and riverbanks could make for easier access — potentially amplifying conflicts between locals and nonresidentsfor limited hunting and fishing opportunities.
Two recent high-profile U.S. Supreme Court decisions, in the Sturgeon cases, also created more incentive for the team’s work by confirming the state’s management authority in the areas it owns within national parks and preserves.
That particular ruling allowed a hunter to operate a hovercraft on a navigable river within a preserve in Alaska’s Interior — where National Park Service rangers had previously told the hunter that his hovercraft was banned.
Public access team members and the political officials who oversee them are also quick to argue on principle. Decisions about how to manage Alaska’s navigable waterways, said Walker, “should be made by Alaskans, and not made in Washington by folks who don’t appreciate and haven’t experienced this place.”
“As has been said repeatedly, in U.S. Supreme Court opinions and elsewhere: Alaska is different,” Walker said.

One former high-level federal land manager in Alaska, Pat Pourchot, said he understands that the state has an obligation to confirm its ownership of lands beneath navigable waters.
But, he added, there’s also a reason the federal government should review each claim deliberately: A decision about one river in Alaska, Pourchot argued, could set a precedent for rivers across the country.
“You don’t want to allow a determination of navigability on some really small stream running through a conservation area in Alaska that some other state might push for — say, for the wild and scenic Buffalo River in Arkansas,” said Pourchot, who’s served both as Alaska’s top Interior Department official and as the state natural resources commissioner.
Congressional proposals to address state-federal navigability disputes in Alaska have gotten similarly “bogged down,” Pourchot added.
“Again, you go from Alaska to the nation: How does this apply in West Virginia coal mine country, and how does this apply to other wild and scenic rivers?” said Pourchot, referring to rivers with federal protections.
Pourchot said he also sees state ownership as a possible precursor to expanded mining or oil and gas leasing in ways that conflict with the purpose of national parks and preserves.
But another longtime participant in the state-federal navigability war thinks there’s a tendency on both sides to overstate the stakes of the dispute.
“The feds will say, ‘If the state manages it, they’ll allow coal mining everywhere. They’ll give permits to any outfitter for any reason, for doing anything.’ And that’s just not true,” said Doug Whittaker, an outdoor recreation expert who consults for the public access team.
On the other hand, Whittaker added, state officials say, “‘The feds are going to close everything; you’re never going to get on a river.’”
“That’s not really a thing, either,” Whittaker said. “They’re both exaggerating.”

There are real differences between the two sides, with federal management leaning more restrictive and state management more permissive, Whittaker said. But the reality, he added, is less dramatic than the rhetoric.
Whittaker nonetheless supports the state’s work to settle more of its claims to Alaska riverbeds, saying that ambiguity about landownership can cause real problems.
He pointed to plans the state drafted for the Fortymile River to better regulate small-scale mining operations that posed a risk of fuel spills. That work, he added, advanced only after litigation helped affirm the state’s ownership of the river’s gravel bars and banks.
“What I care about is management. And I think both the state and feds can do a good job of managing; they can also do a bad job,” Whittaker said. “I don’t really care who owns it. But I think they should agree on the rules.”
Breaking the logjam
The sun was finally warming us and drying our gear as we pulled the rafts off the water at our take-out point, the confluence of the Stony and Telaquana rivers.
We were early: Float planes wouldn’t be dispatched from Anchorage to retrieve us for another day-and-a-half. And a storm was on its way, according to a weather forecast that Anchorage-based support staff had sent the team through a satellite messaging device.

Walker cheekily suggested that we should gather ark-building material — ”pitch and gopher wood” — for the impending flood. Other team members tried to coordinate an early pickup; their Anchorage flight service, busy with summer tourists, eventually agreed to send a plane.
There was enough room for a few of us, and some of the public access team members needed to get home; the last seat would go either to me or Fuller, the consulting hydrologist. I threw rock, he threw scissors. I would be flying out before the deluge.
As we waited, we discussed our trip down the Necons. After floating its full length from Two Lakes, it was difficult to see how the federal government could plausibly argue that it’s not navigable.
It was deep, with just a couple of riffles in 15 miles. None of the rafts had run aground or even hit bottom, except on a short jaunt down a side channel.

And yet, more than four decades ago, the federal government determined that the Necons is non-navigable, according to the state’s public access team, and hasn’t changed its position since then. (Federal officials could not be reached for comment about the Necons’ navigability due to the ongoing government shutdown.)
“It’s astounding the federal government is wasting everyone’s money fighting this,” said Fuller.
“If this isn’t fucking navigable,” Opsahl, the state attorney, chimed in, “I don’t know what is.”
The team’s frustration was palpable.
But when I picked up my reporting back in Anchorage, following a presidential election, things had changed.
Walker, in a recent interview, said his team has met with Trump administration officials and presented them with big-picture policy proposals aimed at breaking the navigability logjam. One idea is agreeing on basic principles that would apply to a state application asking the federal government to relinquish an array of riverbeds, rather than just one at a time.
“Instead of going through and giving minute details about every mile of these rivers, we talk, rather, about our methodology and why it’s so sound,” Walker said. “Hopefully, this would begin a dialogue.”

In a prepared statement issued before the shutdown, an Alaska-based spokesperson for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, Emma Roach, said the agency understands the frustration about the pace of its navigability decisions in the state.
The bureau, which is part of the Interior Department, is excited to pursue improvements in response to Trump’s executive order encouraging progress on the dispute, Roach added.
Evaluating navigability claims “is a complex process — made especially complex in a state as vast, remote, and young as Alaska,” she said.
“But working together on this and other related navigability initiatives, we can make substantial progress,” Roach added. “The state’s title to submerged lands at statehood is well recognized, and we’re committed to supporting that process moving forward.”
For now, though, the team’s work continues, with trips this past summer outside Anchorage and up to the Seward Peninsula, on the Alaska side of the Bering Strait.
Some of that work could support new litigation if the state’s talks with the federal government fail. And public access team members acknowledge that there are no guarantees the Trump administration will concede much.
Past Republican administrations have generally been more sympathetic to Alaska leaders’ complaints about federal management. But they’ve still accomplished little more than Democrats when it comes to resolving the big-picture dispute over Alaska’s submerged lands and navigable waters, according to state officials.
“It’s surprising,” said Goodrum, the deputy state natural resources commissioner. “We haven’t made progress on this issue regardless of who’s in office.”
Walker, the public access team chief, said he’s hopeful the recent meetings will produce results. But, he added, “this is not our first rodeo.”
“We’ve heard encouraging words before, which have not translated into results,” he said. “And so very much, in our dealings with the feds right now, we’re trying to put the past behind us — and look forward to constructively and cooperatively getting some of this stuff resolved.”

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator)I was born in Mississippi to Indian-immigrant parents who came here in the late 1960s, drawn by the promise of American ingenuity and opportunity, as well as the openness created by the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act. 
My father first arrived as a post-doctoral fellow and was soon recruited to Mississippi as a professor. He was part of a wave of immigrant scholars who helped build higher education and research across the South, especially at historically Black colleges and universities. 
My mother began her career there as a special education teacher — one of the first in her district — and later became a small business owner alongside my father. Together they built a life in Mississippi rooted in education, entrepreneurship and service to the community.
Their story is one of grit, contribution and building opportunity — not just for themselves but for generations to follow.
Today, I am a professor of public health at a top 10 public health school and was recently elected to the National Academy of Medicine. My journey was made possible by the infrastructure, the research labs and the faculty pipelines the generation before me helped create. 
But I now fear that the talent pipeline that once brought global scholars and students to the United States — especially to the Gulf South — is beginning to dry up.
Shrinking pipeline of global talent
Once dominant in recruiting international students and scholars, U.S. higher education is now under serious strain. A recent New York Times analysis showed a steep decline in international student enrollment in the past year, particularly in the South. The reason for concern is not just demographic: our capacity to lead in research and innovation is at stake.
International students and scholar-trainees have long been central to American science, technology and medicine. These fields, in turn, power local and national economies. 
When fewer such individuals choose the U.S., we all pay a price.
The data are clear:

Foreign-born individuals comprised nearly 26% of workers in STEM occupations in 2021, up from 16.4% in 2000.
International students in the U.S. contributed $43.8 billion to the U.S. economy and supported more than 378,175 jobs in the past year.
In Louisiana alone, approximately 6,891 international students accounted for 2,269 jobs and about $264.8 million in economic impact in the past year.

These numbers are not about replacing U.S.-born talent; they are about complementing it, strengthening the research enterprise, enabling richer mentoring, deeper collaboration and more robust innovation ecosystems. 
U.S.-born students benefit from having colleagues and mentors drawn from global networks, as do local employers in health care, energy and technology – leading industries for our state and nation.
Why the Gulf South feels it most
In the Gulf South, where higher‐education institutions often compete with fewer resources, the contribution of international scholars and students has been particularly important. 
Many immigrant faculty, including my father, helped build research programs in biology, engineering, public health and medicine at universities that long had been under-resourced. They created labs, attracted grants, trained both U.S.-born and international students, and strengthened regional capacity in major industries such as healthcare and energy.
For example, the health care workforce in this region depends not only on graduating U.S.-born professionals but also on attracting and training people who bring diverse research perspectives and advanced expertise. 
Similarly, the energy economy — still so vital in states like Louisiana and Mississippi — benefits when universities and research institutions can recruit global talent to advance new technologies in offshore energy, coastal resilience, climate mitigation and biomedical innovation.
When fewer international scholars and students choose U.S. institutions — especially in the South — the ripple effects include fewer research grants, fewer innovations and fewer trained professionals staying and contributing regionally. 
It’s not about foreign-born replacing U.S.-born; it’s about all of us doing better by working together.
Keeping the door open to excellence
We must remember that world-class universities and ambitious regional economies don’t emerge by accident. They need global networks, diverse talent and a commitment to staying competitive in science, technology, and medicine.
You cannot have world-class universities if you cannot recruit the best from around the world. And the South needs that more than anyone. Because in recruiting nationally, we already face structural disadvantages.
This is not about elevating one group over another. It’s about building institutions, industries and communities strong enough to serve both U.S.-born and immigrant students, researchers and professionals. It’s about recognizing that when we invest in global talent, we uplift the entire ecosystem: faculty, students, local economies, health care systems, energy innovation and beyond.
My parents’ generation came here, accepted the challenge and built programs when the door was open. Today, we must decide if we will keep that door open — not just because it is the right thing to do, but because it is the smart thing to do for every citizen and every community.

By nearly every measure, American farmers are struggling.
Experts say financial pressures are expected to continue mounting.
Due to rising costs, low crop prices and the effects of the trade war, economists project that growers could see roughly $44 billion in net cash income losses from their 2025–26 crops.
At a September conference on agriculture and trade uncertainty hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank, Shawn Arita, professor at North Dakota State University and former senior economist with the USDA, presented projections showing losses across nine major crops.

With production costs far outpacing revenue, Arita and his team at the NDSU Agricultural Risk Policy Center estimate losses of about $20 billion for corn, $10 billion for soybeans and $8.5 billion for wheat — with peanuts, cotton, barley, oats, grain sorghum and rice adding another $6 billion combined.
Since 2023, U.S. farmers have struggled with high input costs and weak commodity prices, a squeeze economists attribute partly to the Russia-Ukraine war.
But this squeeze is made worse by the loss of key export markets — particularly China.
“The tariffs are creating challenges, but it’s not fair to say they are the main culprit,” Arita said. “Certainly, they are exacerbating the issue.”
Arita also noted that the crop sector tends to follow trade cycles more closely than inflation trends. “[China is] not going to start buying soybeans until they get something out of these negotiations,” he said during his presentation.

Still, the main problem remains high costs across the board — tractors, machinery, fertilizers and other inputs, many of which are imported. Although it’s too early to determine whether President Trump’s tariffs will have an effect on these prices, Arita said it’s “simple economics”: higher taxes on these products inevitably lead to higher production costs.
While some farmers are expected to receive financial assistance through the Big Beautiful Bill, that support isn’t set to arrive until October 2026.

I put on my green volunteer shirt and started sorting food donations from around the state with a group of strangers.
We sorted donations: protein shakes, peanut butter, Turkish figs, ranch dressing, hamburger helper, soda, evaporated milk, crushed tomatoes, cream of mushroom soup, apple sauce, payday candy bars, chips. “Don’t worry about expiration dates on food,” a volunteer who had logged 8,000 hours told me. “Just look if they’re medications/supplements or baby products.”
The generosity of people, of the donations is truly remarkable. That this food will find its way to people gives me hope. The quality of the food — or lack of — also kept crossing my mind. Highly processed food, loads of artificial sugars and ingredients, banged-up cans, all kinds of food dyes. It made me wonder what the people who received the items thought.
But their alternative was nothing to eat.

That afternoon, I finished “The Glass Castle,” which now shows up on banned-books lists. It’s a remarkable memoir by Jeannette Walls about hope, resilience and redemption. It’s also about poverty, family dynamics, family dysfunction, addiction, food insecurity, essentially navigating difficult life situations with perseverance. It’s a story of hope during the worst of times. Banning such a book deprives potential readers of examples of a path forward, a way out of whatever challenge people might be struggling with also gets banned.
As our country braces for cut-offs of SNAP, the federal program that helps low-income families afford food, the number of people facing hunger should make every heart hurt. Adding to their pain are skyrocketing health insurance premium costs. In Colorado, more than 600,000 people rely on SNAP to fill a gap in their life. It’s also projected that 80,000 Coloradans will lose health insurance if the Affordable Care Act tax credits expire. Of these 600,000 people who rely on SNAP, half are children. Kids.


When hunger rises, so can we.


Hunger, like many stigmas, is often invisible.
When our team a few weeks ago spent time in the San Luis Valley, an impoverished region of Colorado, to better understand SNAP, food, and its impact especially on older adults in rural communities, we found that meals for seniors had already stopped due to budget cuts. That loss of food was before SNAP faced any potential hits. Community pantries simply cannot fill these enormous gaps.
Seniors in this country already must worry about where they might live if they lose Medicaid, and now when they will get their next meal.
Meanwhile, a $300 million ballroom is being constructed where the East Wing of the White House once stood. We saw that demolition while millions live in fear. They worry about their next paycheck, their next meal, their next medical bill, their ability to afford health insurance. They are afraid to go to school or to work. They can’t go for a walk, go to the doctor, buy groceries, fill their cars with gas without dread. They can’t put a sign in front of their house, they worry about speaking any language but English. They fear being in public.
Fear affects us on a cellular level. It impacts our health in significant ways.
When I checked in to volunteer at the food bank, there’s a sign that reads, “When hunger rises, so can we.”
It’s a great sentence that I keep repeating, and a sentence that can be used for so much:
When hate rises, so can we.
When fear rises, so can we.
When injustice rises, so can we. 
I recently drove home from work behind a car that had a pride flag on its back window with the words “defend equality” and a gigantic machine gun over the flag. I had to watch it for about 30 minutes until we took separate exits, and I took my first real exhale.
As I finished the drive home, I remembered this short clip a friend sent me of an older woman sitting on a park bench outside. She looks at the camera and says, “When your kids, grandkids, nieces and nephews ask you what did you do, what will you tell them?”
I will not say I stayed quiet. Because, when hope rises, so can we.

Seven Great Walks in Delaware from riverfront paths to forested preserves.
Jamie Kleman | Contributing Writer Delaware Live | October 2025
“Golf,” Mark Twain once joked, “is a good walk spoiled.” While many Delawareans love their time on the greens, they are also leaning into the simple joy of the walk itself. This time of year, as trails glow with color and the air turns crisp, walking has become one of the most refreshing ways to experience Delaware’s natural beauty.
Across the First State, walking is finding its stride, and it’s not just about fitness. It is about connection, balance, and belonging. The simplicity of putting one foot in front of the other has the power to strengthen hearts, clear minds, and bring people together.
Why walking works
Walking remains one of the easiest and most effective forms of exercise. The American Heart Association reports that just 30 minutes of brisk walking a day can lower the risk of heart disease and stroke by as much as 27 percent. Researchers at Harvard University recently found that adults who walk regularly can reduce their overall mortality risk by nearly 25 percent, even without high-intensity workouts.
It is not only physical health that improves. Walking outdoors can lift mood, sharpen focus, and ease anxiety. A 2023 study in The Lancet Public Health linked regular walking to lower rates of depression and higher life satisfaction across all age groups.
Health benefits at a glance
Even short daily walks can have measurable effects:

Improve heart and lung health by lowering blood pressure and cholesterol
Support healthy weight and boost metabolism
Strengthen joints and muscles, reducing stiffness and pain
Increase mental clarity and creativity
Lower stress and anxiety through the release of endorphins
Improve sleep quality and overall mood
Reduce the risk of chronic illness, including Type 2 diabetes and certain cancers
Build community connection through shared, screen-free time outdoors

Where Delaware walks
From riverfront paths to forested preserves, Delaware offers countless places to stretch your legs and enjoy the seasons.
Brandywine Creek State Park (Wilmington): Wooded trails from 1.5 to 5 miles through rolling hills and streams.
Jack A. Markell Trail (Wilmington to New Castle): A 5.5-mile paved path linking the city’s riverfront to New Castle’s historic district.
White Clay Creek State Park (Newark): Forest and meadow loops from 2 to 4 miles, rich with wildlife.
Newark Reservoir: A smooth 2.3-mile paved loop with wide-open water views.
Brecknock County Park (Camden): Family-friendly trails surrounded by shaded woods.
Junction and Breakwater Trail (Lewes to Rehoboth): Six scenic miles between coastal towns, bordered by pines and marshland.
Cape Henlopen State Park (Lewes): Ocean-view loops ranging from 1 to 3 miles near dunes and beach paths.
Aim for 20 to 30 minutes at a comfortable pace. Bring water, wear supportive shoes, and if you enjoy company, check local parks, libraries, or community centers for group walks and wellness meetups.
The power of community on the move
Walking is not only a path to better health. It is also a bridge to connection. In towns across Delaware, small walking groups have become weekly rituals that bring together people who might otherwise never cross paths. Conversations come easily when the pace is unhurried, and the world around you is alive with color and sound.
When walking becomes a shared habit, its benefits grow even stronger. Neighbors who meet for morning strolls, families who explore local trails on weekends, and coworkers who walk together at lunch all gain something deeper – community. A consistent walking routine creates both accountability and belonging, two of the most powerful motivators for lasting well-being.
A habit worth keeping
Walking is a way to explore Delaware’s landscapes, and to reconnect with what truly moves us – nature, people, and purpose. Every trail offers a chance to see something new, whether it is a heron lifting from the marsh, a friend’s story unfolding beside you, or a deeper breath of fresh air. Wherever you are in the First State, every season offers another reason to step outside and keep walking.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Markell_WilmTrailhead-002.jpg,,,2025-10-31 13:04:23.142859

Free.,Kilmar Abrego Garcia to be transferred to Tennessee for hearings on criminal charges,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/kilmar-abrego-garcia-be-transferred-tennessee-hearings-criminal-charges,,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge in Maryland on Friday approved the transfer of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from immigration detention in Pennsylvania to Nashville, Tennessee, for a multi-day hearing in his criminal case brought by the Trump administration after an erroneous deportation to El Salvador. The Trump administration previously planned as soon as Friday to again deport Abrego Garcia, this time to the West African country of Liberia. Abrego Garcia has protections from deportation to his home country of El Salvador after an immigration judge in 2019 feared he would face violence if removed there. Maryland District Judge Paula Xinis will allow for the transfer for his multi-day hearing on Nov. 4 and 5, according to court documents. Xinis, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama, is overseeing Abrego Garcia’s challenge to his detention, which is separate from the criminal case. His attorneys argue the Trump administration is keeping Abrego Garcia in detention to punish him, rather than seeking deportation. Abrego Garcia has agreed to be removed to Costa Rica, which has offered to accept him as a refugee. The Trump administration also has floated several other African countries as deportation destinations for Abrego Garcia: Ghana, Eswatini and Uganda.Deportation, criminal chargesThe Trump administration in March erroneously deported Abrego Garcia, a longtime Maryland resident, to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador — a move that thrust a spotlight on the realities of the president's immigration crackdown. Facing mounting pressures from various courts that ordered Abrego Garcia’s return, the Trump administration brought him back in June to face criminal charges lodged against him by the Justice Department that stemmed from a traffic stop in 2022. Those charges, to which Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty, accuse him of smuggling migrants across the country. The federal judge overseeing Abrego Garcia’s criminal trial in Nashville, U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw, this week filed an order warning Trump administration officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, they could face sanctions if they continue to make inflammatory remarks about Abrego Garcia. Members of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump, have without evidence repeatedly labeled Abrego Garcia as an MS-13 gang member. Tennessee hearingThe multi-day hearing for Abrego Garcia in Tennessee comes after Crenshaw earlier this month found there was a ""likelihood"" that the DOJ indictment against Abrego Garcia was vindictive. Obama also nominated Crenshaw.Abrego Garcia was living in Maryland with his wife and their three children when he was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents earlier this year and notified that there had been a change in his status. Because of the deportation protections, Abrego Garcia was required to check in with ICE each year.",,,,2025-10-31 13:04:23.142859

(Photo by Jacob Orledge/North Dakota Monitor)State officials have tapped former Office of Management and Budget Director Pam Sharp to fill one of the three open seats on the North Dakota Ethics Commission, but remain divided on the reappointment of one commissioner.
“I think Pam Sharp has more knowledge about what goes on in this place than just about anybody else,” Gov. Kelly Armstrong said in a Friday morning meeting with Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, R-Minot, and Senate Minority Leader Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo.
Sharp will succeed Ward Koeser, one of the original five members of the commission, and will serve a four-year term.
She led the Office of Management and Budget from 2003 to 2018 and is currently retired.
In her interview with the selection committee, Sharp said her background gives her an extensive understanding of how the executive branch works.
“I do feel I can bring value that perhaps not everyone has,” she said.
She said she would advocate for the Ethics Commission to be “very transparent” and “say everything they can say.”

Sharp also expressed support for the commission providing public education on how to navigate ethical issues.
“I do think the Ethics Commission is the place to give that advice,” she said. “How can you go wrong with education?”
On Friday, Armstrong, Hogue and Hogan remained at odds over who to pick for the remaining two open positions. The three state leaders indicated they would reconvene early next week to resume discussions.
The selection committee must appoint commissioners by a consensus vote. They have been meeting since August to select the commission’s next members.
The committee is at a standstill over whether to appoint commissioner Murray Sagsveen, a Bismarck attorney, to another term. Sagsveen joined the commission in late 2024 after former chair Paul Richard announced his retirement.
Hogan and Hogue have both identified Sagsveen as a favorite, though Armstrong has said he is unwilling to vote for him.
Governor wants ‘reset’ from North Dakota Ethics Commission as committee deadlocks on candidates

Armstrong in a previous meeting expressed a desire to replace Sagsveen because of the Ethics Commission’s tenuous relationship with the executive branch, which Armstrong said warrants a “general reset” of the board’s culture.
Sagsveen also expressed during the selection process that he feels the state Legislature has passed unconstitutional laws that limit the commission’s authority, which Armstrong said he disagrees with.
Hogue and Hogan both said Friday that their support for Sagsveen hasn’t changed.
“I think Mr. Sagsveen is the best, and I’m in the habit of hiring the best,” Hogue said.
Sagsveen is seeking another four-year term after his seat expired Aug. 31. The other open position was left by former chair Dave Anderson, who died in May. Anderson’s term expires Aug. 31, 2026.
Last week, selection committee members also identified Jared Huibregtse, a project manager for a Mandan engineering firm, and Mark Western, a Fargo attorney, as top picks. The state received 39 applicants for the open positions.
The Ethics Commission was created through a constitutional amendment approved by voters in 2018. The amendment tasks it with regulating ethical behavior in areas relating to elections, lobbying, corruption and transparency.
Commissioners’ duties include adopting ethics rules, investigating alleged violations and issuing advisory opinions to help public officials navigate ethical issues. They are paid a stipend for every day they meet, plus reimbursement for travel.

In this Sept. 24, 2025, image, Kelly speaks to Kansans during gathering in Johnson County. (Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly took an extraordinary step Friday by filing a lawsuit directly with the Kansas Supreme Court alleging Attorney General Kris Kobach was undermining constitutional powers assigned to the state’s governor.
Kelly, a two-term Democrat, said the lawsuit was necessary because the GOP attorney general took the position that he alone determined interests of Kansas when it came to litigation in federal and state courts. The governor said Kobach had failed to defend Kansans against “unlawful” federal overreaches by President Donald Trump.
“Time and again, Attorney General Kobach’s blatant partisanship is on display, harming and embarrassing Kansas,” she said. “While he was quick to sue the previous presidential administration, alleging he would protect Kansans from federal overreach, he has not once followed through on that claim now that the Trump administration has repeatedly done just that.”
Kobach, who filed or joined numerous lawsuits against the administration of President Joe Biden, said Kelly chose Halloween to take unprecedented action to seize control of the state’s litigation agenda. He expressed confidence Kelly wouldn’t prevail in court.
“This is not a close question. Gov. Kelly is wasting the court’s time,” Kobach said. “If the governor wants to run for the office of attorney general, she has the right to do so. But she will need to go to law school first.”
He said Kansas law was “crystal clear regarding who represents the state of Kansas in court and controls what legal positions are taken by the state of Kansas.”
Kelly’s lawsuit requested the state Supreme Court issue an order preventing the attorney general from intruding on a governor’s “supreme executive” power as head of the executive branch. She said the Kansas Constitution should be relied upon by the court to affirm a Kansas governor’s authority to take steps in defense of Kansans without interference from the attorney general’s office.
Kelly said Kobach’s “willful ignorance undermined” her administration’s effort to shield Kansans from harm and protect millions of dollars for essential programs and services.
“If the attorney general refuses to stand up for Kansas, at least Kansans can rest assured knowing that I will,” Kelly said in a statement.
Kelly said she was disturbed Kobach declined to participate in two federal lawsuits. One was filed against the U.S. Department of Agriculture to seek release of congressionally approved emergency funds for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. SNAP provides food aid to nearly 188,000 adults and children in Kansans.
Meanwhile, the governor joined — despite Kobach’s opposition — a lawsuit seeking to prevent the Trump administration from terminating federal funding to a collection of public health and safety programs. The list of programs included financing to test for lead in schools and child care facilities, environmental cleanup, evaluating the safety of dams and improvements to drinking water.
Kobach, who lost a campaign for governor against Kelly in 2018, has declared he had authority over what litigation the state of Kansas initiated.
In September, a Shawnee County District Court judge threw out a lawsuit filed by Kobach challenging Kelly’s decision to withhold from the Trump administration personal data on thousands of Kansans regarding SNAP. So far, the Kelly administration has refused to comply with federal demands for information on people who applied for or used SNAP in Kansas.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kelly-democrat-lenexa-5-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-31 13:04:23.142859

Unless you’re in prison.
The South Dakota Department of Corrections has been rationing its supply of flu vaccines this month in response to a federal government shutdown-related shortage.
The department offers the vaccines at no cost to the 3,800 inmates scattered across the state’s six prison campuses. Last year, spokesman Michael Winder told South Dakota Searchlight, the department administered 1,225 flu shots.
At this point, he wrote in an email the department is “prioritizing high-risk offenders to receive the vaccines.”
Flu shots are not in short supply for the general public, according to spokespersons for Avera and Sanford Health, South Dakota’s two largest health care providers. But the department doesn’t get its shots through them.
Flu deaths rise as anti-vaccine disinformation takes root

Instead, its supplies come from the federal Centers for Disease Control. The shots first come to the state Department of Health, which then distributes them to the Department of Corrections. As of Monday, Health Department spokeswoman Tia Kafka said, the state hadn’t received its entire correctional supply. 
The Health Department doesn’t distribute flu vaccines to any other state facilities, Kafka said. Just corrections.
“Some delays have occurred due to the federal government shutdown, and we are monitoring the situation closely,” Kafka wrote in an email. 
She said the department expects to get the rest of its correctional supply soon, but she didn’t know when.
Kafka’s department also distributes COVID boosters for inmates, which are supplied, like the flu shots, by the CDC. There isn’t a shortage there, though.
The Corrections Department has been impacted in at least one other way by the federal government shutdown, Winder wrote. Correctional officers are typically able to take a National Incident Management System training through the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Those web-based courses are paused.

Living at Wake Robin, Mary surrounded herself with a community that reflected her love of learning, creativity, and nature.
As her resources grew, she delighted in supporting more causes that mattered to her. She always followed the motto “trust but verify.” Through careful planning, guided by her trust advisor and her VCF philanthropic advisor, Emilye Pelow Corbett, Mary made generous legacy gifts to the institutions she cherished: Shelburne Farms, Shelburne Museum, Vermont Symphony Orchestra, The Nature Conservancy of Vermont, Vermont Land Trust, the Vermont Community Foundation, and Wake Robin.
To honor her generosity, six of the organizations teamed up with filmmaker Ned Castle of Frames to Life to create How Vermont Remembers, a heartfelt video about the lasting impact of Mary’s gifts.

(Photos courtesy of campaigns)In Virginia’s House of Delegates District 86, which includes Hampton, York County and all of Poquoson, incumbent Del. A.C. Cordoza, R-Hampton, faces a challenge from Democratic nominee Virgil G. Thornton Sr. in a competitive district that has increasingly been targeted by Democrats and shifted from red to purple in recent years. 
With control of the House of Delegates hanging in the balance, both campaigns have emphasized fundraising, voter outreach and key issues including workforce development, education, public safety and reproductive rights. 


Key races: 2025 Virginia House of Delegates elections
• Money, message and momentum define the 89th District race in Chesapeake
• Data centers dominate House District 21 race between Thomas and Gorham
• House District 82 rematch could help decide control of Virginia’s legislature
• In House District 22, candidates tackle data centers, rising costs in race for legislature’s future
• Familiar foes, new stakes: Coyner–Dougherty rematch tests Va.’s suburban swing in House District 75
• Democrat Mehta aims to unseat Republican Earley in Chesterfield-based House District 73 race
• Growth, tourism and turnout collide in House District 71 rematch
• House District 97, anchored in Virginia Beach, could determine party majority in House of Delegates
• Big money, tight margins define Obenshain–Franklin rematch in House District 41


Virginia’s 86th House District encompasses a diverse demographic. The median household income is approximately $86,000, the median age is roughly 38 years old, and around 37% of adults hold a bachelor’s degree or higher. The district reflects a blend of working-class and middle-income voters whose priorities often center on affordability, workforce opportunity and commuting time. 
In 2024, Kamala Harris narrowly carried the district over Donald Trump by just 1.1 percentage points, while U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine won it by less than 3 points against Republican Hung Cao. As of Oct. 23, Thornton had outraised Cordoza $2.47 million to $634,543, signaling that Democrats view House District 86 as a potential pickup opportunity in a narrowly divided chamber.
The race intensified in the final stretch leading up to Election Day, after Thornton released an advertisement calling Cordoza a “dangerous predator,” a claim the Republican has denied repeatedly and denounced in a sit-down TV interview.
 A.C. Cordoza

Cordoza was first elected in 2021 and has served two terms in the House of Delegates. He ran unsuccessfully for Hampton City Council in 2020. Before entering elected office, Cordoza served in the U.S. Air Force from 2013 to 2016 and later worked in cybersecurity at Newport News Shipbuilding. Cordoza declined to be interviewed for this story.
His committee assignments in the 2025 General Assembly include the House Public Safety Committee, the House Courts of Justice Committee (Criminal Subcommittee), and the Communications, Technology and Innovation Committee. 
According to his website, Cordoza’s stated platform emphasizes support for working-class families, technical education, small business growth and keeping Virginia’s cost of living low. He opposes tax increases and supports returning state budget surpluses to taxpayers. He also highlights career and technical education as central to workforce development, noting alternative pathways for students who struggle in traditional public school settings. 
Cordoza backs higher pay for law enforcement officers and continued funding to combat human trafficking. On Second Amendment issues, he is a strong proponent of gun rights, arguing law-abiding citizens should retain access to firearms while promoting voluntary safety and education initiatives. 
His environmental platform includes pushes for clean air, oyster restoration efforts and support for offshore wind. He has also emphasized veterans’ issues, drawing on his military experience to advocate for mental health support and affordable housing for veterans and military families. 
Cordoza’s record includes a 2023 re-election victory in District 86, when he won with 56.3% of the vote to Democrat Jarris Louis Taylor Jr.’s 43.5%. On policy positions, he voted against allowing voters to decide by referendum on a constitutional amendment to protect reproductive rights, and against requiring safe storage of firearms in households with minors.
According to campaign finance reports, Cordoza has raised over $634,000. Since Sept. 22, Pro-Cordoza or Anti-Thornton political ad spending has reached about $253,771. 
 Virgil G. Thornton Sr.

Virgil G. Thornton Sr., the Democratic challenger in District 86, brings a background rooted in workforce development and small-business leadership. He served as a technician in the U.S. Navy’s submarine program after entering shipyard apprenticeship training. He describes himself as an executive coach and community advocate who works with at-risk youth and small-business mentorship programs. Thornton declined to be interviewed for this story.
His latest campaign finance reports show Thornton has raised nearly $2.5 million and is entering the final days of the race with over $170,000 in cash on hand. Anti-Cordoza political ad spending tops $1.4 million. 
As someone who did not attend college, Thornton’s campaign emphasizes that college should not be the only path to success. He advocates for strengthened apprenticeship and technical training programs that link schools with local employers in trades such as shipbuilding, firefighting and criminal justice. He strongly opposes diverting public funds to private or religious schools and contends that public dollars should stay in public schools. 
Thornton supports increasing teacher pay and state per-student funding in divisions that fall below national averages. 
On gun safety, he supports mandatory training and licensing requirements for firearm ownership, comparing the process to obtaining a driver’s license. 
On reproductive rights, Thornton backs the state’s in-progress constitutional amendment to protect access to abortion and contraception, stating on his website that decisions about pregnancy and contraception are part of health care and “should be left to women, families, and their doctors.” He also supports automatic restoration of voting rights for people who have completed their sentences and argues against efforts to restrict access to Medicaid or other health programs. 
Thornton’s campaign positions emphasize economic opportunity and stability. In an interview with the Virginia Independent, he said it is “time out for the chaos and time to get back to community,” focusing on affordability, jobs and local opportunity. He argues small businesses are a major employer in Virginia and supports targeted grants, tax credits and mentorship for small firms. He also voiced concern about health care costs and economic uncertainty driven by federal policy changes and tariffs. 
Thornton’s campaign has also attracted attention for a controversial advertisement released Sept. 17, which cited several past police reports and incidents involving Cordoza, saying he has a “long history of predatory behavior.” 
A fact-check by WAVY-TV 10’s 10 On Your Side reviewed the ad’s claims and confirmed that Cordoza was charged in 2017 with misdemeanor brandishing of a firearm during a traffic dispute with a retired state trooper. However, court records show he was later found not guilty. The same review found that other incidents cited in the ad were based on police reports in which Cordoza was listed as the victim, but no charges were ever filed against him. 
Cordoza has since denied any wrongdoing, calling the advertisement “false” and saying the materials were taken out of context from his teenage years and early adulthood. On Oct. 6, he posted a video on social media featuring Nichole Melvin, a woman described as a “victim of Virgil Thornton’s false ad,” who said she regretted what she had previously said about Cordoza. 
The exchange has fueled tensions in an already competitive race, with both campaigns accusing the other of negative or misleading tactics. Despite the controversy, both candidates have continued to focus on policy: Thornton on economic opportunity and apprenticeships, and Cordoza on parental rights, small-business growth, and tax relief.
Voters will decide which man will represent the district in the House of Delegates on Election Day, Nov. 4.

(Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas will distribute $500,000 among six regional food bank networks in the state, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday, as  SNAP benefits are set to stop on Nov. 1.
Sanders also said she would consider additional weekly allocations from Arkansas’ restricted reserve funds if the federal government shutdown continues past next week. In a press release, she said the chairs of the Arkansas Legislative Council granted emergency approval to release the funds.
The announcement comes as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is set to stop paying benefits on Nov. 1 as a result of the ongoing federal shutdown and the Trump administration’s refusal to use emergency funds to continue paying program recipients.
Arkansas warns SNAP interruptions possible; urges preparation

The decision by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the decades-old food assistance program, sparked nationwide, bipartisan concerns and a scramble by food banks, nonprofits, and state and local governments to prepare for a surge in need by low-income Americans when the funds dry up.
The funds directed to Arkansas food bank networks won’t replace SNAP benefits. The federal government paid out more than $41 million in SNAP benefits to Arkansans in May alone, according to initial data from the USDA.
Republican governors and legislators in Virginia and Louisiana have already loosened their states’ purse strings to pay out benefits in November, with Louisiana preparing to spend upwards of $150 million a month to keep the program afloat during the funding lapse.
The federal government has traditionally covered the full cost of SNAP benefits and split the costs of administering the program with states.
Sanders, who frequently touts her record on addressing childhood food insecurity in public appearances, blamed Senate Democrats for the shutdown in a written statement.
“What Senate Democrats are doing is unconscionable, playing political games with the food assistance that nearly a quarter million Arkansans rely on,” Sanders said. “The simplest, fastest solution remains for Democrats to reopen the government and fund programs like SNAP, but in the meantime, my administration will work with our legislators, churches, and food banks to help feed Arkansans.”
Senate Republicans and Democrats remained deadlocked on funding the government as of Friday.
The food banks that will receive equal portions of the the funds are:

Northwest Arkansas Food Bank at Springdale
Food Bank of North Central Arkansas at Norfolk
Food Bank of Northeast Arkansas at Jonesboro
River Valley Regional Food Bank at Fort Smith
Arkansas Foodbank at Little Rock
Harvest Regional Food Bank at Texarkana

Sanders said HelpArkansas.com “will direct Arkansans to food assistance resources throughout the state and will be updated as the government shutdown continues.”
Those wanting to donate food or time to Arkansans in need can find information on the same website, as well as the websites of each of the food banks linked above.
 ‘No way we can hold the line’ 
Kate Jenkins, director of marketing and communications for Arkansas Foodbank, expressed gratitude for the roughly $83,000 her organization will receive from the pot of money, saying it would allow them to purchase “the first couple truckloads” of the 12 to 13 additional trucks of food they believe they will need.
“It’s definitely a great starting point,” she said.
But the looming SNAP cutoff is already having effects. Food banks in their 33-county service area saw the number of first-time visitors increase 10% to 20% “just this week, in preparation for the possibility that SNAP benefits won’t get funded,” Jenkins said.
Arkansas Foodbank is happy to help anyone hungry as a result of the federal shutdown. “That is our prerogative. That is our mission. That is our job,” Jenkins said. “However, comma, we already serve 280,000 Arkansans, just as the Arkansas Food Bank.”
With the shutdown, there are now between 15,000 to 20,000 federal workers in the food bank’s area without paychecks — and roughly 49% of the state’s approximately 240,000 SNAP enrollees are within Arkansas Foodbank’s service area as well, she said.
The SNAP interruption means many of those people will be looking to get assistance elsewhere.
“We are conservatively estimating that there will be an increase of 100,000 people on top of the 300,000 we’re currently serving” as a result of SNAP payments not going out, Jenkins said. “There’s just no way that we can hold the line as the charitable food system.”
Jenkins said those wishing to help can learn how to donate food or volunteer on Arkansas Foodbank’s website.
“A lot of these pantries are going to have a spike in first time visitors specifically, but just in traffic in general,” she said. “For every $1 that is donated to the food bank, we can provide five meals.”
Kent Eikenberry, the president and CEO of Northwest Arkansas Food Bank, said in an email that the money from the state “comes at a very opportune time.”
While he couldn’t speak for other food banks, Eikenberry said the funds would be used to assist their partner agencies, purchase additional food for mobile and school pantries and stock up on low-stock items.
But Eikenberry said while the funds are “appreciated, it does not negate the fact that for every meal we distribute, SNAP generates nine meals.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_5213-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-31 13:04:23.142859

On Oct. 27, Gov. Ned Lamont announced that his administration is providing $3 million in emergency state funding to Connecticut Foodshare to help Connecticut residents who could lose access to food stamp benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) during the shutdown of the federal government.
But food is not distributed to individuals at Foodshare’s facilities in Wallingford and Bridgeport. They distribute food to local food pantries.
The funding will help Connecticut Foodshare buy more food for agency partners and mobile pantries across the state as the situation is resolved.

The race for governor

Michigan Secretary of State and gubernatorial candidate Jocelyn Benson reported raising $1.2 million in the period running from July 21, 2025 to Oct. 20, 2025, bringing her total fundraising to over $4.7 million, which her campaign said was “more than any other Democratic gubernatorial candidate in an open seat at this point in the cycle.” She ended the reporting period with just under $3 million in cash on hand.
Her main rival for the Democratic nomination, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, who has raised more than $1.1 million since launching his campaign, reported raising nearly $360,000 in that same time frame, ending the reporting period with more than $370,000 cash on hand.
Also in the hunt for the Democratic nod is Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson, who raised more than $295,000 in the most recent reporting period, bringing his fundraising total to $1.3 million. He ended the period with over $385,000 cash on hand.
Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, a lifelong Democrat now seeking an independent run for governor, announced Monday that his campaign had raised more than $1.17 million in the third quarter, leaving him with more than $2.46 million cash on hand. His campaign said the numbers were “a clear sign of growing support for his independent run.”
Not so fast, said the Democratic Governors Association, which released a memo Monday questioning Duggan’s viability as a candidate, and pointing to previous reporting that “a sizable share” of the mayor’s campaign fundraising “comes from donors of President Donald Trump, GOP party leaders, and conservative power brokers”.
Over on the GOP side, former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox reported the biggest war chest, with nearly $3.8 million in cash on hand for his gubernatorial bid, although that includes a $2 million loan he made to his own campaign, which as the Detroit Free Press noted brought the “total he has lent his own campaign to over $3.5 million.”
Also seeking the Republican nod is U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township), who raised just under $1.4 million during the July 21, 2025 to Oct. 20, 2025 fundraising period, bringing his total fundraising to more than $3.6 million since the start of his campaign and leaving him with nearly $2.3 million cash on hand.
Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township) reported more than $2.1 million cash on hand as of Oct. 20, including $420,000 raised in the most recent fundraising period, which brings his total raised to over $2.7 million.
Ralph Rebandt, who is the newest entrant to the GOP race (he also ran for governor in 2022), reported raising almost $927,000 between July 21, 2025 and Oct. 20, 2025, although that includes $800,000 in loans he made to his own campaign. He ends the period with over $880,000 cash on hand.
Meanwhile, former Michigan House Speaker Tom Leonard (R-DeWitt), raised more than $290,000 in the period, leaving him with just over $700,000 cash on hand. While he has raised over $930,000 in total, that includes a $105,000 loan he gave his own campaign.

(photo: Ahmed Jallow /NC Newsline)Inside the Urban Ministries of Wake County’s food pantry on Thursday morning, volunteers slid boxes of pasta and cans of vegetables into brown paper bags, the day’s rations for families waiting outside in a line of cars that wrapped around the building.
Outside, pantry manager Jerry Leslie moved from car to car with a clipboard, checking names and employment status as volunteers hustled to keep pace. The line has grown in recent weeks, he said, a sign of rising need as the federal shutdown unsettles families across North Carolina.
“We’ve got a lot of furloughed workers coming through,” Leslie said. “A lot of truck drivers are starting to come through the line, too.”
The morning before, he noticed a woman typing on her laptop while she waited. “I asked about her situation, and she told me she’s employed but not getting paid.”
As the shutdown stretches into its fourth week, food pantries like Urban Ministry have become a vital safety net for furloughed workers and low-income households bracing for impending disruptions to federal food assistance.
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program still has funding, but benefits will halt this weekend if the Trump administration does not authorize emergency USDA reserves. The agency has said it will not do so.
On Tuesday, North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson joined several states in suing the U.S. Department of Agriculture, seeking to compel the release of reserve funds to continue SNAP benefits in November. The lawsuit aims to protect food assistance for 1.4 million North Carolinians, including about 580,000 children.
On Thursday, Gov. Josh Stein announced that the state and private donors are sending $18 million to North Carolina food banks to help. However, that’s just a fraction of the $230 to $250 million SNAP benefits pump into the state every month.
If payments pause for long, food aid groups warn they will not be able to meet the surge in need.
“We used to serve between 80 and 100 people a day,” Leslie said. “Now we’re seeing at least 200 daily.”
Sitting in his car, Theodore Robinson, 78, said the looming threat of cuts worries him and his neighbors. “It’ll affect the very essence of our lives — everyone who depends on these programs,” he said.
Franklin County mom Rebecca Cuering is also worried about what the coming disruption will mean for her family. 
When stagehand work comes through, she takes it. At home, she raises her 6-year-old son while caring for her 78-year-old mother, who has dementia, and her brother, a veteran. Their well barely produces clean water, so part of her SNAP benefits goes toward buying it by the gallon.
Before she qualified for SNAP, she fell behind on utilities and her car was repossessed. The benefits, she said, have given her just enough breathing room to keep the lights on and begin rebuilding. 
“Since getting SNAP, I’ve been able to start catching up on bills,” Cuering said. “Without it, I don’t know what we’d do — probably start asking strangers for help.”
Inside the food pantry, the shelves remain stocked for now, but staff worry that a shutdown could quickly change that. 
The Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program, which provides about 70% of Urban Ministries’ monthly supplies, distributes staples like canned vegetables, beans, rice, applesauce, and usually three types of meat.
But with the shutdown, even that lifeline is  at risk. Recent deliveries have arrived short, particularly on protein. “The last order we had, we didn’t get any meat,” Leslie said.
To fill some of the gap, Urban Ministries has turned to local partners, scheduled six community food drives for November, and is using its limited funds to stock the pantry.
“It’s going to be cutting it close,” Leslie said.
Even so, he expects they will make it through the end of the year. “We have a good base of support. We’re just trying to keep up with the need.”
Jessica N. Holmes, former state auditor and executive director of Urban Ministries of Wake County, recalled growing up reliant on free lunch, pantries, and SNAP benefits. 
“Even though North Carolina is known for agriculture, too many of our neighbors still go hungry,” Holmes said in a statement. “With the government shutdown, things can go from bad to worse very quickly for hard-working families and children.”

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s top state government budget official warned Thursday that the current budget cycle “is playing out to be another belt-tightening year.”
Bureau of Finance and Management Commissioner Jim Terwilliger spoke during a Governor’s Council of Economic Advisors meeting.
“We probably just have to take a cautious approach as we move forward, given some of the circumstances that we’re in right now,” Terwilliger said. 
Through September, the state’s general fund revenue was 2.5% below the budgeted projection, which meant revenue was $17.4 million less than expected. Derek Johnson, the bureau’s state economist, said the bureau is anxiously awaiting October tax collection reports. Sales taxes were $6.1 million below estimates through September.
Johnson pointed to numbers indicating slower spending despite rising personal income, and cited weak consumer sentiment — a measure of consumers’ attitude and confidence about the economy and their personal finances — and higher prices as part of the explanation. 
The farm sector is another drag on state revenue. Taxable sales of farm machinery fell 21% in fiscal year 2025 and were down about 20% in the first three months of the state’s fiscal year 2026, which began in July. Corn, soybeans and wheat prices are all lower than last year, although cattle prices are up. 
Council members from around the state reported uneven conditions. Sioux Falls City Finance Director Shawn Pritchett said the city will miss its sales tax revenue estimate and has already cut $6 million in ongoing expenses, with fee hikes on the table to help account for the remaining $4 million shortfall. He said the city is seeing softer restaurant traffic ticket sales and hotel occupancy.
Rapid City is benefitting from a boom tied to the Ellsworth Air Force Base expansion (construction is underway to accommodate the impending arrival of new B-21 bomber planes) and continued migration into the Black Hills. City sales tax collections are up just over 3% this calendar year. However, “that number just tracks with inflation,” said Marnie Herrmann, chief banking officer at Security First Bank in Rapid City.
Retailers are bracing for a lean holiday season. Kevin Nyberg of Nyberg’s Ace Hardware, which has locations in Sioux Falls and Watertown, said national surveys suggest the average household plans to spend about $1,600 less on Christmas gifts this year. He hopes discounts, rewards and rebate programs will drive traffic.
“Call it a gimmick, call it a marketing ploy — either way, it works,” he said.
Carla Gatzke of Daktronics, an electronic display manufacturer based in Brookings, flagged tariff impacts, child care cost and eligibility, and workforce shortages as key issues in the Brookings regional economy. South Dakota’s unemployment rate sits at 1.9% — the lowest in the nation — with roughly three job openings per unemployed worker.

You can read more about the section here.

It is with great pride and excitement that Mississippi’s Capital City prepares to host the 82nd Annual National Folk Festival, Nov.  7-9. This is significant in the life of the National Folk Festival because it marks the first time in the history of the event that it has been held in the Deep South.
November also marks the beginning of a three-year residency for Jackson. The event also will be hosted in Jackson in 2026 and 2027.
At the conclusion of the 2027 festival, the Jackson community will have the opportunity to create a legacy that will sustain a vibrant, locally-produced festival celebrating our living heritage, utilizing the infrastructure of the National Folk Festival.   
For years, citizens and visitors alike have inquired, “When is Jubilee JAM! returning?” Well, hosting the National Folk Festival creates an opportunity to birth an annual event with many similarities to that historic and enduring event.
Why does the National Folk Festival matter?
For over 90 years, the National Folk Festival has celebrated the artistry, music, dance, story and crafts that form the living traditions of America. We are honored to bring this storied festival to Jackson. The 2026 festival will play an integral role in the American 250 (Mississippi) Celebration.

The National Folk Festival is more than a festival. It is a statement. It’s about honoring the roots of America’s music and culture, from the Mississippi Delta to the Gulf Coast, from African-American traditions to Native American crafts and beyond.
Everybody knows that Mississippi is the Birthplace of America’s Music. Also, it is about a place known as “The City with Soul” stepping into the national spotlight and celebrating what makes us unique. It’s about doing so together. We at Visit Jackson call it “collective ambition.”
What Is folk?
Folk is a cultural tradition from all across America.  It’s Bobby Rush, bluegrass, steel guitars, gospel and Jackson State University’s Sonic Boom of the South marching band. It is western dance, South African qawwali, the Korean Performing Arts Institute of Chicago and E.U. and their hit from my college days, “Da Butt.” It is basketmaking and multiple other activities. 
Over three days, downtown Jackson will be transformed. More than 300 artists, musicians, dancers and storytellers will grace multiple stages, with continuous performances, craft demonstrations, food representing regional and international traditions, a bustling marketplace of folklife and family-friendly programming.
From blues and bluegrass to hip-hop and Irish fiddle, from Choctaw social dancing to South Asian qawwali, there is something for everyone. 
The event reinforces the commitment to accessibility, sustainability, community and cultural celebration.
Hosting the National Folk Festival isn’t only about the arts. It’s about the broader impact on our city and state. Over the three-year run, the festival is projected to generate significant economic benefit and elevate Jackson’s standing as a cultural destination.
It will bring tens of thousands of visitors, fill our hotels, restaurants and shops, and spotlight our region’s talents on a national stage.
Jackson is uniquely positioned to host the event.
Mississippi is rightly known as the birthplace of so much of America’s music: blues, gospel, soul, marching bands and traditions that shaped the world. Jackson is located at the heart of that legacy, and we are perfectly positioned to host a festival of this magnitude.
The city of Jackson, Visit Jackson, the Greater Jackson Chamber Partnership, the Mississippi Arts Commission, Visit Mississippi, the Jackson Redevelopment Authority, Hinds County Economic Development Authority, the Community Foundation for Mississippi and many others have come together to make this possible.
Far too many times I have heard metro Jacksonians say that there is nothing to do here. And while that is far from the truth, I encourage our residents, families, friends and visitors to attend this historic event. Bring your children, grandparents and friends.
Walk the streets of downtown Jackson, enjoy the music, sample the food, browse the crafts and celebrate the diversity of tradition that binds us together. Volunteer opportunities are available, vendor applications are open, and the festival is a platform for our local artists and makers to shine. 
Will the festival be safe?
The festival is produced by a respected national organization, the National Council for the Traditional Arts, in partnership with the city and local agencies, which suggests there will be professional event planning, crowd management, security coordination and infrastructure.
In fact, local and state law enforcement agencies have been a part of the planning process since the event selected Jackson.
The location and staging have been intentionally strategic. Multiple stages and programs have been planned in an open public space, utilizing proven event safety best practices.
We encourage attendees to review the event map before arrival so that they can more easily locate venues, vendors and stages. Also, know where you will park. The event organizers have this type of information and much more on the website, www.nationalfolkfestival.com.
Thank you for being part of this journey. I look forward to seeing you downtown in Jackson, Nov. 7-9, tapping your toes, dancing, exploring and celebrating –  together.
In short, enjoy the National Folk Festival in Jackson, Mississippi – MY CITY –  THE CITY WITH SOUL.

New benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, will not be issued beginning Nov. 1 due to the ongoing federal government shutdown, the Mississippi Department of Human Services announced Oct. 24. Food assistance has continued to flow in past shutdowns, but the federal government has said it cannot use emergency funds to pay for the program. 
Republican Gov. Tate Reeves has not indicated that he will move for Mississippi to bridge the gap in the food assistance program. Democratic and Republican governors in a handful of other states, including Louisiana, have pledged to use state funds to cover all or part of the program.
There will be long-term consequences for children if Reeves and state legislators do not take similar steps to fund the benefits, leaders of the Mississippi Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics wrote in a Tuesday letter. 
“The cost of inaction will be far greater than the cost of temporary assistance,” said the letter penned by President Dr. Patricia Tibbs and Vice President Dr. David Reeves. 
“Families already struggling to make ends meet will be forced to choose between food, utilities, and medicine. Hospitals and clinics will inevitably bear the burden of increased malnutrition and preventable illness. Our children, the future of this state, will suffer the most.”

Mississippi Legislative Black Caucus Chairman Kabir Karriem, a Democrat from Columbus, encouraged Reeves to declare a state of emergency and call a special session of the Legislature to appropriate funds to cover the shortfall. 
“Ensuring that no Mississippian faces hunger due to gaps in SNAP delivery is a critical public health and humanitarian priority,” he wrote in a letter Tuesday. 
Reeves did not respond to a request for comment from Mississippi Today.
In a social media post Monday, he blamed Democrats for the government shutdown’s ramifications and said the state cannot cover the halted funds. 
“Democrats in Washington are evidently more interested in providing free healthcare to illegals than a safety net for poor Mississippians,” he wrote. 
“They evidently hate Trump more than they like their constituents. There is sadly no simple way for state government to just step in and pay the hundreds of millions of dollars in harm that this shutdown by the Washington Democrats is causing.”
The battle over whether or not to extend expiring tax credits that make health insurance more affordable for millions of Americans is at the heart of the government shutdown standoff, with Democrats pushing for their renewal, along with the reversal of cuts to Medicaid. Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for the subsidies, nor are they eligible for full Medicaid benefits.  
Nearly 400,000 Mississippians — or 13% of the state’s population — receive food assistance through SNAP. Two thirds of participants are in families with children, and about 41% are in households with older adults or adults with a disability. 
Mississippi has one of the highest rates of childhood poverty in the nation, with over 1 in 5 children living in poverty and lacking reliable access to food.  
“I’m really worried,” Tibbs told Mississippi Today. She referenced the effects that hunger can have on children’s development, behavior, academic performance and long-term health. 
Some counties rely heavily on SNAP benefits. In four Mississippi counties, over a third of residents rely on the program to purchase food, according to a report from WLBT. 
The federal government has been shut down since Oct. 1 as Congress works to strike a deal on the national budget. It is now the second-longest government shutdown in U.S. history.
More than two dozen states sued the Trump administration Tuesday over the halted food assistance benefits, arguing that the decision was illegal and will harm the 42 million Americans who depend on the benefits. 
Federal officials say they are legally prohibited from extending the benefits by using emergency funds.
“No child in our state should go hungry because of political gridlock in Washington,” Tibbs and Reeves, the pediatrics association’s vice president, wrote in the Oct. 28 letter. 
SNAP beneficiaries in Mississippi must meet income and resource limits, and most able-bodied adults must also meet work requirements. 
New work requirements for SNAP are set to begin next month as a result of federal budget legislation President Donald Trump signed into law last summer. The law increases the existing work requirement’s upper age limit from 54 to 65 and extends the requirement to people who were previously exempt: veterans, those facing homelessness, and young people aging out of foster care. There is still a caregiver exemption, but parents must have children younger than 14 — down from 18. 
Even in the best of times, many Mississippi families aren’t able to provide healthy meals for their kids, said Tibbs. A pause to SNAP could be devastating. 
“I just hope that the state sees the crisis that’s looming for our vulnerable citizens and that they do something to extend benefits for as long as we can,” she said. 
“We need to have said in the future that we tried, we tried to do the things we need to do for the children in our state, regardless of what’s happening in Washington, D.C.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/30123917/Mississippi-Economic-Council-annual-Hobnob16B.jpg,,,2025-10-31 12:03:06.124374

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Delays in the sale of Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital, have led the owner of both hospitals to propose two new alternatives: transferring the facilities to state ownership, or closing them.
In a motion filed in federal bankruptcy court Thursday, attorneys for Prospect Medical Holdings sought court permission for its new backup plan. The LA-based hospital chain operator, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January, had hoped to onload its Rhode Island facilities onto a new, nonprofit owner. But prospective buyer The Centurion Foundation still can’t sell the bonds needed to finance its purchase, and Prospect has had enough.
“Now, more than eight months after approval of the Centurion Sale, and six months after that promised closing date, the Debtors can no longer afford to fund the RI Hospitals on the hope that Centurion may finally obtain adequate financing to close the Centurion Sale,” states the motion filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas.
Otis Brown, a spokesperson for The Centurion Foundation, did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Friday.
The 346-page document includes a tranche of exhibits documenting the history of the drawn-out sale, from the initial, conditional approval by state regulators in June 2024, to the series of revisions granted to ease the financial terms of the transaction. Centurion has struggled to secure investors to back the $150 million in taxable and tax-exempt bonds needed to finalize its purchase amid unfavorable credit ratings and a bleak outlook for health care facilities nationwide under federal budget cuts.
Despite these obstacles, proponents, including Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, insist that the Atlanta-based nonprofit is the best hope for saving the critical, safety net hospitals from closure. 
“Given the developments over the past few weeks, we are not surprised by this development and have been preparing for it,” Neronha said in an emailed response Friday. “We will oppose this motion in court in the coming days and will continue to do everything we can to keep these hospitals open and operating for the foreseeable future.”
However, Neronha’s office has refused Prospect’s request to repurpose $51.5 million already held in escrow for hospital operations to cover Prospect’s losses, according to the court document. The escrow account was set up in 2021, paid for by private equity firm Leonard Green as part of its exit from the local hospitals ownership.
Neronha has remained insistent that the money remain available for hospital operations, while blasting the corporate owners for financial mismanagement.
But Prospect, which continues to face short-term cash flow woes as its assets are sold off through federal bankruptcy proceedings to pay its creditors, can’t afford to keep waiting. The six-month delay in closing has caused the company to incur an additional $18.7 million in losses, with another $6 million loss by the end of November, the motion states.
“The Debtors cannot continue to operate the RI Hospitals indefinitely,” the motion states. “Continued operations at these facilities past December 31, 2025 would risk further administrative insolvency of these chapter 11 cases. It is particularly inequitable to burden the Debtors’ creditors with these losses under the current circumstances, where the Debtors will receive little, if any, consideration from the transfer of these assets.”
It seeks a federal bankruptcy judge’s permission to start the process to transfer the hospitals to state ownership or to begin their “orderly closure.” 
The company has proposed a Dec. 31 closure date, noting that it will adjust the end of clinical operations ‘if necessary to ensure safe patient care.”
The closure plan also details the timing of layoff notices for the 2,400 affected employees and patient discharges, along with transferring and storing medical records and getting rid of medical waste and hazardous materials.
The two hospitals offer 500 beds between them, including 104 beds for behavioral health patients, equal to more than 20% of behavioral health beds. They accounted for more 50,000 emergency room visits in 2024.

Former Oklahoma Department of Corrections Director Steven Harpe approved a million-dollar deal with a private vendor in early April to install AI call monitoring software in seven state prisons.
Months later, he resigned from state service and took a job with that company.
On Oct. 3, Harpe posted on LinkedIn that he had accepted the position of chief product officer at LEO Technologies, an Austin, Texas-based artificial intelligence company that caters to law enforcement and corrections officials. More than 80 people, including two Board of Corrections members, responded to the post wishing Harpe congratulations. Harpe also shared news of the job change on Facebook.
Six months earlier, on April 3, Harpe authorized a one-year, $1.017 million deal with LEO Technologies. Agency officials gave final approval to the contract, which includes four one-year renewal options, on April 8. The contract stipulates that LeoTech will “assign designated personnel to support Oklahoma DOC operations.”
Harpe announced his resignation in late August, effective Sept. 30. The announcement stated that he was leaving state service to rejoin the private sector but did not specify which company. Typically, if the company is in business with the state, such a move would require a one-year cooling off period.
Oklahoma statutes stipulate that a state officer or employee who exercises discretion or decision-making authority in awarding a privatization contract is prohibited from becoming an employee of that business or organization within one year of the contract award date. Penalties for violating the statute include the cancellation of contracts and a temporary prohibition on doing business with the state.
The Legislature passed the law in 1999 to stop a revolving door of state officials leaving to work for private vendors. In 2009, lawmakers updated the statute to include sanctions for businesses that hire an involved state employee.
Lee Ann Bruce Boone, executive director of the Oklahoma Ethics Commission, said enforcement of the statute likely falls with the attorney general’s office. Leslie Berger, a spokesperson for the attorney general’s office, declined to comment on whether the matter is under investigation, citing an internal agency policy.
Abegail Cave, director of communications for Gov. Kevin Stitt, said people within the governor’s office were unaware of Harpe’s employment plans upon leaving state service. She declined to comment on the law requiring a cooling off period. Harpe was the second Department of Corrections director appointed by Stitt following a 2019 law change that transferred power to appoint the agency’s director from the Board of Corrections to the governor’s office.
Bob Burke, an Oklahoma City-based attorney and historian, said Harpe’s signature on the contract should concern taxpayers.
“It’s a sad day in this state when directors of agencies even recommend the award of a contract and months later go to work for that same company,” Burke said. “The appearance stinks. That kind of self-dealing should be frowned upon by the people and by the governor and legislative leaders who appoint members to the Board of Corrections.”
Harpe did not respond to phone calls, a text message or an email seeking comment. LEO Technologies did not respond to a phone call or written inquiry.
Harpe, who worked as the chief information officer for Gov. Kevin Stitt’s Gateway Mortgage Group prior to entering state government in 2019, regularly promoted the Department of Corrections’ artificial intelligence initiatives in media interviews and at out-of-state conferences.
In July, he traveled to Washington, D.C., to represent the American Correctional Association at a congressional briefing on AI in public safety. At the hearing, Harpe touted broad AI implementation efforts within the Department of Corrections.
“What if I was able to take that labor and instead of using people to do it, I was using facial recognition AI, not just one time, but use it all the time,” Harpe said during the briefing. “I always know where they are. You get logistics of who’s talking to who. Technology now exists where you can look at a body in real time and tell if they’re carrying something, if you have something stowed somewhere on you. It also lets us do really cool things like suicide prevention.”
Harpe earned $275,000 per year in his role as agency director, comparable to top prison officials in larger states like Texas. Stitt has defended the salary as necessary to recruit and retain the best and brightest from the private sector to work in state government.

Patrol investigators cited him after investigating an allegation by a woman attending a sine die party often attended by staff, family and friends of legislators, Patrol Public Relations Director Cody Thomas confirmed to the Nebraska Examiner.

The Patrol received a report in early September about an alleged incident in the evening hours of May 29 at Lincoln Country Club. That is the same time and location that lawmakers attended the first of two post-legislative session sine die parties.
“An adult female reported that Dan McKeon had made inappropriate contact with her buttocks with his hand, over the top of her clothing,” Thomas said in response to a reporter’s questions about the incident.
Thomas said the State Patrol issued McKeon a citation for public indecency — a Class II misdemeanor — Thursday afternoon. The allegation was forwarded to Lancaster County Attorney Pat Condon’s office, which had no immediate comment.
McKeon’s office declined to comment on the allegations Friday morning, and he did not answer a call to his cell phone.
McKeon was elected to the Nebraska Legislature in 2024, replacing former State Sen. Fred Meyer of St. Paul. McKeon has been married for 30 years and has four children, according to McKeon’s biographical page on the Nebraska Legislature’s website.
During his first session in office, McKeon passed two bills to ease agricultural regulations and has another bill pending that aims to protect veterans from “predatory claim sharks.”

The Examiner is not naming the woman making the allegation, because it is the policy of States Newsroom and the Examiner not to name people who say they have been abused unless they wish to talk publicly. Her lawyer declined to comment Friday morning.
People around the Capitol have been talking for months about an alleged incident involving someone who works for the Legislature.
On Oct. 20, State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha posted on social media in response to a comment criticizing her that the Legislature doesn’t “have an ‘ethics committee,’ and if we did, my colleague who grabbed a staffers ass at an event a few months ago would have resigned already.”
As of midmorning Friday, no resignation letters from a member of the Legislature had been received by the legislative or executive offices that would expect them.
Gov. Jim Pillen, through a spokesperson, had no immediate comment.
McKeon is expected in Lancaster County Court Dec. 10, authorities said.

The Iowa Board of Nursing has charged 48-year-old Andrea Marie Meisinger, formerly of Altoona, Ankeny and Grimes, with professional incompetence and with having her nursing license sanctioned by other jurisdictions.
While the board has not disclosed any information as to what led to the charges, regulators in other states have publicly detailed a long history of alleged violations related to Meisinger prescribing weight-loss drugs to patients in states where she wasn’t authorized to do so.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Meisinger’s licensing troubles began in October 2018 when she — then known as Andrea Richey and Andrea Althaus — surrendered her Iowa license as an advanced registered nurse practitioner after being accused of prescribing controlled substances to people with whom she had no provider-patient relationship and with using a prescription pad she obtained from a previous employer.
In February 2020, the Iowa board agreed to reinstate Meisinger’s license subject to one year of probation.
Nebraska, South Dakota and other states take action
In May 2024, the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services’ Division of Public Health charged Meisinger with several regulatory violations, including gross incompetence or negligence, unprofessional conduct, immoral or dishonorable conduct, and having had her license sanctioned in the states of Georgia, Texas, Florida and New Mexico.
The Nebraska division alleged that Meisinger had placed on Facebook a set of advertisements for weight-loss drugs. A prospective patient allegedly contacted Meisinger through Facebook Messenger and received in return a pricing schedule and an assurance that no medical appointment or consultation was needed to receive the drugs.
Meisinger later invoiced the patient $2,700 for a six-month supply of the drugs, although the patient canceled the order before it was fulfilled, the division alleged.
As a result of the disciplinary charges, Meisinger agreed in July 2024 to pay a $3,000 civil penalty and have her Nebraska license suspended for 90 days followed by a period of probation.
In September 2024, the state of South Dakota sent Meisinger a cease-and-desist order, alleging she was unlawfully practicing without a license in that state. Meisinger’s Iowa license, however, remained in good standing, authorizing her to continue working in Iowa as both an ARNP and RN.
In November 2024, Nebraska’s Division of Public Health filed new charges against Meisinger seeking the immediate suspension of her license because “her continued practice would constitute an imminent danger to public health and safety.”
The division alleged that after her July 2024 suspension took effect, Meisinger, as the CEO and advanced registered nurse practitioner at AR Virtual Health in Omaha, had begun prescribing weight-loss drugs to additional patients in states where she was not authorized to do so, such as California, New York, Illinois, Idaho, Kansas, Washington and other states.
The division also alleged Meisinger was prescribing medications for various patients by having the drugs delivered to her home address or to the Iowa addresses of employees or associates.
‘We don’t want a lot of people snooping around in here’
The Nebraska division also alleged that in September 2024, after one of Meisinger’s employees at AR Virtual Health resigned, Meisinger had a phone conference with the worker and stated, “If people start investigating this … we don’t want a lot of people snooping around in here … Your name is on every single chart.”
Meisinger, the division alleges, also told the former employee she was considering offering the individual a severance package and specifically asked the worker not to file a report against her.
“I’m just asking to please not do anything in haste in making decisions right now,” Meisinger allegedly told the worker. “I want to make it right with you. And that doesn’t mean just smoothing things over with a few words. It means taking care of you financially.”
At around that same time, the Nebraska division claimed, Meisinger was advertising on Facebook that she could provide patients “in all 50 states” with prescription-only weight loss medications.
As a result of the allegations, the Nebraska division revoked Meisinger’s probation and scheduled a hearing to again suspend her nursing license in that state. Within days, Meisinger agreed to a revocation of her Nebraska ARNP and RN licenses and also agreed to pay a $16,000 civil penalty.
New allegations surface while Iowa license remains in effect
In March 2025, with her Iowa license still in good standing, the Nebraska division again took action against Meisinger, this time issuing a cease-and-desist order related to her alleged ongoing efforts to provide nursing services in Nebraska despite her license revocation.
The division alleged that on her AR Virtual Health website and on social-media platforms, Meisinger was continuing to offer consultation on “detox” and supplements to individuals in all 50 states.
“These advertisements and comments make it clear that you are holding yourself out as a nurse practitioner and are operating a business to do so,” the division claimed, warning that continued violations could result in felony charges, up to four years in prison, and a $25,000 fine.
Currently, Meisinger’s Iowa licenses as an ARNP and RN remain active and in effect. A hearing on the Iowa Board of Nursing’s charges is scheduled for Jan. 16, 2026.

Department of Corrections)COLUMBIA — An inmate who pleaded guilty to killing three and leaving messages written in blood chose to die by firing squad, according to a letter submitted to the state Supreme Court on Friday.
Stephen Bryant’s execution is scheduled to take place at 6 p.m. Nov. 14, marking the fifth to take place in the state this year. Bryant, 44, will be the third inmate put to death by firing squad since legislators added it as an option in 2021.

The other four inmates executed since the process resumed in September 2024 selected lethal injection. By law, inmates have until two weeks before their execution date to choose their method of execution. Anyone who doesn’t make a choice faces electrocution, which legislators made the default method in 2021, though no inmate has died by that method in the state since 2008.
Legislators made firing squad an option four years ago in an effort to restart executions after years of being unable to purchase the drugs used in lethal injections. A secrecy law passed in 2023 allowed prison officials to get the drugs later that year, making it an option once again.
Bryant’s execution would be the sixth in the country carried out by firing squad since the state Supreme Court resumed executions nationwide in 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.
Before the two in South Carolina this year, the last firing squad execution took place in Utah in 2010.
Previous questions over methods
Attorneys for death row inmates have raised concerns about the legality of lethal injection and firing squad, though the state Supreme Court decided last year both were constitutional.
The most recent firing squad execution, carried out in April, faced scrutiny after inmate Mikal Mahdi’s attorneys claimed the bullets mostly missed his heart.
During a firing squad execution, three marksmen shoot live rounds at the inmate, who is strapped to a chair, through a hole in the wall 15 feet away, according to Department of Corrections protocols released during court proceedings.
An autopsy after Mahdi’s execution showed two bullet holes, instead of the three that appeared on the last inmate to die using that method, according to filings attorneys submitted to the state Supreme Court. Fragments of the bullets pierced Mahdi’s heart, but they did not strike it directly the way they did with the previous inmate, according to court filings.
Department of Corrections officials contend nothing went wrong. Two bullets struck Mahdi’s chest in the exact same spot, creating one entrance wound, spokeswoman Chrysti Shain has said. No bullet fragments were found in the room, she said.
Lethal injection has faced its own concerns. In court filings to the state Supreme Court and federal lawsuits, attorneys have repeatedly asked for more information about the drugs used to kill prisoners, which judges and the state’s highest court have said is unnecessary.
Death by lethal injection can be long and painful, as the inmate’s lungs fill up with fluid, attorneys have claimed in court filings, though experts for the state contend the drugs knock out inmates long before that occurs.
Bryant’s crimes and appeals
Bryant was sentenced to death for one of three Sumter County murders he committed 21 years ago. He never professed innocence. He pleaded guilty to all three killings.
His crime spree began on Oct. 5, 2004, when he broke into a house. Continued burglaries escalated three days later, when he shot Clinton Brown in the back while he was fishing in the Wateree River in Richland County. Brown survived.
Bryant picked up two of his victims, Cliff Gainey and Chris Burgess, in his truck before shooting them and leaving their bodies by the side of the road, according to court documents.
The killing of Willard Tietjen, however, was different.
Bryant broke into the 62-year-old’s home in Sumter County, where he shot Tietjen nine times before ransacking his house looking for items to steal. Bryant stayed at the house, smoking and using Tietjen’s computer and answering calls from his wife and daughter, telling them he had killed Tietjen, according to court filings.
Police found Tietjen’s body with cigarette burns on it, along with notes written on the walls, with some letters written in blood.
“Victim number four in two weeks, catch me if you can,” Bryant wrote, according to court documents.
Bryant also pleaded guilty to multiple other charges, including attacking a detention officer while in jail awaiting trial, according to court filings. He received two life sentences for the other two killings, along with a combined 100 years for his other crimes.
Bryant’s attorneys are asking the state’s highest court to reconsider his death sentence, claiming his mother’s drinking while she was pregnant with him, combined with childhood sexual abuse by multiple male relatives, caused Bryant to have mental defects that led to the slayings.
Other courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, have declined to overturn his sentence for similar claims.
Until the court comes to a decision in that case, Bryant’s execution should be put on pause, his lawyers claimed in a filing asking for a stay.
The state’s response to those claims is due next week.
Intervention from a court or the governor is the only way Bryant, who has run out of normal appeals, can avoid the death chamber. Gov. Henry McMaster has not granted clemency since executions resumed.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/execution.jpg,,,2025-10-31 11:22:51.969101

Public data shows that Victory Field Operations has been paid throughout the cycle by the campaign of U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township) for ballot access work. Additionally, Mission Michigan, the issues-based political action committee supporting James, has paid the firm for political strategy consulting. 
Victory Field Operations is a Republican petition signature collection firm founded by consultant Meghan Reckling, chief of staff for state Sen. Lana Theis (R-Brighton), and Jeff Wiggins, the current press secretary and senior advisor to Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt’s legislative office.

Nesbitt is also running for governor, raising questions of whether Wiggins was playing both sides of an intraparty horserace for the top seat in Michigan government.
Other Republicans seeking the GOP nomination include former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox, Genesee County truck driver Anthony Hudson, former Michigan House Speaker Tom Leonard, pastor Ralph Rebandt and anti-property tax advocate Karla Wagner.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Mission Michigan was created in April to support James, and received a large $5 million contribution from Dan and Pamela DeVos, members of the prominent Republican DeVos family. The Detroit News’ editorial page editor, Kaitlyn Buss, wrote about the influx of cash from members of the DeVos family to Mission Michigan in May.
Michigan campaign finance reports show that the committee paid Victory Field Operations $40,000 for political strategy consulting, according to July and September filings.










It’s very unethical, and I would question his allegiance to either candidate.


– John Truscott, CEO of the Lansing-based bipartisan Truscott Rossman communications firm


The Michigan campaign finance reporting and disclosure interface has, by all accounts, struggled over the past year to accurately report filings due to an overhaul of the system, which has caused some backlash from the oversight arm of the state House of Representatives. Several instances have arisen where filings needed to be amended due to issues with the system.
Mission Michigan’s treasurer did not respond to two phone calls and messages requesting confirmation that it paid Victory Field Operations for strategy consulting.

James is viewed as a leading candidate for the office of governor on the Republican side, a campaign being waged against the better wishes of President Donald Trump and the leaders of the GOP majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Wiggins’ firm was founded in the wake of the 2022 petition signature scandal that sank the gubernatorial campaigns of several Republicans, preventing James Craig, Michael Brown, Donna Brandenburg, Perry Johnson and Michael Markey from ever reaching the ballot that year.
Massive signature fraud scandal upends Michigan GOP gubernatorial race

Victory Field Operations aims to cut out the third-party signature collection vendors, the type of which caused the 2022 debacle, and to ensure that quality Republican candidates can make it on the ballot. The outfit also prides itself on its in-house work ethic.
In an interview with Michigan Advance, Wiggins was asked if there had been a firewall built around his work with Victory and its work for James’ campaign given that his legislative staff position serves in an advisory role to Nesbitt.
“We ensure that all of our clients are comfortable with who they work with at our company,” Wiggins said. “And there are point people who work with specific clients, and so we do everything to make sure that our clients are comfortable with who their point person is at our company. If the candidates are comfortable, it’s whatever our clients are comfortable with.”
When asked more pointedly if he was the point person for James’ campaign with Victory Field Operations, Wiggins said he was not willing or able to discuss the inner workings of the company.
Asked if Nesbitt knew about the work he was doing on the side for James, or if he raised any concerns about him working for the campaign, Wiggins again said that he was not able to discuss client communications.

Two Lansing and Michigan political insiders who spoke with the Advance said the situation was a clear conflict of interest, even if it wasn’t illegal in terms of Michigan election law.
“It’s very unethical, and I would question his allegiance to either candidate,” said John Truscott, CEO of the Lansing-based bipartisan Truscott Rossman communications firm and an expert in public relations. “You can’t get paid a government salary working for one candidate, and get a campaign salary while being paid by another one. I don’t know anybody who thinks that would be OK.”
Truscott went on to say that the situation and others like it was “a symptom of the lack of ethics that seems to be creeping into every corner around Lansing these days.”
“I really thought that, looking at things like the prosecution of [former House Speaker] Rick Johnson and the prosecution of [former House Speaker] Lee Chatfield … would get people to tighten up and look at their conduct more carefully,” Truscott said. “But it appears things are getting even more loose, and that’s really unfortunate. It’s what drives the public to not have any faith in their elected leadership. If I were Aric Nesbitt or John James, I would fire him immediately.”
Jeff Timmer, formerly the executive director of the Michigan Republican Party, and now a principal of the political strategy firm Two Rivers Public Affairs, as well as a senior advisor to the Lincoln Project, said that it was certainly unethical, but the more interesting aspect, in his view, was that it was all happening out in the open.
“This is all transparently disclosed, so it’s not like you can be sneaking around behind your boss’s back,” Timmer said.
He also employed a sports analogy to describe the situation, noting that James hiring Nesbitt’s legislative senior advisor, and that Nesbitt would allow Wiggins to be hired by James, is akin to a coordinator for one football team building a game plan during the week and then showing up on the sideline of another team on game day.
Asked if that analogy still held water even though Wiggins wasn’t working on Nesbitt’s campaign, Timmer said he believed that it did.
“You don’t work both sides of the fight,” Timmer said.
In response, Wiggins said he considers Victory Field Operations as a vendor for ballot access, nothing more. Riffing off Timmer’s football analogy, Wiggins said the work, in his view, was more akin to making the pads and helmets for high-impact players.
“We make sure that the people that are trying to play the game are doing so as safely as possible,” he said.

The East Coast Migrant Head Start Project, aimed at providing early education for the children of migrant farmworkers, is set to temporarily lay off 258 employees across 12 North Carolina counties and suspend operations at nine child care centers in the state on Nov. 1, according to a filing with the NC Department of Commerce.
The Salisbury-Rowan Community Action Agency is also stopping all services at the end of October, including its Head Start programs as well as workforce development offerings. According to the program’s website, that will leave 408 children without care.
Head Start offers free, federally funded child care for children up to 5 years old with the aim of preparing them for school and helping them develop social skills, providing care to around 750,000 infants, toddlers, and children across the U.S.
Federal funding for Head Start programs is disbursed annually to local nonprofits at the start of each month. An estimated 140 nationwide were due to receive their year’s funding in October or November. Those programs provide child care to about 65,000 students across the country.
Gov. Josh Stein, joined by Lt. Gov. Rachel Hunt and State Superintendent Mo Green, wrote in an April letter to Congress that the Head Start program adds $290 million to North Carolina’s economy, creating thousands of  jobs.
Roughly 19,500 North Carolina children depend on Head Start for their early education and care, according to the governor’s office. Rural counties could be the hardest hit by the freeze, as many depend on Head Start funding for more than 20% of their child care slots.
Some nonprofits dependent on Head Start funds are already reeling from the loss of other federal dollars.
Earlier this month, Gaston Community Action, which operates Head Start programs in Gaston and Lincoln counties, furloughed employees who were funded by the Community Services Block Grant, as that program is also on hold. The organization wrote in a Facebook post that its Head Start programs remain unaffected for now.
The Wayne Action Group for Economic Solvency, which provides Head Start care for 812 children across five North Carolina counties, has also halted services funded by the Community Services Block Grant, and wrote in an update on Facebook that its Head Start offerings may be impacted starting Nov. 14.
“Research consistently shows that children who attend Head Start are more likely to graduate high school and enroll in and complete college and are less likely to be arrested, enter foster care, or experience poor health outcomes,” Stein wrote in the April letter. “Without Head Start, our most vulnerable children will suffer — with likely ripple effects on our education, child welfare, health, and criminal justice systems.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1367212888-2048x1365-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-31 11:22:51.969101

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine is ordering the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services to give $7 million to regional food banks and up to $18 million in emergency relief benefits to more than 63,000 low-income Ohioans. 
DeWine’s executive order requires ODJFS to allocate $7 million to regional food banks using Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) funds. The order also requires ODJFS to double the monthly benefit for the state’s 63,000 Ohio Works First recipients — which include more than 57,000 children. 
Ohio Works First provides assistance to low-income families with children — at or below 50% of the federal poverty level — using TANF funds.

Ohio Works First recipients will receive their usual monthly benefits on Saturday and will receive an additional weekly benefit equaling a quarter of their typical monthly allotment.  
“While we will always do everything we can to support Ohioans who need it most, this is not a viable, long-term solution,” DeWine said in a statement. “SNAP is a federal program that is specifically federally funded.”
About 1.4 million Ohioans receive SNAP benefits and the U.S. Department of Agriculture said federal food aid would not be issued Nov. 1 because of the government shutdown, which started on Oct. 1. 
Ohio’s average SNAP benefits are $190 a month, ODJFS Spokesperson Tom Betti said. Ohioans must have a net income at or below federal poverty guidelines —  $32,150 a year for a family of four — to qualify for SNAP. 
“Not every family is going to get additional funds, but we want to target specifically those families where we thought that they really desperately would need the money and would need the help,” DeWine said to reporters. 
Food banks across Ohio have said the need will be beyond what they can bear with SNAP benefits not being distributed. 
“Governor DeWine’s approach allows us to allocate funds using ordinary distribution channels – providing targeted support to families in greatest need, while also assisting food banks, which can reach people quickly and directly,” ODJFS Director Matt Damschroder said in a statement.
Ohio’s minority leaders in the House and the Senate expressed gratitude while also asking DeWine to do more.
“I am grateful that there will be some relief for those in need, but this executive order does not go nearly far enough to help,” said Ohio House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati. “We are on the tipping edge of a crisis and the governor needs to do more.”
“While we’re glad the governor has taken steps to protect Ohio families that are caught in the middle of political debates taking place in Washington, this is not nearly enough to make up for the potential gap in funding,” said Senate Democratic Leader Nickie J. Antonio, D-Lakewood.
Ohio Democratic lawmakers have been calling on DeWine to authorize funds during a lapse in federal food assistance. DeWine’s spokesperson Dan Tierney, however, says there is no mechanism for the state to directly fund Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program payments, “regardless of funding source.” 
“Ohio does not run the SNAP payment system,” Tierney said in an email. “We do not have access to that system to fund SNAP. Ohio’s role is to verify if beneficiaries are eligible for SNAP and to transmit that to the federal government.” 
Ohio Republican lawmakers are blaming U.S. Senate Democrats. Congressional Democrats have refused to sign on to a funding bill if Republicans don’t agree to extend subsidies to buy health insurance on marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act.
“The easiest and best way to help Ohioans in need of food assistance is for U.S. Senate Democrats to end its filibuster of SNAP benefits and other important federal programs and approve the clean continuing resolution passed by the U.S. House,” DeWine said in a statement.
Ohio Republican lawmakers also argue this needs to be solved at the federal level, not the state level. 
“Everyone’s heart is in the right place on this,” state Sen. Terry Johnson, R-McDermott, said during the most recent Senate Session. “If you want a solution to this, it’s at the federal level. It’s not at the state level.” 
State Rep. Latyna Humphrey, D-Columbus, introduced Ohio House Bill 502 which would make an appropriation through the Budget Stabilization Fund (also known as the “Rainy Day Fund”) to continue to fund SNAP and some other federal programs if there were to be a lapse in federal funding, but the bill has had no hearings.  
“Ohio families are truly going to be in crisis,” she said during a recent press conference. “We can’t stand by while families wonder how they’ll put food on the table.”
The Ohio Senate Democratic Caucus sent a letter to DeWine asking him to use the state’s $3.9 billion “Rainy Day Fund” as a way to continue funding SNAP benefits to Ohioans, saying funding SNAP benefits for one month would cost $263 million.
“The sole purpose of the Budget Stabilization Fund is to support a previously enacted budget if state revenue decreases in an economic downturn,” Tierney said in an email. “The fund may be accessed only if the Ohio General Assembly enacts legislation to do so.”
Several other states — including Republican-led Iowa, Louisiana, Nevada, South Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia — have also announced plans to help those who are losing SNAP benefits, according to NBC News. 
The Ohio House Democratic Caucus also sent a letter to DeWine asking him to declare a state of emergency and to work with lawmakers to make sure food banks have enough resources to feed people. 
Ohio Sen. Kent Smith, D-Euclid, offered up an amendment during the most recent Ohio Senate Session that would have allowed the use of the Ohio Budget Stabilization Fund to fully fund the SNAP program during a lapse in federal funding and allowed the state to ask for reimbursement from the federal government for those funds. 
“These (SNAP) funds are vital drivers for our local economy, generating commerce at our grocery stores and neighborhood markets,” Smith said. “Losing this spending power would inflict substantial harm, not only on families, but on small businesses and employees.” 
The amendment was voted down in a party-line vote. 
“I’m very sympathetic to the idea in this amendment that we do need to restore SNAP funding, but unfortunately, this is a very expensive endeavor,” said Ohio Sen. Bill Blessing, R-Colerain Twp.
Ohio Senate Republicans argued there’s no guarantee the state would get reimbursed from the federal government. 
“The potential damage to our budget as a result of this could be devastating,” said Ohio Sen. George Lang, R-West Chester.
Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, called the SNAP amendment “appalling.” 
“If Ohio and other states might follow in our footsteps of backfilling the federal government, all that does is encourage them to remain closed because we will backstop them whether or not we get reimbursed at some point,” he said. “… Do we want to encourage that human behavior?”
The longest government shutdown took place during Trump’s first term as president in 2019 and lasted 35 days.

And which state has a fancy for Almond Joy? And where's all the chocolate?,"Tonight, thousands of young ghouls and ghosts will hit the streets in search of the best sweets in their neighborhoods — but what candy do Connecticut kids (and their parents) enjoy most from these yearly hauls?
Starburst is the most popular candy in Connecticut and in the nation, topping the charts in a total of 13 states, according to a year-long study done by InnerBody analyzing Google Trends search data over the past year. Sour Patch Kids came in second place, taking the top spot in eight states.
Chocolate candy was much less popular across the nation, according to the study. Reese’s took the slot for top chocolate candy in the U.S.
Connecticut’s neighbor, Rhode Island, was the only state where Almond Joy came in first place.
Nationwide, spending on candy is expected to reach $3.9 billion this year, and Halloween costs are predicted to reach a record $13.1 billion, according to the National Retail Federation’s annual consumer survey. Candy and chewing gum prices have risen 9.8% from September 2024 to September 2025, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
This comes out to around $114 on overall Halloween spending per person, another spending record for the holiday, according to the survey.
As for costume attire, spending is also high, but the NRF survey found that 51% of consumers plan to dress in costume. The most popular kid costume is Spiderman, and the most popular adult costume is a witch.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/bMhGz-what-s-the-most-popular-halloween-candy-in-each-state--1024x844.png,,,2025-10-31 11:22:51.969101

(Amodei photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images; Trump and Lombardo photos by Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)One of the most surprising revelations of the SNAP saga is how powerless Republican leaders are. 
At least according to them.
When it was suggested last week that the state of Nevada should step in to deliver SNAP benefits if the federal government wasn’t going to, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo said it couldn’t be done because the Trump administration said so.
Lombardo was at least partly right. The Trump administration’s Department of Agriculture has declared states can’t pay Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Benefits.
Citing selected passages from federal legislation and regulations, the USDA had crafted a rationale not only for not paying SNAP benefits during a shutdown, which is unprecedented. Drawing on a precious reading of dainty rules, the USDA has also decreed that states can’t pay SNAP benefits in the federal government’s stead, or if states do, they won’t be compensated later.
As of Friday morning, USDA websites were continuing to post a blatantly political attack on Senate Democrats while invoking MAGA red meat tropes like “illegal aliens” and “gender mutilation procedures.” So a reasonable person might be excused for suspecting the agency’s order telling states they couldn’t pay for SNAP benefits is not a result of earnest and honest interpretation of the law, but of cherry-picking and misinterpreting it to play MAGA shutdown politics, the well-being of households be damned.
The USDA’s arguments flummoxed a federal judge Thursday, who struggled to get Trump administration lawyers to explain a coherent legal, regulatory, or budgetary justification for failing to put money on households’ SNAP EBT cards during the shutdown. (As this is written the judge has yet to rule on the request from 22 state attorneys general, including Nevada’s, to keep SNAP benefits coming.)
In declaring that he is powerless in the face of a memo from a federal agency, Lombardo is not alone. Governors in other states, heeding the Trump administration’s directives, have also determined they can’t fill the void and pay SNAP payments.
Some states, however, are preparing to deliver SNAP benefits directly to their residents’ EBT cards. Why Virginia’s Republican governor can create a program to do that but Nevada’s can’t is a question Lombardo hasn’t answered.
There may be perfectly good reasons; Virginia’s state government infrastructure is larger and more robust than Nevada’s, and Nevada may simply lack the administrative wherewithal to establish an EBT distribution system on the fly.
But whatever the scope of technical or administrative challenges beyond Lombardo’s control, there’s another fact that can’t be ignored: Republicans love to whine about “federal overreach” and “unelected bureaucrats in Washington.”
Lombardo’s no exception. He sends strident letters to the president complaining about all the red tape and regulations that are hindering federal land sales or hurting the economy. 
Or at least Lombardo sent strident letters when the president was Biden.
When the heavy hand of the federal government dictates policy to states, Republican governors don’t take it lying down. They challenge the offending policies, even in court. 
But Lombardo left that to Nevada’s attorney general, Democrat Aaron Ford.
Instead of blasting federal overreach from unelected Washington bureaucrats, Lombardo responded to the USDA’s memo meekly, saying “even if I called a special convening of the Legislature and the Legislature opted to appropriate temporary SNAP funding, the State would not be able to directly fund the program.” Because the Trump administration said so.
Rep. Mark Amodei, the only Nevada Republican in Congress, has similarly exhibited powerlessness in a crisis. Even though his party controls the White House, both houses of Congress, and the United States Supreme Court, there is simply nothing Republicans can do to prevent the end of SNAP benefits, according to Amodei.
“There is no mystery that, despite some commendable efforts from private individuals and the administration to delay the realities of government shutdowns, everyone knows when SNAP benefits run dry and programs start shutting down,” Amodei said in a (syntactically compromised) press release this week.
“Everyone knows,” congressman? 
SNAP benefits have not “run dry.” The reserve fund has $6 billion. And to reiterate, ending SNAP benefits is unprecedented during a government shutdown.
But Amodei’s right when he says “there is no mystery” about why SNAP benefits are scheduled to end Nov. 1.
 It’s the result of a choice made by the Trump administration.
Trump has spent the last nine months aggressively flaunting laws enacted by Congress, and gloating about it. He’s reduced Amodei and the Republicans who hold majorities in both houses of Congress to irrelevance, mere nodding bobblehead dolls.
But now Trump and his White House are claiming they are powerless to continue paying SNAP benefits during the shutdown. A man who is eager to defy and willing to shred the U.S. Constitution now asks everyone to believe he is constrained by some regulatory fine print — fine print that the administration itself fished out to willfully misinterpret.
“Republicans and Democrats have to work together” is a mantra being chanted from coast to coast, often accompanied by assigning blame to both sides.
But when it comes to the argument over providing food assistance to needy households, there’s a big difference between Democrats and Republicans.
Democrats have argued the USDA’s decision is wrong, and sued over it. They’ve pleaded with the Trump administration and the courts in an effort to see that SNAP benefits are not interrupted.
But the only thing Democrats have the power to do is unconditionally surrender to Republicans in the shutdown fight, and then hope that Trump and Republicans will graciously agree to negotiate with Democrats to shore up a health insurance program Republicans have spent the last 15 years vowing to repeal.
On the specific issue of continuing SNAP funding, Democrats are powerless.
Trump isn’t. He could assure benefits will continue to be distributed to EBT cards in Nevada and the nation with a single post on social media ordering USDA to make it so.
Democrats don’t have any power. Trump does. But instead of using it to help people, Trump’s wielding his power to deprive families of food, because he thinks hurting them will hurt Democrats. Republican officials in Nevada are going along with the fiction that the SNAP crisis is the result of Democratic defiance, while ignoring the fact that it is a deliberate choice sanctioned by their dear Republican leader.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Image-10-31-25-at-7.24 AM-1024x555.jpeg,,,2025-10-31 10:57:30.580980
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-31 14:48:58+00:00,CT Mirror,A moment that demands action from all of us,Kathy Taylor & Kristen Jacoby,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/31/a-moment-that-demands-action-from-all-of-us/,The loss of SNAP benefits will have immediate and devastating consequences for thousands of families struggling to put food on the table.,"Every day, as leaders of organizations deeply committed to the wellbeing of Connecticut residents, we witness the needs in our community in a deeply profound way.  Today, we write with urgent and grave concern about the pending cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Barring a deal in Congress that would end the federal government shutdown, SNAP, which helps roughly one in eight Americans buy groceries, will lose funding this Saturday, November 1.
In Connecticut, more than 10% of the state’s population rely on SNAP benefits to feed themselves, their families and their children.  Across our state, 58,000 families are expected to lose at least $25 per month in SNAP benefits, with these families experiencing an average monthly benefit loss of $194. These cuts will have immediate and devastating consequences for thousands of families who are already struggling to put food on the table. Waterbury is projected to see over 4,600 families losing monthly benefits. Yet, impacts will reach beyond urban areas. In Connecticut, families receiving SNAP assistance span every corner of our state, and every one of our 169 towns have families and our neighbors receiving food assistance. 
The Challenge Before Us
While we are grateful that Connecticut is stepping forward with $3 millionin emergency funding to CT Foodshare, we must be clear-eyed about the scope of this crisis. This emergency allocation represents just a fraction of the $72 million in monthly costs required to fully fund SNAP benefits in Connecticut. The math is sobering, and the gap between need and resources is staggering.
The People Impacted
These are not just statistics. Behind every SNAP benefit cut is a parent deciding whether to skip meals so their children can eat, a senior citizen stretching their medication budget to afford groceries, a working family forced to choose between paying rent and buying food, and a child going to school hungry – unable to focus on learning because they don’t know when their next meal will come.
Our food banks and emergency food providers are already operating at capacity. They cannot absorb this level of increased demand without significant community support.
A Call to Action
This is a moment that demands action from all of us. Here’s how you can help:
Donate to Your Local Food Bank – Financial contributions allow food banks to purchase nutritious food in bulk and respond quickly. Every dollar makes a difference, and every donation, whether $10, $100 or $10,000, helps feed a neighbor in need.
Organize a Food Drive – Rally your workplace, school, faith community, or neighborhood to collect non-perishable food items. Focus on nutritious, high-protein options like peanut butter, canned proteins, whole grain cereals, and canned vegetables and fruits.
Volunteer Your Time – Food banks need volunteers to sort donations, pack food boxes, and distribute meals. A few hours of your time can help feed dozens of families.
Advocate – Contact your elected representatives at the state and federal level. Let them know that food security is a priority for you and that all Connecticut families deserve to eat. Share your concerns on social media and in conversations with neighbors. Collective voices create change, and our elected officials need to hear that this issue matters to all of us.
Moving Forward Together
Food insecurity is not just a hunger issue – it’s a health issue, an education issue, an economic issue, and a moral issue. Our neighbors, our seniors, our veterans, our children – no one should go hungry in our state.  No one in Connecticut should have to choose between feeding their family, keeping a roof over their heads, or putting gas in the car to get to work.
The wise Ashleigh Brilliant, author and cartoonist, brilliantly reminded us that “Not being able to do everything is no excuse for not doing everything you can.” And while we work toward systemic solutions, there are things – big and small – that each of us can do to help our neighbor have a meal.
The need is immediate. The stakes are high. The time to act is now.
We urge every person, every business, and every organization in Connecticut to join us in this critical effort.

Some residents will be casting ballots that may have an impact on everything from the direction their communities take to who represents them. They will also weigh in on specific questions surrounding civil service reform and whether they should bother issuing public notices to local newspapers.
These are some of the questions up for a vote on ballots.
Bethel
Bethel, a town of slightly over 20,000, has the most revisions up for a vote in Fairfield County. Eight proposals will be voted on in Bethel this election season. Some of them include raising the threshold for referendums on capital expenditure and infrastructure projects which are not funded through user fees, grants, or loans, from at least $1 million and up, according to Republican Bethel First Selectman Dan Carter. Other changes include lengthening the board of selectmen’s terms from two to four years and including more inclusive gender pronouns when referring to people in the town charter.
Bridgeport
Voters in Connecticut’s largest city can now vote on reforming the city charter. Key proposals include ending the practice of electing city and town clerks. Instead, those roles would be switched to civil service positions, starting in 2031. The Bridgeport’s Sheriff’s Office would be eliminated, partly because according to the charter revision proposal, state marshals are able to perform the same roles and protect the city from potential lawsuits.
[Who’s on the ballot in Bridgeport? A 2025 election voters’ guide]
Other proposals include strengthening the Ethics Commission to include a municipal ethics office and adopt a code of ethics. Many Bridgeport officials have been accused of various legal and ethical transgressions over the years, including the 2023 mayoral Democratic primary, tainted by allegations of ballot fraud.
Fairfield
Fairfield residents are heading to the ballot box, and can vote on seven proposals. Voters will be asked to answer a question on the ballot that would revise the town charter by mandating any selectman filling a vacancy during the first 18 months of their term to stand for election to serve the remaining two years.
That change could impact future first selectmen finding themselves in a similar position to current First Selectman, Christine Vitale. Former Democratic First Selectman Bill Gerber, elected in 2023, died in office earlier this year, succeeded by Vitale, his running mate in a process many town Republicans claimed was not transparent. Vitale denied those claims, saying she followed the town charter. Vitale is expecting to face off against Republican State Sen. Tony Hwang in a future special election. They are not on the ballot this November.
Other changes include ceasing publishing notices in local newspapers unless required by state law, instead publishing them on the town’s site and allowing the town’s legislative body, the Representative Town Meeting, to vote on whether to retain lawyers.
Norwalk
Voters in Norwalk may end up revising their town charter for the first time in over a century. The city’s charter revision commission said the charter needed to be changed to reflect the rapid changes the city experienced over the last decades.
Some of those changes include renaming Norwalk’s legislative body from the Common Council to the City Council, tying councilmember compensation to a percentage of the mayor’s annual salary, and lengthening the mayor and city clerk’s terms from two to four years starting in 2029. City council positions would also be extended beginning in 2030.
The language of the charter could also be revised to make it more comprehensible for city residents.
Other key changes also include making it easier to introduce petitions and using a public applicant pool to fill city board and commission vacancies.
Trumbull
Trumbull residents have just one question up for a vote this year, but it’s a question that has inflamed local opinion and that’s whether or not Trumbull should fork over $27 million to build a new senior/community center that has been in the planning stages for years.
Supporters of a new center include the local Democratic Party including First Selectman Vicki Tesoro, who stated the benefits of a new structure and the value it would bring over time, noting the alternative, renovating the existing center, isn’t feasible due to its age.
Town Republicans who regained control of the town council two years ago said the original plan was too costly. They responded by proposing cost saving measures which resulted in a smaller design, although that process was also met with controversy.

In addition to the payout to 34-year-old Ramsey Kettle, the settlement calls for several policy changes in jail operations, including a new requirement that all correctional officers, regardless of rank, report any instance in which food or water is withheld as a disciplinary measure.
“While the court’s decision and this settlement cannot undo the unlawful torture Mr. Kettle endured, they have shone a light on Otter Tail County’s failure to respect the human rights of those in their custody,” Catherine Ahlin-Halverson, staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota, said in statement announcing the settlement.
The ACLU partnered with a pro bono lawyer from the firm Norton Rose Fulbright in bringing the suit.
Ahlin-Halverson said the settlement ensures that “the withholding of food and water as punishment ends here.”
Kettle’s ordeal began on February 9, 2024, just as he finished serving a 30-month sentence at the state prison in Rush City on a felony conviction for terroristic threats. Instead of being released, Kettle was arrested on new charges of aggravated witness tampering.
Several months later, those charges would be dismissed. Before that happened, Kettle was transferred for pre-trial detention to the Otter Tail County Jail, where he was immediately placed in “disciplinary segregation.”  
The rationale: Kettle had committed infractions during a prior stint in the jail, and so he would have to serve out the remainder of his sanction – a practice referred to as “rollover discipline.”
The following morning, Kettle asked officers to retrieve some personal paperwork. When he was provided with documents belonging to another inmate, he became agitated and smeared feces on the window of his cell door.
According to the lawsuit, as well as a separate investigation by the Minnesota Department of Corrections, Kettle was subsequently told by his jailers that he would not be given food or water until he cleaned the cell.
Over the following days, Kettle languished in squalor.
At one point, according to the lawsuit, Kettle was observed “licking the feces off the cell window” and told officers he was “hungry so I’m eating my own sh*t.”  The stench was bad enough that inmates were removed from adjacent cells, while the guards used vapor rub as a masking agent.
During the 52 hours that Kettle went without food or water, officers recorded more than 100 welfare checks, all of which reported him as “ok.”
A whistleblower at the jail eventually reported the episode, which triggered an investigation by the DOC. In the end, the agency temporarily stripped the jail of its certification to hold detainees for more than 72 hours; employees underwent additional training; and Sheriff Barry Fitzgibbons issued a public apology.
The lawsuit against Otter Tail County included claims for civil rights violations, negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress and violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act. In August, U.S. District Court Judge Katherine Menendez rejected the county’s motion to dismiss, paving the way for the settlement.
In addition to the cash payout, according to the ACLU, the county agreed to end its practice of rolling over disciplinary sanctions. 
It will also now require that correctional officers conduct “meaningful” welfare checks on detainees to look for signs of mental distress, ensure the person’s safety is not compromised by “biohazard material” and confirm they have access to water.
Kettle was released from the Otter Tail County Jail in April 2024 when the witness tampering charge was dismissed.
He is now incarcerated in the neighboring Becker County Jail on charges of felony assault and arson. In that case, he is accused of stabbing and biting a relative and setting a kitchen trash can on fire.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/barbed-wire.jpg,,,2025-10-31 10:57:30.580980

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-31 14:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,New Trump admin. rule bars loan relief for public service workers tied to ‘illegal’ activity,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/31/trump-education-department-public-service-loan-forgiveness/,New rules give the US Education Department expanded power to ban organizations from the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is forging ahead with plans to eject some nonprofits from a popular student loan forgiveness program if their work is deemed to have a “substantial illegal purpose” — a move that could cut off some teachers, doctors and other public workers from federal loan cancellation.
New rules finalized Thursday give the Education Department expanded power to ban organizations from the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. The Trump administration said it’s necessary to block taxpayer money from lawbreakers. Critics say it turns the program into a tool of political retribution.
Set to take effect in July, the policy is aimed primarily at organizations that work with immigrants and transgender youth.
It grants the education secretary power to exclude groups from the program if they engage in activities including the trafficking or “chemical castration” of children, illegal immigration and supporting terrorist organizations. “Chemical castration” is defined as using hormone therapy or drugs that delay puberty — gender-affirming care common for transgender children or teens.
It amounts to a major reworking of a program that has canceled loans for more than 1 million Americans and was created by Congress in 2007 to steer more college graduates into lower-paying public sector jobs. The Trump administration has yet to identify specific groups it intends to target, but it estimates fewer than 10 would be barred per year.
The program “was meant to support Americans who dedicate their careers to public service – not to subsidize organizations that violate the law, whether by harboring illegal immigrants or performing prohibited medical procedures that attempt to transition children away from their biological sex,” Education Undersecretary Nicholas Kent said in a statement.
The new rules are weaponizing loan forgiveness to make it harder for groups that work on issues like refugee and transgender rights, said Michael Lukens, executive director of the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights.
Lukens said many of the attorneys, social workers and paralegals who work at his organization on deportation defense and other immigration litigation count on public service loan forgiveness to take jobs that pay significantly less than the private sector.
“All of a sudden, that’s going away,” Lukens said. “The younger generation, I hope, will be able to wait this out for the next couple of years to see if it gets better, but if it doesn’t, we’re going to see a lot of people leave the field to go and work in a for-profit space.”
The program has rewarded a wide range of public service careers
The program promises to cancel federal student loans for government employees and many nonprofit workers after they have made 10 years of payments. It has long been open to government workers, teachers, firefighters and employees of public hospitals. Eligibility rules laid out by Congress focus mostly on nonprofits’ tax status and their field of work.
The benefit has gone to workers at organizations across the political spectrum. Yet in a March action demanding new limits, President Donald Trump said it has “misdirected tax dollars into activist organizations that not only fail to serve the public interest, but actually harm our national security and American values, sometimes through criminal means.”
A central concern of critics is the wide latitude the department is giving itself to determine if an organization’s work should be considered to have a “substantial illegal purpose.”
Employers across state and local government as well as nonprofits can be expelled from the program if a state or federal court rules against them, or if they agree to a legal settlement that includes admission of guilt. Performing gender-affirming care in the 27 states that outlaw it, for example, appears to be grounds for expulsion.
Even without a legal finding, the education secretary will be able to independently determine that an organization should be barred. The secretary would weigh whether the “preponderance of the evidence” leans against the employer.
The department dismissed concerns from many who said that bar is too low.
“It ensures decisions are grounded in fact, not speculation, and allows the Department to act promptly to protect both borrowers and taxpayers,” federal officials wrote.
Critics see an opening for decisions based on ideology
Among those opposing the proposal were prominent associations in higher education, health care and legal professions. In public comments submitted to the department, many called it an illegal overstep and said it would undermine an incentive that has helped address work shortages in high-demand fields.
The American Bar Association said it could decrease the ranks of public defenders and those in public interest law. Thousands of people will lose access to representation, the association said, “simply because those attorneys’ jobs were deemed politically unfavorable by the Secretary.”
The National Council of Nonprofits said the policy would allow future administrations from any political party to change eligibility rules “based on their own priorities or ideology.”
Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., chair of the House Education and Workforce Committee, said the overhaul will prevent taxpayers from covering loan relief for employees at “radical organizations that violate state and federal laws.”
Under the new rules, employers can only be sanctioned for activities that take place on or after July 1, 2026. Those barred from the program can reapply for eligibility after 10 years or rejoin sooner if they follow a “corrective action plan” approved by the secretary.
Documents from the department indicate that a single violation of the law may or may not be enough to get an employer barred, depending on the circumstances.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The U.S. Department of Energy of Wednesday closed on a nearly $1.6 billion loan to Indiana’s Wabash Valley Resources for a “clean” fertilizer facility in West Terre Haute — and the project’s carbon dioxide capture and storage system.
“For too long, America has been dependent on foreign sources of fertilizer,” U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a news release. “Under President (Donald) Trump’s leadership, we are changing that by putting America first, relying on American coal, American workers, and American innovation to power our farms and feed our families.”
Wabash Valley Resources intends to pipe and inject 1.67 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually a mile below the earth’s surface as part of its plan to produce “low-carbon-intensity” anhydrous ammonia fertilizer at a former coal gasification plant.

The gasifier will use coal and petroleum coke — an oil refining byproduct — as feedstock, according to a project summary.
The DOE’s loan was for $1.559 billion.
A panoply of political and business leaders celebrated the announcement, including Indiana Gov. Mike Braun.
“Wabash Valley Resources is putting America first — transforming an idle fossil energy plant into a fertilizer engine that strengthens our farmers, bolsters energy independence, and revitalizes coal country,” he said. “This is the kind of vision and leadership we need to compete globally.”
The company’s CEO, Dan Williams, called the project “more than an investment.”
“It’s a new chapter for a world-class facility and the community that built it,” he said. The project is “restoring good-paying jobs and proving that rural Indiana can help lead America’s clean energy future.”
Williams also praised organized labor, “whose skill and professionalism will bring this vision to life.”
But groups of Hoosier landowners and other opponents denounced the project as a “scam.”
“It is shameful that this administration would hand out $1.5 billion to a privately owned, Korean-backed corporation during a shutdown when everyday people can’t receive basic government services and government employees go unpaid. That is not the American way,” Janet Cianteo, a member of the Concerned Citizens Against Wabash Valley Resources and Indiana Action Team.
Korean firms Hanwha Asset Management and Korea Investment Real Asset Management have invested in Wabash Valley Resources, and the Korean government has also been involved, according to the company’s news release.
“This company and its foreign partners will be hard pressed to ever have majority support in our community,” Cianteo said. “We are steadfast in our commitment to protecting Hoosier land and lives from this dangerous scheme.”

The Indiana Action Team is part of the Nebraska-based Bold Alliance, best known for its opposition to the Keystone XL oil pipeline extension.
“It is disgraceful that this project is being foisted on Hoosiers with the backing of our government and our public money,” said Emma Schmit, the Bold Alliance’s pipeline fighters director. “Enough is enough. We should not have to sacrifice our property rights or take on the risks of a proven-to-fail technology so Wabash Valley Resources’ investors can afford another private island.”
The groups observed the loan was initiated under former President Joe Biden’s administration but frozen under Trump’s, and the project description no longer boasts of the undertaking’s carbon dioxide sequestration components.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued permits early last year allowing Wabash Valley Resources to construct wells. The EPA in August found the injection and monitoring wells would have “no significant impact” on the environment.

As the then-new CEO of the Full Employment Council of Kansas City, he needed to get a handle on the technology on his desk.
“I had to learn how to do this stuff — work the computer,” McQueen told The Beacon via Zoom. “I had to go back to training, as a CEO, at a community college on my own. … Now I can do it.”
McQueen said he had to continually learn new technology just to stay up to date with the ever-evolving workforce. Today’s workers, he said, also need constant learning and skill refinement as they see the disruptive rise in generative artificial intelligence models like ChatGPT.
“You’ve gotta keep your skills up to compete in the market,” McQueen said. “You can’t use the same oil in your car for a year — you’ve got to change the oil to not wear your pistons out. We’ve all got to update and change.”
In Kansas City and beyond, AI is transforming work with a combination of automation and augmentation. Automation is when an AI can fully complete a task, and AI augmentation is when a human and AI work in tandem.
Jobs have started disappearing in information services, professional and business services, and office and administrative support sectors as automation and AI-assisted work have increased productivity, reducing the need for workers. Meanwhile new, but so far fewer, positions emerge in AI development and data center construction and maintenance.
“This is not a maybe, sometime, Star Trek prediction,” Miles Bassett, founder of Prairie Code AI, told the 2025 Kansas Economic Outlook Conference recently. “The AI revolution is happening right now.”
AI represents an exponential change to the workforce beyond jobs lost to automation or increases in productivity. The very nature of work — the tasks that fill our days — is being rewritten in real time, and workers will need to adapt.
“If we fumble this (AI implementation) and AI doesn’t take your job directly, someone using AI will,” Bassett said.
 AI disruption has started

More than 40,000 workers in Kansas City work in the 10 largest occupations most susceptible to AI automation, according to a recent analysis from Jasmine Escalera at MyPerfectResume. The career expert used data from Microsoft’s Working with AI study and cross-referenced it with occupational and employment wage statistics in the Kansas City area to reach that conclusion.
The analysis found customer service representatives to be the most vulnerable to AI in Kansas City. There are 23,750 customer service workers in the area, and 44% of their daily tasks could potentially be automated.
Escalera told The Beacon that doesn’t necessarily mean that 44% of customer service workers will lose their jobs. People will still be needed for escalated customer service issues. But she wasn’t surprised to see customer service representatives as the most vulnerable vocation since automated systems have been used by many companies for years now.
“One of my biggest irritations in life is trying to get to a customer service rep and never speaking to an actual human,” Escalera said. “We’ve been seeing the slow evolution and change of the customer service space, and we will be seeing continued impact there.”
Escalera’s analysis also found that white-collar service jobs are vulnerable to AI. Roughly 17,000 Kansas City workers like financial advisers, management analysts, public relations specialists and web developers all have at least 35% of their tasks that are potentially automatable.
The University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School found that nationwide 42% of current jobs are potentially exposed to AI and that based on real-world generative AI applications, companies could expect a labor cost savings of roughly 25% from gains in efficiency.

That means that as companies see productivity increase as AI is implemented, they will require fewer workers to achieve the same results. Employers will then decide to cut employees or change their current employees’ job duties.
“There cannot be a customer service worker that comes in and all you do is answer the phone,” McQueen said. “That’s done.”
Bekah Selby-Leach, director of the Center for Economic Development and Business Research at Wichita State University, told the Kansas economic conference that the uncertainty surrounding AI — paired with inflation, tariffs and other concerns —  has many businesses in “wait and see” mode over hiring for the next year.
“We’re in a period of high uncertainty,” Selby-Leach said. “Change is happening, whether we want it to or not.”
Selby-Leach noted that statewide, Kansas is expected to see employment decline for financial service workers, information service workers and business and professional services workers in the next few years due to automation and AI. Those sectors of white-collar service workers have already seen thousands of jobs lost in the Kansas City area in the last year, according to the most recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Early indications are that young people trying to start their careers are bearing the burden of the initial wave of AI’s workforce transformation.
An August report from the Stanford Digital Economy Lab showed that since widespread adoption of generative AI in 2022 there has been a drop in entry-level white-collar service jobs. Those aged 22 to 25 in the most AI-exposed occupations saw a 13% decline in employment. This was while the report found that jobs numbers overall have grown during the same time period.
The study also found that employment remained steady for those who work in jobs whose tasks are augmented by AI rather than automated by AI.
“AI will be more of a complement to workers versus a substitute,” McQueen said. “If you are static, then you might get replaced, not because of AI, but because you haven’t upgraded your skill set.”

He said employers should also adapt, including by training their employees on new skills.
 Opportunity in AI transformation

McQueen and others say that alongside the change AI brings is opportunity. McQueen points to the Full Employment Council, which recently completed a staffing search for a Northland data center.
“They are offering jobs to like 75 to 100 people,” said McQueen. “Those jobs are paying like $23 an hour, so they’re not cheap jobs.”
Data centers are springing up all over the country to house the hardware needed to power and process the large data sets needed for generative AI. Despite environmental concerns, companies have invested $40 billion in the U.S. on new data center construction between June 2024 and June 2025, according to Reuters.
Mychal Shaw, founder of Uwazi.ai, a Kansas City-based startup that looks to use AI to promote civic engagement, said that there will be short-term challenges as AI implementation scales up, but that those challenges will ultimately be worth it.
“I think we are in the Industrial Revolution phase,” Shaw said. “AI is going to be the biggest disrupter in a positive way.”
Shaw said that the change AI represents is bigger than the implementation of the internet, email and smartphones combined. He said AI has grown exponentially and will continue to as AI large language models can be used to produce even more specifically targeted large language models.
That big of a change is naturally scary, Shaw said, but AI can be used to upskill yourself. He said he taught himself to code during the pandemic but has used AI tools to advance his skills and to help build his startup.
“The fun thing about AI is the opportunity to advance your mindset, your skill set, those things, those (tools) will all be available to you,” Shaw said. “They’re a lot more accessible now than they were even just five years ago. I say that particularly to minority communities who historically have not had that available. AI is a tool that allows you to catch up.”
Bassett said that AI can also level the playing field between larger and smaller companies.
“AI acts as the great equalizer,” Bassett said. “It allows a five-person team in Manhattan, Kansas, to compete with a 500-person team in Manhattan, New York.”
Mark Esposito, professor of economics and strategy at both Hult International Business School and Harvard University, told the Kansas economic conference that over the next 50 years the economy will see a shift in value from labor production to learning systems like AI.
“The future economy will be built on algorithms, not assembly lines,” Esposito said. “AI as a new factor of production is really the new horizon of competitiveness.”
 How to adapt as a worker

For Kansas City workers currently in jobs that are exposed to AI automation, Escalera said to focus on increasing skills in aspects of your job that can’t be automated. That could eventually mean a pivot in job titles like moving from a customer service representative to a customer experience specialist who strategizes how to increase customer satisfaction and loyalty.
Bassett and Shaw said white-collar workers may have no choice but to adopt the use of AI.
“I think it takes a conscious investment, especially in the white-collar space, to educate yourself on utilizing AI properly, because it can actually maximize your productivity,” Shaw said. “That makes you, in a way, unfireable.”
Bassett says that AI can’t replace strategy, vision, taste, relationship building or emotional intelligence — among many other innately human qualities — and that honing those skills will give you a leg up. He advocates for adopting AI use over time, familiarizing yourself with models incrementally, to rid yourself of repetitive “busy work.”
“Become a director, not a doer,” Bassett said. “If your day is all task work, you’re just doing AI’s job of tomorrow. In a couple of years AI is going to be doing 99% of that to-do list and doing it better than you.”
McQueen said that no matter your field you must continue to grow and hone your skills to remain competitive. If you work in a field that uses AI — the Full Employment Council also connects people to jobs that are largely unaffected by AI, like the trades — you’ll need to adapt or risk being left behind.
“AI means a market adjustment in terms of your skills and the job that you perform,” McQueen said. “You’ve got to plan for the market to adjust. It’s not going to be the same.”

(Kansas Reflector screen capture of Kansas Legislature video)TOPEKA — The first audit under expanded powers from the Kansas inspector general’s office identified more than a dozen problems within organizations providing health care through Kansas’ Medicaid program.
The audit is just the beginning of a campaign to weed out fraud and inefficiencies within social welfare programs, following the 2025 Legislature’s approval of broadening the office’s authority to encompass oversight of cash, food and health assistance.
Steven Anderson, the state inspector general, presented 17 findings with accompanying recommendations based on hospital complaints about delays, discrepancies and a potential conflict of interest. He spoke to the Senate Committee on Government Efficiency at an Oct. 21 hearing. 
The audit analyzed hospital complaints from 2023 to determine whether organizations prolonged reviews, manipulated patient statuses and lacked consistency in determining post-visit levels of care. The audit also identified a potential conflict of interest within United Healthcare, one of three managed care organizations that have offered services under KanCare, as Medicaid is known in Kansas.
The inspector general’s office, which is housed within the Kansas Attorney General’s Office, interviewed staff at six Kansas hospitals, representatives from the three KanCare managed care organizations at the time of the report, staff from the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, and representatives from the Kansas Hospital Association. KDHE agreed with most, but not all, of the audit’s recommendations.
The audit found that managed care organizations refused to reimburse claims that involved returns to a hospital within 30 days of the initial visit, even if the visits were unrelated.
The hospitals typically eat those costs, Anderson said.
“It’s probably incalculable how much money is lost through all this,” said Sen. Mike Thompson, a Shawnee Republican.
The percentage of denied claims for hospital services across the organizations averaged 6% in 2023. However, the value of hospital service claim denials makes up a disproportionate amount of all denials.
One organization denied $1.8 billion in claims in 2023. Hospital claim denials made up 70%, or $1.3 billion, of those denials. Another denied $1.02 billion in claims, and hospital denials accounted for 69%, or $707 million. The third organization denied $1.8 billion in claims, and hospital denials accounted for 62% or $1.1 million.
Anderson said the amounts have grown larger every year.
“The reality is, if I’m going to deny claims, I’m going to look for the higher-dollar ones,” he said. “We can draw some conclusions, maybe, that they were approving the smaller-dollar ones, but the big money ones were oftentimes denied.”
The audit also found that United Healthcare used its proprietary health care criteria and billing system to judge its own claims.
“So they own the process from front to back,” Anderson said.
He said the organization “controls so much of the narrative,” and United Healthcare’s use of a system owned by one of its subsidiaries “looks bad on the surface.”
However, he acknowledged his office cannot prove United Healthcare uses its system inappropriately. KDHE said in a response in the audit that state Medicaid programs must follow certain conflict of interest provisions, “but to date, United acquiring billing and other health care companies and continuing to use those products is not a conflict per the current standards.”
The tools were used by all three contracted organizations at the time, KDHE said. Trying to restrict United Healthcare’s use of the systems and allowing other organizations to continue would create “additional dynamics.”
“These tools are widely used and accepted by healthcare providers across the nation to make medical decisions and validate claims,” KDHE said.
Anderson said his office, the managed care organizations and KDHE are scheduling a meeting to discuss the audit’s findings.
“I’m thrilled to hear that,” said Sen. Renee Erickson, a Wichita Republican and chairwoman of the committee.
The best solution, she said, is to get stakeholders together to sort out their differences.
“I always say, if you want the Legislature to do it, no one’s going to be happy with that fix,” she said, “so I’d rather the entities get together and work it out.”
Ultimately, the audit poses the question of whether the state’s contracts reflect what Kansans need, Erickson said.
Upcoming audits span government assistance programs, according to Anderson. One examines data sharing between the state agencies that oversee KanCare and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to verify eligibility for those programs based on comparing residency, household composition and income reporting. Anderson promoted another audit that will look at what he called the pregnant women program to identify whether those accessing it qualify.
The state facilitates the Special Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program for Women, Infants and Children, often called WIC, which would fall under Anderson’s purview.
He said his office also plans to release audits of Kansas’ waiver programs, which assist elderly and disabled Kansans through Medicaid, and the pharmaceutical drug program, which is also operated through Medicaid.
Sen. Michael Murphy, a Republican from Sylvia in Reno County, commended Anderson’s work.
“I’m a simple guy,” Murphy said, “and I think when you find you have a hole in the fence, you shouldn’t be surprised when the cows get out.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/251021_anderson-1024x597.jpeg,,,2025-10-31 09:57:26.093244

Mike Braun this week puts in motion a statewide task force that aims to make Indiana a national leader in drone research, manufacturing and security technology.
The new “Indiana Initiative for Drone Dominance Task Force” will coordinate work across government, universities and private industry to support federal efforts to strengthen U.S. leadership in drone technology and airspace security.

“Indiana has always stepped up to use our skills and labor to support America’s defense,” Braun said in a statement announcing the order. “Indiana’s advanced manufacturing capacity and our concentration of defense and research assets make us uniquely suited to lead in America’s pursuit of drone dominance, and this new Task Force will position Indiana as a national asset and drive innovation in this important sector.”
Braun developed the executive order in collaboration with Republican U.S. Sen. Todd Young, who serves on the Senate Commerce Committee and has worked on drone policy at the federal level.
“Drones are increasingly critical to our economy and national security, and as a leading manufacturing state, Indiana is positioned to help unleash American drone dominance,” Young said in a statement.
“Over the past several months, my team has worked hand in hand with Governor Braun’s team on developing this executive order,” he continued. “Governor Braun has been a great partner on this issue, and I look forward to continuing to work with the Governor and Hoosier stakeholders to support the President’s executive order and empower the U.S. drone industry.”

The task force will draw on the state’s “robust advanced manufacturing industry, expertise from NSWC Crane, restricted airspace over assets like Camp Atterbury and Muscatatuck Urban Training Center, strong policy framework, and universities with established programs to further drone research and development,” according to Braun’s office.
Priorities include developing a cross-sector aerial test corridor linking those sites; expanding public safety uses of unmanned aircraft during major events; strengthening Indiana’s drone-manufacturing supply chain; and supporting workforce training programs with colleges and universities.
Federal officials said the North American drone market is estimated to reach $59 billion by 2030.
The task force must deliver its strategic plan and recommendations to the governor by July 31, 2026.

(Photo by Linda Shaw/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries Service)When a young Sealaska intern walking a beach in July 2022 found the first evidence of European green crab presence in Alaska – a discarded shell on a beach on Annette Island in the state’s far southeast corner – it was an ominous sign about the invasive species’ northward spread.
Since then, the Metlakatla Indian Community, the tribe based on Annette Island, and its partners, which include Alaska Sea Grant, have found not just more shells, but live invasive crabs. Discoveries numbered just a handful at first, then dozens, then hundreds, then thousands.
This year, the Metlakatla tribe’s team has trapped more than 40,000 of them on and around Annette Island, a representative said.
“This year we’ve had a complete explosion of green crab — over seven new locations on Annette Island we found green crab, and eight new locations off Annette Island,” said Nicole Reynolds, an environmental specialist working with the tribe, in a presentation at a three-day Anchorage meeting on invasive species in Alaska this week.
The more than 40,000 crabs removed this year compares to last year’s total of 1,800, Reynolds said.
European green crabs are small, usually measuring no more than 4 inches wide, but they  are powerful forces of destruction. They mow down eelgrass beds that are vital habitat for salmon and other native species. And they gobble up native marine life like juvenile salmon, clams, mussels and juvenile Dungeness and other crabs that are important to commercial and subsistence harvests.
“They’ll eat the baby crabs. They’re meaner and tougher than the Dungeness,” Reynolds said during a break in the annual Alaska Invasive Species Partnership Workshop.
European green crabs have already spread north of Annette Island. Last year, they were found at Gravina Island, and this summer they were found by participants in a local university class at beaches in Ketchikan that lie about 30 miles north of the initial Annette Island discovery site.
Just this month, they were found at Etolin Island, Reynolds said. Etolin Island is roughly 60 miles northwest of the city of Ketchikan, making it the northernmost North America discovery to date.
And now European green crabs appear to be entrenched in Alaska waters for good, Reynolds and Genelle Winter, a grant administrator with the tribal government, told the workshop audience.
That means the fight against green crabs will also have to be long-term, Winter said, with a permanent staff and a strategy of what is known as “functional eradication.” That is an eradication strategy that accepts the reality of the invaders’ presence in some places, but tries to keep them out of other places with resources that are most important to protect.

	Such a strategy involves “focusing all our efforts on protecting the most vital subsistence and commercial resources,” she said.
Conditions in Alaska waters, the farthest-north spots in North America where the crabs have spread, do not faze the invaders, DNA analysis shows. For that information, the tribe consulted with an expert, Carolyn Tepolt of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. Tepolt has also been investigating the genetics of green crabs that have invaded Washington state.
Tepolt’s analysis found that the green crabs in Alaska are a genetic blend of those in Washington and British Columbia, diverse enough to persist in the more northern waters, Reynolds said.
“She even called it a ‘super-crab’ just because of how perfectly genetically suited it is for the environment in Southeast Alaska,” Reynolds said.
European green crabs have been altering North American marine ecosystems for a long time.
They were first found in East Coast waters in the early 1800s, likely carried there in ship ballast water. The first West Coast discovery was in 1989 in San Francisco Bay. Since then, they have been spreading north up the Pacific coast. They were first confirmed in British Columbia in 1999 and continued moving up that Canadian province’s coast before being found at Annette Island three years ago.
Beyond the accidental releases through ballast water, scientists say warming conditions are aiding the spread of green crabs. Larvae are more likely to survive in warmer waters brought on by climate change and weather events like El Nino cycles.
The 2023-2024 El Nino, which warmed Alaska waters, is a possible factor in this year’s explosion of green crabs in Southeast Alaska, the Metlakatla tribal representatives said.
Warmer temperatures than those that used to be normal in Alaska marine waters are known to encourage green crab proliferation.
A study by Danish scienetists that was published in September identifies a temperature range that appears ideal for the crabs. At temperatures of 12.5 to 16.6 degrees Celsius, or 54.5 to 61.9 degrees Fahrenheit, European green crab abundance peaked, the scientists found.
Average temperatures in Southcentral Alaska’s Cook Inlet were within that range this August, an indication that conditions would be suitable for green crabs if they somehow reach that area.

	Preparations are already underway in Alaska for what experts believe is an inevitable spread north from the Southeast region.
In Southcentral Alaska’s Kachemak Bay, over 700 miles northwest of Ketchikan, residents this summer deployed over 60 traps in what was effectively a pre-invasion drill. The program was a cooperative effort of the Kachemak Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, the Seldovia Village Tribe and its council member, Michael Opheim, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
There and elsewhere, a big part of the fight against green crab infestations is public education.
European green crabs can be identified by the array of bumps on their shells. They have five sharp spikes on either side of their eyes and three lobes in between their eyes. Despite their name, they are not always green – they can be red, yellow or mottled. Some of those found by her team have even been blue, Reynolds said.
To help boost awareness, local Tsimshian artist Elizabeth Anderson has designed a green crab logo – with an angry face to reinforce the message that the species is a bad actor, Winter said.
In Metlakatla, awareness appears to be keen already, including among some of the youngest residents.
“The other day, the mayor was driving down the street and got flagged down by two little kids. And they said, ‘We found some green crab! We know its green crab because it’s 5-3-5,’” Winter said during the workshop presentation. The numbers reference the array of shell bumps on a green crab. “Those little kids absolutely knew how to identify the European green crab.”
Those crabs, found at a beach right in front of town, were stashed in a plastic bag and added to this year’s count, Winter said.
Aside from identifying, trapping, counting, measuring and analyzing the European green crabs, the inundated community faces another challenge: what to do with thousands of unwanted invaders.

Delaware Court of Chancery Delivers Opinion on Split-Rate Property Taxes
WILMINGTON, Del. — The Delaware Court of Chancery has delivered its opinion regarding the Delaware General Assembly’s controversial move to permit split-rate property taxes, upholding the legislature’s authority to enact the law. The ruling marks a significant moment in Delaware’s ongoing debate over property taxation and its impact on residents and local governments.
In a decision released Thursday, Vice Chancellor Jane Smith wrote that the General Assembly acted within its constitutional powers when passing legislation that allows municipalities to set different tax rates for land and for buildings. The split-rate system, proponents argue, encourages development by lowering taxes on improvements while maintaining or increasing rates on land, thereby discouraging speculation and blight.
“The General Assembly possesses broad discretion in matters of taxation, so long as it does not violate constitutional guarantees of equal protection and fairness,” Smith stated in the court’s opinion. “The split-rate property tax law falls within these bounds, offering municipalities a flexible approach to local fiscal policy.”
Opponents of the law, including a coalition of property owners and advocacy groups, had challenged the measure, claiming it unfairly burdens landholders and could lead to unpredictable changes in tax bills. The court, however, found that the legislature had conducted sufficient study and public hearings before enacting the law, and that the split-rate structure does not constitute unlawful discrimination.
A Lose-Lose Proposition for Residents
The judgment is being viewed by many as a “lose-lose” proposition for county residents. If the court had ruled with the plaintiffs, taxes on homeowners would have increased, as rates reverted back to the original reassessment values prior to the General Assembly’s actions on September 12 and subsequent interventions by the school boards. However, since the judge ruled against the plaintiffs, the revised tax structure will disproportionately affect corporately-owned rental properties, leading to higher rents for many low-income families. As a result, the financial strain on renters could be significant, amplifying concerns about housing affordability in New Castle County.
As a result of the decision, New Castle County is freed to issue revised property tax invoices to all county property owners.  At this time, the bills remain due on November 30, 2025.
Legislators Call on New Castle County to Repeat the Property Reassessment Process
In the wake of today’s Delaware Chancery Court decision upholding a proposed two-tier system of property taxation, two Delaware State Representatives are calling for New Castle County to repeat its property reassessment process, maintaining the previous evaluations and tax rates in the interim.
State Reps. Kevin Hensley (Townsend, Odessa, Port Penn) and Mike Smith (R-Pike Creek Valley) say the best path forward is for New Castle County to take a “mulligan” and repeat the process. Both legislators sit on the House Special Property Reassessment Committee and have been taking part in a joint investigation of the county’s flawed outcome.
“Regardless of whether we have a one-tier or two-tier system of tax rates is kind of beside the point,” Rep. Hensley said. “The property valuations on which those taxes are based are badly flawed. For instance, at the first committee meeting, we learned that there was no differentiation between preserved farmland and farmland not in the preservation program, even though there is a huge difference between the two.”
Rep. Smith agreed that New Castle County residents have no trust in what’s been produced. “Even under the standards used by Tyler Technologies, we know that many commercial properties were severely undervalued. Some properties vanished during the process or had major components that were left unassessed. Even if we have an extended and thorough appeals process, that would only potentially correct overvalued assets. No one who owns undervalued properties will be appealing those decisions. Leaving the owners of commercial properties to pay less than their fair share means homeowners will collectively pay more. No one should find that acceptable.”
State House Minority Whip Jeff Spiegelman (R-Townsend, Smyrna, Clayton), who works in the commercial real estate industry, echoed the thoughts of his caucus members. “Taxation, like any government institution, is based on public faith. I’ve seen some of the commercial property valuations produced by this process and, even having insight into the market that most people lack, I can’t make the numbers work. The fact the legislature took the extraordinary step of meeting in a special session and is now conducting a joint probe of what went wrong emphasizes what we all already know: The public has no confidence that the reassessment was done well or fairly.”
All three legislators note the county’s 2024 reassessment resulted from the settlement of a 2020 lawsuit filed by a coalition of groups. The plaintiffs successfully claimed that the lack of contemporary valuations had created disparities in public education funding. Prior to the legal action, New Castle County last conducted an assessment in 1983. Delaware’s other two counties, which were also sued and entered into separate settlements, had also not reassessed in decades.
“This reassessment was only done to address the unequal property tax burdens placed on homeowners and business owners,” Rep. Hensley said. “I would argue that the county’s latest efforts have done nothing to correct the situation. It’s just produced a different pattern of inequities.”
Rep. Smith said there is only one acceptable remedy. “We need to toss the most recent reassessment, continue the investigation, learn from the mistakes that were made, observe the best practices employed by Kent and Sussex counties, and redo this thing. In the meantime, use the old valuations and tax rates.”
Both Reps. Hensley and Smith said they would work across the aisle with other members of the House and Senate Special Property Reassessment Committees to make their proposal a reality, including the potential for the state to finance a portion of the work.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/6374e3fe79e83.image_.jpg,,,2025-10-31 09:16:31.385728

As millions of low-income Californians — most of whom are children and senior citizens — brace for the absence of federal food benefits starting Saturday, local officials, schools and organizations are scrambling to provide support for their communities.
More than 5.5 million Californians depend on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as CalFresh in the state, for food. California issues about $1.1 billion in CalFresh benefits every month, but due to the federal government shutdown — soon entering its second month — benefits for November have been delayed. 
In San Francisco, Mayor Daniel Lurie on Wednesday said the city will cover food benefits through the month of November for its nearly 112,000 CalFresh residents. Some of the money comes from a $400-million reserve set up by San Francisco lawmakers to cover possible cuts from federal and state governments, according to KQED.
Staff at California K-12 schools and colleges are also stocking up food pantries and connecting students with local food resources, reports EdSource. San Jose State University, for example, is urging students specifically affected by CalFresh delays to request assistance, and Chico State is offering free meals for food stamp recipients.
Some restaurants in the Bay Area and Los Angeles County are also offering free food to children and seniors, including bowls of pho in Oakland and shelf-stable snacks in Lynwood. 
Meanwhile, food banks — already stretched thin since the pandemic and affected by federal and state funding cuts — are preparing for the surge in demand. In Shasta County, nearly one in five residents are on food stamps. The county’s food bank is ordering more food through funds the state set aside to support food banks, reports Shasta Scout. But concerns of being overwhelmed remain.
At the state level, Gov. Gavin Newsom deployed the California National Guard and allocated $80 million to assist food banks. California is also suing President Donald Trump’s administration to use emergency funds to cover food benefits.

Who’s spending the most on Prop. 50?

All three of the campaign committees on Proposition 50 — one Yes on Prop. 50, and two No on Prop. 50 — are pouring millions of dollars for their causes, with the Yes campaign outspending and outraising its opponents. But groups not directly affiliated with these campaigns are also pouring big bucks, known as independent expenditures, to influence voters.
As CalMatters’ Jeremia Kimelman explains, anybody can advocate their position on a California ballot measure as long as they follow certain rules, including registering with a state committee, and not coordinating with the primary campaigns.
Entities such as nonprofits, political parties and independent billionaires have reported spending nearly $26 million as of Oct. 30 to pay for ads, mailers and canvassers to promote their stances on the redistricting measure. 
The largest spenders outside Prop. 50’s campaigns are billionaire Democrat Tom Steyer, who reported more than $12.8 million in expenditures, as well as the California Republican Party, which reported more than $10.2 million.
More than two dozen county parties and current and former elected officials have also reported spending more than $1 million in total for Prop. 50. Assemblymember Carl DeMaio, a San Diego Republican, spent more than $430,000 from his Reform California committee to oppose Prop. 50 because he didn’t “trust the failed consultants of these mega-committees.”

DeMaio: “My intuition was correct. The ads were horsesh–t, off message.”

OpenAI wants to change things up

Artificial intelligence company OpenAI said Tuesday that it plans to restructure as both a nonprofit foundation and a for-profit company after it received approval from California Attorney General Rob Bonta. But concerns remain that the move could set a precedent for the company and others to misuse certain tax benefits, report CalMatters’ Khari Johnson and Levi Sumagaysay.
Originally launched as a nonprofit in 2015, the California-based creator of ChatGPT moved forward with plans last year to set up a for-profit public benefit corporation. The shift would remove certain barriers for raising money, as well as conflict-of-interest issues between its nonprofit and for-profit arms.
Bonta opened an investigation into the restructuring to ensure the company abided with its original stated mission, which was to make artificial intelligence that benefits humanity. He ultimately gave the proposal his blessing on Monday.
But critics say the reorg could allow OpenAI to reap the benefits of charitable tax exemptions, and that even though its nonprofit arm is nominally in control of the for-profit entity, the for-profit company could end up pulling the strings.

In a ruling issued Oct. 23, Circuit Judge Cotton Walker said administrative law judges, who work in the Division of Workers’ Compensation and hear disputes over claims, are not entitled to any more job or pay protections than any other state employee.
The decision means former state Rep. Gina Mitten of Richmond Heights, who was appointed as an administrative law judge in 2021 and fired in May 2024, will not get her job back. And Ryan Asbridge, appointed in 2019 but on active duty with the Air Force since 2021, will receive only three weeks of pay each year while away from his state duties.
Mitten and Asbridge filed the lawsuit in August 2024. Andy Hirth, the attorney for Mitten and Asbridge, said they will appeal the decision.
“We basically think that the courts found in favor of the state contrary to the plain language of Missouri statutes,” Hirth said.
In the lawsuit, Mitten argued that state law is clear that administrative law judges can only be discharged or removed if three of five members on a review committee vote no confidence after two successive performance audits two years apart.
Walker disagreed, pointing to another state law that states employees of the executive branch “may be discharged for no reason or any reason not prohibited by law.”
The law for biennial performance reviews, Walker said, “does not limit the executive branch’s appointing authority by prohibiting the unilateral termination of employment of an ALJ with or without cause.”
Around the same time division Director Pamela Lewis fired Mitten, she informed Asbridge that the department would no longer pay his entire salary of approximately $120,000 a year while he was deployed with the Air Force. Asbridge had received approximately $335,000 in pay while away from his state duties.
Asbridge received no other payments after he received a new deployment in June 2024 until after Oct. 1, 2024, the start of the federal fiscal year, when the state paid him salary for three weeks.
In the lawsuit, Asbridge argued that because his salary is set by statute, the state must pay him regardless of hours worked. The lawsuit cited an attorney general’s opinion from 1998. 
Walker, however, ruled that Asbridge’s pay status is governed by a law that allows 120 hours of pay for employees and officers of the state on leave to perform active duty with the National Guard or other armed forces.
“Asbridge is entitled to 120 hours, or three weeks’ pay, per federal fiscal year during his
leave of absence for military duties,” Walker wrote. The department “could pay him more, up to his full salary, but the law does not require this of (the department).”
Mitten, a Democrat, was a member of the Missouri House from 2013 to 2021. She is seeking nomination for the state Senate in the 4th District in 2026.
Mitten could not be reached for comment.
Asbridge, who is listed among the 26 administrative law judges, remains on active duty and has received orders extending his service to at least August 2025, Hirth said.
The decision, if it stands, has implications for every executive branch employee, he said.
“The language of that ruling is so broad,” Hirth said, “that if that is right, then the governor of Missouri can fire any employee from any commission including the Missouri Ethics Commission, Administrative Hearing Commission or anywhere.”

Re: “Protecting Jewish students or chilling speech? Inside California’s ‘hardest’ fight over antisemitism”
When Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 715 into law on the solemn second anniversary of the deadliest attack against Jews since the Holocaust, California declared that every child deserves to feel safe in our schools.
For years, Jewish students in California have shared painful stories: slurs shouted in hallways, swastikas drawn on desks, lessons that distort Jewish history. These aren’t isolated incidents. Antisemitic acts in California schools have surged 623% in the last decade, according to the ADL. 
AB 715 creates the nation’s first statewide antisemitism prevention coordinator, a position dedicated to helping schools respond to incidents, train educators, track data and recommend future reforms. It also requires swift responses when bias occurs and promotes inclusive learning environments so that all students can learn without fear. 
None of this should be controversial. The bill ultimately passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. 
This victory was years in the making. Assemblymembers Rick Chavez Zbur and Dawn Addis worked closely with the Jewish, Black , Latino and AAPI caucuses — backed by the largest coalition of Jewish organizations ever assembled for Capitol legislation. After three different bills, countless amendments and feedback from education leaders, civil-rights advocates and legislators of every background, the north star for this two-year effort was protecting students.
The tenacity of this coalition was tested at every turn. The state’s largest teachers’ union ultimately opposed the bill for “prioritizing one form of discrimination over others,” yet education union leaders refused to answer basic questions about whether antisemitism was a problem in schools.
Despite these challenges, California passed a law that affirms both academic freedom and equal protection, ensuring classroom discussion remains open while discrimination is not tolerated. It sends a statement to Jewish families that the state stands by them.
Now comes the next phase: ensuring this law fulfills its promise. Training must be substantive, not perfunctory. Reporting must be transparent. Accountability must be real.

(Photo by Susan Tebben/Ohio Capital Journal)A new map was introduced Thursday at the second meeting of the Ohio Redistricting Commission, one that leaders say was a compromise between the Democrats and Republicans on the commission.
A vote could happen at the meeting scheduled for Friday morning, though commission members did not indicate whether or not they had a unanimous vote as of Thursday.
“This is the process working,” said State Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, also the co-chair of the commission.
“There are pros and cons to all different aspects of this process, but I think those legislators did what the constitution envisions, which is accept those pros and cons and come to an agreement.”
The newest map would create a state with 12 Republican-leaning districts and three Democratic-leaning districts, increasing the Republican districts in the state from the current 10-5 map.
The commission has until Oct. 31 to approve a bipartisan map, or the process goes back to the Ohio General Assembly.
The districts that would change most significantly under the new map would be those of Democratic congress members, including U.S. Reps. Marcy Kaptur, Greg Landsman and Emilia Sykes.
Landsman’s 1st district would lean Republican with a 54% to 47% breakdown. Kaptur’s 9th district would lean Republican with a 54.5% to 45.5% Republican to Democrat ratio.
Sykes’ 13th district would lean Democratic, 52% to 48% Republican, according to data provided by the commission.
The biggest gap is in the 4th district, held by Republican U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan, which breaks down to 72% Republican and 29% Democratic. The Democrats see a 78% advantage in the 11th district, held currently by Democratic U.S. Rep. Shontel Brown.
Minority Leader Nickie Antonio led most of the meeting, which was punctuated by complaints from the crowd and one person who was escorted out by security.
Antonio would not say which way she was planning to vote on the map, but emphasized the flaws in the redistricting system.
“We have a broken system of redistricting, I think that bears out in the testimony we heard today as well,” Antonio said after the meeting. “It was not what the voters expected when in 2018 we voted to end gerrymandering.”
Antonio said the process is down to the “11th hour” in that system.
“This system that we have, in the long-run, is probably going to be need to be fixed again, but today, we have to look at the best way to go forward with our congressional maps because we are required to do that,” she said.

Gov. Mike DeWine told reporters Thursday that he supported the map as presented, noting he got a look at the map early Wednesday. He said it was a welcome compromise between the two sides.
“The goal here was to get maps and get Democrats on board with the map, it would appear that that’s going to happen,” DeWine said.
DeWine didn’t attend Thursday’s meeting, but met with reporters in the hallway as the meeting went on to discuss action on SNAP funding and redistricting.
“What Republicans will get out of this is a sure map, that will be done, both sides get that,” DeWine said. “These are all negotiations and in negotiations no one gets what they want.”
The commission has now met twice since reconvening last week, with the first meeting covering consideration for the legislative Democrats’ map proposal. That proposal would have split the state into eight Republican-leaning districts and seven Democratic-leaning districts. The Democrats said this map was based on voting trends for the last 10 years in the state.
Republicans on both the Joint Committee on Congressional Redistricting, which met in September, and the commission dismissed the map as an unfair gerrymander, and questioned the use of the election results as a measure for what the partisan breakdown of the state should be.
Stewart presented the newest map to the commission on Thursday, saying the proposal “complies with ‘one person, one vote,’” as 13 districts have the same population, and the other two districts are only off by one individual in each district.

Members of the public who came to speak at the commission hearing on Thursday continued a familiar complaint throughout the renewed redistricting process, shaming Republicans for not showing up with a map earlier than October, and further decrying the process as a closed-door, unaccountable method of redrawing the districts that establish the members of Congress who will represent Ohioans on Capitol Hill.
Some shed tears, expressing anger and frustration and calling the process “just one big sham.”
“We are gathered here again, with less than 48 hours before this commission is expected to have produced something more than political theater,” said Dayton resident Zachary Gibbs. “And yet, the drama continues.”
Even self-identified Republican Paul Miller, who has spent his testimony in previous redistricting hearings over the years highly criticizing Democrats, had notes about the map.
“In the past we’ve had the ‘snake on the lake,’ and you’ve turned it into an elephant,” Miller said. “…The map is crap, that’s all.”
Jen Miller of the League of Women Voters of Ohio said the actions of the commission make clear “the politicians on the Ohio Redistricting Commission don’t care about voters or good government.”
“The public was shut out, the process rigged and incumbents favored,” Miller said in a statement. “The resulting congressional map still doesn’t reflect the will of the voters of Ohio.”
Stewart had previously said he saw no point in bringing forth a map without assurances that it would have bipartisan support, which is why the Republicans hadn’t released a map until now.
The Thursday meeting announcement came almost exactly 24 hours before the meeting was to be held, and the GOP map wasn’t released to the public until Thursday’s hearing.
Another meeting is scheduled for Friday morning, the same day as the deadline the state constitution gives the commission to adopt a bipartisan map.
Maps can be challenged through the Ohio Supreme Court after they’re passed, and there is talk of a possible referendum to once again challenge the redistricting process in the state. If a map is passed by the commission, a referendum can’t be attempted.
If no agreement comes from the commission, the map comes back to the Ohio General Assembly, where the Republican supermajority would have an easier time passing a map because it’s only required to obtain a simple majority.
But passage by the General Assembly would open up the map for potential referendum, to keep the current map in place for now.

Chesteen said in an interview Thursday that he is not worried about constitutional challenges, despite the Fourteenth Amendment guaranteeing equal protection to all citizens, naturalized and native-born.
“The language in the bill speaks for what it’s trying to accomplish,” Chesteen said. “I don’t want to make this anything more complicated than it is.”
According to the American Immigration Council, about 77,300 Alabama residents were naturalized citizens in 2023, about 1.5% of the state’s population. 
The amendment came from Secretary of State Wes Allen, Chesteen said. Currently, the only office that requires a candidate to be a natural-born citizen is President of the United States. Allen said in a release Monday that the requirement should apply to state government officials.
“For the same reasons our founding fathers sought to ensure that our nation’s leader was a natural born American citizen, we believe the same standard must be required of those operating in the highest levels of our state government,” Allen said. 
Currently, Alabama law requires the governor and lieutenant governor to be U.S. citizens for 10 years; the secretary of state, treasurer, and commissioner of agriculture for seven years; and state lawmakers for three years, according to the bill. Other constitutional offices do not have a specified length of citizenship requirement.
No state requires all constitutional office holders to be natural born citizens. Chesteen wants Alabama to be the first.
“I don’t think it’s ever been challenged before. There’s a first time for everything,” Chesteen said. “We’ll try to move the bill through the legislative process. If it’s challenged, it’s challenged.”
Until a repeal in 1955, Maine required its governor to be a natural born citizen. It was amended to require U.S. citizenship for 15 years.
Only one immigrant has served as Alabama governor. Robert Lindsey, who was born in Scotland and came to the United States when he was 20, served as governor from 1870 to 1872.
While nobody is entitled to a right to hold office, every citizen has the right to run for office under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, according to a University of Pennsylvania law review. 
The review quoted a 1969 U.S. Supreme Court case that originated in New York, 1969 Kramer v. Union Free School District No. 15.
“Statutes granting the franchise to residents on a selective basis always pose the danger of denying some citizens any effective voice in the governmental affairs which substantially affect their lives,” the opinion said. “Therefore, if a challenged state statute grants the right to vote to some bona fide residents of requisite age and citizenship and denies the franchise to others, the Court must determine whether the exclusions are necessary to promote a compelling state interest.”
Pam Karlan, a professor of law at Stanford Law School, said in an interview Thursday that beyond the unconstitutionality of the proposal, there is a question of what a natural born citizen is. People born in Indian tribes are considered citizens at birth since a law passed in 1924, she said, as well as children born outside the country to parents who are U.S. citizens.
“As a matter of morality and policy, this is a truly evil proposal, because some of some of our most distinguished citizens over time have been people who were immigrants to the United States,” Karlan said. “This idea that even if the people of Alabama think that one of these people who’s an immigrant would be the best governor or be the best state legislator, they’re prevented from voting for this person by this law that says, well, because you weren’t born here, your citizenship is not good enough. It’s really kind of staggering.”
She said that regardless of what type of citizenship somebody has, they are protected equally under the Fourteenth Amendment and seen as citizens of the U.S.
“I don’t see the constitutional argument for why it is okay to treat these groups differently,” Karlan said. “On top of that, I don’t see any normative argument for why you would want to treat them differently, other than, to my mind, nativism. That is really quite inconsistent with American values.”
If 60% of both houses of the Legislature approves the bill, it must get a majority approval from voters to be added to the Alabama Constitution. Currently, the Republican party holds 71% of the Legislature in both chambers. Chesteen said he has talked with the Republican caucus and the members are supportive of the bill. 
“It could be a challenge working the bill through both sides of the aisle, but we’ll get to work on it in session,” he said. 
The 2026 Legislative session begins in January.
Chesteen said he has concerns about naturalized citizens in other states running for office, but did not specify who or which offices. He said he is not aware of any such candidate in Alabama.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DSC02190-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-31 08:16:31.620504
,California,2025-10-31 12:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Even California’s iconic industries are cutting back in this sluggish economy,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/10/california-sluggish-economy-cutbacks/,Technology companies and Hollywood corporations are laying off thousands. The only job growth is in government and healthcare.,"As Gov. Gavin Newsom ramps up what appears to be a 2028 White House bid, a mainstay of his pitch during television interviews and social media appearances is California’s economy.
As Newsom tells it, the state’s $4-trillion-plus annual economic output is not only the fourth largest in the world, were it a nation, but it’s a model of entrepreneurial vigor and programs  advancing equity.
Were it only true.
A year ago, the Legislature’s budget analyst, Gabe Petek, indirectly blew the whistle on Newsom’s braggadocio.
“California’s economy has been in an extended slowdown for the better part of two years, characterized by a soft labor market and weak consumer spending,” Petek wrote while outlining the state’s deficit-ridden budget dilemma.
“While this slowdown has been gradual and the severity milder than a recession, a look at recent economic data paints a picture of a sluggish economy. Outside of government and health care, the state has added no jobs in a year and a half.”
Nothing has changed since then. Employment has been stuck at virtually the same level for a couple of years. At 5.5%, California’s unemployment rate is the highest of any state, with more than a million workers lacking jobs.
Meanwhile, the state has been overspending its revenues, creating what budget experts call a “structural deficit,” meaning spending programs locked into law are greater than the reliable income to fund them.
California really can’t afford those compassionate services Newsom boasts about creating. He and the Legislature, amid great fanfare, extended state-paid medical care to undocumented immigrants, only to be forced to roll it back after costs turned out to be double their estimate.
It should be noted that what Petek saw a year ago, and remains fundamentally true today, pre-dates Donald Trump’s becoming president, so blaming him, which Newsom attempted earlier this year, is groundless.
One of the most troubling aspects of California’s wheel-spinning economy is the turmoil in two revered sectors, high technology in the San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California’s movie and television production industry.
Silicon Valley has been shedding jobs for the past several years as it shifts emphasis to artificial intelligence. This weeks’ announcement that Amazon is cutting 14,000 jobs  — and may eventually double that number as it focuses on AI — was a jolt.
Not all of those cuts are in California, of course, but the online seller has been heavily involved in California, operating multiple warehouses.
 “We expect to continue hiring in key strategic areas while also finding additional places we can remove layers, increase ownership, and realize efficiency gains,” Beth Galetti, Amazon’s senior vice president of people experience, said in a memo to employees.
Meanwhile, the Paramount production conglomerate, a mainstay of the Southern California entertainment industry for decades, also announced payroll cuts as new owners took over.
Paramount on Wednesday began cutting about 1,000 employees, the initial cohort of what could be much deeper cuts. David Ellison, Paramount’s new boss, said the reduction is aimed at “building a strong foundation for the future.”
The layoffs hit not only Paramount’s movie production, but also staff at its CBS television subsidiary, MTV and Comedy Central. The Los Angeles Times reported that another 1,000 jobs are expected to be cut later, bringing the total reduction to about 10% of Paramount’s workforce.
Movie and TV production in Southern California has been declining for years as companies have coped with high costs and been lured to other states or nations with lower costs and subsidies. Another iconic movie company, Warner Bros. Discovery, is currently for sale.
Despite California’s budget woes, Newsom and the Legislature increased state tax credits — in effect, cash subsidies — for in-state TV and movie productions to $750 million this year. But the hemorrhage has continued.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/022024-Amazon-Warehouse-REUTERS-SH-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-31 08:16:31.620504

Tim Walz’s announcement of a pause in payments for 14 Medicaid programs in Minnesota caused widespread confusion and anxiety among the people who provide services to the elderly and disabled. The Walz administration announced Wednesday that the governor ordered a “pause on all payments for 14 DHS Medicaid services until (an) audit is complete.” […],"Gov. Tim Walz speaks after the end of the special session in June Tuesday, June 10, 2025 at the Minnesota State Capitol. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Gov. Tim Walz’s announcement of a pause in payments for 14 Medicaid programs in Minnesota caused widespread confusion and anxiety among the people who provide services to the elderly and disabled.
The Walz administration announced Wednesday that the governor ordered a “pause on all payments for 14 DHS Medicaid services until (an) audit is complete.”
Providers and Democratic legislators reacted with alarm given the prospect of unpaid caregivers and vulnerable Minnesotans shut out of lifesaving services. DHS clarified that each payment will undergo a review and only be paused — for up to 90 days — “if an anomaly is detected and needs to be reviewed further. If the review determines the bill is fraudulent, it will not be paid.” It’s not clear how long the review will take.
DHS told providers hours after the governor’s announcement via email that “DHS is not holding all submitted claims for these 14 Medicaid services for 90 days.” (In bold.) The snafu comes as Walz seeks to get ahead of the fraudsters who have bilked state and federal programs out of hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years — as well as Republican attacks on the fraud issue, which are already incoming as he begins a race for a third, four-year term.
Rep. Tina Liebling, DFL-Rochester, said lawmakers encouraged the administration to clear up any confusion. “We were very clear with (the administration) that they needed to correct that misinformation” about the payment pause, she said. “I know they didn’t intend that, but it scared a lot of people. A lot of us when we saw that were startled, and providers were too.”
State Rep. Mohamud Noor, DFL-Minneapolis, the top Democrat on the House Human Services Finance and Policy Committee, said that he’s been receiving calls from providers who are concerned their payments will be paused, but he expects payments will be timely: “Most of the claims — any clean claims — should be paid on time,” he said.
A DHS statement to providers on Wednesday stated that there still may be “payment processing delays as we roll out this new prepayment review process,” but the payments pause is not as all-encompassing as providers feared from the press release.
Optum, the third-party auditor contracted by DHS, did not immediately respond to questions regarding the auditing process and how long payments will be delayed for claims that are not flagged. The health care company, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, is familiar with investigations — along with UnitedHealth’s insurance arm, Optum’s pharmacy benefit manager is being investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice for possibly illegal business practices, according to Bloomberg.
The Association of Residential Resources in Minnesota, which represents disability service providers, said in an earlier release that a pause in all payments could cause people with disabilities to lose their housing and critical services, care workers to go without paychecks and providers to shutter.
Sue Schettle, the CEO of ARRM, said on Thursday that she was previously under the false impression, from Walz’s press release, that the pause would be “sweeping; that all providers that were providing those services would be affected by it.”
Now, after a day of fielding questions from worried providers, Schettle has questions of her own.
“The words that were put in the press release really did cause a lot of confusion, concern and aches for providers,” Schettle said. “What was the intent behind putting it out so poorly?”
Providers also said that they got no heads up about the new review process prior to the public press release.
Had the governor’s office consulted their organization or any other provider, Schettle said, “We would have been able to give them five questions to say, hey, you’re missing this or that.”
The governor’s office defended the language of the press release.
“The press release accurately conveys that all providers will be subject to an audit before payments are made,” said Claire Lancaster, a spokesperson for Walz’s office.
In the meantime, nonprofits that provide critical support for Minnesota’s elderly and disabled residents are worried about the consequences of what they thought was a more sweeping pause in payments.
John Estrem, CEO of Hammer, a nonprofit that provides housing and support services to people with disabilities, said a 90-day pause on payments from the integrated community supports program could impact around $2.2 million in funding. The vast majority of that money goes towards salaries for the workers who help their clients live independently, Estrem said.
But Hammer operates on thin margins, and even smaller disruptions in payments could force the nonprofit to borrow money to cover workers’ paychecks, Estrem said.
Shannon Bock, the executive director of CCRI, another support services nonprofit, also said that it was her understanding that all payments for the 14 programs will be paused for up to 90 days, which would mean “shutting down lines of support for so many people in our state.”
Social service providers are already confronting a hostile budget environment at both the state and federal level. This year, Walz and lawmakers were tasked with making budget cuts to account for a projected deficit in coming years. Walz’s budget proposal suggested cutting payment rates for disability service providers. (The final budget bill passed by lawmakers cuts nursing home funding instead.)
That move also blindsided disability service providers, Estrem said.
“So this seems to be a pattern,” he said. “And it really is hard to do, to run a service organization, when things are coming at you out of the blue.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NN250609_0562-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-31 08:16:31.620504

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah and six other states along the Colorado River are pushing up against a deadline to figure out as a group how to manage the river and its reservoirs. 
If they can’t reach an agreement by Nov. 11, the federal government is set to intervene and make its own plan. The existing agreement expires at the end of next year. 
“There’s still hope,” Marc Stilson, principal engineer for the Colorado River Authority of Utah, said Thursday. “They’re working hard, and they’re close.” 
The upstream Upper Basin states — Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Wyoming — and the Lower Basin states of Nevada, Arizona and California pitched competing plans to the federal government last year. 
As November deadline nears, Colorado River states ‘nowhere close to an agreement’

Now, in the home stretch of negotiations, the seven states are working through questions including which reservoirs would be managed under the new agreement, how they’ll measure water use and whether the plan will include mandatory cuts to water allocations, Stilson said. 
The Upper Basin states have resisted the idea of mandatory cuts in dry years, saying they typically use much less than their yearly allocation. 
Lower Basin states have said all seven should share water cuts during dry years under the new plan, warning if they don’t, downstream states could face cuts that aren’t feasible for them to absorb, the Nevada Current reported. 
The river provides water to 40 million people across the U.S. and Mexico, and contributes 27 percent of Utah’s water supply. Hotter temperatures tied to climate change have mixed with drought and overuse to reduce its flow. 
Utah isn’t waiting to prepare for potentially significant changes to how it manages water, said Michael Drake, deputy state engineer with the Utah Division of Water rights. 
It’s been investing in expanding its use of tools to better measure and monitor water use since 2023, Drake told reporters Thursday. 
That year, the Legislature poured $1 million into a Colorado River measurement infrastructure project and approved $650,000 in annual funding to monitor water use, according to the division. 
Whether the state ends up facing cuts as part of the new plan or just working toward new targets, Drake said, it sees a need “to be able to manage water better, and you can’t regulate what you can’t measure.”
“As we get close here, I think reality is starting to hit and so we want to put out the messaging, you know, we can do this,” Drake told Utah News Dispatch. 
He noted the possibility of forced cuts is troubling to many of the state’s farmers. 
“What we’re going to be asking people to do is to see water running in a stream, and to not take it, to leave it there,” Drake said. “It’s a hard pill to swallow.”
Scott Thayn, who farms alfalfa and the grain sorghum in unincorporated Carbon County, agreed.
“If something happens with this new treaty and they drop it 10, 15, 20%,” Thayn said, “most of the years we’re going to be hurting.”

By contrast, food banks have to get food into their warehouses, then back out their doors to distribution spots where the food is given out. (Photo: Aramelle Wheeler/Food Bank of Northern.)Food banks are vowing to do everything they can to keep people fed as federally funded “food stamps” are withheld from the 1 in 6 Nevadans approved for them. But they warned state lawmakers Thursday they will not be able to fill the gap of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as SNAP.
Lawmakers this week approved nearly $40 million in assistance to local food banks, which are expected to see a 25% surge in demand because the Trump administration has declared it will not issue November SNAP benefits while the federal government shutdown continues.
Beth Martino, the president and CEO of Three Square in Southern Nevada, told state lawmakers on the Interim Finance Committee that the food banks will be moving “as quickly as possible” to get food into the community. But she offered a sober warning.
“This is not enough to meet the need, and there’s probably no way that philanthropy can fill this gap,” she said. “The answer is to reopen the government and run these programs as intended.”
SNAP is “highly efficient,” Martino said. It loads benefits onto electronic benefit transfer (EBT) cards that individuals and families can use on their own schedules.
By contrast, food banks have to get food into their warehouses, then back out their doors to distribution spots where they are given out.
“That takes time,” Martino said. “It’s not as efficient, and that’s one of the challenges that we’ll face. I would expect that this investment today will take us 10 to 12 weeks to move back into the community, at minimum.”
Even if lawmakers were to give $90 million to the food banks overnight, it would be a logistical challenge, said Martino. 
“No dollar amount would allow us to be out in the next two weeks serving 90 million pounds of food to Nevadans,” she said.
Seniors and families, who make up the majority of SNAP recipients, would find themselves waiting for hours in a car line to get a box of food.
“We always try to serve people with dignity,” she added.
Demand already on the rise
Three Square has already recorded a 16% increase in the number of people coming into its food pantries, according to Martino. That increase does not include the month of October.
“But I can tell you anecdotally that we have certainly seen an increase above and beyond that,” she said.
Three Square has done special distribution sides for federal workers who’ve been impacted by the federal government shutdown, which started Oct. 1 and is now on day 31.
“And we’ve been contacted by several of our partners to say that they needed more food, that they were actually running out of food at distributions because we were sending at the levels we had been over the last four months and that was not adequate to meet the needs that had been coming in,” said Martino.
Three Square estimates that 25% to 35% of the SNAP recipients who don’t receive their approved benefits next week will seek out a food pantry.
“We would need to almost double our distribution in order to meet that need,” said Martino.
Shane Piccinini of the Food Bank of Northern Nevada told lawmakers their pantries have not seen a significant increase since July.
“However, I do want to put on the record that we have been serving 160,000 people a month in that period,” he said. “So, the need has not been low.”
Pre-pandemic the food bank’s visitation hovered around 98,000, he added.
Piccinini said the Food Bank of Northern Nevada anticipates a 25% increase in November. That equates to an additional 40,000 people.
In preparation, the food banks have already started purchasing foods, with a focus on nonperishable items because nobody knows how long the shutdown will continue. Families may need to be able to stretch what they get as long as they can.
Typically, perishable items like proteins, fruits, vegetables and dairy items make up 60% of what Three Square distributes, according to Martino.
Nevada National Guard to assist
As part of the state’s “food insecurity plan” to bolster the food banks, Gov. Joe Lombardo committed to deploying the Nevada National Guard to assist at food banks.
Assemblymember Daniele Monroe-Moreno said situations like this are “exactly what the National Guard is designed to do” but she worries the weaponization of the guard by the Trump administration might result in some people not feeling safe standing in a food pantry line.
Nicole Lamboley, president and CEO of the Food Bank of  Northern Nevada, said they plan to use the National Guard for warehouse and logistics operations, rather than having them hand out food to people. For distribution, they plan to use community volunteers.
Lamboley and Martino said the community has stepped up to volunteer. Lamboley said that after the food bank put out a call for volunteers they “were at wait-list level” within 24 hours.
Martino added that some business owners have called and offered up all of their employees for volunteering.
Still, both food banks welcomed additional members of the public to sign up as volunteers.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/PXL_20250305_172257574.PORTRAIT-large-1024x771.jpg,,,2025-10-31 08:56:45.877924

As election day approaches, nonprofits, political parties and a billionaire have spent nearly $26 million on ads and other communications in an effort to convince voters to support or oppose Prop. 50 – the most of any ballot measure in recent state history.


Voters in Sacramento got a mailer in recent weeks declaring that “California’s landmark election reform — under attack by Sacramento politicians.” Orinda residents have received flyers that shout “Fight back against Trump — Vote Yes.” The narrator on a video ad shared on X intones, “Two wrongs don’t make a right — Vote No.” These are among a barrage of advertisements, yard signs and billboards bombarding Californians with direction to support or oppose redrawing the state’s congressional districts four years ahead of schedule.
But none of it was paid for by the major campaigns advocating for and against Proposition 50, the ballot measure put forth by Gov. Gavin Newsom to counter Republican redistricting efforts in Texas. Instead, nonprofits, political parties and a billionaire have financed an independent effort as election day approaches Tuesday.
Groups not directly affiliated with any Prop. 50 campaign have reported spending nearly $26 million to influence voters as of October 30, more than any ballot measure in California history, according to a CalMatters analysis of secretary of state campaign finance data. The spending does not include the $118 million reportedly spent by the three major campaign committees.

Anybody can buy ads, pay canvassers, or otherwise promote their position on a California ballot measure as long as they register a state committee, disclose major funders in the ads themselves and don’t coordinate with the primary campaigns. Once they’ve spent at least $1,000, they must report their spending to the secretary of state as independent expenditures.
Independent spending for the redistricting measure is significantly more than the previous record-setting Prop. 32 in 2012, which drew $10.8 million in similar spending and would have restricted campaign contributions from labor unions if it passed.
The largest spenders outside of the major campaigns this time are billionaire Democrat Tom Steyer, who reported more than $12.8 million in expenditures and the California Republican Party, which poured more than $10.2 million into ads and messaging opposing the measure. As a result, Steyer and the state GOP have become the second- and third-largest independent ad buyers in state history. The only group to have spent more was run by former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s “California Dream Team,” which reported spending a combined $27.8 million on multiple ballot measures in 2004 and 2005.
In yet another example of how the campaign has drawn national attention, Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC, gave $8 million to the state GOP in October, which they used to buy nearly $2.9 million worth of digital ads two weeks ago; the super PAC also gave $5 million directly to one of the major campaigns against Prop. 50 — “Stop the Sacramento Power Grab.” 
Some large nonprofit organizations are spending money on Prop. 50, too. The largest expenditures come from the California Community Foundation, which reported spending $800,000 to support the proposition, although that doesn’t capture all of the money the nonprofit is putting into the election.
Miguel Santana, president and CEO, said that the foundation is additionally spending more than a million dollars to convince voters to participate in the election without telling them specifically how to vote, though efforts to increase turnout without taking a position are not reported to the secretary of state.
“California representation at the federal level matters,” Santana said. “Our power is being diluted by the gerrymandering that is taking place in other parts of the country.”
Not just Democrats and Republicans
Other political parties and groups in the state have also reported independent expenditures for Prop. 50. The left-leaning California Working Families Party reported spending more than $36,500 on digital ads and outreach to reach voters who might be less receptive to Newsom as a messenger.
“This isn’t the fight we wanted, but I think it’s important that California, the most populous state in the country, fights back,” said Jane Kim, California Director of the Working Families Party. “We really want to hit younger voters who are less party loyalists.”
The Libertarian Party of California spent more than $6,400 for postcard mailers opposing the proposition. Loren Dean, chairman of the state party, said the outreach was an opportunity to raise the party’s profile. “It is important to us to take every opportunity to remind people that the ‘two-party’ choice is a fiction built by would-be monopolists who yearn for authority over their neighbors,” Dean said. “Third-party voices matter.”
Though not a registered political party, the California Democratic Socialists of America reported spending more than $3,500 to try to persuade voters to vote yes while maintaining distance from Gov. Newsom.
“We are not doing this to support him,” said William Prince, co-chair of the organization. “We must ally with him in the struggle against fascism.”
Similarly to the Libertarian Party, the DSA also sees value in putting out campaign materials stamped with “Democratic Socialists of America.” 
“When voters think about who encouraged them to vote against a permanent MAGA majority in Congress, more are going to think of [California] DSA than they would have if we sat this out,” Prince said.
Elected officials and local parties hit their districts
More than two dozen county parties, along with current and former elected officials, have reported more than $1 million in independent expenditures for and against Prop. 50.
The Sonoma County Democratic Party reported spending nearly $90,000 on postcards, phonebanking and radio ads to support the initiative, while the Yuba County Republican Party reported almost $55,000 to spread opposition signs around Northern California.
Pat Sebo, chairperson of the Sonoma County Democratic Party, said the county party spent money on its own mailers and canvassing because it wanted to move faster than its state counterpart. “We wanted to act, we had volunteers, we had them basically beating down the doors at headquarters here,” she said. 
“Ballot measure campaigns usually do not distribute signs to local Republican groups,” said Johanna Lassaga, chair of the Yuba County Republican Party. She credited her group’s expenditures for raising visibility of the party’s unified position: “If you drive through the North State, you will see [our signs] everywhere.”
Along with a $5,000 contribution to the main Yes campaign, former Democratic state Sen. Steve Glazer from Orinda used his ballot measure committee to spend more than $160,000 in support of Prop. 50, because he said he could reach voters in his district in a way a statewide campaign could not.
“When you’re running a statewide campaign, you don’t always have that luxury of microtargeting,”  Glazer said. “I felt that I had a good handle on the pulse of the voters in my area, where I believe I have a heightened level of credibility.”
“We decided we want to do it quicker, better, faster,” said Assemblymember Juan Alanis, Republican from Modesto, whose ballot measure committee reported spending more than $12,500 on signs to oppose Prop. 50. He said the short election cycle meant the statewide campaigns could not ensure enough signs would reach his district in time, so he decided to “make sure my area is taken care of.”
Assemblymember Maggy Krell, a Democrat who represents Sacramento, said that the most valuable way she could have spent $8,000 was to organize door-knocking in her district. “My best contribution to the campaign is my network of volunteers — people who are going door-to-door and engaging voters one conversation at a time,” she wrote in an email.
Republican Assemblymember Carl DeMaio from San Diego spent more than $430,000 from his Reform California committee, because he didn’t think the official No campaign was up to the task. He released a final ad last week that urged voters statewide to reject Prop. 50.

The Alabama State Board of Education is scheduled to vote on new textbooks at its meeting next month (Todd Van Emst for Alabama Reflector)The Alabama State Board of Education will vote on adopting new social studies and arts education textbooks for the 2026-2027 school year at its November meeting.
Members of the Alabama State Board of Education earlier this month were given scores granted to textbooks by the Alabama State Textbook Committee.
The two committees, one for social studies and one for arts education, were appointed in April to review and rate textbooks. Once the ratings were complete, they were sealed and given to State Board of Education members.
The scores and number of textbooks evaluated were not shared with the public. Alabama State Schools Superintendent Eric Mackey told the board the textbook approval process in Alabama is a “tight-lipped” process due to contracts with publishers.
“Until the board votes and says, ‘This is the list we are sending to the governor to sign contracts with,’ then they can’t be public,” he said to board members.
The board will vote on the textbooks at its Nov. 13 meeting.
Mackey also told the board the textbook approval process is the only one that carries criminal charges if done incorrectly.
“Remember that for textbook companies, these are multi-million dollar contracts, and if they get pushed out of a contract, and they think it’s because board members or the superintendent didn’t follow the law, they would, in a heartbeat, bring charges against us,” he said.
ALSDE only facilitates the textbook approval process. The textbook committee reports directly to the Board of Education members.
Mackey reminded board members that previously, Alabama textbook law stated that recommendations from the committee couldn’t be made public until the governor signed contracts with publishers.
“You all went to the Legislature and got that changed, because that’s an extra couple of months, and now the law is as soon as the board votes on them, they’re public so that’s been speeding things up by about three months,” he said.
Members of the public may review the social studies and arts textbooks that are under consideration until Nov. 12 at select libraries. 
Alabama social studies standards were updated last December. A report from Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative education thinktank, was mostly positive but critiqued the teaching of slavery, “state’s rights,” and lack of post-1970s history.
The updated curriculum includes three years of world history and geography and three years of Alabama in American history and government. It also requires schools to teach the Holocaust and shifts teachings of the Civil Rights Movement to the fifth grade to build on context and expand on the role Alabama played in the movement.
In 2021, board members approved the Preservation of Intellectual Freedom and Non-Discrimination in Alabama Public Schools. The resolution prohibits “concepts that impute fault, blame, a tendency to oppress others, or the need to feel guilt or anguish to persons solely because of their race or sex.” The move was aimed at critical race theory, an academic framework that seeks to understand the persistence of racism in the United States after the civil rights movement. Teachers and officials repeatedly stressed that critical race theory is not taught in K-12 schools. 
The textbook selection process ties into the new curriculum that has yet to be implemented. While the state can set the course of study, companies don’t always create textbooks with each state’s standards in mind.
According to American Public Media, California and Texas have the most influence in the K-12 textbook industry with Florida beginning to have influence as well.
The last time Alabama updated social studies textbooks was 2013. EdReports, a non-profit organization that reviews instructional materials, said in a statement Oct. 23 that new textbooks and other instructional materials are needed for students.
“We believe that students are best served by high-quality instructional materials (HQIM) that reflect the most current research on how kids learn and what they need to succeed in school and beyond. These materials help support educators with clear instructional pathways and strong guidance, especially when paired with thoughtful local adoption processes and professional learning,” the organization said.
Local school boards get the final say in what books are adopted for their schools and can even consider textbooks that are not recommended by ALSDE.
“So long as the state board of education doesn’t reject it. If you reject a textbook, then they cannot use state funds to buy the textbook. But if it’s a textbook that they just didn’t submit to the committee, and they want to go sell to a local county, they can still do that,” Mackey told board members.
This will be the last textbook adoption for a core class until math in 2029.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/15-txtbook-tve-15-1024x577.jpg,,,2025-10-31 08:16:31.620504
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-31 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,SNAP suspension a reminder to CT GOP: Trump sets the agenda,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/31/ct-gop-trump-sets-the-agenda/,Criticizing Trump is unthinkable in a GOP primary for governor. But standing with him on some issues can carry risks in a general election.,"A demand by state Senate Democrats that Republicans challenge President Donald J. Trump over the suspension of the SNAP food assistance program is a harbinger of the challenges Trump could pose for Republican candidates next year in blue states like Connecticut.
His administration’s plan to cut off SNAP on Saturday and deny food aid to 42 million Americans is a step Trump did not take during the longer federal government shutdown during his first term, buttressing a Democratic claim that the suspension is a tactic, not a fiscal necessity.
“This crisis is being precipitated needlessly in order to inflict more suffering on people,” Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, said Wednesday, flanked by a half-dozen other Democratic senators. 
Are elected Republicans in Connecticut supporting the move? Looney asked. His immediate goal was to cause discomfort for Republican state senators, who dismissed the press conference as a stunt. 
It will be harder for Republican candidates for governor to be similarly dismissive once the 2026 campaign is fully underway.
Polling points to two factors problematic for blue-state Republicans: Given his popularity among Republican voters, criticizing Trump is unthinkable for any Republican planning on competing in a GOP primary. But standing with him on a growing list of controversial positions carries risk in a general election.
An Economist/YouGov Poll released Wednesday showed Trump hitting a new low: 39% approve and 58% disapprove, a net negative rating of 19 points. The same poll, however, showed 86% of Republicans still backing him.
Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat on the verge of announcing his candidacy for a third term in 2026, notes the aversion of his two would-be Republican challengers, Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich and Mayor Erin Stewart of New Britain, to differences with Trump. 
Do they agree with the suspension of SNAP and other aid programs during the budget impasse in Washington, which sparked a partial federal shutdown that begins its second month Saturday? Are they in agreement with the president? Those are questions Lamont says Fazio and Stewart won’t answer now, even though they are unavoidable for a sitting governor.
“I know these guys are going to embrace Trump like there’s no tomorrow, right up until somebody wins the primary. Then they’re going to show their feisty independent streak,” Lamont said, smiling. “Don’t be fooled.”
Stewart opened an exploratory campaign in January, a step that allowed her to begin raising money. She is not seeking reelection as mayor and will leave office on Nov. 11, a week after the municipal election. A gubernatorial campaign announcement is expected soon after. 
Ryan declared his candidacy for governor two months ago. 
Fazio and Stewart previously had kept a respectful distance from Trump. Until recently, Fazio had declined to say if he had voted for Trump in any of his three runs for president. In 2018, Stewart accepted an invitation to visit Trump but stressed her independence of the MAGA movement.
“I have no ties to them, and I’ve been pretty outspoken about not supporting Trump and about not supporting or being in favor of a lot of what he’s done and his approach,” Stewart said then. “If I was out there wearing ‘Go Trump’ stuff, I’m sure that they would be using that against me. But I haven’t been. I never have been.”
Both have dropped their reticence, praising the president and sharing that they had, indeed, voted for him. 
Ben Proto, the chair of the Connecticut Republican Party, said leaning one way in a primary then moving to the center is hardly unique to Republicans. He said he expected Lamont, who angered the Democratic left with his veto of an omnibus housing bill intended to promote affordable housing, to be more attentive to liberals on housing until their anger subsides.
“And then once we get past all of this, suddenly he’s going to become Uncle Ned again, and back in the middle, right? That’s what he’s going to do. Why? Because the vast majority of Connecticut lives in the middle,” Proto said. “And so, yeah, he’s going to do the same thing, just on his side of the aisle.”
One difference is that Lamont, to a large degree, can choose the issues where he takes on liberals in his party. Fazio and Stewart have no say over what issues Trump will put over every front page, newscast and social media feed.
Trump has leaned into controversy since the opening hours of his new term, pardoning the Jan. 6 rioters, declaring an end to birthright citizenship, barring leasing for new offshore wind projects, suspending refugee resettlement and curtailing federal funding for humanitarian aid and medical and scientific research.
In late August, the administration ordered a stop-work order on the nearly completed Revolution Wind, an offshore wind project largely staged from the State Pier in New London. It was expected to provide carbon-free power the New England electric grid, supported by power-purchase agreements with utilities in Connecticut and Rhode Island.
Connecticut, among others, sued, and a federal judge lifted the stop-work order. The episode was a stark example of the potential for conflict between a Connecticut governor and the president.
One prominent Republican, House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, spoke against the order and the administration’s failure to offer a clear rationale for the action or a path to go forward. Fazio, the ranking Republican on the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee, did not.
“If I was running to be a member of Congress or the U.S. Senate, then I should be answering for every single issue that is a federal issue,” Fazio said. 
He sidestepped saying whether he agreed with the Trump administration’s suspension of SNAP.
“My opinion is our U.S. senators should be voting for legislation to fund SNAP,” Fazio said.
Democratic senators have refused to vote for the continuing resolution to fund government operations unless Republicans agree to preserve at least some of the subsidies created during the COVID pandemic to bring down the cost of health coverage under the Affordable Care Act.
Stewart did not respond to a request for comment.
Candelora, who has endorsed Fazio, said he well understands the reluctance to go down the “rabbit hole of trying to score political points on every issue coming out of Washington.” But he believes some of those issues must be addressed by elected officials and candidates in Connecticut.
“I think in the end, people in Connecticut are starving for leadership. I don’t let a sitting president define my principles and who I am as a leader. Any candidate should lead on their own and let the chips fall where they may,” Candelora said.
He added a postscript: 
“President Trump can pose a challenge, especially to those who need to survive a primary.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25185821873536-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-31 07:56:45.602853

Wes Moore declared a state of emergency Thursday to send $10 million to food banks, responding to the Trump administration's announcement that funds for SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, will run out in November.","Gov. Wes Moore spent a few minutes sorting donated food at the Anne Arundel County Food Bank before signing an executive order Thursday declaring a state of emergency to allow for distribution of food aid. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore (D) declared a state of emergency Thursday to send $10 million to food banks, responding to the Trump administration’s “human-made” crisis when it said funds for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will run out in November.
“I understand the weight of what it means to put this state under a state of emergency – when the state of emergency is not a natural disaster, when it is a human-made one,” Moore said Thursday at the Anne Arundel County Food Bank. “What’s really unfortunate — is that these are actions that the state of Maryland is taking because the actions that the federal government is taking are actively hurting our people.”
More than 680,000 low-income Marylanders are set to lose their November benefits from the federally funded Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
Moore signed an executive order Thursday declaring the state of emergency and directing $10 million in state funds toward meal assistance programs to alleviate the expected surge when SNAP benefits are denied.
Moore said the state must “move quickly to make sure we’re getting the most support to those most in need” and that the $10 million in additional state funds will go out to “hundreds of institutions with experience of distributing food at the regional level.

“We are also providing support to local nonprofits, faith-based organizations, food kitchens, farmers markets, school pantries and also mobile food units,” he said.
While some lawmakers appreciate the help for meal assistance programs across the state, many note that the $10 million won’t even cover 10% of the $123.2 million state SNAP recipients receive in a typical month.
The $10 million comes from an account funded by capital gains taxes called the Fiscal Responsibility fund. The highly volatile revenue source is difficult to project year to year, but senior administration officials say the fiscal 2025 closeout for those funds was “better than expected” and that about $200 million is sitting in the account.
State fiscal experts treat the revenue like found money, placing it in a separate account to be used for one-time expenses — specifically K-12 and higher education capital projects. Moore’s declaration of a state of emergency allows him to repurpose the money.
Senior administration officials said that they will have more details about how the money will be distributed in the next few days. Meanwhile, more than 371,522 Maryland households are set to lose SNAP benefits for the month of November.
After funding benefits when the government was shut down in October, the Trump administration reversed course last week and announced that it is unable to continue funding SNAP next month, even though critics note there is $6 billion in a U.S. Department of Agriculture account specifically for that purpose. But the White House said it is not allowed to touch that money during a government shutdown/
Unless Congress agrees on a budget, SNAP funding would be halted, the administration said — and it may not reimburse states that decide to fill the gap in the meantime.
The federal funds are set to run out on Saturday, though everyone’s benefit renewal date is different and in Maryland, the first date for which recipients will not have their SNAP benefits renewed for November is Tuesday, Nov. 4. On Tuesday, and every day thereafter, more and more people will find that their EBT cards did not get refilled for the month

More than two dozen states, including Maryland, this week sued the Trump administration in hopes of forcing the government to pay for SNAP amid the shutdown.  In the meantime, a handful of governors in other states have signaled they will use state funds to cover SNAP regardless.
Many state lawmakers called on Moore Wednesday to tap the state’s Rainy Day fund to directly backfill missing SNAP benefits, which could have used up upwards of $123.2 million from the state’s designated emergency dollars just for November. Using money from the Fiscal Responsibility fund leaves the state’s Rainy Day funds untouched for now.
Moore’s approach to mend the SNAP benefit cut-off is getting mixed reviews from lawmakers.
Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey (R-Upper Shore) thinks Moore should fund SNAP benefits directly, saying that the governor has “once again passed on the opportunity to lead.”
“Other governors found a way to do this the right way — directly and transparently,” Hershey said in a statement Thursday. “Governor Moore chose the harder, less effective path, handing responsibility off to nonprofits despite his administration’s poor track record of accountability in that space. Marylanders deserved better than confusion and headlines.”
Comptroller Brooke Lierman also supported state action to extend SNAP benefits, in November touting the economic benefits of letting people purchase their groceries within their communities through SNAP funds.
Del. Emily Shetty (D-Montgomery), who chairs the Appropriations subcommittee that oversees social services, said that $10 million toward food banks is a “good start.”
“$10 million is not a small amount of money,” Shetty said. “It will enable food banks to purchase additional food for distribution efforts. The lines for food banks are already around the blocks.”
However, if the legal challenge to force the Trump administration to release funds for SNAP does not go in Maryland’s favor, Shetty said the next step “has to be an extension of SNAP benefits” by the state.
“Let’s not forget that the total amount of SNAP benefits that are no longer going to be on cards is about $130 million,” Shetty said. “So this is less than 10% of the money that people would otherwise be receiving to purchase food for their families.

“We can look at it week by week as needed, but as we get further into the holidays and families go deeper into their savings,” she said, “this becomes a more urgent, pressing matter.”
But Moore says that he has “no belief that the federal government is going to reimburse anybody for anything,” and with more than three years left in the Trump administration, be believes it is safer for Maryland’s fiscal outlook to be cautious about dipping into the Rainy Day fund.
“Not only are we going to make sure that we’re protecting and taking care of our people, but also that we’re going to ensure that there is a real measure of fiscal discipline when it comes to how Maryland is going to manage its finances,” he said.
Meanwhile, food banks report increased activity and need in the last few weeks.
Maryland Food Bank CEO Meg Kimmel told reporters Wednesday, prior to Moore’s executive order, that “the need in Maryland has been high for some time” and will likely increase as SNAP benefits come to an end.
“Nationwide, SNAP provides nine meals for every one meal provided by the charitable food system,” Kimmel said Wednesday. “We’re already beginning to see the influx of federal furloughed workers on top of historically high levels of food insecurity that came out of the (COVID-19) pandemic, and those levels never went down.
“The SNAP stoppage will have an immediate impact on even more Marylanders, and we can already see this happening,” she said. “We’ve never been in a situation where a lot of our SNAP benefits have been off the table. So of course, we’re very concerned.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC_4177-1024x681.jpeg,,,2025-10-31 07:56:45.602853

A federal judge on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit seeking public access to recordings of all Oakland County judicial hearings. | ScreenshotA federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, which had sought to make the audio and video recordings of Oakland County court proceedings available to the public.
The lawsuit, Hallman v. Reeds, was filed in April in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan and was seen by the plaintiffs as a way to hold judges accountable when they are accused of courtroom errors or misconduct. 
However, in an order issued Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Brandy McMillion granted a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, finding that there was no constitutional right to access, copy or disseminate court recordings under the First Amendment.
The motion to dismiss had been filed by the named defendants in the case; Oakland District Court judges Travis Reeds and Lisa Asadoorian, as well as Oakland Chief Circuit Judge Jeffery Matis. 
The lead plaintiff, Dr. Samantha Hallman, filed the lawsuit after being denied access to recordings of Asadoorian’s courtroom, whom she alleged had subjected her brother to abusive conduct during a probation violation hearing.
Hallman was later allowed to view a recording of the proceeding involving her brother, but was denied permission to disseminate a copy to the public, legislators and other policy makers.
While transcripts of hearings are made available to the public, recordings are not and attorneys with the ACLU of Michigan claimed that transcripts were inadequate compared to an audio or video recording in capturing the tone, tenor and demeanor of a given judge, especially when an attorney or a party is seeking to highlight a judicial error upon appeal.
But in Tuesday’s order, Judge McMillion found that Hallman had failed to state a plausible claim for relief and dismissed the case with prejudice, meaning that it cannot be refiled. 
However, the ruling itself can be appealed. A request to the ACLU Michigan to ask if they planned an appeal has yet to be answered.

Kevin made sure my time always aligned with the people of Vermont.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Patrick J. Leahy: Remembering Kevin McDonald.","Patrick J. Leahy represented Vermont in the United States Senate for 48 years – from 1975 to 2023. He also was president pro tempore of the United States Senate from 2012 to 2015 and from 2021 to 2023. 


When I think of Kevin McDonald, who died quite suddenly in September, I think of family, integrity and excellence. But it wasn’t always quiet excellence. Sometimes — often in fact — it was noisy excellence — because Kevin was someone who was full of life, laughter and energy.
For more than three decades in my Senate office, Kevin was at the center of just about everything we did. He worked his heart out every single day but also made sure that every day had joy and purpose in it.
Kevin served as my longtime scheduler and senior aide in the United States Senate. He arrived from another Senate office with glowing recommendations and, within weeks, became indispensable.
He understood that a public official’s schedule isn’t just a list of meetings — it’s a reflection of priorities and values. Kevin made sure my time always aligned with the people of Vermont. He kept the trains running in an operation that stretched from Capitol Hill to every corner of our state, and he did it with patience, warmth and grace.
But he also did it with laughter. Kevin had an unmatched sense of humor — quick, mischievous, joyful and Irish to the core. He could find humor in almost anything, and he made others laugh constantly. He wrote every holiday skit for my office for more than 30 years, dreamed up the goofiest costumes and made sure everyone participated.
Kevin had a gift for understanding people — their stories, worries and joys. I can’t count how many Vermonters told me that Kevin remembered important details about their lives: a son or daughter applying to college; a parent recovering from surgery; or a farmer struggling through a hard season. His empathy was genuine and boundless. People who sat down with Kevin often found themselves opening up about their lives and challenges, and they left feeling seen and understood.
Inside the office, Kevin was our compass. Staff came to him before they came to me, knowing he would listen, think things through and offer practical wisdom. He didn’t say, “You can’t do that.” He’d ask, “Have you thought about doing it this way?” His calm steadiness and quick wit grounded us all. In a place full of large personalities and sharp elbows, Kevin led with humility, humor and heart.
He was deeply loyal — the most loyal person I’ve ever known — and deeply faithful. His religion wasn’t for show; it shaped how he treated people. It kept him humble, grounded and kind.
Kevin was, in every sense, part of our family. Our children adored him. When they learned of his passing, their grief was as deep as ours. To us, Kevin wasn’t staff — he was kin.
Since his passing, Marcelle and I have heard from people across Vermont, the country and abroad — friends, former colleagues, even an ambassador in Ireland — all sharing stories of Kevin’s kindness, humor and humanity. Those messages reminded us how far his influence reached and how many lives he touched, not quietly, but joyfully.
I still catch myself reaching for the phone to call him. After decades together, he could finish my sentences, anticipate what I needed, and, more importantly, remind me what mattered.
Kevin McDonald embodied the best of public service — not ambition or self-promotion, but empathy, loyalty, laughter and heart. Vermont, and all of us who knew him, are better for his life, his friendship and his example.

We honor those who are gone by remembering their full humanity, not by reducing them to specters. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Kurt L. White: Psychiatric hospitals are not haunted (sorry) .","This commentary by Kurt L. White. He is a licensed clinical social worker working at Brattleboro Retreat, a private non-profit psychiatric hospital founded in 1834, where he oversees communications and community partnerships. He lives in Newfane.


As Halloween approaches, the calls start to come in: “Do you think we could have a tour? What about the tunnels? We’d love to do a story for Halloween.” I have to lean back in my chair and take a breath. My colleagues remind me it’s “just a bit of good fun — the boo tour. What’s the harm in it?” But my internal dialogue tells me that this is actually important.  
Persons who sought care — voluntarily or compelled — do not become ghosts when they pass away at any greater statistical frequency than anyone else. Psychiatric hospitals like the Brattleboro Retreat, places that work to help and provide care, do not become “haunted.”
If this is an obvious truth, then we should wonder: why are we so compelled to exotify and “other” those with mental health challenges? Why, driven by a century of “haunted asylum” tropes in movies and media, do we choose this over respecting their basic dignity and memory? 
Mental health symptoms are, after all, quite common, and can come up at many times in life and for many different reasons — not unlike other medical problems.
Thinking of people in my life who are now gone, I remember my mother, the psychologist, who died far too young of pancreatic cancer — a scourge of a disease, then and now. I remember her having psychosis — hallucinations and paranoia — as a reaction to pain medicines and anesthesia when she was in the hospital, confounding nurses as well as friends and family members as she behaved in distinctly different ways than was typical for her.  
Or my uncle, who had been diagnosed at different times in his life with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. In his case, the all-too-common problem of poor medical care for persons with mental health challenges nearly took his life. When he was young, his severe Crohn’s disease was dismissed and neglected until my grandmother physically carried his emaciated body into a different hospital to get care.
For so many others, he was “just a person with a mental health problem” not worthy of their time or attention.
There is no eulogy large enough to really capture the scope of his defiance of the stereotypes of these diagnostic labels. Though he always sought care when needed, he refused to let his symptoms define him, and was a loving and passionate advocate for others — at
 one point suing the town of Flint, Michigan because the sewage lines flooded his and his neighbors’ houses, and winning repair costs for all of them! 
My father, too, struggled with a lifelong depression and trauma history that often isolated him, and he survived multiple serious suicide attempts. I choose to remember him as a brilliant labor attorney, who never gave anything less than complete commitment to the causes he took on — even when he would neglect to send a bill afterward! Perhaps he gave the advocacy to others that he couldn’t make use of in his own life. 
They are gone now from this world, and I mourn them as family, but never as psychiatric patients. Their struggles made them more human, not less, and it would bring me joy to imagine that the even as I describe them now, that you, as a reader, take the journey into the shadows of history to find them with me. To find them as they were, in their lives as they lived them, with all the messiness, joy and ordinary tragedy.
I am sometimes haunted by their absence, but I would never want to think that their whole lives could be boiled down to a ghost-status, a “haunting” diminishes their humanity in death.  
And here, the tradition of Halloween fails us, as it doesn’t naturally invite that sort of retrospection and memorialization. Although it is not my cultural tradition, I have always had a respect and admiration for the practices in el Día de los Muertos, including especially the practice of making an ofrenda, a memorial and offering, to remember those who have passed.
What a joy to remember those who are gone, and to sense their spirit and presence being with us — even just for a night each year. For me, it brings an immediate emotional stirring that Halloween has never quite managed to evoke for me.  
At Brattleboro Retreat, we have a small version of this intention in the form of a memorial garden where staff members engrave bricks in honor of those who have impacted them — family, colleagues, teachers, including many who have struggled with mental health challenges. It’s a beautiful place where I can feel the true spirit of those who are no longer with us. 
So this Halloween, please don’t dismiss the humanity of those who sought treatment here, or elsewhere by turning them into ghosts or spectres. They are not wandering our halls, not causing our elevators to malfunction or going bump in the night… at least, not
 any more than in any other place.

Sears/Maryland Matters)A Maryland state senator, her brother and a Baltimore City Police officer are in federal custody facing federal charges in an alleged blackmail scheme.
The grand jury indictment charging Sen. Dalya Attar (D-Baltimore City) and others was unsealed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Baltimore. Prosecutors allege Attar, then a delegate, worried that a disgruntled political consultant would turn against her during her 2022 re-election bid.
The 20-page indictment details how Attar, her brother and a campaign volunteer who was also a Baltimore City Police officer, carried out a scheme to videotape the consultant having an affair, then use the recordings  to threaten the consultant as she sought to arrange the marriages of her children.
It was a conspiracy that included the use of tracking devices on vehicles, video cameras hidden in smoke detectors, and interstate and international communications using the WhatsApp messaging service.
“It was the purpose of the conspiracy that the co-conspirators sought to surreptitiously obtain evidence of the relationship between Victims 1 and 2 so that the evidence could be used to prevent Victim 1 from … engaging in any act or speech that could negatively impact the election campaign or political aspirations of Dalya Attar,” according to court documents.
Attar, a former Baltimore City assistant state’s attorney, was elected to the House of Delegates in 2018 and re-elected in 2022. She was appointed in 2025 to fill the seat vacated by Sen. Jill Carter (D-Baltimore City), who resigned after being appointed to the State Board of Contract Appeals.

With the appointment, Attar became the first Orthodox Jewish woman to serve in the Maryland Senate.
A spokesperson for Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said Thursday that they had just “been made aware of state Senator Dalya Attar’s arrest and we don’t have any additional information to provide at this time.”
“The Senate of Maryland holds its members to the highest ethical standards as we serve our constituents, and we will continue to do so as we learn more about the alleged facts in the indictment,” the Ferguson spokesperson said.
As Attar prepared for her 2022 reelection to the House, she worried about the unnamed female political consultant, with whom she had a falling out after the 2018 campaign, prosecutors said. Attar worried the consultant would try to torpedo her reelection, according to court records. In messages to an unnamed co-conspirator on WhatsApp, Attar worried the consultant “is still looking to screw me badly,” according to the indictment.
“I just want her to be a non-issue in my mind and in reality that won’t happen as long as she is relevant or doesn’t have anything to worry about,” Attar said in a Jan. 9, 2020, message according to the indictment. “Because I believe she’s building things up, even small things, but in the end when it’s the right time for her (close to reelection), it’ll come out … And even more reason why the lady should be afraid to come out with anything at that point.”
A week later, prosecutors said the delegate’s brother, Joseph Attar, and Kalman Finkelstein, a police officer, exchanged messages in which they discussed following the consultant.
The consultant, a U.S. citizen who also lives in Israel, is a friend of Finkelstein’s family. She frequently used a car and apartment owned by the Finkelsteins when she visited Baltimore, the indictment said.
By mid-January, Finkelstein and Joseph Attar, also known as Yossi or Jay, were discussing buying a tracking device that would be placed on the vehicle driven by the consultant. They also discussed, with two other unnamed co-conspirators, recording devices that would be installed in the apartment where the consultant stayed, according to court records.
Joseph Attar and Finkelstein, again using the secure messaging app, allegedly planned when to install video cameras inside smoke alarms in the bedroom and living room areas of the apartment used by the consultant.

In one Jan. 16 message, Finkelstein told two unnamed co-conspirators that the consultant was watching his children until his wife came home. Later that day, Joseph Attar sent a voice message announcing the installation of the cameras.
“Got it connected, tested them and all that. Now I’m on my way there now to go and pick the lock and try to get in,” court records quote Joseph Attar as saying.
It is unclear how long the recording continued. Prosecutors alleged that Dalya Attar sent a series of messages on March 11, 2021, to an unnamed co-conspirator in which she talked about the ongoing effort.
The delegate allegedly wrote that the consultant “needs to be warned before mailers to the Jewish community start coming out about things I voted on in the last three years. We’re nearing my election. We can’t wait until she does it already. Things as simple as anti-police things … She wants her daughters to get married more than she wants to screw with me … There’s the perfect way to scare her re[garding] her daughters shidduchim…Each mailer can do a lot of damage. We have a way that can potentially stop her. Why not at least try.”
A shidduchim is a matchmaking process within the Orthodox Jewish community. Both Attar and the consultant are Orthodox Jews.
By early December, Attar, her brother and Finkelstein were moving their plot forward.
Joseph Attar met with a man described as Victim 2, a married man who was allegedly engaged in the affair with the consultant. The two met at the Atrium at Greenspring Shopping Center in Baltimore.
It was during that meeting that prosecutors allege Joseph Attar told the man of the existence of “hours of footage of you in bed” with the consultant. Attar allegedly told the man that to make “this go away permanently” that he needed to convince the consultant to leave his sister alone.
“Don’t bring her up anymore to anyone. Stay out of this election, the delegate election,” Joseph Attar is alleged to have said. Prosecutors said he then showed the man a video recording of him in bed with the consultant, and warned of the consequences if the man did not do as he was told.

“I’ll share this video with everybody you know, everyone she knows, every Rabbi in town, your kids, your wife, her daughters,” Joseph Attar is alleged to have said. “And every shadchan in Israel who is trying to set up her daughters.”
Later that day, prosecutors said Joseph Attar messaged the consultant saying she should speak to Victim 2.
Five days later, in a message between Victim 2 and Joseph Attar, the man confirmed he spoke to the consultant, who “has indicated multiple times that she is not involved in any activity that could harm Dalia. She has no intention of harming her in anyway either. You have everything you asked for. Put it to bed. Leave me the hell alone.”
Before the end of 2021, Finkelstein and Del. Attar allegedly messaged each other. In that message, prosecutors said Finkelstein urged the delegate to “push [victim 2] one more time.”
Prosecutors said the trio began messaging about the plot again on April 8, 2022.
In an exchange with her brother, Dalya Attar raises concerns about a Facebook post authored by the consultant. The post questioned why some delegates voted against an amendment on a bill before the legislature.
“Looks like she wants the world to know about her and [victim 2],” the delegate allegedly wrote.
She later added that “it’s time to show someone that’ll get back to her,” according to court filings. Attar later allegedly sent a voice message to an unnamed co-conspirator. In it, she allegedly suggested that the co-conspirator should talk to Joseph Attar “about a smart move.”
The plan was to show some of the video to someone who would tell the consultant about it — possibly Finkelstein’s wife.
“I just care about it getting back to [the consultant] and she understands we’re serious. Not another little threat or something like that, she needs to understand we’re serious,” the delegate allegedly said in the voice message.
Prosecutors said Joseph Attar did eventually contact the consultant. In a June 28, 2022, exchange, repeated the threat to send the video to the consultant’s family and the matchmakers. “Do you really want to go down this road?” Attar asked, according to the indictment.
In follow-up messages, Joseph Attar allegedly wrote: “Just leave my family alone and nothing will ever come out” and “put me to the test. I dare you.”
Attar, her brother and Finkelstein face more than a half-dozen charges including conspiracy and extortion. They are also charged with interception and disclosure of wire, oral or electronic communications, and four counts of violating the federal travel act for their use of “a facility of interstate commerce” as part of the alleged extortion plot.
Court records show all three were in federal custody on Thursday. None had lawyers, according to online records.
The charges have potential election implications for Attar, who was appointed to the seat 10 months ago. The district she represents is diverse with sizable Black and Jewish populations.
Attar edged out Del. Malcolm Ruff to replace Carter earlier this year.
Ruff, who was appointed to the house in 2023, announced in August that he would challenge Attar for the Senate seat in 2026.
That race has the attention of Ferguson, the Senate president. He traveled to Attar’s district to spotlight an $800,000 capital project.
The press conference was a first for Ferguson, who had not participated in similar events during his time as Senate president. He later held a similar event for Sen. Shaneka Henson (D-Anne Arundel). Both women were appointed to their seats and are expected to face challengers in 2026.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC_0312-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-31 07:56:45.602853

Brown will lead a team that produces contextualized reporting on a range of topics ranging from school funding and postsecondary opportunities to curriculum and mental health in schools. The stories will be anchored in community-centered reporting with an eye toward racial justice and equity. 
She is looking forward to using her expertise to guide and shape coverage of one of the state’s most consequential topics. 
“Jackson is my hometown. As someone born and raised in the city and metro area, I was proud to serve my community years ago as a daily newspaper reporter,” Brown said. “Since then, I’ve relied on Mississippi Today for in-depth journalism that holds state and local officials accountable and uncovers issues important to Mississippians’ everyday lives. It’s an honor to join that team and serve my hometown and state again as a journalist.”
As a former education reporter and a graduate of Murrah High School and the University of Mississippi, Brown is intimately familiar with the successes and challenges of the state’s education system. She also has a keen awareness of how those issues fit into a national context. 
She has worked with national education groups such as the Education Writers Association and, most recently, on a contract with the U.S. Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics. She also spent more than a decade as a reporter at newspapers in Mississippi, Virginia and North Carolina and received her master’s degree in interactive media from Elon University.
“I was impressed by Marquita years ago when she was an early-career reporter at The Clarion-Ledger, and I’m even more impressed with the leadership she has shown as her career developed,” said Emily Wagster Pettus, editor-in-chief of Mississippi Today. “She brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to her new role at Mississippi Today, and we’re happy to have her as part of the team.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/04185133/MT-Featured-Image-General-Logo.jpg,,,2025-10-31 07:17:19.572333

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Republican gubernatorial hopeful Jack Ciattarelli has said he wants to remake New Jersey’s high court, moving away from a tradition of partisan balance that has persisted on the seven-seat bench for nearly 80 years.
Ciattarelli, a former state assemblyman, has called the court’s partisan balance — an unwritten convention that broadly says no party shall have more than four of the high court’s seven seats — a “failed tradition” and pledged to nominate conservative justices.

“I will appoint Supreme Court justices that agree with me on issues like high-density housing and suburban districts where there’s no infrastructure and who agree with me on school funding,” Ciattarelli said during a debate in early October.
The current state Supreme Court has four Democrats, two Republicans, and one who is unaffiliated but worked in the administration of Republican Gov. Chris Christie.
Ciattarelli’s pledge to do away with the court’s tradition of partisan balance, one that has persisted uninterrupted since the state adopted its 1947 constitution, has some court observers worried that New Jersey’s high court could come to mirror the U.S. Supreme Court.
“We don’t have the situation, alas, that we have down in Washington where there’s such obvious bitter divides that it’s almost getting to the point where the justices apparently are being uncollegial to each other,” said Ron Chen, a former New Jersey public advocate who teaches law at Rutgers Law School.
The U.S. Supreme Court, where conservatives have a 6-3 majority, rarely issues unanimous decisions, and those justices now regularly snipe at each other in dissents and concurrences, questioning not only whether the court has overstepped its authority but also whether justices are consulting law when making their rulings.
Only four of the 38 decisions New Jersey’s Supreme Court has meted out this year included a dissent. All others were ruled unanimously.
Rep. Mikie Sherrill, who is Ciattarelli’s Democratic opponent in the Nov. 4 election, during a primary debate said she would maintain the court’s partisan balance.
The state high court’s current membership provides Ciattarelli with no grand opportunities to remake the bench. New Jersey’s Supreme Court justices are appointed, with Senate confirmation, to an initial seven-year term and can be renominated and confirmed to remain on the court until they reach the mandatory retirement age of 70.
Three justices will turn 70 over the next two gubernatorial terms. Two of them are Republicans.
Only Justice Anne Patterson, a Republican, turns 70 during the next governor’s term, in 2029. The next-oldest member of the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Stuart Rabner, a Democrat, doesn’t turn 70 until the gubernatorial term after that, in June 2030. 
A victorious Ciattarelli could have other avenues to remake the court, though they’re likely to be substantially more controversial.
Members of the court are typically renominated absent major controversy, but Ciattarelli could gain two seats for Republicans in his first term by moving to replace Democratic justices instead of renominating them, and he could gain a third by the same means if reelected to a second term.
Justices Fabiana Pierre-Louis, Rachel Wainer Apter, and Douglas Fasciale will see their initial seven-year terms expire under the next governor, and Ciattarelli is not required to nominate them for tenure (Fasciale is Republican).
Wainer Apter and Pierre-Louis are Democrats, and nominating Republicans in their place could give Republicans a 5-2 majority on the high court. But that path is perilous.
“We saw 10 years ago what happened when Gov. Christie tried that,” Chen said.
When Christie declined to nominate Justice John Wallace for tenure in 2010, Democrats who controlled the Senate ground his judicial confirmations to a halt, rejecting two of Christie’s Supreme Court nominees and refusing to hear two others. Wallace’s seat was not filled until 2016.
The Legislature could blunt a push to stack the high court with conservatives with little difficulty.
Democrats hold 25 of the state Senate’s 40 seats, and members of the upper chamber are not up for election this year, so the next governor will have a Democratic-controlled Senate for at least two years. If Ciattarelli becomes governor in January, Senate leaders can simply refuse to bring his Supreme Court nominations to committee or indefinitely withhold floor votes on their nominations.
Even if Republicans take control of the upper chamber after legislative elections in 2027, Democratic senators could still block broad swaths of his nominees under an unwritten rule, called senatorial courtesy, that allows senators to unilaterally and indefinitely block nominations from their home county or legislative district.
Sen. Holly Schepisi’s (R-Bergen) invocation of courtesy froze Wainer Apter’s nomination for 18 months.
The pains inflicted by courtesy can stretch past the judiciary. Prior to his retirement, former Sen. Michael Doherty (R-Warren) for a time blocked all gubernatorial nominations in Warren County.
There’s little indication the Senate would back eliminating courtesy, regardless of who controls the chamber. With few exceptions, the unwritten rule is a senator’s greatest source of individual power.

It is still too crowded to end the freeze.","Sara Vasquez, lead teacher in the classroom with 2- and 3-year-old students at The Learning Bee in Frederick County, reads “The Littlest Pumpkin” Oct. 29. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)At The Learning Bee child care center in Frederick County, groups of preschoolers clustered around a table Wednesday to conduct a science experiment combining vinegar, food coloring and baking soda in a small, black pot with a teacher’s help.
As the ingredients bubbled back out of the pot, the children yelled in unison, “Haaaa!”
“Wasn’t that exciting?” asked lead preschool teacher Carolyn Jackson, as more children clamored to be part of the experiment.
It’s the sort of experience Learning Bee owner Cindi Webb wishes she could share with more children. But enrollment at Learning Bee is currently at about 75% of its 112-student capacity, she said, a victim of the ongoing freeze on state scholarships for children in day care.
“We are down, and we contribute a lot of it to not having the scholarship available for families,” said Webb, who said Wednesday that just 15 of her current 83 students are on scholarship.
But any hopes of the freeze being lifted anytime soon were largely dispelled Thursday, when state analysts presented House lawmakers with the latest data on the scholarship program. It is still too crowded to end the freeze, they were told, and new enrollments have been mostly limited to siblings of children who were already getting a scholarship.
Lawmakers in the joint virtual briefing for the House Ways and Means Committee and the Appropriations’ Subcommittee on Education and Economic Development did not offer specific solutions, but pledged to push the issue in the 2026 General Assembly session.

The scholarship program has largely been a victim of its own success. When it began in 2018 as the Maryland Child Care Subsidy, enrollment stood at more than 12,000 children, according to data presented Thursday. By the last fiscal year, enrollment stood at 46,295, more than the state could afford, which sparked the freeze on enrollment.
When it paused new enrollment in May, the state intended to reopen the program once enrollment dropped to a more manageable 40,000, hopefully by the start of the school year. But the latest figures show about 43,000 children enrolled.
There are enrollment exceptions based on certain income guidelines — such as families receiving temporary cash assistance (TCA) or supplemental security income (SSI) — or having a sibling already enrolled in the program.
Alistair Johnston, a policy analyst who works with Ways and Means, said that since the freeze went into effect, about 1,308 children, or slightly more than 80% of eligible children enrolled, have been siblings. In the meantime, about 2,700 families remain on a waiting list.
Laura Weeldreyer, executive director of Maryland Family Network, who participated in the briefing, thinks the number waiting to get in could be higher.
“I would like you to please consider that those numbers are a gross undercount because many families are walking away and not even applying for the child care scholarship program when they find out there’s a freeze in place,” she said. “It’s tough to accept a job or make plans for your family when you can’t access child care.”
Del. Vanessa Atterbeary (D-Howard), chair of the Ways and Means Committee, asked Weeldreyer if she knew how many families have walked away and not applied.
“It’s anecdotal,” Weeldreyer said. “We’re hearing through those kind of front line supports and providers.”
While over-enrollment has caused problems, Atterbeary said the popularity of the program is something lawmakers should be proud of.
“It means more parents, especially mothers, have been able to return to the workforce here in Maryland,” Atterbeary said. “It’s an extraordinary achievement and it’s one I’m personally proud of as a legislator, and most importantly, as a mother. Ending the freeze is going to be my priority this upcoming legislative session.”
The nearly 70-minute briefing highlighted some legislation to improve the scholarship program, its popularity and challenges.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Johnston said one of the biggest legislative boosts came from a bill approved in 2022, sponsored by Montgomery County Democratic Dels. Jared Solomon and Julie Palakovich Carr. Part of the law now requires the state Department of Education to cover copayments for families participating in public benefits programs, to exclude child support payments calculated from a family’s income and to allow at least 60 days of benefits for recipients while applications are under review.
‘Right thing to do’
Laura Hyde, a senior policy analyst who works with the Appropriations Committee, summarized a few challenges in the early education profession.
Hyde said the annual minimum wage salary for child care teachers in Maryland is about $31,000; it increases up to $43,000 for lead teachers.
According to 2023 data, she said the average cost of child care in the state for children ages 2 to 4 was $14,850 per year. The annual amount increased to slightly more than $19,000 to care for an infant.
To help boost the profession, the state established a child care career and professional development fund to allow workers interested to obtain a college degree. About $3 million was allocated this fiscal year.
Del. Kris Fair (D-Frederick) asked if there’s initial data on how much it would cost to implement universal child care in Maryland.
Johnston said there wasn’t specific data available. However, what was presented is that if the state implemented universal child care for children from birth to two years old, the estimated cost could be $2.6 billion annually.
“That’s a very large number, but working towards that long term goal, it is the right thing to do,” Atterbeary said. “And the progress we’ve made in the last four years shows that this is possible if we stay the course and we continue to work hard.”
In the meantime, some children continue to receive an early childhood education at places like The Learning Bee.
Webb said she wishes state lawmakers would visit her center.
“Come see our day to day,” she said. “Come see how we’re preparing the children and loving and caring for them and meeting their needs.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Sara-Vasquez-reading-to-students-10-29-2025-1024x668.jpg,,,2025-10-31 07:56:45.602853

The D.C. region’s economy has taken a hit under President Donald Trump’s administration, following a series of government buyouts and layoffs, and now a near monthlong shutdown. But in Seat Pleasant on Wednesday, it was all smiles in hopes that a much-needed economic boost is on the horizon.
The “Blue Line Corridor” is Prince George’s County’s main economic redevelopment and revitalization project, and the wheels were put into motion before the federal upheaval started impacting the region.
Those involved say that upheaval has made the job harder, but it isn’t putting a stop to the project.
A group of developers, elected leaders, business owners and residents came together Wednesday to celebrate the creation of the Blue Line Corridor Coalition. It’s a group that aims to bring together all the stakeholders focused on revitalizing the area closest to the D.C. line and make sure everyone is pulling in the same direction.
“It’s to coordinate our efforts so that we’re moving more strategically, we don’t waste resources, but we also make sure that everyone’s bought in to what eventually happens,” said Del. Jazz Lewis (D-Prince George’s).
One of the leaders of the coalition is Bryan Franklin, of Local Initiatives Support Corp., or LISC D.C.

“For outsiders, right? Most people would think about this as a drive-through community,” he said.
“But this community is rich in history, and what this coalition is about is bringing that history to the forefront and bringing the type of change and development that the community has been asking for, and bringing the partners to the table,” he said. “Who can make it happen?”
And he maintained the region is still primed for new opportunities and revitalization.
“We have four Metro stops, and 15% of the land around those Metro stops is vacant lands,” he said. “Where in other parts of our region can you see vacant land, near Metro?
“So as the gateway to D.C., with connections to Amazon headquarters, with connections to Dulles and to DCA [Washington Reagan National Airport], not to mention the Capitol, this central part of the county, the Blue Line corridor, is primed for revitalization,” Franklin said. “We want to make sure that revitalization is community driven.”
One of those joining the coalition is Stabina King, who owns and operates Baked By Bina Mobile Coffee Shop. Her coffee is sold at The Capital Market, an area farmers market also guiding this coalition.
“I see a lot of improvement and changes coming along the way that’s needed,” King said.
She said she can remember when the area thrived, and can’t wait to see it happen again.
“But this time, everybody needs to be included,” King said.
Both Franklin and Lewis said the main redevelopment projects focused on housing are still being built. Ground was recently broken on 200 new units near the Capitol Heights Metro station, and Lewis said another project next to it will be announced soon, among other new development projects in the pipeline.
“All these are being led with minority developers too, so we’re still on pace to transform this area with the type of walkable, transit-oriented development that increases quality life for the residents here,” Lewis said.
“There are things happening. And so even amidst the headwinds, it’s showing that when we come together, we can make change,” Franklin added.

(Photo by Eric Thayer/Getty Images)In the absence of much federal action, states have enacted dozens of laws this year to lower prescription drug costs for their residents — and many more are considering following suit.
States cannot lower drug prices directly, but they can go after different parts of the drug supply chain to try to lower patients’ out-of-pocket costs and reduce excessive spending in state-run health plans.
Nearly two-thirds of the new state laws are aimed at pharmacy benefit managers — the drug middlemen who negotiate deals among the manufacturers that make the drugs, the insurers that allow the drugs to be prescribed, and the pharmacies that sell them.
Several states are considering drug affordability review boards. Others have passed laws to hold manufacturers and PBMs to higher transparency standards.
“So a lot of states went into looking at drug costs — trying to understand and follow the dollar,” said Maureen Hensley-Quinn, a senior program director at the National Academy for State Health Policy, a nonpartisan group that works on health policy issues. “Is it the price that manufacturers are setting? Is it the supply chain where there are different entities?”
Advocates of these laws say it’s up to states to take the lead as the federal government lags in compelling drug companies and insurers to lower prices for patients. But critics say some state interventions could lead to local pharmacies shuttering and may stifle innovation in the pharmaceutical industry, leading to fewer new drugs.
Laws targeting PBMs are wide-ranging in scope, requiring PBMs to pass discounts on to consumers or to be more transparent in their drug purchasing activities. Some states have created drug affordability review boards to assess manufacturers’ prices. Some laws aim to place copay caps on critical medications like insulin.
So far this year, at least 31 states have enacted nearly 70 laws designed to lower drug costs, according to a state drug affordability law tracker from the National Academy for State Health Policy. Earlier this year, Indiana’s legislature passed Senate Enrolled Act 140, which was signed by the governor. The law requires insurers and PBMs to ensure network adequacy and restricts anticompetitive practices — but Medicaid, managed care organizations and the state employee health plan were all exempt due to concerns about cost increases.
Health care pricing bill moves before third reading deadline

“States have no leverage, really, to put pressure on manufacturers to lower their prices, and that’s why I think most of the legislation at the state level has been on the intermediaries, the supply chain,” said Geoffrey Joyce, chair of the Department of Pharmaceutical and Health Economics at the University of Southern California.
Those interventions can go a long way in trying to reduce patients’ expenses, he said.
“The concern [is] about, well, ‘States really can’t lower drug prices, per se,’ but they can,” Joyce said. “I think there’s been evidence.”
California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in October signed legislation to cap the cost of insulin for people covered by state-regulated health plans, including the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace, private health plans and its Medicaid program. The state also plans to start offering its own generic version of insulin, costing just $11 a pen, in January.
Colorado’s drug affordability review board capped the cost of a widely used rheumatoid arthritis medication.
And Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore signed a law in May to expand the authority of the state’s drug affordability review board to lower prescription drug prices for all residents, not just state employees.
Pointing fingers
The federal government has taken some steps to lower prescription drug prices. The Inflation Reduction Act under the Biden administration created annual caps on out-of-pocket drug costs and capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for patients with Medicare, the health care program that primarily serves people over 65. The law also gave the federal government more power to negotiate drug prices for Medicare patients.
President Donald Trump has promised to slash drug prices by percentages that some experts say are mathematically impossible. He threatened tariffs on manufacturers that import their drugs if they didn’t lower their prices, which led to a deal with biopharmaceutical company Pfizer. And in May, he signed an executive order designed to ensure the U.S. government can secure drugs at prices on par with other nations.
Kush Desai, a spokesperson for the White House, said in a statement that the Trump administration’s website, TrumpRx, which hasn’t yet launched, will lower drug costs by allowing people to purchase drugs directly from the manufacturer.
But some states are going further.
In October, Colorado became the first state to cap the price of a prescription drug for all consumers. Starting in 2027, new insurers and patients will pay no more than $31,000 a year for Enbrel, a drug that treats rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases — a sharp decrease from the average insurance payment of $53,049 in 2023. Nearly 2,600 Coloradans used Enbrel in 2022, according to state research.
Colorado Democratic state Sen. Julie Gonzales, who sponsored the bill creating the state’s drug oversight board, said states have to deal with a lot of competing interests in the drug supply chain. When it comes to establishing who is setting high drug prices, she said, “everyone is pointing the finger at everyone else.”
It took four years from the law’s passage to set up the board and approve its first payment limit because there were so many special interests involved, she said. “We had to overcome a tremendous amount of angst and fear.”
Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington also have prescription drug affordability boards. New Hampshire created a board but dissolved it in July because of budget cuts.
In California, Newsom signed a bill this year to cap the consumer copay of insulin at $35 per month for all state-regulated health plans, after vetoing similar legislation in 2023. More than two dozen other states had already opted to cap insulin for state health plans. He also signed a PBM regulation bill that, among other provisions, requires pharmacy benefit managers to pass drug discounts on to payers and patients.
California Democratic state Sen. Scott Wiener, who sponsored the PBM and insulin bills, said states have the power to lower patients’ out-of-pocket expenses, even if they can’t force manufacturers to lower drug prices.
“The federal government right now is a disaster zone when it comes to health care,” Wiener said. “That’s why it’s more important for the states to step up.”
Other states such as Illinois, Iowa and Louisiana enacted similar PBM laws this year, according to the National Academy for State Health Policy.
A complicated system
The system for developing, selling and distributing prescription drugs is complex.
Pharmaceutical companies determine the initial costs of drugs, but are often accused of setting prices too high. Pharmacy benefit managers say they exist to negotiate lower drug prices, but are often accused of pocketing discounts or engaging in predatory practices. Meanwhile, health insurers pay for the drugs and decide what copays patients may end up with, and are often accused of not reimbursing enough.
Experts note that three pharmacy benefit management companies — CVS Health, Cigna and United Health Group — dominate the PBM industry, which adds to concerns about their market power.
“There’s also some truth to the fact that this industry is very concentrated, and there’s not a lot of transparency around how much money they’re making and how they make their money, and if that’s being shared back with plans and with consumers,” said Pragya Kakani, a health economist specializing in drug policy at the Weill Cornell Medical College.
The pharmaceutical industry typically opposes drug affordability boards.
In Colorado, Amgen Inc., the manufacturer of Enbrel, sued the state in 2024 over its drug affordability review board, alleging that a price cap would cause economic harm to the company. A federal district court dismissed the challenge in March.
“Instead of fixing the root causes of patient affordability concerns, the board has rushed into a reckless experiment,” Reid Porter, senior director of state public affairs for PhRMA, a group that represents pharmaceutical companies, wrote in an email statement in regard to the board’s upper payment limit. “Colorado is risking patient access and jeopardizing the development of new medicines.”
Porter argued that PBMs and health insurers, not drugmakers, drive high costs.
But PBMs say their negotiations lower costs.
“Big Pharma sets the price — and the price is the problem when it comes to Americans facing difficulty affording their prescription drugs,” Mike Baldyga, a spokesperson for the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, which represents pharmacy benefit managers, wrote in an email statement. “PBMs are the only entity in the drug supply chain that lower prescription drug costs on behalf of patients, and there is no correlation between the rebates they negotiate and list prices.”
Hensley-Quinn, of the National Academy for State Health Policy, noted the challenge of making drugs affordable and accessible.
“There is no silver bullet for lowering drug costs,” Hensley-Quinn said. “You have to balance being able to innovate and making sure that drugs are affordable so that what you have just created, which is life-changing, actually gets to the people that need it.”
But this challenge is in some ways expected and more evidence that states must take action, said Priya Telang, communications manager at the nonprofit advocacy group Colorado Consumer Health Initiative.
“Manufacturers point the finger at PBMs, and PBMs point the finger at insurers. And so it’s really hard to get a sense of who the actual bad players are all at the same time,” she said.
“And so that’s why it’s critical for affordability boards to exist, because they get to see the data, they get to see behind closed doors what the root causes are and really work to bring affordability to consumers.”
Drug affordability boards
When Mary Fowler Simmons, 54, was diagnosed with an advanced cancer three years ago, she had to give up her steady job as a state government worker in Virginia to go through months of expensive and painful treatment. Fowler Simmons survived and is cancer-free today, but is still reeling financially.
Fowler Simmons told Stateline that after being saddled with a hospital bill totaling over $323,000 and depleting her savings, she and her husband continue to pay around $300 a month — after insurance — for prescription medications to maintain her health.










I need them to actually consider what they are doing to the American people and just have affordable prescription drugs available.


– Mary Fowler Simmons, a cancer survivor


Fowler Simmons, who also has Type 2 diabetes, says she wants her state and federal lawmakers to recognize that some Americans are having to choose between paying for their next meal or their necessary prescription drugs.
“They need to have more compassion for people. We’re not in the position that we are making millions, that we can afford this. We’re working-class people,” Fowler Simmons said. “I need them to actually consider what they are doing to the American people and just have affordable prescription drugs available.”
Otto Wachsmann, a Republican in the Virginia House of Delegates and a pharmacist, said that he doesn’t think there’s enough evidence yet that prescription drug affordability review boards work.
He said if states set upper payment limits on drugs, that doesn’t mean a pharmaceutical company would necessarily lower the cost. Rather, he says, pharmacies may just get reimbursed even less than the cost of the drug. This year Virginia lawmakers tried to create a drug affordability review board.
“There’s nothing to prevent the board from saying we’re only going to reimburse $100 for this prescription, although those pharmacies may have to pay $120 for the drug,” Wachsmann said in an interview.
He added that if review boards target expensive and rare drugs for which to set upper payment limits, they could stifle innovation.
“If those manufacturers think that those are the type of drugs that are going to get hit by these boards and they realize they’ll never get their investment back, they’re not going to develop those drugs anymore,” Wachsmann said.
Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a bill this year that would have created a drug affordability board in the state, saying in a statement, “This approach could limit access to treatments and hinder medical innovation, especially for life-threatening or rare diseases.”
Wachsmann had voted against the board. Instead, he says it’s better to target PBMs, because he said they are engaging in predatory practices that freeze out small pharmacies and leave consumers with nowhere to go.
Neighboring Maryland created the nation’s first drug affordability board in 2019; it got a boost of resources and revved up activities in 2023.
“It will not hurt pharmacists. It will help everybody except Big Pharma,” said Vincent DeMarco, president of health care advocacy group Maryland Health Care for All, in speaking about the state’s drug affordability review board.
The original bill creating the board only authorized the board to create upper payment limits for drugs purchased by states and local governments in Maryland. But this year, Moore signed a law to expand the authority of the board to create upper payment limits for everyone, except patients on health plans regulated by the federal government.
DeMarco said he’s hoping the board will move to create limits on two popular drugs prescribed for Type 2 diabetes, Jardiance and Farxiga.
“In addition to individuals who can’t afford their drugs, all of us pay the price in higher health insurance premiums, because a big part of our health insurance premiums is high-cost drugs,” DeMarco said.

An annual report from the Wisconsin Hospital Association says hospitals in the state are doing better financially, but face uncertainty. (Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Uncompensated health care at Wisconsin hospitals rose more then 30% in 2024 from the year before, according to a new report from the Wisconsin Hospital Association.
People without health insurance or regular health providers are using emergency rooms more, the report also finds.
The association annually assesses the state of Wisconsin hospitals, including their finances, utilization and staffing. The 2024 report was released Thursday.
“We are seeing a modest improvement in hospital financials across the state,” said Kyle O’Brien, president of the Wisconsin Hospital Association, in an interview. Nevertheless, he added, “there’s a lot of uncertainty in the health care market right now.”
While the state’s hospitals were doing better in 2024 than in the previous two years, 40 hospitals had a negative operating margin, O’Brien said, and many hospitals across the state where margins were positive, but narrow.
Uncompensated care includes charity care — provided by the hospital with the full knowledge that the cost won’t be covered — as well as bad debt: care for which the hospital expected to be paid but wasn’t.
In 2024, uncompensated care in both categories added up to $1.77 billion — a 30.5% increase over the 1.36 billion in uncompensated care in 2023.
O’Brien said several factors are responsible for that increase. One of those is generally higher deductibles on health insurance plans, requiring patients to spend more out of pocket before their insurance coverage kicks in.
“If that patient can’t pay for that higher out-of-pocket [expense], hospitals are the ones that either have to try to collect those dollars, or they are the ones that provide relief through charity care, bad debt policies, or things like that,” O’Brien said.
For hospitals, another top concern is how much Medicaid pays to cover the cost of care.
State budgets over the last decade have been increasing Medicaid hospital payments, O’Brien said, with the 2025-27 budget having the largest increases to date. Even so, he said, hospital Medicaid reimbursements fall short of fully covering the cost of the care that Medicaid is supposed to cover.
Decisions by health insurance to deny coverage are a source of “general consternation” for hospitals, O’Brien said — both with group health insurance policies but also for Medicare Advantage policies. Medicare Advantage policies are sold to people eligible for the federal Medicare program but are instead provided by private insurance companies.
O’Brien said the hospital association is also concerned about projected increases in people without health insurance as a result of higher premiums paid by people who buy their own insurance at the federal marketplace, HealthCare.gov, created under the Affordable Care Act.
Enhanced subsidies for HealthCare.gov policies enacted in 2021 will expire at the end of this year unless they are renewed. The subsidies are provided in the form of federal income tax credits for consumers who purchase insurance through HealthCare.gov
This week the state Office of the Commissioner of Insurance released projected rates for 2026 that reflected the loss of those enhanced subsidies.
Those higher costs have prompted widespread predictions that, after years in which enrollment in the marketplace plans has set new records, enrollment will drop off and more people with go without health insurance instead.
“We are certainly concerned anytime there’s a potential that somebody might lose coverage,” O’Brien said. Federal law requires hospitals to treat patients whether or not they are able to pay.
“We have been advocating with the congressional delegation to reauthorize those enhanced premium tax credits,” O’Brien said. He said members of Congress have been focused on “issues that are playing out right now [that] may be even bigger than hospital-related issues, but I think that they understand our concerns.”

The poll results, which were released this week, actually are far more in line with not only the state’s past political affiliations, but the attitudes and priorities of Montana’s past.  
In short, we still favor the right of individual privacy – with 83% supporting the Montana Constitutional amendment to ensure a woman’s right to make their own decisions when it comes to reproductive choices.
We still believe in separation of church and state — as reflected in the disapproval of mandatory prayer in schools by 59% compared to 21% who approve. 
We’re still strong supporters of Second Amendment gun rights.  But perhaps in response to the wave of mass shootings nationwide, a whopping 63% of those polled support stricter regulations, weapons limitations, and provisions for owning firearms.  
The most significant indicator of our less than ruby red status is in the approval/disapproval rating of top elected officials from Donald Trump to Congress to Gov. Greg Gianforte. In this regard, none of them came even close to breaking even.
Despite showing 58% of Montanans voted for Trump, his approval and disapproval ratings are tied at a mere 41% – and yes, those are seriously skewed by party affiliation with about 3-out of-4 Republicans approving, but 9-out of-10 Democrats and a whopping 48% of independents disapproving.  Not exactly a great showing for MAGA given its 24-7 domination of the news cycle with endless and often baseless braggadocio.
Still and all, if Trump only gets 41%, he’s slightly ahead of our all-GOP Congressional delegation, which is strange since Montanans are supposedly more supportive of their local politicians.
Guess not, eh?  
Gianforte, having been in office now since 2017 as both our Congressman and now into his second term as governor, “topped” the ratings with a paltry 37% approval.  
Perhaps his approach that Montana is an “easy product to sell” hasn’t exactly proved popular with those who would just as soon keep Montana the way it was and is — and not sell everything to the highest bidder while degrading the vast natural assets and beauty most Montanans cherish. 
Even those minimal approval numbers are far beyond what Montanans give Congress (13% approve, 56% disapprove) and our Congressional delegation. 
At the bottom of the pack sits Congressman Troy Downing with a pitiful 16% approval, 15% disapproval and the vast number of respondents saying they don’t know.  So much for the promised transparency and constituent communication.  
Moving up from there, but not much, sits Rep. Ryan Zinke – in his second term — at 26% approval, only 4% above his disapproval at 22%.
Our senior senator, Steve Daines, doesn’t have much to pound his chest about either.  His 31% approval is exactly three points above his 28% disapproval.  
Then comes Sen. Tim Sheehy who, despite only his first year in office, winds up with 34% disapproval, exactly matching his 34% approval.   
Polls are just polls, but tough to argue we’re “deep red” when Montanans say they overwhelmingly think politics is more polarized, but just aren’t that crazy about the job Republicans are doing.
But here’s the rub: Unless the Democrats and/or independents get their act together and field some electable candidates, we’re likely to keep these low-approval Republicans in office — blundering along, parroting MAGA propaganda, and selling Montana to the highest bidders like just another commodity.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1216006088-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-31 06:56:41.496004

You're more likely to spot the night-time fliers in the summer — just about anywhere in Wyoming, one bat lover says.
The post Spooky or just misunderstood? Wyoming’s wide variety of bats are mostly hibernating for Halloween. appeared first on WyoFile .","Your chances of seeing a bat on Halloween, unless it’s a store-bought decoration or a candy-collecting kid adorned with black wings, are very low — despite the wide variety of real ones that live in and migrate through Wyoming.
They’re most often spotted in the summer and during migration season in the fall. By tonight — the end of international Bat Week — most of the fury fliers are already hibernating, according to local experts. But the animal’s association with the spookiest night of the year is unavoidable, for good or ill, a Wyoming bat aficionado told WyoFile.

“It makes me laugh,” said Ellen Whittle, who, instead of finding bats spooky, describes them as “adorable,” “chill” and “fascinating.” Then again, those are descriptors you might expect from a wildlife biologist who researches bats.
Whittle serves as bat project manager for the Wyoming Natural Diversity Database at the Berry Biodiversity Conservation Center in Laramie. When she’s not searching for bats in the field, she’s always eager to intervene in a batty situation when one needs to be rescued from a potential human interaction on the University of Wyoming campus.

One call she regrets not getting was when a western spotted bat was seen chilling on the outside of the College of Education building. The local animal shelter took the call instead — which is appropriate, Whittle said. But the rare-for-Wyoming bat had already been relocated before she got a chance to observe it.
“I would have dropped everything to go see this bat,” Whittle told WyoFile. “Everyone in the bat profession wants to see a spotted bat. It’s like our white whale. I was so jealous.”

As exhaustive “recalibration” process continues, committee adopts many consultant recommendations but may punt on school nutrition, school resource officers, counselors.
The post Lawmakers advance school funding model that includes teacher raises appeared first on WyoFile .","Beau Fulton, a parent and school board member in Park County, remembers when his Powell school district used to receive dozens of applicants for educational staff positions. 
The pool has diminished in recent years as Wyoming salaries have fallen in comparison to other states, he said.
“Now sometimes it is in the single digits,” Fulton told lawmakers Tuesday. 
It was a recurring theme during the Select Committee on School Finance Recalibration meeting in Casper. 
“The hiring environment in Wyoming right now is absolutely the toughest I’ve ever seen in my career, and that’s 31 years in administration,” Carbon County School District 1 Superintendent Mike Hamel said. 
Two years ago, Sheridan County District 2 Superintendent Scott Stults said, “for the first time this has ever happened in the 27 years I’ve been in Sheridan District 2, we went without a teacher. We had a machining teacher [position] that we could not fill for a full year. That speaks a little bit to the quality and to the quantity of applicants out there.” 
His district, he continued, experienced a 72% decrease in elementary school applicants between 2016-2025. Lagging salaries certainly factor into that, Stults said. “Salaries matter.”
A string of parents, teachers and educators testified before the committee, many urging lawmakers to properly fund education staff salaries — be it veteran instructors, janitors or classroom aides.  
At the end of the two-day meeting, committee members, who are tasked with overseeing Wyoming’s public school funding “recalibration” process, appeared amenable to the salary pleas. Lawmakers directed legislative staff to draft a recalibration bill that would set average weighted teacher salaries at $70,000, a bump from the model’s current weighted average of under $60,000. Other suggestions for a draft include paying substitute teachers more, providing more resources for career and technical education programs and setting a cap on how much superintendents get paid based on district teacher salaries.
However, lawmakers may delay funding decisions for school nutrition programs, school resource officers, mental health counselors and other facets. That’s because committee member Rep. John Bear, R-Gillette, asked legislative staff to hold those topics over for further study during the next legislative off-season, or interim. 
“There are certain things that we just need more data on,” Bear said.

The committee’s co-chair, Sen. Tim Salazar, R-Riverton, stressed that it’s still relatively early in the exhaustive process of assessing the state’s funding model. 
The draft that comes out of this week’s meetings, Salazar said, “is a beginning.” He expects there will be some tweaking, he said, and promised more public comment opportunities at the committee’s next meeting in January. 
Ultimately, the process will shape what Wyoming’s public school landscape looks like, with significant implications for the state’s students. Lawmakers, many of whom are parents, said it’s not a task they take lightly. 
“This has been a heavy lift,” said co-chair Rep. Scott Heiner, R-Green River. “For many of us, this is one of the most difficult committees we’ve been on.” 
Mandates and court rulings 
The recalibration process is required every five years to ensure the Legislature fulfills its constitutional duty to “provide for the establishment and maintenance of a complete and uniform system of public instruction.” 
To do that, the state’s consultants, Picus, Odden and Associates, have been holding meetings with Wyoming educators, analyzing data and making recommendations over the course of many months.
The consultants presented their preliminary findings to the committee in September. Amid the minutiae and acronym-heavy language of education, several issues emerged as topics of high interest for educators and lawmakers — including teacher retention, school resource officers, school nutrition programs and technology.
Many of those overlap with areas identified in a February district court ruling that found the Wyoming Legislature violated the state’s constitution by underfunding public education and must amend that. The ruling, which the state is appealing, is the latest in a string of court cases that have further delineated the state’s education obligations.

In his 186-page order, Laramie County District Court Judge Peter Froelicher found the Legislature failed to properly fund the “basket of quality educational goods and services,” that the Wyoming Supreme Court in 1995 ordered lawmakers to set, update and fund every two years. 
The judge also found the state failed to properly adjust funding for inflation; failed to provide funding for adequate salaries for teachers and staff; and failed to provide sufficient funding for mental health counselors, school safety resource officers, nutritional programs and computers for students. Lawmakers also have failed to properly assess school buildings for “educational suitability,” and have allowed inadequate facilities to exist for too long without repair or replacement, he ruled.
Though much of this week’s meeting was spent on those provisions the judge identified, some lawmakers cast skepticism on the ruling, portraying it as one person’s opinion that won’t necessarily stand. 
The issue of pay  
Consultants brought Dr. Christiana Stoddard, a Montana economics professor, to present a report on Wyoming’s teacher and nonteacher labor markets. 
Stoddard, who has studied the issue in Wyoming for 20 years, noted that “labor markets really matter because they affect the quality of teachers.” The body of research, she continued, shows that “a high-quality teacher makes a big difference in a classroom for the success of the students.”
Wyoming used to rank well above surrounding states for teacher pay, she said, but that’s changed. Utah and Colorado have actually surpassed Wyoming, while other states are closing in. 
Wyoming school districts, she explained, generally pay more than what the state model calls for. The state model’s weighted average for the school year 2024/2025 was a little under $60,000 according to a graph Stoddard presented. Because districts find funds from elsewhere to pad that, the state’s actual average salary that year was a little over $65,000, according to her data. 
Wyoming continues to do very well when it comes to keeping its percentage of very-low-paid teachers small, Stoddard said. What is also small, however, is the percentage of teachers who are very highly paid.

Wyoming teacher pay has eroded in relation to other professions, she said, and about half of Wyoming’s new education hires are green with no teaching experience.
Stoddard recommended that the committee set the state’s funding model teaching salary to ensure the weighted average salary is equal to $70,560 for 2025/26. That, Stoddard said, would make Wyoming more competitive with Colorado and Utah, which tallied average teacher salaries around $70,000 in 2024/2025.
Kiley McConnell, a second-year teacher in Sheridan School District 3, urged the committee to make $70,000 the starting salary, not the average. In Sheridan County, where the average home costs $400,000, McConnell said, it’s not possible to buy a home on her current salary of $48,000. 
“The opportunity for me to be investing back in my community, wanting to stay where I am and continue to teach becomes more and more difficult because of the salary limits,” she testified. 
To be continued …
Housing strains came up several times during the meeting, along with issues like how to fund counselors, finding resources for increasing disciplinary needs, whether individual computer devices are necessary or harmful for students and the role that school nutrition can play in education. 
Lawmakers also expressed doubts about finding solutions to all the issues before them within the timeframe. And given Bear’s suggestion, several topics may have to wait until 2026 for more thorough investigation before the state determines how to fund them. 
Lawmakers also issued directions related to school insurance, reimbursement schedules, using a hedonic index to adjust costs over time and capital construction guide posts.

When asked at the meeting Wednesday what message the public can help spread about recalibration, Speaker of the House Chip Neiman, R-Hulett, emphasized that the committee members take their task very seriously.
“We are going to commit to the people of the state of Wyoming, from my perspective, to do the very best job we possibly can with the resources that we have to take proper and just care of our kids,” Neiman said. 
People who are involved in education, he said, have students’ best interests in mind. “That’s not lost on this committee or on your Wyoming Legislature,” he said, but he noted that lawmakers have to balance those priorities with all the other constituent concerns.
The committee will take up the draft recalibration bill when it meets again Jan. 22-23 in Cheyenne.

In a press release issued last week, the groups Vote Solar and the Sierra Club announced that they filed the petition and have asked the Idaho Public Utilities Commission, or PUC, to create  a working group to review the fairness of solar reimbursement rates before the next scheduled review in 2028.
“The PUC acknowledged that the Export Credit Rates are unreasonable and volatile, which is why they chose to limit this year’s changes and delay the next change until 2028,“ Lisa Young, Sierra Club Idaho Chapter director, said in a written statement. “But this is just a temporary Band-Aid. We need to come together to make real improvements to the methodology. Otherwise, communities in Idaho will face the same problem all over again in 2028.”
On Sept. 30, the Idaho Public Utilities Commission approved new, decreased reimbursements rates, which are called export credit rates, that Idaho Power pays its rooftop solar customers, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
The decreased solar power reimbursement rates apply to more than 14,000 Idaho Power customers who have rooftop solar systems or other on-site generation systems that were installed prior to Dec. 20, 2020. Idaho Power customers who had their solar systems installed prior to Dec. 20, 2020, are not subject to the decreased reimbursement rates because they are considered legacy customers and grandfathered in, officials said. 
Aside from rooftop solar panel systems, other types of on-site generation systems include wind systems, but solar systems are the most common. 
Idaho Power had applied to reduce solar reimbursement rates even further, but the utilities commission approved a smaller decrease after expressing concerns about the impact the change would have on solar customers. 
“The commission recognized that all customers have faced increases to their average monthly bills over the past 18 months, and the proposed update to the (export credit rate) would further affect customers in Schedules 6, 8 and 84,” the utilities commission said in a news release issued Oct. 2.
The commission is charged with regulating investor-owned utility companies that provide electricity, gas, water and some telephone services for a profit, according to the commission’s website. Examples of utilities the commission regulates include Idaho Power, Rocky Mountain Power and Intermountain Gas.

In an interview in October, Idaho Power officials said they request the decrease in reimbursement rates for their rooftop solar customers to more accurately reflect energy costs and avoid overcompensating customers who generate their own energy through rooftop solar systems.
Company spokesman Jordan Rodriguez told the Idaho Capital Sun that Idaho Power originally reimbursed its solar customers with the same retail rate that other customers paid on the electric bills. But Rodriguez said the original reimbursement rates did not take into account expenses that Idaho Power has to provide electricity, such as operating and maintaining the electrical grid and employing staff. 
“When some customers are being overcompensated with the full retail rate credit, the difference is made up by the rest of our customers, 98% of which do not have rooftop solar or other on-site generation,” Rodriguez said earlier in October.
Solar advocates who are asking for the Idaho Public Utilities Commission to review the fairness of solar reimbursement rates prior to 2028 say it is unfair to customers invested in solar panel systems to keep changing the reimbursement rates they are given.
“Families in Idaho turn to rooftop solar to gain stability and independence from unpredictable and ever-rising utility costs,” Kate Bowman, Vote Solar’s Interior West senior regulatory director, said in a written statement. “Unfortunately, the current solar export rate structure undermines that stability — it’s designed to change from year to year and is biased toward utility profits, leaving solar customers exposed to unpredictable energy bills and unfair compensation rates.”

(Photo:John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)With the looming prospect of federal food aid disappearing for nearly 1 in 10 Tennesseans starting Saturday, state Democratic lawmakers – and at least one Republican – have urged Gov. Bill Lee to follow the example of other state governors in taking action. 
Lee, who’s out of state this week on an economic trip to Asia, has thus far declined to tap state resources to help mitigate the loss of more than $145 million in monthly food aid intended for the state’s poorest residents – among them more than 300,000 children living in poverty. 
Instead, Lee, a Republican, blamed Democrats in Congress for the government shutdown that has frozen the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, a federally funded program that loads about $340 a month onto a debit card for a family of four to use at the grocery store.
“Their failure to fund federal nutrition programs cannot be solved by states, and the void cannot be filled with temporary fixes that would only drain state resources and prolong the misery of this shutdown,” Lee said in a statement.
Lee announced Thursday he had set up a website, www.feedtn.org, to connect Tennesseans in need of food with local pantries. 
A high percentage of rural Tennesseans use SNAP, as funding set to dry up

At least 24 other states, however, have found ways to tap into funding to bridge the loss of November SNAP benefits. 
In Louisiana, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry announced he would direct $150 million from the state’s health department budget to aid SNAP recipients. In New Mexico, Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said $30 million in state-funded food benefits will be loaded onto existing SNAP debit cards to help New Mexicans buy food through Nov. 10. 
A coalition of 25 Democrat-led states also sued the federal government seeking an emergency court order to restore federal SNAP funding before it runs out on Nov. 1. A Massachusetts federal judge said she would soon rule on their emergency request to force the Trump administration to tap contingency funds to provide November SNAP benefits.
The Trump administration has warned states they will not be reimbursed for using funding to aid SNAP recipients during the government shutdown.
Tennessee lawmakers urge Lee to act
The Tennessee Senate Democratic Caucus on Thursday sent a letter to Lee urging the governor to declare a state of emergency to coordinate hunger relief in the state. 
“Under a state of emergency, your administration would be empowered to utilize all available state resources, direct emergency funds, expand local food assistance, and bolster the capacity of food banks and faith-based groups already doing God’s work in our communities,” the Democrats wrote.
Republican Sen. Paul Bailey of Sparta, on Thursday, urged Lee “to find a way to protect Tennessee families from losing access to essential food assistance benefits.”
“We can’t wait on the federal government to act,” Bailey said in a statement. “Tennessee should take the lead in meeting this challenge. Let’s show the rest of the country what it looks like when leaders put people before politics and compassion before bureaucracy.”
Tennessee currently has more than $2 billion in its state rainy day fund that could be tapped, Democratic lawmakers noted. 
Tennessee governor warns of SNAP lapse, blames Democrats for shutdown

SNAP is funded by the federal government and administered by the Tennessee Department of Human Services, which contracts with an outside vendor to electronically load SNAP cash benefits onto debit cards families use at the grocery store.
On Thursday, Department of Human Services Commissioner Clarence Carter told lawmakers in a House committee hearing that, even if state funding were made available, the vendor the state relies on to distribute SNAP dollars to 690,000 Tennesseans has no mechanism to tap state funds.
The vendor is only able to access a federal line of credit to refill the SNAP debit cards, he said. 
“We don’t have the ability to recreate that mechanism overnight,” he said. 
A spokesperson for the Department of Human Services did not respond to questions about the SNAP distribution system. 
Vermont, which operates a similar system to distribute federal SNAP aid, announced Wednesday it would reprogram its debit card system to distribute more than $6 million in funding to its residents.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC04521-copy-1024x601.jpg,,,2025-10-31 06:16:53.172274

 Election 2025
Coloradans are voting on two statewide ballot measures and a variety of local issues in the off-year election. Click here for more of Newsline’s coverage.

A combined total of more than $2.5 million has been spent by an array of outside groups seeking to influence school board races in some of Colorado’s largest public school districts. More than half of that has been spent on races for the Denver Public Schools board, where a deep-pocketed reform group hopes to wrest control away from candidates backed by teachers unions.
Colorado holds coordinated off-year elections to choose candidates for certain school boards, municipal offices and other local races, often alongside one or more statewide ballot issues. In 2025, Colorado lawmakers have referred two measures to the ballot, Propositions LL and MM, which would shore up funding for the state’s universal school meals program.

Election Day is Nov. 4. Voters who have already received their ballot can return it by dropping it off in a secure drop box or at an in-person polling location. It’s too late to return a ballot through the mail, or to receive a new or replacement ballot through the mail, but all eligible voters can still register and vote in person by visiting a polling location until 7 p.m. on Election Day.
Information about ballot drop box and in-person service locations is available at local county clerks’ websites. Voters can sign up for the state’s BallotTrax system, which tracks the status of ballots and notifies voters when their ballot is received and counted.
Super PAC spending
Once again, board elections in Colorado’s largest public school district are being heavily influenced by an independent expenditure committee known as Better Leaders, Stronger Schools. The group spent more than $1 million on DPS races in 2023, helping its endorsed candidates sweep the three seats up for election that year, and it’s on pace to break the $1 million mark again in 2025.
Independent expenditure committees, also known as super PACs, can spend unlimited sums of money to influence elections but are barred from coordinating directly with candidates.
The Better Leaders, Stronger Schools committee’s top donor, Denver Families Action, was founded in 2020 and has roots in the pro-charter “school reform” movement, though its leaders say they have broadened their focus to issues of declining enrollment and school safety, while pivoting away from past reform priorities like standardized testing. The group also received a $40,000 contribution from billionaire Republican megadonor Phil Anschutz in September, according to campaign finance disclosures.
The second-largest overall super PAC spender in 2025 is Students Deserve Better, a group funded by the Colorado Education Association, the statewide teachers union. The PAC has reported spending a combined total of $821,348 to support candidates in a half dozen school board races across the state. About a third of that total was spent to support union-backed DPS candidates.
Colorado Springs
Students Deserve Better has also spent $216,296 to influence board races in Colorado Springs School District 11, where seven candidates are vying for three seats elected at large. In 2024, the District 11 board’s conservative majority voted to end its collective bargaining agreement with the Colorado Springs Education Association, a decision that hundreds of teachers protested in a one-day strike earlier this month.
D11 Parents and Teachers, a new super PAC registered in September, has spent over $140,000 to support conservative candidates. Disclosures show that the group is wholly funded by Advance Colorado, a right-wing “dark money” group that does not disclose its donors.
Douglas County
In Douglas County, a suburban battleground where school board politics have been fractious in recent years, the biggest spender to date is Colorado Labor Action, a committee that has spent $129,815 to support a slate of union-backed candidates. The PAC reported receiving a single contribution of $130,000 from a group affiliated with the American Federation of Teachers in early October.
Meanwhile, a conservative slate of candidates in Douglas County has benefited from over $62,000 in spending by Neighbors for a Better Colorado, another newly registered super PAC. The group has also reported spending on behalf of conservative school board candidates in Durango and the campaign of veteran GOP operative Roger Hudson for Castle Pines mayor. It has received two contributions totaling $115,000 from RTR Research Inc., a nonprofit registered in Colorado last year. RTR Research’s articles of incorporation were filed by election attorney and former Republican secretary of state Scott Gessler.

(Getty Images)Across the country, career and technical education is reshaping ideas of what high school should be, and momentum continues to build. Enrollment is rising, states are investing heavily and politicians on both sides of the aisle see CTE as a practical way to prepare students for good jobs in a changing economy, without requiring them to take on more education debt than necessary. As a result, states are now incorporating CTE measures into their accountability systems, signaling that success after high school isn’t measured solely by test scores or four-year college enrollment.
On the surface, this is good news. Today’s CTE looks nothing like the “vocational ed” of the past. Students are earning credentials and college credits in fields like health sciences, IT, engineering, and advanced manufacturing. And the results are clear: Rigorous studies show that high-quality CTE increases graduation rates, boosts college enrollment and improves access to well-paying jobs, whether it’s after college or in a skilled trade.
But beneath the headline numbers lies a harder truth: In too many places, CTE remains a loose set of electives with little structure or alignment to industry standards. Courses may look modern, such as “Intro to Business,” but without clear pathways or rigorous content, they rarely lead to meaningful skills, credentials or good jobs. Much like other “evidence-based” initiatives, how a program is structured matters much more than whether or not it is offered.
Combining higher education and K-12 posts could have lasting impacts

The danger of low-quality CTE is that it risks giving a false sense of progress. Labeling courses “career-ready” doesn’t make them so. Worse, inequities creep in if students are steered into career tracks with weaker labor market returns. And we’ve seen this film before: In the 1960s, federal vocational education bills promised to reduce inequality but by the 1980s, it was clear that the system had too often reinforced tracking, essentially segregating some students from rigorous academic coursework. Without high standards and greater accountability, low-quality CTE risks repeating that history.
So, what distinguishes CTE programs that truly pay off from those that don’t? By studying models that have demonstrated success, we can identify the features that should be scaled across more schools. A new EdResearch for Action brief does exactly this, looking across the existing research to identify clear lessons about what makes CTE programs high-quality.
The strongest CTE programs offer structured, sequenced pathways, not a few disconnected electives. Students who take at least three aligned courses in a single career area consistently fare better than those who take standalone courses. Benefits accrue to these students in the form of higher graduation rates, as well as either higher college enrollment or stronger earnings. High-quality programs also make work-based learning a core feature rather than an afterthought. Well-designed internships, apprenticeships and employer-linked projects give students the kind of hands-on experience that builds both confidence and skills.
Just as important are partnerships with employers and with colleges. Industry partners ensure students are learning on up-to-date equipment and tackling relevant problems; higher education partners create early-credit opportunities and smooth transitions into degree programs. The most effective programs also recruit teachers with real-world experience, valuing practical expertise as much as traditional certification.
Finally, equity must be a design principle, not an afterthought. Schools should make sure CTE courses fit within students’ schedules, expand access to underrepresented groups, and track participation and outcomes to identify gaps. After all, the promise of CTE is not simply to prepare some students for good jobs but to ensure every student can connect learning to opportunity.
Nebraska is taking a bold approach in rural communities with its reVISION initiative.
Rather than leaving small districts to build programs in isolation, the state requires each district to conduct a data-driven needs assessment and supports regional collaboration through reVISION Action Grants. Districts then pool resources, staff and industry partnerships to design stronger, more equitable programs.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The result: regional CTE hubs, mobile labs, and virtual courses that bring specialized programs like cybersecurity to even the most remote towns. By embedding collaboration and workforce alignment into state policy, Nebraska shows how geography doesn’t have to limit opportunity.
Washington state is rethinking who can teach CTE through its Business & Industry (B&I) pathway, which allows skilled professionals with substantial industry experience to get certified without a bachelor’s degree. Candidates complete a streamlined pedagogy program, making it easier for industry experts to transition into classrooms. This approach maintains instructional training requirements and expands and diversifies the CTE teacher pipeline so that students learn from educators who know both their craft and how to teach it.
Ultimately, high-quality CTE is tied to real-world experiences that are hard to measure, vary across states, and available data provide only a partial picture. The federal government has a key role to play in tracking the results of these programs. Yet the latest proposal from the federal government would scale back what little we already collect, making it even harder to identify high-quality programs. 
If Washington is serious about preparing students for good jobs, it should strengthen, not shrink, its role in collecting and sharing useful data. We lack the equivalent of a “Nation’s Report Card” for career readiness: common, rigorous measures that show which programs align with labor-market needs and promote economic opportunity. Without stronger data and federal leadership, CTE risks becoming a black box: highly visible in name but opaque in impact.
To deliver on the promise of CTE, we cannot settle for programs that look good on paper but fail to prepare students for real opportunity. Every student needs access to a rigorous program connected to postsecondary education and local workforce needs. That’s not the case today, but it can be, if leaders prioritize quality and equity in every CTE investment they make.

Bill Lee indicates the federal government will fund National Guard troops in Memphis through Sept. 2026. (Photo: Karen Pulfer-Focht/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee National Guard soldiers could be patrolling Memphis for up to a year, lending credence to the governor’s prediction that the crime task force in Memphis could be permanent.
U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth notified Gov. Bill Lee in a Sept. 23 letter that the U.S. Department of Defense is prepared to authorize and fund up to 1,000 Tennessee National Guard personnel to work with the Memphis Safe Task Force through September 2026.
“Tennessee, particularly in Memphis, is currently facing a convergence of public safety threats that exceed the capacity of local law enforcement agencies,” Hegseth, a Sumner County resident, said in the letter.
The Lookout obtained the letter in a public records request for communications between the Trump administration and Lee’s people, most of which the state rejected as falling under attorney-client privilege. 
Despite a major crime reduction in the first part of 2025, Hegseth said Memphis’ violent crime rates remain among the nation’s highest and local law enforcement has reported difficulty staffing the force. All of that is compounded by the city’s location along interstates, making it a distribution hub for narcotics trafficking and organized crime, Hegseth said. 
Tennessee National Guard personnel started patrolling in Memphis as part of a federal, state and local crime task force about a month ago. Lee said recently he believes the crime-fighting surge should “last forever.”
Unarmed Guard personnel, who are mainly walking the streets and talking to people, are considered a godsend by some and a waste of time and money by others.. 
A group of state and local officials responded by filing suit over the deployment last week, saying it violates the Tennessee Constitution.
A representative of Democracy Forward, a nonprofit group handling the lawsuit, said the mobilization is a “direct violation of the state Constitution.” The Guard shouldn’t be deployed unless a rebellion or invasion is taking place, and even then, the local government has to request it or the legislature has to approve it, attorney Yenisey Rodriguez said.

But Hegseth wrote in his letter to Lee that National Guard personnel would be operating under a status that supports the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security in Memphis “consistent with the Posse Comitatus Act.” The act generally prohibits federal forces from being used for law enforcement, but Hegseth said it doesn’t apply to the National Guard in this case, “allowing them to engage in law enforcement operations under the authorities of the requesting Federal agencies.” 
The secretary added that his office expects the departments of Justice and Homeland Security will request support for law enforcement presence in high-crime neighborhoods, as well as assistance with narcotics interdiction and logistical and communications support with local agencies.
Asked about a potential year-long stay by the Guard, state Rep. Jesse Chism, a Memphis Democrat, said he doesn’t think the soldiers are needed at all, much less for a year.
“The work that I’ve heard of them doing is mostly of a support nature, and that they are not the ones taking the dangerous criminals off of our streets. I think their purpose in our city is more to make a political statement than anything else.”
“I continue to believe that a better course of action would be to take the funding we are spending on the National Guard and investing it in the men and women of the Memphis Police Department who were already making a difference in our community,” Chism said.
More than likely, though, it could go on “forever, forever, forever …”
“Come on and tell me who are you”
Republican nominee Matt Van Epps launched an ad this week attacking his opponent, Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn, calling her a “woke liberal” and castigating her for chasing federal agents and state troopers during a summer sweep of South Nashville, an area heavily populated with immigrants.
It’s the first real salvo for the 7th Congressional District seat vacated by Mark Green.
Behn responded by telling the Lookout, “I’m not surprised his first ad is negative because he doesn’t want to talk about rising healthcare costs or releasing the Epstein files.”
Truth be told, Van Epps hasn’t talked about anything with the Lookout, despite repeated efforts to see where he stands on issues ranging from a federal bill to keep SNAP (formerly food stamps) from lapsing, the constitutionality of the federal buildup in Memphis, inflation and economic uncertainty and how he plans to maintain momentum in the race heading toward the Dec. 2 special election.

The Van Epps campaign got so busy it forgot to answer the latter queries the Lookout sent by email last week. Then Van Epps refused to talk to a Lookout reporter this week before a Tennessee Roundtable conference at the State Library and Archives. 
These were not tough questions designed to trick the candidate. But alas, we must figure he’s aligning himself with President Donald Trump on every topic, since he adopted the “MAGA Matt” mantra during the Republican primary.
Behn, on the other hand, is more than willing to respond to questions, most likely because she’s playing from behind in a red district.
Asked if she supported a Republican-backed emergency plan to save SNAP benefits in November, Behn said both parties in Washington need to “get their act together” and reopen the government, fund the food program and stop the “spike” in healthcare costs.
Some states are responding to the emergency by suing to renew SNAP. Others are trying to come up with the money. Tennessee set up a website telling people where they might be able to go to find food.

Chris Hurt in House District 82.
Shaw, who often goes back to his preaching roots, objected to making the Bible the state’s official book.
Case dismissed
U.S. District Court Judge Eli Richardson dismissed state Rep. Justin Jones’ lawsuit against House Speaker Cameron Sexton and three staff members over expulsion and ensuing punishment for violating House rules. (Since when did decorum amount to a hill of beans in that joint?)
Jones filed the suit claiming, in part, his constitutional rights to free speech and due process were violated in the expulsion and then when he was removed from a committee and prohibited from speaking on the House floor for violating new rules adopted in 2024.
Richardson found that Jones, a Nashville Democrat, didn’t have standing in his complaint against House Chief Clerk Tammy Letzler, who notified him about the penalties, or House Sergeant at Arms Bobby Trotter, who turned off his keycard to Cordell Hull entry.

The judge did determine that he had standing to sue Sexton and Assistant Chief Clerk and Parliamentarian Daniel Hicks. But then Richardson found they had legislative immunity to all of Jones’ claims and tossed the lawsuit.
For those whose memory is getting worse than mine, Jones was half of the duo expelled for taking over the House floor in an anti-gun protest following the mass shooting at The Covenant School in 2023. (Rep. Gloria Johnson narrowly escaped expulsion when Republicans’ video showed her humming and twiddling her thumbs while Jones and Rep. Justin Pearson shouted and used a bullhorn to fire up the balcony audience that day.)
Sexton and the Republican-controlled House adopted new rules the following session to control public entrance to the balconies and keep disturbances down. It led to Jones’ statement that Sexton was “drunk with power,” which didn’t exactly endear him to the speaker. His seat on the Government Operations Committee was subsequently vacated, and he lost House time, which affected his state benefits. The judge, though, decided Jones couldn’t show enough personal injury because he’s back on the committee.
Clearly, the rules were designed to stop Jones, Pearson and those dratted rabble-rousers from regaining any semblance of footing on the House floor. But the judge determined the rules were adopted by the entire House, not Hicks or Sexton.
It should be noted that these rules led to off-the-record discussions during House sessions to decide the outcome of indiscretions. Someone pointed out these little rules parsings are worse than NFL video reviews because viewers don’t even have a chance to go to the fridge for another beer.

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)In August of 2024, the Center for American Progress released an analysis of how the Heritage Foundation’s 920-page document Project 2025 would impact each state.
The center indicated that if Project 2025 were implemented, West Virginia residents would eventually: 

Experience a tax increase of $2,185 for the average West Virginia family. People exceeding an annual income of $10 million would get a cut of $1.5 million.
Be forced to delay retirement to 69, negatively affecting 1.2 million West Virginia residents.
Have 70,000 West Virginia residents lose Medicaid coverage due to “lifetime caps.”
Be forced to pay more for prescription drugs by ending the current Medicare drug cost limitations, affecting 140,540 residents. 
Lose Head Start causing 8,480 low-income West Virginia children to be without day care. 
See 1,378 West Virginia teaching positions, serving 18,598 students, eliminated when Title I is abolished.

Back then, President Donald Trump claimed he knew nothing about it. Yes, Trump never read it. However, he appointed Russell Vought — the mastermind behind Project 2025 — to be Director of the Office of Management and Budget. 
Post election, Trump stated he would be meeting with “Russ Vought, he of PROJECT 2025 Fame, to determine which of the many Democrat Agencies, most of which are a political SCAM, he recommends to be cut, and whether or not those cuts will be temporary or permanent.” 
In his second term, Trump has been following Project 2025 right down to the smallest details. 
For example:
— Under Project 2025, the Affordable Care Act (p 468) was to be gutted. Medicaid expansion would be limited by adding bureaucratic, unenforceable “work requirements.” Mission accomplished and numerous West Virginia residents will suffer.
— Project 2025 politicizes health care, stating, “Cultural institutions like public libraries and public health agencies are only as ‘independent’ from public accountability as elected officials and voters permit.” Classifying public health departments as “cultural” versus health care provisions opens public health up to politics. Thus, it opens the way for a lawyer like Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to be undercutting science and redefining the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccines policy. Mission accomplished.
— The conservative plan advocated doing away with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (p 869) which it incorrectly classifies “as a shakedown mechanism to provide unaccountable funding to leftist nonprofits politically aligned with those who spearheaded its creation.” The Trump administration is vocally advocating for this approach and is well on its way to succeeding. Thus, consumers will again be left with no advocate for their interests while big business (Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, etc.) contributes money to the MAGA cause.
— Project 2025 (p 693) advocates “legislation that would ‘effectively abolish’ the Federal Reserve and replace it with ‘free banking,’ whereby ‘neither interest rates nor the supply of money’ would be ‘controlled by government.’” Trump’s moves to gain control of the Fed are the first step towards accomplishing this goal. Such a move would have disastrous economic consequences, leading to another Great Depression.
— Project 2025’s plan is to slash the size of the federal workforce (p 20), politicizing it while hindering its ability to function. This is based on the radical right assumption that there exists a “largely underworked, over-compensated, and unaccountable federal civilian workforce.” Along the same lines, the Trump administration is advised to “fill its ranks with political appointees” who would “overcome the federal government’s obstructionist Human Resources departments.” Mission accomplished.
— The federal Department of Education (c11, p365) would be abolished, and student aid slashed under Project 2025(c11, p385). Our public education system (c11, p390) would be undercut in favor of a stronger private sector presence. Trump is implementing these policies.
— Project 2025 slashes environmental regulations on businesses (c13, p440) while gutting Environmental Protection Agency regulations as well (p425/p 450). The strange rationale given is that the EPA is a “breeding ground for expansion of federal government influence” and that Democrats have a “global climate themed agenda.” Clearly, the authors want to ignore the severe climate threat facing the world.
 — Energy production via fossil fuels would be increased on federal lands (c16, p600) while federal funding for renewable energy projects would be cut (c12, p405). “A new Administration must immediately roll back Biden’s orders, reinstate the Trump-era Energy Dominance Agenda” (p 521). The Trump administration is implementing these policies while the environmental impact of these changes is ignored.
Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts stated prior to Trump’s second term, “We are in the process of the second American Revolution.” Unfortunately, with the U.S. Supreme Court having been packed by the extreme right and a GOP Congress bowing down to presidential whims, Roberts may be correct.

LNG liquefaction plant and export terminal on Sabine Pass in Cameron Parish. (Matthew White/Getty Images)New research shows a continuous pattern of air pollution violations from liquified natural gas export facilities in Southwest Louisiana. 
Three LNG export facilities in Cameron Parish are featured in a report from the Environmental Integrity Project, a nonprofit research organization. 
Sourced from federal and state data, the report documents federal Clean Air Act infractions for each of the past 12 quarters – spanning three years – at Cheniere Energy’s Sabine Pass LNG terminal and Venture Global’s Calcasieu Pass LNG terminal. The Cameron LNG export terminal in Hackberry has been out of compliance with the Clean Air Act for 11 of the past 12 quarters. 
Report author and Environmental Integrity Project research manager Alexandra Shaykevich spoke at a press event about the “terrible compliance record” for the LNG industry, noting that Southwest Louisiana facilities in particular have been in “nearly continuous” violation of the Clean Air Act for the past three years.
Venture Global and Cameron LNG did not respond to requests for comment on the report. Cheniere Energy had no comment.

Cameron Parish resident John Allaire lives within 30 miles of the three LNG facilities highlighted in the report – and six more that are planned or under construction.
“I live in the eye of this LNG hurricane,” Allaire said at a news conference this week announcing the report’s release.
Allaire’s home sits close enough to the Venture Global facility for him to see fiery plumes of methane flares from his patio. The Commonwealth LNG facility is planned 750 feet away from his property line, he said. 
“I’m surrounded on all sides,” he said. “It’s not the same coastal wetland estuary that it used to be.”
While each terminal provided varying explanations for its violations, Shaykevich said, common ones include: 

failure to report excess emissions and permit deviations to state regulators; 
exceeding allowed pollution limits for contaminants such as nitrous oxide, volatile organic compounds and sulphur dioxide; and 
failure to properly operate equipment meant to control pollution levels. 

Cameron LNG’s Clean Air Act violations included at least 89 instances of excess pollution that released thousands of pounds of benzine, a known carcinogen, from the facility into the surrounding environment, according to the report’s analysis of Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality records. 
“We need these companies to actually be good neighbors and not to continue causing suffering in the communities in which they operate,” said James Hiatt, director of local nonprofit For a Better Bayou at the news conference. 
Each of the three facilities had only two air enforcement actions opened from LDEQ, according to the report. Cheniere Energy had paid $225,000 in fines as of July 29, when state records were analyzed, for air quality violations. Financial penalties hadn’t yet been finalized for the other two facilities before the Environmental Integrity Project published its report. 
The report also included tallies of Clean Water Act violations for LNG terminals in Southwest Louisiana. Sabine Pass was out of compliance with the act’s standards for 8 of the past 12 quarters. Cameron LNG had violations in seven quarters, and Calcasieu had just one quarter with water-related infractions.
Cameron LNG had 27 effluent violations from July 2020 through June 2025. Sabine Pass had nine and Calcasieu Pass recorded one over the same period, according to the report’s analysis. The violations at Cameron LNG and Sabine Pass involved fecal coliform and suspended solids, such as algae, bacteria and industrial particles. The lone issue at Calcalsieu Pass involved only suspended solids. 
Shaykevich said the pattern of permit violations for existing facilities should be a factor in approving new facilities as the LNG industry continues its rapid expansion. 
“President Trump has aggressively promoted the liquefied natural gas industry, including by directing agencies to fast track certain approvals for LNG projects,” he said. “State and federal agencies should be slowing down and more carefully scrutinizing new applications for LNG export projects instead of speeding up permit reviews.”

The city of nearly 2,000 people is the county seat for Crawford County in the northern part of Michigan’s Lower Peninsula. Matt Vasilogambros/StatelineWhen I first joined Progress Michigan, I was excited to become the organization’s first rural communications coordinator. Having organized in very conservative small towns in Michigan, I knew there was important work to be done to drive forward a winning progressive narrative about how to lower costs and deliver a better future for folks who have historically been left behind.
For too long, people of all political stripes have discounted rural communities. I’m proud of the work I’ve put in to make this important change happen, but I also know there is still so much more to be done. This past week, Progress Michigan and nearly 40 other organizations from across the country released the 2025 Rural Policy Action Report.
The report outlines practical steps that Congress can take to immediately deliver for the American people –– something that is desperately needed right now.
Complete dysfunction in Washington is on full display this month. The government is shut down while the White House and congressional leadership are ignoring the upcoming deadline to prevent massive cost increases to health care. On top of that, farmers are unsure of when their next payments are going to arrive and families don’t know when they’re going to receive their food assistance, all while the White House uses our taxpayer dollars to knock down the East Wing and pay for a gaudy ballroom.











At the end of the day the majority of us believe we have a right to breathe clean air, drink clean water, and earn a fair wage while having a safe place to call home.


– Levi Teitel, Progress Michigan communications coordinator


Wealthy corporate interests stoke fear and division in order to distract us from the real problems plaguing rural communities across the country, and we must chart a path forward. The Rural Policy Action Report provides a roadmap for how we can make needed reinvestments to ensure everyone has a fair shot at economic success.
Whether you live in Marquette or Monroe or somewhere in between, most of us believe that we all need lower costs, higher wages and the freedom to make choices about our own lives in order to thrive. The 2025 Rural Policy Action Report gives specifics for how our elected officials can make this a reality for everyone. As rural communities and small towns continue to feel the impacts of consolidation, lack of federal investment and rising authoritarianism, folks are looking for answers to deliver prosperity and fairness.
The report provides a positive agenda to improve rural people’s lives and deliver lower costs, higher wages, and the freedom to make choices about our own lives. Since the original 2021 Rural Policy Action Report, we’ve achieved major victories like expanding low-cost renewable energy and preventing corporate mergers fueled by greed — proving that when we organize we can make change. However, many of those successes have been reversed in 2025, and new policies have added even more barriers to the future and strong communities we deserve. The report provides a detailed accounting of the progress and rollbacks of the priorities in previous reports.
To reshape the government for working people, the report highlights 26 policy priorities, organized into four pillars.


Rein in corporate greed and support workers, small businesses, and farmers


Invest in foundational infrastructure for thriving communities


Everyone gets a fair deal – no one should be discriminated against or excluded from the benefits of pillars 1 and 2


Steward our land and natural resources for a prosperous and sustainable future


The reforms in the report are popular. I know this because I’ve talked to people across the state about these needs. Regardless of our ZIP code or our background, most people believe in the core values that bind together these policies.
At the end of the day the majority of us believe we have a right to breathe clean air, drink clean water, and earn a fair wage while having a safe place to call home. That’s what the American dream is all about –– it’s an aspirational vision for what we know we can achieve. Rural communities have an important role to play in creating this change, and we can start by listening to one another and finding common ground.

(Photo by Perry Bennett/West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia’s system for distributing electronic SNAP benefits isn’t set up to receive an infusion of state dollars, according to the governor and lawmakers, leaving the state’s food banks and pantries in need of donations to keep people fed during the delayed food benefits. 
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, helps feed about 275,000 West Virginians, or one in six state residents. Nearly 40% of those recipients are children. 

To donate to Facing Hunger, visit the agency’s website. Donations can be made to Mountaineer Foodbank here.
Families who need assistance finding local pantries may call 211 or visit wv211.org.

Due to the federal government shutdown, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP, said “there will be no benefits issued” Nov. 1.
Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced this week he plans to give up to $13 million in state dollars to food banks and called on residents to match the contribution. Funding SNAP directly — about $47 million — isn’t the best option right now, according to the governor.
The state’s SNAP electronic benefits management company, Fidelity Information Services, is unable to accept direct state funding, according to the governor’s office. 
Del. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha
Del. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha, on Thursday noted an Oct. 24 memo from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that the agency would not use contingency funds to fund food stamps during the shutdown. 
She said the state cannot directly fund SNAP due to the change at Fidelity. 
“So even if we gave the money to the [West Virginia] Department of Human Services, they would not be able to directly load that money into SNAP accounts,” Young said. “So the best thing we can do is to fund our food banks. I realize that is not the same thing, but we don’t have the capacity to fund SNAP benefits because the federal government has taken an unprecedented move to stop the system.”
Morrisey posted on his X account Oct. 29 that Fidelity “does not believe that sending money through EBT is feasible over the next few months.” 
“This is why we’re proceeding with our plan which is the quickest way to get food to people who are in need,” he wrote. 
Caitlin Cook, director of advocacy and public policy at Mountaineer Food Bank, said SNAP is the most effective tool the country has to fight hunger. For every one meal the charitable food network food provides, SNAP provides nine, she said. 










There is no way the charitable food network can make up the full difference that SNAP benefits provide to the 144,000 households that received SNAP.


– Caitlin Cook, director of advocacy and public policy at Mountaineer Food Bank


“There is no way the charitable food network can make up the full difference that SNAP benefits provide to the 144,000 households that received SNAP,” Cook said. 
House Democrats ask Morrisey, GOP lawmakers to appropriate more food money 
In a news conference Thursday, Young and other Democrats in the West Virginia House of Delegates called on Morrisey and federal leaders to do more to address the SNAP crisis. They suggested calling a special legislative session so that lawmakers might appropriate money to food banks. 
W.Va. House Minority Leader Del. Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell
House Minority Leader Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell, said Morrisey has not done enough. 
“It takes $1.5 million a day to feed hungry mountaineers,” Hornbuckle said. “Ladies and gentlemen, we have over $60 million in surplus. We have a medical cannabis fund. We could even follow the lead of Ohio Gov. [Mike] Dewine, who tapped their Rainy Day Fund. There are outlets out there that we could be doing right now. It’s a dire situation.
“And so what we are doing as a caucus, we are asking to call us in a special session, whatever it is that needs to be done,” Hornbuckle said. “We will work together to get this thing done.”
Senate President Randy Smith did not respond to a question about whether the Republican-led Legislature would consider dipping into the state’s $1.4 billion in Rainy Day Fund for food banks. 
Lawmakers can utilize the Rainy Day Fund, an emergency fund of sorts, to cover acts of God, budget shortfalls and other things solely at the discretion of the Legislature.
House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, R-Clay
House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, R-Clay, was unable to answer questions for this story due to scheduling conflicts. During Morrisey’s press conference earlier this week, Hanshaw said food security is part of the government’s primary jobs of infrastructure and public safety. He applauded the governor for filling in the gap left by a “dysfunctional federal government.”
“Certainly no element of public safety rings more true to citizens, certainly across our state than food security,” Hanshaw said. “And in an environment in which food security is already a baked in problem that we in our communities experience every day, a federal government that has abdicated its responsibility to do basic services and provide basic funding for the functions of government is unacceptable.”
House Democrats also noted that Morrisey could dip into $500 million sitting in the governor’s contingency fund. 
Cook said that the federal government shutdown has also meant that the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Commodity Supplemental Food Program has also been on pause, which means that food assistance programs have less food inventory to distribute. 
The increased demand on feeding programs will come from multiple sources — including federal workers who are going without paychecks, people who aren’t receiving their SNAP benefits, and other people who are food insecure but ineligible for the SNAP program, she said. 
“So, the pressure is mounting on a charitable food network that’s already been stressed before this government shutdown,” Cook said. 
Drew Galang, spokesperson for Morrisey, said that, “The state continues to evaluate plans to prevent our citizens from going hungry should the federal shutdown continue past the first few weeks of November.”
He added that Morrisey’s actions to expedite and authorize over $14 million, which includes money allocated by lawmakers earlier this year for food banks, was expected to provide food assistance to SNAP recipients for up to two weeks.

But, unhealthy living conditions there have left her wondering if she may have to. 
Woods became sick after mold was discovered in her Alexander Hall dorm room earlier this semester, she said. She took multiple allergy medications for treatment. She filed multiple complaints with administration often getting “the run-around” from university housing officials and staff. 
But nothing changed, she said. Her parents are worried. 
“It hurts when I talk about it,” Woods said Monday, her voice trembling in the microphone in front of her peers. “I came to college for my career, my education … not just to complain about things I have to deal with as a student.”

Woods was among dozens of students, faculty, staff and alumni who packed the seats of a small auditorium at the historically Black university’s student center this week to participate in two community listening sessions. 
The sessions were to gather feedback on the qualifications they hope to see for the university’s next president. Many took the opportunity to express grievances to the Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning Board of Trustees and consultants of executive headhunting firm, AGB Search. 
Since May, the top job at Jackson State has been vacant. Marcus Thompson resigned as president less than two years into his tenure without explanation from the IHL board, which oversees and selects the university’s presidents. 
Thompson was the third president to depart in five years — in similar fashion to his two predecessors, Thomas Hudson and William Bynum. 
State lawmakers and supporters of Jackson State have repeatedly criticized the board’s opaque search process, calling for a fair, transparent national leadership search for the university.

Many say the constant leadership turnover has caused tremendous strain on the reputation and growth of  Jackson State, Mississippi’s largest HBCU located in the state’s capital.  
Like Woods, stakeholders said they didn’t want their next leader to be someone who can “meet the criteria,” but a president with a proven track record to hold administrators accountable, address ongoing challenges and ensure student success. 
Since August, the board search committee has collected input from constituents in an effort to build the job candidate profile. Kim Bobby, a consultant with AGB Search, told Mississippi Today that feedback shared from participants, including public comments made through IHL’s portal, will be used for the candidate vetting and recruitment process, which can take up to eight weeks. Consultants said they anticipate releasing the candidate profile for a national search in the next few weeks. 
‘People need to come out of the ivory tower’ 
Faculty and staff said they hope their next leader can mend relationships among colleagues in departments, boost salaries, address pay inequities and invest in research and academic programs, internships and opportunities for students. 
Dawn Bishop McLin, psychology professor, said the campus community has experienced trauma, likely from the exhaustion and frustration with the board’s search process these past few years. It has affected morale for anyone connected to the university. 
McLin would know. Her months-long federal lawsuit reached a tentative settlement agreement with IHL and Jackson State this summer after she was placed on leave pending termination in 2024. 
She said the university needs a leader who can “get back to the basics” and have “strong core values” like integrity and accountability and who will, most importantly, emphasize education and service.

“People need to come out of the ivory tower,” McLin said. “They need to walk the campus, they need to talk to the students. Talk to faculty. Jackson State has seeds of greatness that never left. We just need someone to nurture it.” 
Robby Luckett, professor of history and director of the Margaret Walker Center, said he believes in Jackson State. An investment in the HBCU can challenge predominantly white institutions like the University of Mississippi and Mississippi State University. But, it all begins with leadership, he said. 
“We have the opportunity to make this institution the envy of everyone in this state,” Luckett said. “If we have the right leadership, the right support from IHL and people above that, it could happen.” 
‘The future of this institution is in the hands of this next president’

 Students said they want the next Jackson State president to prioritize student housing, campus safety and student input. When they voice concerns about mistreatment of faculty, staff and administrators, they said they want officials to respect their feedback.
Just days before fall semester began, dozens of students were left without housing assignments, scrambling to figure out where they would live. More than 380 students signed a petition this semester calling on the administration to acknowledge the university’s housing shortage. 
Madison Jackson, a freshman affected by this situation, now lives a 25-minute drive off campus. She now has to plan her day based on whether staff can resolve issues before driving to campus. Many students refer to the phone conversations with staff as “bad customer service.” She wants the next president to address this problem. 
“Communication is really bad, honestly,” Jackson said. 
Jakari Holland, a junior studying political science, told consultants to make sure their next leader is vetted carefully. As a student leader on campus, he has seen Jackson State move away from being a “safe haven” to “a place where students don’t want to be.” He wants student voices considered when it comes to the decision making process.
“The future of this institution is in the hands of this next president,” Holland said. “We pay money here. And, we just need to make sure they are actually here for the people.” 
‘We want to get close to John A. Peoples’ 
Alumni and community residents expressed that the late notice about the campus listening sessions didn’t provide enough time and opportunity for the IHL board and AGB Search to engage with stakeholders. 
“It seems like you’re setting the pace already by the way you’re conducting the presidential search,” May Frances Bridges, a retired Jackson State employee and alum, said. 
Bridges said she had to make a few calls to catch a ride to the sessions. The Jackson State Tigers also played  Grambling University in a game in Las Vegas over the weekend, which could have made turnout for these sessions fairly low the first day, she said.

State lawmakers and city officials who participated told consultants they are looking for a leader who cares about the city of Jackson, its residents and community at large. 
“I don’t think we will ever see another John A. Peoples but we want to get close to John A. Peoples,” said Sen. Sollie Norwood, a Democrat from Jackson and 1974 JSU alumnus. 
Peoples, who served as university president from 1967-1984, is widely regarded as the university’s best president. Many alumni shared stories of their experience under his leadership and how he emphasized the need to respect the campus community to survive and thrive. 
“Everybody wants to be treated with dignity and respect and that’s what he exemplified and that’s what we were accustomed too,” Bridges said, echoing Norwood’s public comment regarding Peoples.

Norwood also said he is looking for a leader whose “toolbox” includes fundraising. Over time, the Legislature has decreased funding support for all state public universities, including Jackson State. Having a leader who can build relationships with politicians and “access funds” will make a difference. 
Mayor John Horhn wants Jackson State’s next leader to be willing to partner with the city leaders to create jobs and build upon aging infrastructure to keep “the best and brightest” in Jackson. 
“Our HBCUs serve a vital role and they ought to be supported significantly,” Horhn told Mississippi Today. “I’m all for getting as much resources to all the HBCUs as possible. This includes getting the right person to head Jackson State.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/27124406/JSU-President-search-listening-session-4.jpg,,,2025-10-31 06:16:53.172274
