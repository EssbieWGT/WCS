(Pool photo by Bethany Baker/The Salt Lake Tribune) One of several reports prepared for a Utah judge draws a conclusion that convicted killer Ralph Menzies is “not competent to be executed” for the 1986 murder of Maurine Hunsaker. 
The finding doesn’t definitively answer the question of whether Menzies, 67, will be put to death for the crime. The judge will make a determination on legal competency after a court hearing expected to last several days next month. 
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled a person cannot be put to death without a rational understanding of the reason for the penalty, saying that would amount to cruel and unusual punishment. 
In an evaluation dated Nov. 17 and publicly available in Utah court records for a time Friday, forensic psychologist Michael P. Brooks wrote that “Mr. Menzies is unaware of the crime for which he is convicted, the parameters of the case (e.g., victim’s identity, specific acts he was found to have committed, etc.), the capital nature of the sentence he received, or how the punishment will be carried out.”
Brooks, an employee of the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, was ordered by the court to conduct an independent examination. He previously concluded that Menzies was fit to receive the death penalty, testifying in November 2024 that Menzies “knows that the ‘state wants to kill me because I killed a person and killing people is wrong.’” 
Utah’s medical experts say Ralph Menzies is competent to be executed. His attorneys disagree

For the new evaluation, the psychologist met with Menzies on Oct. 20 and Nov. 12, for 70 minutes both times. In one of the sessions, Menzies asked, “why would they want to kill me?”
“I asked after his understanding of the crime for which he had been convicted and the legal proceedings to this point, but he merely shook his head,” the 30-page report says. 
A spokesperson for the Utah Attorney General’s Office, which is defending the state’s plan to execute Menzies, declined comment. Jennifer Moreno, one of Menzies’ attorneys, said his legal team knows about the report but did not provide comment on its conclusion. 
Menzies does not have a “substantial probability” of getting to a point of restored competency, “given that there is no treatment that would improve any cognitive deficits incident to this condition,” the review found.
Menzies killed the 26-year-old Hunsaker nearly four decades ago after kidnapping her from her job at a gas station in Kearns. He tied her to a tree in Big Cottonwood Canyon, strangled her and slit her throat, prosecutors said. She was found by a hiker days later.

Menzies had been scheduled to be executed by firing squad Sept. 5. As the date drew closer, his attorneys argued his dementia had worsened.
After a judge rejected those arguments, they appealed to the Utah Supreme Court. The state’s high court called off the execution in September, ruling there was enough evidence to warrant another competency evaluation. 
The court’s decision triggered the new round of proceedings, requiring reports from at least two state examiners and other evaluators commissioned by the state or Menzies’ attorneys. 
For those already on death row before May 2004, including Menzies, Utah allowed a choice between lethal injection and firing squad. Menzies chose the firing squad. Now the default method of execution is lethal injection, unless the necessary drugs are not available.

Elissa Slotkin took to social media on Friday night to report that the Michigan State Police responded to a bomb threat at her home.
Slotkin was reportedly not at home at the time of the incident. State Police searched her property in Holly and confirmed that no one was in danger.
The bomb threat comes after she and other Democratic lawmakers created a video calling on the various branches of the U.S. Armed Services to reject any illegal order that might come down from President Donald Trump or the newly renamed Department of War under Secretary Pete Hegseth.

Trump responded with vitriol calling the video “seditious behavior from traitors, punishable by death.”
Slotkin responded by saying that the video “really isn’t about those of us who made the video … this is about who we are as Americans and how we’re going to engage with people who we disagree with.”
Trump threatens Democratic lawmakers including Slotkin, calling remarks ‘seditious’ on Truth Social

Trump’s administration later backtracked on those comments and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump did not want to execute the lawmakers.
Slotkin served as a CIA intelligence officer before running for the U.S. House of Representatives and then the U.S. Senate, where she now currently serves.
It was reported later that Slotkin amplified her security presence to a 24-hour detail after Trump’s posts.
Friday night’s bomb threat followed.
“Senator Slotkin is deeply grateful for the swift and professional response by Oakland County and Michigan State Police,” a spokesperson wrote on Slotkin’s social media pages. “U.S. Capitol Police will continue to investigate and hopefully hold accountable those responsible.”

Marjorie Taylor Greene from Georgia, a Rome Republican, announced her plans to resign from Congress Friday evening in an unexpected video message.

Screenshot of Greene's video U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from Georgia, a Rome Republican, announced her plans to resign from Congress Friday evening in an unexpected video message.
Greene, who was first elected in Georgia’s 14th congressional district in 2020, said in a lengthy and pointed video statement posted on social media that her last day in Congress will be Jan. 5, 2026.
Once a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump, Trump publicly broke ties with Greene after she expressed disagreement with him on a number of issues, the biggest of which was the release of the Epstein files.
Greene expressed disillusionment with the political system and Trump, predicting that if she were to stay in office, she would face and defeat a Trump-funded opponent while Republicans lose the midterms nationwide.
“It’s all so absurd and completely unserious,” she said in the video. “I refuse to be a battered wife hoping it all goes away and gets better. If I’m cast aside by the president and the MAGA political machine and replaced by neocons, big pharma, big tech, military industrial war complex, foreign leaders and the elite donor class that can never, ever relate to real Americans then many common Americans have been cast aside and replaced as well.”
“There is no plan to save the world or a 4-D chess game being played,” she added. “When common American people realize and understand that the political industrial complex of both parties is ripping this country apart, that not one elected leader like me is able to stop Washington’s machine from gradually destroying our country and instead the reality is that they, common Americans, the people, possess the real power over Washington, then I’ll be here by their side to rebuild it.”
The Constitution calls on a state’s governor to declare a special election when a vacancy happens in the House of Representatives. 
Greene was reportedly considering a run for higher office, including as Georgia governor or for Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff’s seat, both of which are up next year, but bowed out of consideration after being discouraged by Trump. 
Republican strategist Brian Robinson said that it’s unclear what Greene will do next, but that “she has the profile and the talent to make a splash whatever she does.”
“Her video message laid out a clear and detailed vision that could serve as a roadmap to a political future,” he said in a statement.
Greene said in her speech that her goal was to hold the Republican party accountable and put “America first.”
“I look forward to seeing many of you again sometime in the future,” she said and signed off with a smile. 
Josh McKoon, chair of the Georgia Republican Party, called the announcement a “surprise.” He thanked Greene for her “fierce and unwavering service” and said in a statement that the congresswoman “has been a tireless fighter” for conservatives.
“She entered Congress as a political outsider and never backed down from defending the forgotten men and women of our state,” McKoon said.
McKoon said the party will work to elect another conservative to the district. The 14th congressional district is deeply red, and Greene was reelected to her third term in 2024 with 64.4% of the vote.

Amid unionizing effort, patrol says opening Jackson Hole Mountain Resort on Nov. 28 remains top priority.
The post Jackson Hole Ski Patrol takes steps to unionize appeared first on WyoFile .","The Jackson Hole Ski Patrol has taken the first step to unionize in an effort to secure “fair compensation, comprehensive benefits and equitable career incentives,” the group said in a statement.
Tyler Babcock, a nine-year Jackson Hole ski patroller, told WyoFile that 93% of eligible patrol members signed the petition filed Thursday with the National Labor Relations Board and support a vote to decide whether to be recognized under law as a union. Patrol members who did not sign the petition hold management positions and, as such, are prohibited from forming a union under the National Labor Relations Act.
A vote could be bypassed if the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort voluntarily recognizes the Jackson Hole Ski Patrol as a union.

“That is a potential outcome,” Babcock said. “But more than likely, we will hold a vote. That vote will likely take place in the next four to six weeks. While there’s a lot of unity in our group, we don’t want to be presumptuous,” Babcock said. “We want to allow everybody in our group to make their own independent decisions.” 
If the unionization drive succeeds, the Jackson Hole Ski Patrol would join the Communications Workers of America, which has already successfully negotiated contracts for patrollers and ski lift operators with resorts across the country. The movement to unionize under the Communications Workers of America gained national attention after the Park City Ski Patrol ended a months-long strike last winter by negotiating a contract with Vail Resorts for higher wages, better parental leave and educational opportunities. 
According to Babcock, the Jackson Hole Ski Patrol is already a tight-knit group, and “forming a union would just make it official.” Seeking livable wages is only a small piece of what it means to form a union, he said. 
Unionization would enable the patrol to negotiate for a variety of needs, from working conditions to benefits, Babcock emphasized. He said that all of the seasonally employed ski patrollers, many with families who have worked for the resort for decades, lack access to basic health insurance. He noted that this is especially critical right now because “the Affordable Care Act is about to crumble” — an apparent reference to the expiration of tax credits that subsidize health insurance plans bought through the federal marketplace. 
The effort to unionize will improve job security, helping to create a safer and more enjoyable environment for everyone, Babcock said. In order to protect the public, he stressed that long-time, experienced patrollers are needed to successfully perform complicated and dangerous jobs.    
“In a town that has the largest income inequality gap in the country — if you are able to make a sustainable living in a town like this, then you’re going to have longevity,” Babcock said. “As ski patrollers, institutional knowledge is important in this job. You don’t really want a young, inexperienced person coming in to perform avalanche mitigation with explosives.”
“The skills and institutional knowledge acquired through years on the job is critical and irreplaceable for maintaining the highest safety and operational standards,” the Jackson Hole Ski Patrol said in a press release. “JHSP is committed to ensuring JHMR maintains its position as a leader in mountain safety and guest experience. Unionizing will help patrollers secure the stability, representation and long-term foundation necessary to provide the world-class experience Jackson Hole is known for.”
While it is too early in the process to request specific changes, Jackson Hole Ski Patrol is asking its employer, the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, to have a seat at the table.

The resort issued its own statement in response to the ski patrol’s union petition: “We care deeply about every member of our team, and we value the important role ski patrol plays at our resort. We are committed to listening, engaging respectfully and continuing open dialog. Our focus is to work together toward an outcome that supports our employees and the exceptional experience we strive to create for our guests and our mountain community.”
Forming a union can take months or even years, so in the meantime, the patrol’s priority is to open the resort on time — Nov. 28. When asked about the possibility of a walkout or strike, Babcock said that patrollers are committed to their work and not interested in a fight.
“We love our jobs,” Babcock said. “We look forward to going to work at the resort. That’s really what we are focused on. It’s business as usual. We hope snow continues to accumulate.”
If certified, the patrol will organize as the Jackson Hole Ski Patrol Union under Communications Workers of America Local 7781, United Mountain Workers.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Rates of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, are surging in Texas, Florida, California, Oregon, and other states and localities across the country.
The outbreaks are fueled by falling vaccination rates, fading immunity, and delays in public health tracking systems, according to interviews with state and federal health officials. Babies too young to be fully vaccinated are most at risk.
“Pertussis cases increase in a cyclical fashion driven by waning immunity, but the size of the outbreak and the potential for severe outcomes in children who cannot be vaccinated can be mitigated by high coverage and good communication to folks at risk,” said Demetre Daskalakis, a former head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s immunization program, who resigned in August.
Before the first pertussis vaccine became available in the early 1900s, whooping cough was one of the most common childhood diseases and a major cause of childhood death in the United States. Today, children get a series of DTaP shots (full-dose version) starting at 2 months old, and teens and adults receive a Tdap booster (lower-dose version) every 10 years. (Both vaccines target diphtheria and tetanus in addition to pertussis.)
Until recently, 8 in 10 toddlers had received four doses of the DTaP vaccine by age 2, and case rates were controlled. But vaccine coverage has declined since the covid pandemic and increases in state nonmedical exemptions have widened immunity gaps, which is when the proportion of individuals who are immune falls below the level needed to contain spread.
Texas logged 1,928 pertussis cases in 2024. By October 2025, the state had exceeded 3,500. National numbers are just as stark: In the first three months of 2025, the U.S. tallied 6,600 cases — four times last year’s pace and 25 times 2023’s. Several states are posting their highest case totals in a decade, and outbreaks from Louisiana to South Dakota to Idaho make clear this surge isn’t regional. It’s everywhere.
Key Factors Behind These Numbers
Texas lawmakers recently passed a law that made it easier for parents to claim nonmedical exemptions from school vaccine requirements by allowing them to download exemption forms online. These forms now go straight to schools, not health departments, making the exemptions harder to track.
Dallas County Health and Human Services Director Phil Huang said the full impact of the new exemption rule is not yet known because it began this school year, but he expects it will make school-level vaccination rates fall even more.
He’s already noted a dramatic drop in vaccinations. Normally, during back-to-school season, “our whole front downstairs area is packed,” he said. “We did not see that this year.”
Huang believes fear of immigration enforcement may be keeping at least some families, especially Hispanic families, from getting vaccinated. Dallas County is about 40% Hispanic. “We think that a lot of them are deterred by the ICE activity,” he said, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
More complications: These vaccines protect against severe disease, but protection against infection fades over time, as is the case with the covid and influenza vaccines.
The U.S. switched in the 1990s from whole-cell pertussis vaccines to “acellular” ones, which cause fewer side effects but do not last as long. Because more adults today than in the past received the acellular vaccine as children, many have lost immunity over time and may unknowingly pass the infection to babies.
Babies Face the Greatest Risk
Whooping cough is especially dangerous for infants under a year old. Some stop breathing during coughing fits. Many need hospital care, about 1 in 5 of whom develop pneumonia, and about 1% of whom die.
Because of this high risk, the CDC urges pregnant women to get a Tdap vaccine during every pregnancy. This allows the mother’s antibodies to pass to the baby before birth.
Health officials once promoted “cocooning,” vaccinating all family members and caregivers around the baby, but that strategy was hard to carry out in real life and is no longer widely recommended. Vaccination of pregnant women and babies at 2 months of age remains the strongest protection.
Better Testing Finds More Cases
Modern PCR testing is also uncovering more pertussis cases than in the past. Many clinics now routinely use this lab-based technology to test for several respiratory infections at once, including pertussis. Ten years ago, these panels were uncommon.
CDC experts say this explains part of the rise in case counts. But the large number of infant hospitalizations and the size of state outbreaks show that true transmission has also increased.
A Growing Worry: Antibiotic Resistance
Doctors normally treat pertussis with macrolide antibiotics, such as erythromycin, azithromycin, and clarithromycin. These drugs work best early in the illness and help stop spread. Another drug, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, is an option for some older infants and adults.
But macrolide-resistant pertussis has become common abroad, especially in China, and recent reports show resistance rising in Peru. In the U.S., resistant cases have been rare.
CDC officials warn that resistant strains could spread more easily through international travel. Because treatment options are limited, especially for very young infants, health workers are watching this closely.
Huang said macrolide resistance has not been seen yet in Dallas County. But he is aware of the national concern.
What Happens Now
The resurgence of whooping cough has no single cause. Instead, several problems are occurring at once: falling vaccine coverage, only about 60% of pregnant women receiving Tdap, waning immunity, improved testing, and early signs of antibiotic resistance.
Health experts say solutions must match the problem’s complexity.
Across the nation, clinicians are being told to have a higher suspicion for pertussis when they see patients, especially children or caregivers of newborns with a persistent cough or coughing fits followed by vomiting. Babies who stop breathing or turn blue need immediate care.
Obstetricians are encouraged to discuss Tdap during every pregnancy. Pediatricians and family doctors are urged to check booster status for teens and adults.
Several states have issued health advisories over the past two years, including Texas, which has issued alerts in both 2024 and 2025 urging clinicians to stay vigilant.
Huang said Dallas County is trying to rebuild public health outreach programs that were cut when covid funding ended. But staffing is still limited. “There’s just a lot of different things that are making it more difficult,” he said.
He also noted that Dallas County now receives immunization registry data only once a month, rather than daily, making it harder to track vaccine coverage. “We don’t have that yet. … It’s not real time,” he said.
Protecting the Youngest
As the holiday season approaches, experts urge families with newborns to take extra care:

Ensure infants and children are up to date with their childhood vaccines and that everyone in the family is up to date with their vaccines for influenza, covid, and RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus.
Keep sick visitors away.
Seek care quickly if an infant has a cough or pauses breathing.

The Arkansas-based Tyson said in a statement that changes were designed to “right-size” its beef business and position it for long-term success. 
The Lexington plant is to close on or around Jan. 20. The statement did not elaborate on why the plant in the town of  about 11,500 people was targeted.

The company said it also will convert an Amarillo, Texas, beef facility to a single, full-capacity shift and increase production at other company beef facilities. The number of layoffs from that eliminated shift is about 1,700.
A recent earnings report indicated that Tyson stands to lose some $600 million in its beef business next fiscal year, on top of the already-incurred $720 million loss over the last two years. 
The closure sparked swift reaction from Nebraskans.
The Nebraska Cattlemen Board of Directors expressed disappointment — especially, it said, in light of Friday’s U.S. Department of Agriculture data that Nebraska cattle-on-feed inventories remain slightly above year-ago levels in spite of the ongoing cyclical tightness in national cattle numbers.

“We firmly believe there isn’t a better place to efficiently and economically raise cattle and produce beef than Nebraska,” the board said in a statement. “This will have a profound impact on the community of Lexington and many cattle producers.”
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen called the state’s cattle industry resilient and “the envy of the world.” He said Tyson leadership promised to “work on future value-added opportunities” in the state.
“Big picture — our excellent cattlemen and cattle feeders have emerging opportunities and will still have the Tyson market to sell into as its planned re-organization will boost capacity and jobs at other Nebraska plants,” Pillen said.
But U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, blasted the decision.
“As the single largest employer in Lexington, Tyson’s announcement will have a devastating impact on a truly wonderful community, the region and our state,” she said.
Calling Nebraska a beef state that knows better than anyone the highs and lows of the cattle market, Fischer added: “It’s no secret that just a few years ago, packers like Tyson were making windfall profits while the rest of the industry was continuously in the red.”

“I call on Tyson to do everything in its power to take care of the families affected by this short-sighted decision,” she said. 
U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., said he would do what he could to support Nebraskans impacted and to help employees find work close to home.
“This news is especially heartbreaking around the holidays,” he said.
U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith, R-Neb, called the closure a disappointing loss for the city, Dawson County, the region and cattle industry as a whole. 
“Nebraska’s hard-working cattle producers are innovative and highly efficient as they work to provide high quality beef for consumers,” Smith said. “I welcome input from producers and stand ready to assist as we all move forward.”
In its announcement, Tyson said it recognized the impact its decisions have on its team members and their communities.
“The company is committed to supporting our team members through this transition, including helping them apply for open positions at other facilities and providing relocation benefits,” it said.

Kendelle Petty, a freshman from Nags Head, said many of her friends are afraid to leave their dorms as rumors of ICE sightings fly around campus. She marched in Friday’s protest carrying a sign that said, “No one is illegal on stolen land.”
“I think that our current administration is acting in a very similar way to Nazi Germany, and they’re dragging people out of their homes,” Petty said. “I’m just very frustrated — it’s like we’re not treating immigrants as people.”
The student protesters gathered at the base of the Memorial Belltower before marching down Hillsborough Street, past D.H. Hill Library, and through the campus grounds, chanting “Down with deportation, up with liberation” and “ICE out of NC now!”
The protest comes a day after mixed messages from law enforcement officials about the status of an immigration crackdown in N.C. by the Trump administration.
Mecklenburg Co. Sheriff Garry McFadden said Thursday he was told by federal agents that “Operation Charlotte’s Web” was over for now. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the operation is continuing, punctuated by a mocking meme on social media.
As of Thursday, DHS reported 370 arrests in North Carolina through the enforcement operation. Immigration authorities detained U.S. citizens in some cases, and the expansive nature of the operation has drawn criticism from some North Carolina officials of both parties, who say it should focus on those who pose a danger to the public.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the protest.

NC State spokesman Mick Kulikowski said the university is “closely monitoring the situation,” adding that campus police have reported no credible sightings of immigration agents on campus.
In a memo Tuesday, NC State executive vice chancellor and provost Warwick Arden told faculty not to provide any information about students to immigration enforcement without consulting the university general counsel. He also advised caution for the international community on campus.
“International students, faculty and staff should carry evidence of their immigration status with them at all times,” Arden wrote. “If they leave the Raleigh area, we encourage them to carry their passport.”
Livi Schwartz, an organizer with the campus chapter of the Young Democratic Socialists of America, said that, while there have been no verified sightings on ICE tracking apps, “the threat still feels very real to everyone.”
“Someone told us that he was stopped by someone on campus and asked for his passport and identification,” Schwartz said. “We have had people see suspicious vehicles.”
In response to those fears, students are mobilizing to prepare each other for encounters with ICE. Plastered across the campus are QR codes for immigrant rights resources and ICE tracking tools. Schwartz’s organization and lawyers from the University Student Legal Services held “Know Your Rights” information sessions Wednesday and Thursday at NC State’s Talley Student Union.
“It can be very difficult to act how we would want to in these situations,” Schwartz said. “We want it to be muscle memory for people so that they aren’t caught off guard, which is what the agents want.”
“This all-day climate of, ‘Are my students going to be okay? Is someone I know going to be kidnapped?’ That was new to me on this campus,” said English professor Belle Boggs. “It was incredibly disruptive to the students and to the faculty.”

Like Schwartz, Boggs said she has not had a direct encounter with ICE or Border Patrol agents. But colleagues have sent her photos of men dressed in black and green tactical garb on Hillsborough Street, and students have told her about encounters with them around D.H. Hill Library, she said.
“It felt awful to think about my students having to be afraid that they need to show proof of their immigration status to an armed, dangerous stranger wearing a mask,” said Boggs, who also serves as president of the state chapter of the American Association of University Professors.
In a statement Wednesday, the North Carolina AAUP condemned the immigration crackdown in North Carolina as “racist and xenophobic.”
“It will not succeed in cowing faculty and academic workers, in sowing division, or in keeping us from supporting our neighbors in need,” the professors said in the statement. “We will continue to fight for the colleges, universities, and communities we deserve.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/PB215232-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-21 18:58:40.051120

The North Dakota Native Heritage Showcase, sponsored by the state’s Indian Affairs Commission, featured about a dozen vendor tables at the Capitol with handmade jewelry, paintings, books and other items. 
Brad Hawk, executive director of the North Dakota Indian Affairs Commission, said the event is a way to showcase different Native cultures and give exposure to local nonprofit groups..
“It’s more than music. It’s more than regalia. We have different aspects of the culture in arts,” Hawk said. “It’s a communitywide event, a little bit for everybody, and that’s the way we set it up to be.”
Dakota Goodhouse, a Native American studies instructor at United Tribes Technical College, played a wooden, Native American flute and shared its history that spans “10 grandfathers’ lives.” There isn’t a definitive date of when the Northern Plains Indian-style flute appeared, but he said he believes it has been embedded in Native courtship traditions for about 900 years.





“Everyone remembers young love, and it is just something that resonates with us,” Goodhouse said. 
He said the flute’s dual-chamber design is unique among flutes and was modeled after how the downy woodpecker carves a tree limb in two different parts. Dakota and Lakota tribes noticed when the wind passed through the different holes on the woodpecker’s tree limb, a sound came out, he said.
Melanie Schwab, owner of The Modern Sioux in Mandan, crafts handmade jewelry from parts of animals killed in different hunts. She added her ancestors used all of the parts of the animals they hunted and her business honors that tradition.
“Whatever I am getting from the Creator, I want to use all of it,” Schwab said.

The auditor’s office report detailed complaints that were not investigated on time and cases closed without follow-up visits. The health department said it would work to implement recommendations.

Gov. David Zuckerman in South Burlington on Oct. 20, 2020.  File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
The Office of the State Auditor found significant shortcomings with how the Vermont Department of Health reviews complaints related to food and lodging establishments, according to a recent report.
The report is the first audit of four planned for the coming months by Auditor Doug Hoffer and his staff, part of an effort to assess how the state government responds to Vermonters’ complaints. 
The department’s Food and Lodging program is responsible for ensuring that Vermont restaurants, hotels, and other similar establishments, follow the state’s health and sanitation regulations and protocols. The program provides licenses and inspects more than 6,000 food establishments and regulates lodging facilities, while addressing the complaints it receives from the public.
The audit selected 45 complaints for review out of the 1,081 complaints the program received between 2022 and 2024. The types of complaints that come in include allegations of unsanitary conditions, bed bug infestations, inadequate cooking and contaminated food equipment. Inspectors have to first verify if the complaints are true, and if so, recommend corrective actions.
However, the audit found that inspections were not always conducted within the required timeframe, and, in some cases, inspectors did not follow up to verify if the problems were resolved. Of the complaints reviewed, 16 of them were not investigated in the timeframe required. Seven out of the 10 complaints with more serious allegations were not investigated within the required two days. Two of them were not investigated at all.
Additionally, inspectors closed 18 of the 26 complaints that required corrective actions without confirming if the problems had been resolved. Hoffer said this does not necessarily mean that the owner of the establishment did not address the problem but that the inspectors did not visit the place again to check if they did.
“If you’re calling for a corrective action for a serious problem, you need to make sure that it’s been done and documented, and they were kind of short on that,” Hoffer said.
The audit also found that the Department of Health doesn’t measure the performance of the Food and Lodging program, which is a state requirement. The program is also missing specific policies and procedures for handling complaints.
Hoffer said the auditor’s office will follow up in one year and again in three years to see if the department has implemented their recommendations to improve the program.
The public complaint system evaluated in the audit is just one part of the work carried out by the program, according to Liz Wirsing, the senior program manager for Food and Lodging.
“The report evaluated a small sample of the hundreds of complaints that we receive and follow up on every year, so sometimes other priorities have to take precedence for protecting public health,” Wirsing said.
Still the recommendations are helpful, and the program is already working on implementing them, she said.  
“We appreciate the public reaching out to us and sharing their concern,” Wirsing said, adding that people should continue to file complaints. “It’s important information, and it does help alert us sometimes to things that need some follow-up.”

She is there because of people, she said in her first moments after being formally sworn in as the state’s newest justice. Walsh pledged to be the type of justice all Kansans deserve.
“And that is someone who, with a clear understanding of the legal issues, will faithfully interpret and impartially apply the law to the facts of each unique case, irrespective of popular opinion or political wins, and all while maintaining a humble awareness of each decision’s impact on people and on history,” she said.

Roughly 200 people gathered Friday in the Kansas Supreme Court in the Kansas Judicial Center in Topeka. Family, friends, colleagues, former justices and members of all three branches of government watched as Walsh said her first words from her new chair.
“I’m mindful of the climate and the context in which I am joining this court. This is without a doubt a critical time for the judiciary. But that has always been true,” Walsh said, “and that is because the judicial branch is so critical to our democracy.”
Former Supreme Court Justice Carol Beier and Walsh’s husband, Matt, introduced her to the court, and acting Chief Justice Eric Rosen swore her in. Walsh’s four children helped her shrug on what was once Beier’s robe.
Walsh applied to work for Beier as a fresh graduate of the University of Kansas Law School. Beier said a professor told her Walsh would be “the best hire I ever made.”
Beier was skeptical.
“I thought no new graduate could possibly deliver the performance he promised,” she said. “I have never been so happy to be so wrong.”
Beier added: “Like Athena, born from the head of Zeus, she was fully formed as a discerning intellect and an unusually mature lawyer and adviser.”
Former Kansas Supreme Court Justice Carol Beier speaks at Justice Larkin Walsh’s swearing-in ceremony on Nov. 21, 2025, in Topeka. Beier was a mentor to Walsh, giving her a research attorney position early in her career.
Walsh, the youngest justice on the court, began her duties two months ago after an informal swearing-in ceremony. She succeeded former Justice Evelyn Wilson, who retired in July following a Lou Gehrig’s disease diagnosis.
Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly, who was present at the ceremony, appointed Walsh in August from a slate of three nominees.
In her remarks, Walsh characterized the judicial selection process she endured as rigorous and transparent, a subtle nod to the recent challenges to the state’s merit-based approach. In August 2026, a constitutional amendment will appear on voters’ ballots asking whether they’d like to switch to a popular-vote approach.
Walsh spent the past dozen years in private practice, focusing on civil rights, workers’ rights, consumer protection and complex class actions, according to Kansas Judicial Branch spokesperson Lisa Taylor. Walsh, a Leawood resident, was most recently senior counsel at Stueve Siegel Hanson.
She has worked on at least two class action cases defending victims of sexual abuse. One was against Ohio State University for failing to protect hundreds of male student athletes from Richard Strauss’ systemic abuse. The case rose to the U.S. Supreme Court but wasn’t accepted for review.
She was also part of a Kansas legal team that represented a group of women who in April sued Lawrence Memorial Hospital and the University of Kansas Hospital Authority after a KU physical therapist accessed their medical files, which included images and body measurements. The physical therapist had never treated the women and accessed images for approximately two years without detection, according to court filings. The case is ongoing in federal court, and Walsh withdrew as an attorney in August. Walsh withdrew from the ongoing Ohio case in January 2024.
She is a graduate of Southern Methodist University, majoring in art and English. She is a 2004 graduate of the University of Kansas law school. In addition to her time as a research attorney for Beier, Walsh clerked for U.S. District Judge Carlos Murguia. She served two five-year terms on the Kansas Board of Law Examiners and has been involved with the Kansas Bar Association’s Annual Survey of Law for 20 years, beginning as co-chair and transitioning to editor, a role she still holds.
After one year in office, new justices undergo a retention vote to continue holding a seat on the court. Subsequent retention votes occur every six years.
In public interviews during the judicial selection process, Walsh said she was not a “self-promoter.” She said at the time that ego can hinder effective justice, and she emphasized adherence to law and careful consideration and examination of facts and issues.
Her parents, relatives and friends attended the ceremony, and Matt Walsh thanked many of them, while praising Larkin Walsh for her abilities as a mother, lawyer and new justice.
Matt Walsh and Beier spoke of her positivity, empathy, dignity and humility.
“Larkin knows exactly what court service demands,” Beier said. “She embraces the responsibility and she has crafted a record of achievement and service made to measure.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/PB210135-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-21 18:58:40.051120
,Mississippi Today,2025-11-21 23:22:53+00:00,Mississippi Today,Judge grants bail to Louisiana death row prisoner Jimmie Duncan,"Richard A. Webster, Verite News",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/21/louisiana-death-row-prisoner-jimmie-duncan-bail/,"Louisiana death row inmate Jimmie Duncan is closer to freedom after a judge granted bail. Duncan was convicted in killing his ex-girlfriend’s toddler, but the conviction was based partly on bite mark evidence that is now considered junk science.","After more than 25 years on death row in Louisiana, Jimmie Duncan inched one step closer to freedom Friday when Judge Alvin Sharp of the 4th Judicial District in Ouachita Parish granted him bail, setting it at $150,000.
The decision comes nearly seven months after Sharp vacated Duncan’s 1998 first-degree murder conviction for killing his former girlfriend’s 23-month-old daughter, Haley Oliveaux, finding that it was based in part on bite mark evidence now considered by experts to be junk science.
The Ouachita Parish District Attorney’s Office has opposed Duncan’s release, arguing that Duncan is guilty of the murder. But in his bail ruling, Sharp pointed to evidence that the girl, who drowned, was at risk of seizure, meaning she could have died accidentally while in the tub. Sharp also noted the lack of blood or semen at the scene, contradicting the state’s position that Duncan raped Haley. And, he wrote in the ruling, there was a video, not presented at the trial, that Duncan’s legal team has alleged is evidence that — along with being based on debunked science — the bite-mark analysis in the case may have been fabricated.  
The “presumption is not great” that Duncan is guilty, Sharp said.
“This ruling acknowledged the clear and convincing evidence showing that Mr. Duncan is factually innocent,” his attorneys said in a prepared statement. “Although Mr. Duncan’s ordeal is not over, today marks a significant step forward for Mr. Duncan’s complete exoneration.”
His attorneys said they were working to get Duncan out of prison over the weekend. 
This week’s ruling is yet another chapter in a nearly three-decade legal odyssey that has spotlighted Louisiana’s troubling history with wrongful convictions, as well as its long-held reputation as one of the country’s most punitive states.
As ProPublica and Verite News reported in March, Duncan’s conviction was based largely on now discredited bite mark evidence presented by forensic dentist Michael West and pathologist Dr. Steven Hayne, whose longtime partnership as state experts has been questioned following concerns about the validity of their techniques. West and Hayne also worked on several disputed court cases in Mississippi.
Over the past 27 years, nine prisoners have been set free after being convicted in part on inaccurate evidence given by West and Hayne. Three of those men were on death row. Duncan was the last person awaiting an execution based on the pair’s work.
Duncan, 56, has maintained his innocence since first being arrested in 1993 after Haley’s death. In the ensuing years, Haley’s mother, Allison Layton Statham, has come to support Duncan’s release. At Duncan’s first bail hearing in July, Statham testified that she believes Duncan to be innocent and demanded his release from prison.
Efforts to free Duncan have become even more urgent given the state’s recent moves, under conservative Gov. Jeff Landry, to restart executions following a lapse of more than a decade. Louisiana had not carried out a death sentence since 2010 as it has been unable to procure the drugs necessary for an execution. To overcome that obstacle, the state Legislature, at Landry’s urging, recently approved an alternative method: the use of nitrogen gas, a controversial method allowed in only three other states.That opened the door to Louisiana’s first execution in 15 years. And on March 18, the state used nitrogen gas to put Jesse Hoffman Jr. to death. 
To criminal justice reformers, Landry’s execution push is even more concerning given the state’s history in convicting and sentencing to death people later found to be innocent. In the past three decades, the state has exonerated 11 people facing execution, among the highest such numbers in the country, according to The National Registry of Exonerations.
Despite Sharp’s finding in April that Duncan is factually innocent, Ouachita prosecutors continue to insist that Duncan raped and murdered Oliveaux and should be executed without delay. The district attorney’s office, in urging Sharp to keep Duncan locked up, has argued that Duncan is “a safety risk to not only the victim’s family, but also the general public.” The office has appealed the decision to the Louisiana Supreme Court. 
Duncan was arrested Dec. 18, 1993 after he reported finding Haley’s lifeless body floating in the tub of the home he shared with the girl’s mother in West Monroe. Duncan, who was babysitting that night, told authorities he had put the toddler in the tub to take a bath, then went downstairs to wash dishes. When he heard a noise coming from the bathroom, he rushed upstairs to check on her and found Haley floating face down in the water. She was pronounced dead a few hours later.
Prosecutors enlisted the assistance of Hayne, who had worked on hundreds of criminal cases in Mississippi and Louisiana over his decades-long career. Hayne conducted Haley’s medical exam and claimed he found evidence that she was sexually assaulted and intentionally drowned. He also claimed he found bite marks on her body.
Hayne’s frequent partner, West, then analyzed the marks and found that they were a match for Duncan’s teeth. Based in part on those findings, Duncan was charged with first-degree murder. After about two weeks of testimony in 1998, the jury found Duncan guilty and sentenced him to death.
Duncan’s post-conviction attorneys, however, later uncovered a trove of evidence which, they said, proves he is innocent and was wrongfully convicted, the most damning of which calls into question whether the bite marks Hayne said he found on Haley’s body were manufactured.
In a video of West’s 1993 examination of Haley — which was not shown to jurors at the trial — the dentist can be seen taking a mold of Duncan’s teeth and grinding it into the girl’s body. (West has previously said he was simply using what he called a “direct comparison” technique — in which he presses a mold of a person’s teeth directly onto the location of suspected bite marks.)
In his April ruling vacating Duncan’s conviction, Sharp said the work Hayne and West did on Duncan’s case was “no longer valid” and “not scientifically defensible.” Sharp also stated in his ruling that he found “very compelling” the September testimony of an expert medical witness who said that the child’s death was not the result of a homicide but of an accidental drowning. Prior to her death, Haley suffered several head injuries that could have caused seizures resulting in her drowning, according to the testimony.
Robert S. Tew, district attorney for Ouachita and Morehouse parishes, has argued that despite experts now dismissing bite mark evidence as “junk science,” it was an accepted methodology at the time of Duncan’s trial and that some experts still consider it to be valid. He has also noted that Hayne, who died in 2020, served as the pathologist for the district for over a decade and during that time “there has been no cases overturned because of Dr. Hayne’s autopsy.”
Tew’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
An initial bail hearing for Duncan held in July was delayed after prosecutors filed a motion to recuse Sharp, claiming he was biased given his earlier decision to set aside Duncan’s conviction. Sharp declined the request. In an October ruling, the Louisiana Supreme Court rejected the state’s appeal in a 6-1 vote. The court has yet to take up the state’s appeal of Sharp’s decision to set aside Duncan’s conviction.

(Photo by Ed Saunders, used with permission). The Montana Public Service Commission approved the Yellowstone County Generating Station at $246 million — less than the $289 million in additional rate base that NorthWestern Energy wanted.
Customers will pay for the plant.
How the amount will translate on customer bills is in the works, although NorthWestern already implemented increases associated with the rate case, to be adjusted based on a final decision.
Public Service Commission spokesperson Alana Lake said Friday she expects an estimate on customer bills to be available in the next couple of weeks.
This week, the Public Service Commission took action on the rate case, a complex and multipronged application that includes the controversial methane-fired plant outside Laurel.
In a report, staff analysts with the Public Service Commission said NorthWestern Energy built the plant without adequately evaluating more affordable options, it didn’t manage construction in a cost-effective manner, and it failed to show the plant was a prudent investment.
The staff report recommended disallowing nearly $60 million in recoverable costs compared to the amount NorthWestern requested.
However, the Public Service Commission opted to allow roughly $19 million of those costs related to litigation over the state issuing permits for the plant.
Commission Vice President Jennifer Fielder argued the substantial costs associated with litigation included halting construction, mothballing the work in progress and then ramping up again — all because the state failed to issue permits.
Meanwhile, Commissioner Brad Molnar said it would be important to confirm the cost estimate with actual receipts and other evidence.
And Commission President Jeff Welborn said he was torn on the matter, but those costs weren’t the utility’s fault, and it would be appropriate to adjust the final amount based on the evidence staff can find in the record.
Commissioners voted 4-0 to accept recommended staff reductions, except for the ones tied to permit litigation, with Commissioner Annie Bukacek abstaining.
Bukacek abstained from at least one other motion on the rate case, and did not respond to a message asking why.
However, Bukacek also proposed a motion to let NorthWestern recover $16.3 million for a portion of change orders, the ones associated with the utility switching contractors.
Bukacek argued NorthWestern had shown no evidence of “nefarious motives” nor had it “committed any crimes,” and she questioned whether it was reasonable to penalize the company for trying to do the best for customers.
Fielder joined Bukacek in support of the motion, but it failed, with PSC President Jeff Welborn joining Commissioners Molnar and Randy Pinocci in opposing it.
In a statement, Welborn said the outcome represents a balanced approach to regulation.
It means the Yellowstone County Generating Station will provide “critical capacity” in the winter, and it also represents savings for customers, the Public Service Commission said.
“The Commission’s responsibility is to strike the right balance — ensuring utilities remain capable of delivering safe and reliable service while protecting customers from paying more than what is just and reasonable,” Welborn said. “This decision, and the $43 million in savings for customers, demonstrates the value of a thorough public process and the dedication of our staff.”
A news release from the Public Service Commission said customers can expect reductions based on current rates — $111.58 for residential customers, according to the utility — because NorthWestern implemented its own “significantly higher rates” in May 2025.
The monopoly utility did so in a move that was legal but rare, according to the Public Service Commission; it took advantage of a statute that allows a utility to impose a new rate after an application has been pending for nine months.
The Public Service Commission staff will incorporate the decisions commissioners made at their meeting into a final order to be reviewed before Dec. 24, 2025, Lake said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Methane-Plant-1.1-1-1024x767.jpg,,,2025-11-21 18:58:40.051120

Since returning to office this year, President Donald Trump has led a far-reaching effort to eliminate programs that support DEI — the abbreviation for diversity, equity and inclusion — including pulling hundreds of millions of dollars in research funding from schools and signing executive orders banning DEI-related work in the government.
“DEI is not just a slogan. It is a commitment to ensuring that every person, no matter their background, has a fair chance to contribute, to succeed and to belong,” Joseph said.
English and others specifically pointed to the University of Denver’s move in August to roll back DEI initiatives, including certain scholarships, spaces designed for specific identity groups and DEI training. The change followed a U.S. Department of Justice memo that defined DEI work as unlawful discrimination at schools, like DU, that receive federal funding. The university had not received direct outreach from the Trump administration about its DEI programming.










DEI is not just a slogan. It is a commitment to ensuring that every person, no matter their background, has a fair chance to contribute, to succeed and to belong.


– State Rep. Junie Joseph


The university maintains that it still has systems in place to foster a welcoming environment for all of its students and faculties.
“The work of fostering inclusion at colleges and universities has never been more complex or more vital than it is currently,” the school’s Vice Chancellor of Community Support and Engagement Christopher Whitt wrote in an opinion piece published by the Denver Post last week. “While the changes we have made at DU have not been easy, we are dedicated to continuing to partner with members of our community as the division thoughtfully forges a new path forward for inclusiveness for every student, faculty, and staff member.”

Other Colorado colleges also made changes in response to pressure from the Trump administration and new federal guidelines this year, such as changing language on websites and renaming offices.
“When institutions like DU bow down without being asked to, it sends a message,” said Alli Jackson, a DU alum who was recently elected to Aurora’s city council. “DEI is about inclusion. It is not about exclusion, and a lot of our population needs to be re-educated on that.”
English sponsored a successful bill during this year’s regular legislative session for the state to adopt education standards for Black history in public schools. She said she plans to introduce legislation related to Black maternal health next year, though the framework is still being worked out with stakeholders. She said she wants the messaging and education around the topic to be more comprehensive for health workers.
The Legislature should also “make sure that we are creating inclusive policies, policies that don’t have unintended consequences, especially if they’re not policies that are being run by people of color,” English said.
Additionally, a panel created by the Legislature in 2024 is overseeing a comprehensive study on how systemic racial discrimination in Colorado has impacted Black Coloradans.

(Photo by Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas lawmakers returned an amended contract between the state’s child welfare agency and a California-based company to the subcommittee that previously reviewed it after a state representative raised concerns about the company’s stance on health care for transgender youth.
The Arkansas Legislative Council approved 23 amended out-of-state contracts Friday but sent one back to the Review subcommittee, which advanced all the contracts Tuesday.
Evident Change, a data-driven nonprofit that aims to improve social systems, provides “professional consulting services” to the Division of Children and Family Services within the Arkansas Department of Human Services, according to documents provided to the council.
The state’s business relationship with Evident Change goes back to 2018, DCFS director Tiffany Wright told the council. In its efforts to reduce the number of children in foster care, DCFS has worked with the nonprofit to train staff to better assess risk and safety and manage safety concerns.
Lawmakers are considering a $375,000 amendment to an existing contract with Evident Change that would bring the total authorized amount above $4.2 million, according to legislative documents. The money would pay for additions to Evident Change’s scope of work and performance indicators.
The work in question includes screening calls to the state Child Abuse Hotline, calibrating the hotline’s structured decision-making tool and coaching child abuse investigators, Wright said in response to questions from Rep. Ryan Rose, R-Van Buren.
State to change its child abuse and neglect referral system, partners with nonprofit

West Virginia contracted with Evident Change last year to utilize the structured decision-making tool for its own child welfare system.
Rose asked Wright if she was aware that Evident Change “publicly posted articles and argued that in Texas, gender transition surgeries, hormone therapies, et cetera for minors should not be treated or investigated as child abuse.”
Wright said she was not aware of this. Rose said the articles have been removed from Evident Change’s website.
In 2022, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott ordered the state’s Department of Family and Protective Services to launch child abuse investigations into parents who allow their transgender children to receive gender-affirming medical care. In 2024, an appeals court upheld a lower court’s decision to block the state from enforcing the order.
Rose said he had “real concerns” about DCFS working with Evident Change “because their decisions affect real families here in Arkansas.”
“There is a very definite contradiction between their public opinions and the law that we have established here,” Rose said.
The law in question is the Save Adolescents From Experimentation (SAFE) Act, or Act 626 of 2021. The law banned puberty blockers, hormones and gender-affirming surgeries for Arkansas children with gender dysphoria. Four families of transgender minors challenged the law, and U.S. District Judge James Moody blocked it in July 2021 before it could go into effect.
The law was the first of its kind to go to trial. In June 2023, several months after the eight-day trial, Moody ruled the law was unconstitutional on First and Fourteenth Amendment grounds.

Appeals court upholds Arkansas’ ban on transgender minors’ health care after SCOTUS ruling


An 8-2 ruling from a federal appeals court in August lifted Moody’s injunction and cleared the way for the SAFE Act to be enforced four years after becoming law. The ruling came after the U.S. Supreme Court’s June decision to uphold Tennessee’s similar law, which had also been blocked by a federal judge.
Rose was not yet in the Legislature in 2021, but he voted for the Protecting Minors from Medical Malpractice Act of 2023, which allowed private enforcement of the SAFE Act. The law created a 15-year window for adults to sue physicians for “any physical, psychological, emotional, or physiological injury” incurred while the adult received hormone replacement therapy, puberty blockers or gender-affirming surgeries as a minor.
Two Arkansas Children’s Hospital physicians testified at the SAFE Act trial in 2022 that they do not perform breast or genital surgeries on transgender minors or refer them for such procedures elsewhere.
Rose also voted for an amendment to that law this year that added mental health care providers to the law’s list of medical professionals liable for “gender-affirming intervention.”
He said Friday that Arkansas law “is clear” that gender-affirming medical treatments “constitute [child] abuse.” The SAFE Act, the Protecting Minors from Medical Malpractice Act and its amendment do not mention the word “abuse.”
In response to Rose’s questions, Wright said DCFS does not have a way of ensuring that Evident Change’s tools and assessments are “unbiased.”
The Legislative Council’s Review subcommittee did not discuss the Evident Change contract before advancing it Tuesday. Advancement did not require a vote, but the full council voted with some dissent to send the amended contract back to the subcommittee, which will meet again Dec. 16.
Evident Change has worked with the Annie E. Casey Foundation, whose annual reports on child wellbeing indicators continually rank Arkansas as one of the worst states for children.

Advanced Micro Targeting of Dallas, Texas, was hired by a PAC called People Not Politicians to help collect the signatures needed to put Missouri’s new congressional map on the 2026 ballot. In a lawsuit filed Nov. 11 in Missouri’s Western District U.S. Court, the company alleges four consulting firms are involved in an effort to pay signatures gatherers to abandon their work, turn over signatures and badmouth their employer.
The lawsuit says the defendants have “poached” 28 employees and illegally obtained proprietary information about workers and petition strategy. 
U.S. District Judge Greg Kays on Monday denied the company’s request for a temporary restraining order, stating the company had not proved “irreparable harm” that could not be compensated later. In response, the Advanced Micro Targeting filed an amended complaint, elaborating on the issues the activities of the four defendants are causing for the signature effort.
The defendants, the lawsuit states, are engaged in “an intentional and malicious effort to interfere with AMT’s operations in Missouri…”
According to campaign finance reports, Advanced Micro Targeting had been paid $1.1 million through Sept. 30 to collect signatures for the referendum. The company previously worked in Missouri on the drives to put abortion legalization and an increased minimum wage on the November 2024 ballot.
It is the first time since the company was established in 2007 that it has taken competitors to court, said Billy Rogers, company founder and president 
“This was so egregious,” Rogers said. “We’ve never seen anything like this.”
The Advanced Micro Targeting lawsuit bases its claims on federal law protecting trade secrets and common law protections against defamation. But some of the accusations, if true, could violate the Missouri Uniform Trade Secrets Act, while others may violate the Missouri Merchandising Practices Act. 
Republican Attorney General Catherine Hanaway’s office did not respond to The Independent when asked for comment on the allegations. The only public mentions of Advanced Micro Targeting from Hanaway came in two posts on social media accusing the company of violating the law.
In one, she said her office was investigating the company for employing undocumented immigrants “in their efforts to undermine the will of the people’s elected representatives.”
In the other, Hanaway said she had asked Immigrations and Customs Enforcement to investigate whether the company was “creating an environment for exploitation and human trafficking to thrive.”
Hanaway’s office did not respond to questions about the source of her information or why she deemed it to be credible.
Rogers said no one from the attorney general’s office has contacted him or his company to discuss the accusations. Every person being paid by his company to collect signatures, he said, is a direct employee — and every employee is a legal worker checked through the federal E-verify system.
“If we hear from the attorney general’s office or any other government agency, they want to take a look at our employee records and talk to us about our process, we’d be glad to talk to them,” Rogers said. “We do it right. We follow the law.”
Hanaway’s posts are an attempt at intimidation, said Richard von Glahn, director of People Not Politicians. She should know that the company verifies that its workers are eligible for employment, he said.
“The fact that she doesn’t know that shows that she conducted zero investigation and just put out the tweet, which continues the effort by opponents of the referendum to try to confuse and mislead voters as to what’s going on,” he said.
Dark money groups pour cash into fight over gerrymandered Missouri congressional map

Republicans muscled the gerrymandering plan past Democratic opposition during a September special session. Using the new map, Republicans hope to win seven of the state’s eight congressional seats by adding enough GOP votes to flip the 5th District, currently held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City.
The lawsuit is a new layer of litigation related to the congressional map. 
There are at least eight cases currently underway, not all of which will be completed before the Dec. 11 deadline to turn in petition signatures. The next court hearing is Tuesday in St. Louis, where a federal judge will hear arguments over the constitutionality of a referendum on congressional district plans.
The Advanced Micro Targeting lawsuit names as defendants Let the Voters Decide of Celebration, Florida, and Vortex Elite LLC, of Miami, Florida; Synergy Wise Solutions, which has no website that could be found and lists an address that is a Pakmail storefront in Tucson, Arizona; and Onest Marketing, which also does not have a website that could be found and lists an address in an apartment building on the ocean in Miami, Florida.
The defendants, according to the lawsuit, obtained a confidential list of employees that included productivity rankings.
“Defendants are offering the employees on this confidential list huge sums of money (some were offered up to $30,000) to resign their employment with AMT and provide ‘intelligence gathering’ services for defendants,” the lawsuit states.
Each person hired by the company signs an agreement not to work for a competitor for a year after leaving Advanced Micro Targeting and not to try to hire employees away from the company.
In a statement issued through a communications consultant, Let the Voters Decide called the case a “bogus lawsuit” and cited Hanaway’s social media posts as evidence of bad practices.
“We will defend our company aggressively against AMT’s absurd claims,” the company said. “And anyone who reports or reads these claims really ought to consider the source.”
Vortex Elite did not respond to an email seeking comment. There were no contacts found for the other two defendants and none have lawyers listed for their defense.
The petition drive needs about 110,000 signatures spread across six of the state’s eight congressional districts to force a referendum. In its most recent update, People Not Politicians said it has gathered more than 200,000 signatures.
Von Glahn said the campaign will stop issuing updates as the deadline approaches. 
Most of the signature gatherers passing petitions are volunteers, von Glahn said. The efforts to divert signature gatherers from the task has been felt among volunteers as well, he said.
One volunteer in Columbia reported being offered $1,000 for a backpack of signed petition sheets, he said. Others have been approached by people seeking to sign for a relative or when they are not registered, both violations of state campaign law, he said.
“We’re going to continue together, even in the face of these clearly desperate attempts to keep this from reaching the ballot,” von Glahn said. “The interesting thing about all of the opposition tactics is they are not preparing to defend the map at the ballot. They are desperately seeking to keep it from going to a vote.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091025_rally3-1024x615.jpg,,,2025-11-21 17:59:23.240797

(Photo by Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)A Louisiana Supreme Court justice, who requested that all of his divorce records be kept private for several months, is one step closer to a lifetime appointment as a federal judge. 
The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday recommended Justice Will Crain for a seat on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana based in New Orleans. The full U.S. Senate still has to confirm him before he can take the job.  

Crain, a Madisonville resident, has been on the Louisiana Supreme Court since 2020 and previously worked as a state appellate and district court judge. He also spent two decades as a practicing attorney in St. Tammany Parish. 

The justice placed his divorce proceedings and documents under court seal for most of the year before President Donald Trump announced Crain’s nomination to the federal bench Oct. 20.. This meant that no one besides Crain, his ex-wife, their attorneys, the judge presiding over their case and court staff had the right to access to his divorce records and proceedings for several months. 
Crain could not be reached for comment Friday afternoon on his cellphone. 

His divorce attorney, Ross Lagarde, has said the divorce seal was necessary to ensure the justice’s personal safety. The seal was in place for 11 months until August. It was lifted after after a reporter asked Lagarde why the documents weren’t publicly available.  
Judge William “Billy” Burris, of Louisiana’s 22nd Judicial District Court, granted the seal for Crain’s divorce records based on a state law that wasn’t in effect at the time, according to court documents released after the seal was lifted. 

A new state law allowing judges to keep their divorce records private was passed in June 2024, but didn’t go into effect until February 2025. Yet Lagarde cited the law as the justification in his request to seal Crain’s divorce records in September 2024, five months before the law became active. 
Burris, who also oversaw the rest of Crain’s divorce case, is now one of several Republican candidates running for the Louisiana Supreme Court seat that would be vacated by Crain if he becomes a federal judge. Burris could not be reached for comment Friday at his office. 
Crain is dating his former law clerk at the Supreme Court, Julie Eldridge, who filed for divorce from her ex-husband about a month before Crain filed. Infidelity was not mentioned in either of Crain or Eldridge’s divorce records.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Crain-Red-Mass-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-21 17:59:23.240797

(Photo by Tyler Kaufman/Getty Images)The LSU Board of Supervisors’ vote Friday to intervene in the firing of former football coach Brian Kelly is its latest move to give members more power over day-to-day operations at the university.
The board held a special meeting Friday to authorize President Wade Rousse, who just started in the job this week, to review and, if appropriate, send a written termination notice to Kelly. It’s the university’s first response to a lawsuit Kelly filed seeking the full $54 million buyout he’s owed. The only way LSU can get out of paying him is by firing him for cause, which the university has not publicly indicated it will do. 
The vote also sets a precedent about the degree to which the LSU System’s governing board, mostly made up of allies to Gov. Jeff Landry, will be involved in hiring and firing coaches. 
In a statement after the meeting, LSU spokesman Zach Labbé said the board’s bylaws require them to take action on any personnel action related to a coach with a salary over $250,000. 
Historically, the board has not followed this bylaw. Ex-football coach Ed Orgeron was fired without the board authorizing his termination, as have a number of other coaches. Most recently, offensive coordinator Joe Sloan was fired just days after Kelly. Despite being paid more than $250,000, the board has yet to take action on his termination, which raises the question of whether he was officially fired. 
If the board continues on the path it set Friday, it would amount to a significant escalation in its day-to-day management of athletics. 
The move also raises questions as to why the board has approved contracts that include language that violates its bylaws. It has regularly approved coaching contracts, including Kelly’s, that allow the president to act for the university in firing a coach. 
LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard and Labbé have not yet responded to questions as to the status of Sloan’s termination, why the board has not followed its bylaws for previous firings and contract approvals. John Carmouche, who chairs the board’s athletics subcommittee, also did not respond immediately to a call requesting comment. 
The current iteration of the board has been more interested in directly managing the university’s operations than previous ones. 
Following his inauguration in 2024, Landry, a staunch conservative Republican, appointed new members to join appointees of former Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards, several of whom had swapped their allegiances to Landry. 
Among the first moves of the Landry-aligned board was to give itself the power to appoint members to any hiring search committee. Taken to its extreme, the new rule would allow the chair to stack any search panel, from a new professor to a football coach, and steer it to a preferred outcome.
The board later rolled back this new power to only apply to searches for high-level administrators, such as the president, chancellor, vice presidents and deans. Though Ballard no longer had the power to force members onto the search committee for Kelly’s replacement, he and Carmouche were appointed to the coaching search committee. 
Board members have also independently sought to influence hirings and firings throughout the system. 
Most notably, Esperanza Moran openly rallied to oust LSU Health Shreveport Chancellor David Guzick, who later resigned. 
Vice Chairman Lee Mallett made an early endorsement of Rousse just days after President William Tate announced his departure from LSU. Mallett’s support was key in influencing Rousse’s hiring.

The name, 7-OH, is short for 7-hydroxymitragynine, and it’s made by chemically converting the main opioid-inducing element in kratom. 7-OH is sold as gummies, candies, imitation ice cream cones, liquid shots, tablets and powders. People can buy 7-OH products in Missouri smoke shops, gas stations, convenience stores and online shops. 
Hanaway on Thursday announced her office had issued “civil investigative demand” letters, which are essentially subpoenas, to six companies that represent the “major points of sale” for both 7-OH and regular kratom products. The letters mandate the company to hand over multiple types of documents, including lab test results, research on health risks and safety label information.
Consumers, Hanaway said in a press release, “may be exposed to unapproved, unsafe and deceptively marketed opioid-like drugs.”
According to the letters sent to each company, the attorney general’s investigation targets the distribution of products containing 7-OH or “any part of the plant Mitragyna speciosa,” which is the kratom plant.
“We are deeply concerned,” she said, “that Missourians are being sold drug-like substances under the guise of harmless supplements, with no FDA approval, no safety testing, and in some cases no meaningful disclosure of what these products actually contain.” 
Missouri warns consumers of health risks associated with 7-OH products

The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services issued a health advisory last month warning consumers of potential health risks it says are associated with 7-OH. 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration sent warning letters in June to six manufacturers of 7-OH, and federal action is still pending. The companies the FDA targeted are different from the ones Hanaway is investigating, except for one.
Kansas-City-based Shaman Botanicals LLC — the leading supplier of 7-OH in Missouri — received letters from both the FDA and Hanaway.
The company’s owner, Vince Sanders, has said Shaman was the first company to make 7-OH products. 
Sanders replied to the FDA’s questions about the company’s products in August, told The Independent Friday, and has not yet heard back from the federal agency. The FDA warning has not stopped the company’s production, which he said is higher than ever.
The company’s response to the FDA warning letter included 300 pages of expert testimony and 200 pages of legal opinion, he said.
“I’ve got seven of the world’s experts on there that wrote letters that are saying, ‘Listen, you guys are completely wrong. Here’s the science, here’s the facts,’” Sanders said.
He plans on providing the same information to Hanaway, he said. Sanders’ other Kansas City company, CBD American Shaman LLC, also received a letter from Hanaway.
CBD Kratom, the largest kratom retailer in the country, was also among the recipients, along with St. Louis-area companies Green Dragon CBD, Emporium Smoke Shop and Moonlight Smoke Shop. 
CBD Kratom issued a statement Friday saying the company plans on taking the attorney general’s process seriously and “welcome any opportunity to demonstrate the strength of our safety standards, compliance practices, and long-standing commitment to consumer education.” 
CBD Kratom does not manufacture or sell 7-OH products, according to the company’s statement, and its leaders believe the investigation’s scope is “unusually broad.” 
The company pointed to the FDA’s distinction this summer between natural kratom and 7-OH. 
In a July press release announcing the FDA’s warning letters, the agency stated: “While 7-OH occurs naturally in trace amounts in kratom, the agency’s letters focus on concentrated 7-OH products such as tablets, gummies, drink mixes, and shots, which may be dangerous.”
Kratom leaves come from a tropical tree found in Southeast Asia, and they can be crushed and then smoked, brewed with tea, or placed into gel capsules.
The leaves contain an alkaloid called mitragynine. During digestion, the body converts it into 7-OH in small amounts. It’s what gives people the opioid-like effect.
The products the FDA is targeting contain a highly concentrated amount of 7-OH by taking mitragynine and chemically oxidizing it. 
The way that 7-OH is being marketed as kratom is what has the FDA and some medical experts concerned. 
Sanders argues his product is superior to most kratom products and shouldn’t be taken off the market. 
“We clearly have a better product,” he said. “Consumers voted with their dollar.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2302-e1755617763363.jpg,,,2025-11-21 17:59:23.240797

Yaw/U.S. Coast Guard)The Trump administration on Thursday released a plan for offshore oil and gas leasing that would open up almost all Alaska marine waters to development, along with the entire Pacific coast and the Gulf of Mexico.
The Alaska portion of the plan proposes 21 lease sales through 2031, five of them in Cook Inlet, two in the Beaufort Sea, two in the Chukchi Sea and the others in other marine areas. Those include a lease sale in a newly designated “High Arctic” area that lies beyond the 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone and where U.S. territorial rights are not yet clear.
The only federal Alaska offshore area without a proposed lease sale is the North Aleutian Basin, where oil leasing is under an indefinite ban to protect salmon-rich Bristol Bay.
The new plan, which also proposes six oil lease sales off the U.S. West Coast and seven in the Gulf of Mexico, is similar to an offshore leasing plan proposed by the Trump administration in 2017.
In a statement, the Department of the Interior called the plan “a major step to boosting United States energy independence.”
“Offshore oil and gas production does not happen overnight. It takes years of planning, investment, and hard work before barrels reach the market,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in the statement. “The Biden administration slammed the brakes on offshore oil and gas leasing and crippled the long-term pipeline of America’s offshore production. By moving forward with the development of a robust, forward-thinking leasing plan, we are ensuring that America’s offshore industry stays strong, our workers stay employed, and our nation remains energy dominant for decades to come.” 
Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a supporter of President Donald Trump, hailed the plan.
“Once again, the Trump Administration is leading the way to American energy dominance by restoring confidence in the federal government’s offshore leasing policies. Alaska has tremendous offshore oil and gas reserves that can power our economy for decades,” Dunleavy said in a post on the social media site X.
Another pro-drilling and pro-Trump Alaska public official, Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, had a more muted response.
Sullivan, in a statement, said Burgum on Thursday “committed to me that DOI will continue to carefully listen to Alaskans throughout this process, particularly Alaska Native communities who live near the proposed leasing areas, including our whaling captains who bring generations of experience and deep knowledge of the Arctic Ocean.”
“It’s important for Alaskans to know that this draft proposal is not a final decision or a directive that any particular offshore lease sale will occur. Before any potential proposal is finalized, there will be multiple opportunities for public comment, environmental review, and additional analysis. As my office reviews the proposal, I will work to ensure that we are weighing in and amplifying Alaskan voices and views,” Sullivan continued.
Others expressed anger about the plan.

	Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, was among a group of mostly California Democrats in Congress who blasted it during a news conference Thursday.
“We are here because President Trump just put out what we believe is an asinine pro-polluter plan to open up our coast to offshore drilling,” Huffman said. 
It is “not just a little bit of offshore drilling,” he said, but the entire California coast, the eastern Gulf of Mexico where residents have long opposed offshore drilling, and “every inch of Alaska.”  Huffman is the ranking Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee.
Environmentalists singled out the proposed Arctic lease sales in particular.
“Drilling anywhere in the Arctic Ocean is completely irresponsible. It is remote, ice-filled, stormy, home to irreplaceable wildlife and subsistence traditions. There is no way to clean up oil spills in this environment, and they are inevitable,” Erik Grafe, an attorney for the environmental law firm Earthjustice, said in an emailed statement.
Additionally, Grafe said, leasing in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas is unlawful.
“Those areas have been withdrawn from future leasing by Presidents Obama and Biden, and though President Trump has purported to reverse these withdrawals, he lacks that authority.  Only Congress can open them up again,” he said.
That finding was the result of an environmental lawsuit that Grafe represented. In 2019, Alaska-based U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason ruled that Trump was barred from undoing Obama administration protections for Arctic and East Coast waters.  
A new lawsuit filed in February by many of the same plaintiffs addresses that issue again. The new lawsuit, also with Grafe as one of the plaintiff attorneys, targets Trump’s Inauguration Day executive actions that aimed to open wide swaths of territory to drilling and other development, including the Arctic Ocean.
Another pending legal question concerns whether the federal government has the right to sell leases in the area designated as the High Arctic. That area, part of the North American extended outer continental shelf, lies beyond the 200-nautical-mile U.S. exclusive economic zone. The Biden administration made a territorial claim to the area, which is larger than California. But the claim has yet to be confirmed. The U.S. is not a party to the United National Convention on the Law of the Sea, and that international treaty is used to adjudicate nations’ territorial claims in the outer continental shelf.
The idea of leasing most of the non-Arctic areas off Alaska’s coastline also got a poor reception on Thursday.
Anticipating the new Trump administration plan, a coalition of Alaska Native tribal governments in June sent a letter to Burgum expressing longstanding opposition to Bering Sea oil leasing.
The letter asked Burgum to drop all plans for selling leasing in areas from the Aleutian Islands to the Bering Strait.
“We, the Central Yup’ik, St. Lawrence Island Yupik, and Inupiaq people, have been here since time immemorial. Because we spend so much time out on the Bering Sea fishing and hunting, the sea is just as important to us as the land. The Tribes that still rely on these waters to hunt and fish remain unified in protecting these waters. Our people have been clear: the planning areas in our region should not be made available for oil and gas leasing,” said the letter, which was from the Association of Village Council Presidents, Nome-based Kawerak, Inc. and the Bering Sea Elders Group.
Kawerak, Inc. referred to that June letter Thursday to express its reaction to the new leasing plan.

	The tribal organizations have been the forces behind establishment of the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area during the Obama administration. The designation barred oil leasing and bottom trawling, addressed some shipping safety concerns and established a system for more tribal control.
The first Trump administration abolished the designation; President Joe Biden, in an Inauguration Day executive action, revived it. Trump, on the first day of his second term, abolished the protections again.
A spokesperson for the Department of the Interior said Friday that the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the agency that manages offshore energy activity, will do further evaluation before settling on a final leasing plan.
“The First Proposal is the first of three required steps before the Secretary can finalize the 11th Program. BOEM is including these areas now to meet legal requirements, conduct further analysis, gather public and industry input, and ensure the Secretary can fully evaluate all options before deciding what areas to include in the final program,” Alyse Sharpe, a senior public affairs specialist, said by email.
Huffman, at the Democrats’ news conference, said the public is likely to mobilize nationally against the plan and that his colleagues will work to prevent it from being implemented.
That includes the proposed Arctic and Bering Sea lease sales, which he called “incredibly reckless.”
“We know what the seafood economy means to the state of Alaska. And we know what happened with the Exxon Valdez,’ he said, referring to the 1989 oil spill disaster in Prince William Sound.
“I’m a Californian, but I will fight to protect Alaska’s coast and Alaska’s fisheries as well,” he added.
Eight years ago, when the first Trump administration released a similar plan for oil leasing in almost all areas of federal waters off Alaska, the idea was widely panned in the state.
While political leaders supported leasing in Cook Inlet and the Beaufort and the Chukchi Seas, they objected to the idea of leasing other areas.
Among the groups objecting was the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, which manages commercial seafood harvests in Alaska’s federal waters. The council, citing “the substantial risk to the sustainable management of Alaska’s fisheries,” asked then-Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke to drop all the Bering Sea, Aleutian and Gulf of Alaska lease sales from the plan.
Then-Gov. Bill Walker and the all-Republican congressional delegation made similar requests to Zinke, asking him to focus the plan on Cook Inlet and the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, while retaining longstanding buffers to protect whales and other subsistence resources. The Alaska Legislature passed a resolution with a similar request.
The first Trump administration’s expansive leasing plan never went into effect.
Gleason’s 2019 decision froze action on that leasing plan, and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the Interior agency that manages offshore oil and gas leasing, continued to work under the Obama administration’s 2017-2022 five-year plan. In 2023, the Biden administration released a five-year leasing plan for 2024 through 2029 that was limited to three Gulf of Mexico lease sales.
There has never been any oil produced from federal waters off Alaska except for a small portion of the Hilcorp-operated Northstar field in the Beaufort Sea, which lies mostly on state leases close to shore. The last federal offshore lease sale held in Alaska, a Cook Inlet sale held at the end of 2022, drew only one bid.

(Photo by Zoe Schacht/Colorado Newsline) Officials from across Colorado’s political spectrum are urging Gov. Jared Polis to deny a request from President Donald Trump’s administration to transfer former Mesa County clerk Tina Peters from state prison to federal custody.
The Colorado Department of Corrections said last week that it had received a formal request on Nov. 12 from the Federal Bureau of Prisons seeking the transfer of Peters, who is serving a nine-year prison sentence for her role in a breach of her office’s election systems, part of an attempt to find evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election. The request came amid mounting pressure from Trump, U.S. Pardon Attorney Ed Martin and other far-right figures in the election conspiracy theory movement who have called for Peters’ release.
In a letter to Polis on Friday, the Colorado County Clerks Association warned that agreeing to the request “would send a deeply damaging message” to the local officials who oversee elections in the state’s 64 counties.

“We are deeply concerned that, if transferred, Ms. Peters would continue disseminating the same false narratives that have already endangered clerks throughout Colorado and across the country,” the clerks wrote. “Her pattern of knowingly repeating false claims, long after they were disproven, has fueled harassment, threats, and intimidation against the very officials who protected the integrity of our elections.”
“The risks to these public servants would only grow if she were allowed to use a new legal narrative to further these falsehoods,” the letter adds.
Peters is serving her sentence in a state prison in Pueblo after being convicted of multiple felony counts in connection with her role in breaching Mesa County’s elections systems during a 2021 software security update. Calls for her release by far-right figures have intensified this month following the sweeping pardons that Trump granted to dozens of people involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election through “fake electors” schemes and other means.
Claims that the 2020 election was fraudulent or compromised have been debunked by elections officials, experts, media investigations, law enforcement, the courts and Trump’s own campaign and administration officials.










We are deeply concerned that, if transferred, Ms. Peters would continue disseminating the same false narratives that have already endangered clerks throughout Colorado and across the country.


– Letter from Colorado County Clerks Association


The clerks association, made up of Democratic, Republican and unaffiliated officials, called on Polis to show “courage” in denying the request, and asked to meet personally with the governor before he makes his decision.
“We expect that you will meet personally with Colorado’s clerks before any final decision is made,” the clerks wrote to Polis. “This personal meeting is crucial to ensure that the voices of those who bore the brunt of these events are fully heard.”
Asked about the clerks’ request, a spokesperson for Polis didn’t provide comment for this story before publication.
Violation of public trust
Trump does not have the power to pardon Peters, who was convicted on state charges. The formal BOP request reportedly came at the direction of the Office of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. A partially redacted copy of the email shared by far-right media outlets, which Newsline has not independently verified, showed an unidentified DOJ official ordering the BOP to “explore any and all avenues within BOP’s authority to seek and request” Peters’ transfer to a federal facility. In a Nov. 10 interview with longtime Trump ally Steve Bannon, Martin said that the transfer request would “put the right kind of pressure on” state officials.
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, a Democrat, and Mesa County District Attorney Dan Rubinstein, a Republican who prosecuted the Peters case, have also urged Polis to deny the BOP request. In a joint letter Thursday, they emphasized that Peters’ prosecution was supported by all three of Mesa County’s Republican commissioners and that she was indicted and convicted by juries of her peers, from a community “long recognized for its deep conservative values.”
“Put simply, Ms. Peters is in prison today due to the crimes she committed that put Mesa’s election systems at risk and violated the public’s trust, and for no other reason,” Weiser and Rubinstein wrote. “Her prosecution and sentencing were done with the utmost professionalism and respect for the rule of law, demonstrating how our criminal justice system should always work.”
The outcome of Peters’ transfer to federal custody, the letter adds, would be at best to circumvent Colorado’s criminal justice system in order to give her “preferential treatment,” and at worst to aid her “unauthorized or illegal release.”
“The State of Colorado should not be complicit in either such arrangement,” said Weiser and Rubinstein. “Failing to meet that principle will further strain confidence in our judicial process and embolden those lawbreakers that believe they can evade justice through political connections and pressure.”

The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship said farmers have 120 days to file for indemnity if they had unpaid grain sold before Nov. 17 to Hansen-Mueller Co. 
The Iowa Grain Indemnity Fund will pay farmers up to 90%, with a $400,000 maximum, for their sold grain in the event a state-licensed grain dealer goes broke before it can pay the farmer.

The Iowa Grain Indemnity Fund is supported by farmers who pay a per-bushel fee into the fund when it is below its lower boundary, which the Legislature raised this year to $8 million. The fund was depleted in 2023 due to the bankruptcy of a large dealer, but the Grain Indemnity Fund Board stopped collecting the fees in September this year. 
A spokesperson with IDALS said the fund is currently at $12.6 million and the department does not anticipate that indemnity payments resulting from the Hansen-Mueller bankruptcy will result in the board reinstating grain indemnity fees. 
According to Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings for Hansen-Mueller, none of its 20 largest unsecured claims were with Iowa companies. Some of the top claims include one for more than $4.6 million with Viterra Canada Inc., a more than $2.5 million claim with Cargill in Minnesota and just over $2 million to Beloit, Kansas-based Agmark LLC. 
Hansen-Mueller had its grain dealer license revoked in Nebraska earlier this year, according to reporting from Nebraska Public Radio, when the company failed to make payments to producers. 
The company later made the payments and its license was reinstated by the state licensing agency in early November. 
According to a press release from the company, it intends to continue operations under the supervision of the bankruptcy court and “meet obligations” to employees and suppliers while the sale of its assets is finalized. 
Hansen-Mueller, according to its website, had locations in 10 states, including Iowa. The company had elevators in Sioux City and Council Bluffs. 
Iowa farmers with unpaid grain sold to Hansen-Mueller before Nov. 17, 2025, have until March 17, 2026 to file a claim with the state grain indemnity board. 
Claims must be made in writing and mailed to IDALS Grain Warehouse Bureau. More instructions are available online.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — An Oklahoma law affecting transgender students’ use of public school bathrooms came before a three-judge panel Thursday in the U.S. Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.
Senate Bill 615, signed into law in 2022, requires individuals to use multi-stall school bathrooms and locker rooms that align with their biological sex, not their gender identity. A single-use bathroom also must be made available. 
Oral arguments on behalf of three transgender students challenging the law contended an Oklahoma City federal judge was wrong to dismiss their lawsuit without further considering the case. The plaintiffs, led by then-Noble High School student Andrew Bridge, filed the lawsuit in 2022, arguing SB 615 violates Title IX and the U.S. Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause.
U.S. District Judge Jodi W. Dishman dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice in March 2024, meaning she found the case to be without merit and decided it cannot be refiled.
The plaintiffs then appealed the dismissal to the Tenth Circuit, based in Denver.
The plaintiffs’ attorney, Robert Gianchetti of Covington & Burling LLP, said his clients present a plausible claim for relief and “the students should be afforded the opportunity to prove their claims on their merit.”
“These are very fact-intensive issues that need to be resolved at a later date,” Gianchetti told the appeals court judges.
Oklahoma Solicitor General Garry Gaskins, representing the state and defending the law, contended the case would face “insurmountable obstacles” if it proceeds. He asked the Tenth Circuit judges to let Dishman’s dismissal stand.
The lawsuit is “fundamentally transformed” in light of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision this year to uphold a Tennessee law banning gender-affirming medical treatments for minors, Gaskins said. The Supreme Court justices rejected similar arguments that the Tennessee law violated transgender students’ equal protection rights. 
Tenth Circuit Chief Judge Jerome A. Holmes echoed the Tennessee precedent. He referenced Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito’s opinion that determined different treatment based on gender identity is not enough to violate the Equal Protection Clause.
Rather, the challenged law must treat people unequally based on their biological sex to be overturned, according to Alito’s opinion.
“There’s no differential treatment of men and women in this case,” Holmes said of the Oklahoma lawsuit.
Allowing bathroom use by gender identity could present a “major safety concern,” the Oklahoma City federal judge decided when throwing out the lawsuit.
Tenth Circuit Judge Carolyn B. McHugh, though, said the safety argument “seems a little thin.”
“Do we just presume that there’s a safety issue?” McHugh said. “The (plaintiffs’) complaint suggests the safety issue goes the other way. If you force transgender students to use the bathroom of their sex at birth, they’re more likely to be subject to being beaten up.”
The choice of whether to overturn the dismissal and allow the lawsuit to continue now rests with Holmes, McHugh and Senior Judge Michael R. Murphy. The judges can reach a decision by voting 3-0 or 2-1.
There is no set timeline to issue a decision, but the court typically takes four months, said Cassidy Fallik, of the ACLU of Oklahoma, which represents the plaintiffs.

Free.,Trump praises NYC Mayor-elect Mamdani in warm White House meeting,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-praises-nyc-mayor-elect-mamdani-warm-white-house-meeting,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump and New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani turned around their heated criticism in remarks to the press after an Oval Office meeting Friday.After months of attacking each other, Trump and Mamdani pledged to address the high cost of living for New Yorkers. The White House has tried to steer messaging toward affordability in recent weeks as Trump’s approval ratings on the economy have sunk. “Some of his ideas really are the same ideas I have,” Trump said. “You know the new word is affordability. Another word is just groceries. It’s sort of an old-fashioned word, but it’s very accurate. They’re coming down.”Food prices have risen considerably in recent years. Groceries overall cost 3.1% more than they did a year ago, according to the government’s latest Consumer Price Index.Mamdani campaigned on lowering the cost of living, including property tax reform, making buses free and floating the idea of city-run grocery stories.The mayor-elect described the meeting as “a productive meeting focused on a place of shared admiration and love, which is New York City, and the need to deliver affordability to New Yorkers.”“We spoke about rent, we spoke about groceries, we spoke about utilities, we spoke about the different ways in which people are being pushed out, and I appreciated the time with the president,” Mamdani said.The pair fielded questions on housing costs, crime, whether either of them would retract their recent barbs and whether Trump would backtrack his threats to cut federal money to New York City.“Well, I think if we didn't get along, whether it's cut off or just make it a little bit difficult, or not give as much, we want to see,” Trump said.“We had a meeting today that actually surprised me. He wants to see no crime. He wants to see housing being built. He wants to see rents coming down. All things that I agree with. Now, we may disagree how we get there,” Trump added.In response to a question about GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik, a Trump ally, calling Mamdani a “jihadist” as she eyes the New York gubernatorial seat, Trump said “she's out there campaigning, and you say things sometimes in a campaign.”“I met with a man who is a very rational person. I met with a man who wants to see, really wants to see, New York be great again,” Trump continued, adding “I’ll be cheering for him.”Mamdani will be the city’s first Muslim mayor, as well as the youngest ever elected.Mamdani sought meetingMamdani said he sought the meeting with Trump.“My team reached out to the White House to set up this meeting because I will work with anyone to make life more affordable for the 8 and a half million people who call this city home,” Mamdani said in a press conference Thursday.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Thursday the meeting “speaks to the fact that President Trump is willing to meet with anyone.”“It speaks volumes that tomorrow we have a communist coming to the White House.”Trump and congressional Republicans have repeatedly referred to the 34-year-old Mamdani as a “communist.” Mamdani, who ran on the Democratic ticket, identifies as a Democratic Socialist, an organization that claims roughly 85,000 members nationally. The ideology as a movement received a boost after the 2016 presidential run of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who represents Vermont and caucuses with Democrats.Mamdani beat out former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo this month by a 50.4% to 41% margin, according to the New York Times election coverage. Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa took just over 7% of the vote. Cuomo, who ran as an independent, resigned from office in 2021 after multiple women accused him of sexual harassment.Trump endorsed Cuomo, seemingly reluctantly, on the eve of the election, in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.“Whether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not, you really have no choice,” he wrote. “You must vote for him, and hope he does a fantastic job. He is capable of it, Mamdani is not!”Threat to pull fundingAs Mamdani’s campaign gained momentum, Trump threatened to cut off billions in federal funding to New York City, Trump’s own home city.Trump repeated the threat on election eve, writing on Truth Social that if Mamdani won, New York City would be a “total economic and social disaster” and that NYC should not expect any federal dollars “other than the very minimum as required.”In Mamdani’s victory speech, he referred to Trump as a “despot.”In July, Trump threatened to arrest Mamdani if the incoming mayor does not comply with the administration’s mass deportation campaign, including sending an influx of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to New York City.",,,,2025-11-21 17:59:23.240797

(Screenshot from Tennessee Stands video)Gary Humble, who founded the grassroots conservative group Tennessee Stands, has dropped out of the 2026 race for Tennessee Senate District 27, ending visions he could overcome a small deficit from four years ago. 
In a press release, Humble said his personal life “is in a season of significant transition,” citing business opportunities and family needs. 
Humble first ran for the seat in 2022, challenging Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, a Franklin Republican, in the Republican primary. Johnson was a heavy favorite but beat Humble by only 786 votes out of a total 24,100 cast in the election, and the narrow win left the door open for a rematch. 
In April, the Lookout reported Humble would run again for the seat, and he formally launched his campaign in September. 
Humble formed Tennessee Stands in 2020, initially protesting pandemic policies and  galvanizing resistance to COVID-19 emergency orders by state and local officials. Since then, the group has grown into a political power, opposing Gov. Bill Lee’s private-school voucher plan and backing Rep. Jody Barrett, a Dickson Republican, in the recent Republican primary for Congressional District 7.  
“Our political system is not healthy. We all see it — the corruption, the power structures, the backroom deals, the pressure to compromise, and the machine that punishes anyone who dares stand outside it,” Humble said in the statement announcing his withdrawal from the race.. “The environment is spiritually exhausting, and the cost on families is real.”

(Courtesy New Mexico National Guard) 
The small state agency that coordinates responses to natural disasters and other emergencies across New Mexico is seeking a significant funding boost next year, a reflection both of an expected increase in fires and floods and also a potential exodus of contractors if federal funds stop flowing through the agency. 
Miguel Aguilar, the adjutant general of the New Mexico National Guard and secretary of the state Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, told the Legislative Finance Committee on Thursday that the agency is seeking a nearly $7 million budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2026. That’s a roughly $2.5 million increase over the agency’s current budget.
The increase is necessary, Aguilar said, to keep up with increasing natural disasters, including ones the department is responding to now and that it expects in the future. So far this year, he reported, the department has activated its State Emergency Operations Center 11 times for storms, flooding and landslides.
“We’ve had a rough couple years,” Aguilar told the LFC on Thursday at the beginning of his remarks. He went on to say that prolonged drought means perpetual risk of wildfire, while burn scars across the state will often be the site of dangerous floods and debris flows.  
“Even moderate monsoon storms can produce dangerous runoff” in burn scars, he said. 
‘My staff is spent’: New Mexico emergency management leader reflects on year of disasters

The funding increase would allow the department to hire 13 new full-time employees, including engineers, analysts and program managers. The department currently has eight employees tasked with emergency response, according to the presentation. 
That small crew manages millions of dollars in federal grants, including for federally declared disasters like the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire in 2022 and the South Fork and Salt fires in 2024. 
Aguilar said the department relies heavily on private contractors to handle much of the work, a longstanding practice at the department since 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina. That’s when the state first began receiving a large share of its operating revenue in federal funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other federal agencies. 
He expects federal funding to slowly go away, Aguilar said. That will mean a loss of the contractors, and, with them, institutional knowledge.
“As the burn scars heal, assuming there’s not another long fire,” the department will need to build its own capacity with new state employees, he said, as contractors leave alongside federal funding. 
“We don’t have the [staff] to really do the things that the state needs us to do over the coming years,” he said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/480628493_945485931104974_4705135364372250275_n-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-11-21 17:59:23.240797

“And then, in September, I get fired for absolutely no reason,” the former director of the Fair and Impartial Policing and Community Affairs Committee said.
Now, almost two months after he was fired, Nasreddin-Longo said he is “still in the dark” and has had no communication from the department about reasons behind his removal. 
While DPS Commissioner Jennifer Morrison said the decision was hers alone, she and other members of the state police have declined to comment on why he was removed, as it involves “personnel matters.” Birmingham did not respond to a request for comment.
Nasreddin-Longo, 62, is a professor of musicology and composer, a longtime advocate for racial justice and, until recently, the salaried part-time head of the DPS committee that advises and provides implicit bias training to law enforcement, among other things. 
He said he came to the position by chance when a gym buddy who was in law enforcement asked him to join a committee exploring bias-free policing. He was surprised by the term and recalled saying, “if you don’t have any bias, you’re probably dead.”Nasreddin-Longo, who identifies as mixed race, Jewish and Muslim, said he initially thought he would not get involved, but got drawn in more so after George Floyd’s killing in 2020, when he became a salaried civilian employee of the state police.
“You cannot be Black in this country, have a brain and have a heart and not get into this work at some point in your life, either professionally or not professionally,” he said.
Since then, Nasreddin-Longo’s work has been celebrated by advocates and racial justice leaders to advance equity statewide, such as creating a first ever anti-bias police training outline. In 2022, he was given an award for outstanding dedication and his contributions to the committee at the Vermont State Police’s annual ceremony at the statehouse.
He is “a trusted resource, a thoughtful educator” who has built bridges between marginalized communities and law enforcement, said Amanda Garcés, the new commissioner of the Vermont Truth and Reconciliation Commission. She briefly worked with him on a different Fair and Impartial Policing subcommittee under the Vermont Criminal Justice Council, which is tasked with creating the statewide model policy for fair and impartial policing.
“In every setting I have been part of, whether in community conversations or in discussions with law enforcement, people consistently spoke of Etan with genuine respect. His trainings, his approach to dialogue, and the care he brings to difficult issues have earned him deep regard across the state,” she wrote in an email.
Nasreddin-Longo said he particularly enjoyed forging new relationships between the DPS and groups like the Root Social Justice Center, which prioritizes Black, Indigenous, and people of color communities. But he received positive verbal feedback for such work from supervisors, he said, and has never faced a disciplinary action that he knows of. 
An ‘abrupt’ departure
The first indication Nasreddin-Longo had of any issues involving his position was at the beginning of September, he said, when he was asked to write his own contract for the first time. At that time, he learned that the department wanted to turn his salaried position into a consultant contract, with no reasons given. He declined but said it felt “very irregular” and “very abrupt.”
Then, during a Sept. 25 meeting with Morrison, Nasreddin-Longo was handed “a boilerplate termination letter” with no reasons given. He signed it and left. 
“I had no plans to say anything. I want them to say something,” he said.
The public safety department issued a brief press release on Sept. 29 confirming Nasreddin-Longo was “not currently a state employee.”
Almost two months later, Nasreddin-Longo said he doesn’t think it’s a coincidence that he was removed at a time when DEI efforts and diverse voices are being undermined and undercut across the state and nation. 
“I certainly wasn’t thinking of retirement,” he said.
Morrison plans to post the currently vacant part-time civilian position early next year, with input from the community, according to Adam Silverman, public information officer for Vermont State Police. Nasreddin-Longo’s co-director and police counterpart Sgt. Daniel Bennett is leading the committee. Bennett did not respond to a request for comment.
In a Nov. 7 email to the Fair and Impartial Policing Committee, Morrison said she is focused on hiring a new co-director of FIP and more clearly defining the role of the FIP committee in consultation with longtime FIP committee members.
The committee, established in 2009, meets four times a year and acts as an advisory group to the Vermont State Police to address bias and hate crimes in policing, hiring and working with marginalized communities, and conducts law enforcement training, according to the website.
Other advocates of the FIP committee’s work also see Nasreddin-Longo’s sudden removal as an ominous sign of the times. 
With the federal government rolling back decades of civil rights progress and threatening states that fail to comply, Vermonters are right to question the motives behind the firing of one of the state’s most respected racial equity leaders, James Duff Lyall, executive director of the ACLU of Vermont, said in an email.
“The evidence is all around us that systemic racism is alive and well in our state and continues to perpetuate real harm in our communities — and the silence and inaction of so many state leaders is telling,” he wrote.
Vermont’s criminal justice system, Lyall added, still has some of the worst racial disparities in the country — from racial disparities in state prosecutions to the House and Senate judiciary committees failing for three years to advance a bill that could address pervasive racial profiling on Vermont’s roadways. 
“These are the kinds of injustices Etan Nasreddin-Longo worked to dismantle,” he said.  
“Until we know more, it’s difficult to see this as anything other than a slap in the face to Vermonters who are calling on state leaders to act with urgency and resolve in defense of our laws and our values,” Lyall wrote.
The Windham County NAACP also called for community support in the wake of “the perceived unfairness” of Nasreddin-Longo’s removal and offered its help.
Garces said it is sad to see a widely respected state employee removed from his role without a clear explanation. 
“Vermont has long benefited from his integrity, compassion and experience in equity work. My hope is that the commitment to fair and impartial policing remains strong and transparent moving forward,” she said.
Nasreddin-Longo said he is humbled by the community support he has received: “It’s nice to know that that’s there. I’m just sorry that things have worked out this way. I wish I had a reason.”
After years of work by the FIP committee, advocates are mostly worried that progress may be reversed or terminated.
Federal policies have no impact on the work of the committee, according to a Nov. 7 email from Morrison to the Fair and Impartial Policing Committee. Marginalized communities will continue to be heard, and there is “no intention of watering” the FIP down, she wrote.
Rep. Angela Arsenault, D-Williston, who serves on the House Judiciary Committee and the Joint Judicial Retention Committee, doesn’t have any information on the dismissal either and urged transparency from the department.
“I do think that the Department of Public Safety’s failure to provide a clear rationale — to a valued employee and a concerned public — could serve to uphold many of the harmful constructs that Etan was charged with helping to dismantle,” she said.
Nasreddin-Longo said he had volunteered on the committee since about 2012 and was hired as a co-director in 2020. When Birmingham hired him, he said: “Your job is not to be a yes man,” Nasreddin-Longo recalled, and said he took it to heart.
After years of helping to build relationships with communities of color and other marginalized groups, Nasreddin-Longo said he hopes the work continues with intention and better communication. 
“I just hope that they’re going to approach this process of reformulation and hiring that I knew nothing about with a lot more cultural sensitivity than they showed in firing me,” he said, “because if they don’t, they’ve already lost the battle.”

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The Senate’s plan to address the school choice voucher system’s shortfalls was made public Friday. 
“A myriad of accountability problems” went on display this week when two legislative committees reacted to an independent audit showing “funding did not follow the child” to private schools or homeschool. Now, Sen. Don Gaetz, R-Crestview, has put out his chamber’s plan, co-sponsored by the chairs of both Senate education committees. 
‘Funding did not follow the child’: State audit displays school choice woes

In the nearly 150-page bill, SB 318, Gaetz, a former school district superintendent, touches concerns raised by school districts, parents, private schools, and scholarship funding organizations. 
“As the Auditor General has made clear, the architecture of our current funding system has scrambled together the funds for public schools, private schools, home schooling and unique ability scholarships and then the Department and the Scholarship Funding Organizations have to unscramble upwards of $4 billion and send the right amounts to the right places for the right students at the right times. No wonder there are problems,” the Senate president’s office said in releasing Gaetz’s bill.
The bill establishes:

 A categorical fund for the scholarship programs as opposed to the existing practice of lumping those funds together with all school funding; 
Requires a minimum of $250 million in a fund that offsets unexpected budgetary costs related to school choice scholarships;
And “clears up the timing confusion in the present system and establishes clear application and scholarship acceptance deadlines that occur prior to the funding of scholarships,” according to the Senate president’s office.

Additionally, the bill would provide the state access to scholarship funding organizations’ databases. After each verification of student locations, the list of students must be provided to the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, the chair of the House Budget Committee, and the office of the governor.

The Senate plan would require the Department of Education to investigate written complaints from parents, students, and schools regarding school choice laws and investigate fraudulent activity and overpayment, and refer them to the Department of Financial Services for potential criminal investigation. 
Private schools that do not properly attest that a child attends their school could be investigated for fraud and would have to repay the funds, according to the bill. 
During a committee meeting this week, Gaetz acknowledged his bill is not “perfect,” but said it fixes “issues, which, left unaddressed, will continue to worsen and threaten to disrupt and imperil school choice in Florida.”
The department would be required to develop a uniform reimbursement and invoicing process and create stricter application windows for scholarships, addressing a concern Rep. Toby Overdorf, R-Palm City, among several other representatives, shared last month. 
The bill would requires all students including those attending private schools, to be tracked with Florida Education Identifier numbers, unique to each student, to better check the location of students, a focal point for Reps. John Snyder, R-Stuart, and Fiona McFarland, R-Sarasota. Under the existing model, not all non-public school students were being tracked with those numbers, making verification of student information a heavier lift. 
The Phoenix reported this week the House and Senate, while both acknowledging the problems with the program, are not entirely on the same page, particularly whether to separate the school choice programs from the school funding model.

(USDA Photo by Lance Cheung)Agricultural groups and environmental groups combined to file a lawsuit against the state’s Department of Natural Resources and Conservation alleging the state’s exempt well laws allow unregulated groundwater development outside the state’s permitting system.
According to the DNRC, small groundwater developments that use 35 gallons per minute or less and do not exceed 10 acre-feet per year, are known as “exempt wells.”
There may be as many as 141,000 exempt wells authorized between 1973 and 2023, the lawsuit says. 
“By authorizing unregulated groundwater development, the Exempt Well Law undermines these constitutional protections afforded to senior water right appropriators and threatens the integrity of Montana’s water resources,” the lawsuit says.
The coalition bringing the lawsuit against the state is broad, including the Montana League of Cities and Towns, Association of Gallatin Agricultural Irrigators, Clark Fork Coalition, Montana Environmental Information Center, Montana Farm Bureau Federation, and Trout Unlimited.
A DNRC spokesperson said they could not comment on the suit due to litigation being active.
“From rapid growth to ongoing drought, Montana’s water resources and water users are facing unprecedented challenges,” Andrew Gorder, legal director of the Clark Fork Coalition, said in a press release. “The cumulative impact of over 100,000 exempt groundwater wells can no longer be ignored. We’re asking the court to conserve our limited water resources and ensure that the constitutional protections afforded to senior water rights, including instream flow rights, are preserved.”
The lawsuit goes on to say that some of Montana’s fastest growing areas have been “fueled” by individual exempt wells. The issue was heavily discussed during the legislative session, with some home developers and realtor associations pushing to keep rules as they are now.
Advocates against exempt wells have said developers have exploited the exempt well rule to build new homes and try to solve the state’s housing crunch. 
“Exempt wells facilitate a housing development model and pattern that is unsustainable,” Mark Runkle, a Montana housing developer said in a press release. “It transfers many of the developer’s responsibilities to future homeowners and taxpayers. This model undermines responsible development on municipal services with infrastructure completed and undermines the affordability of housing.”
One bill last session — Senate Bill 358 — would have restricted usage of exempt wells in some high-growth areas of the state. 
“The State knows that exempt wells adversely affect senior water rights,” the lawsuit states. “Yet, legislative attempts to address the exempt well loophole have been unsuccessful in multiple sessions, including the 2025 session, demonstrating the legislature’s unwillingness or inability to bring the Water Use Act into constitutional compliance.”
The suit seeks to end the exempt well “loophole.”
“The exempt well loophole forces cities and towns to shoulder the consequences of unregulated groundwater use,” Kelly Lynch, executive director of Montana League of Cities and Towns, said in a press release. “Municipalities are already struggling to ensure reliable water supplies for growing communities. We need a consistent, lawful permitting process that protects existing users, not a system that leaves Montana’s communities and taxpayers to clean up the mess.”

Gov. Phil Scott submitted the appeal Friday and believes the state has bolstered its case for why it needs federal assistance, his office said.

Gov. Phil Scott on Friday formally appealed President Donald Trump’s rejection of a state application for federal disaster aid stemming from flooding that struck the Northeast Kingdom in July this year. 
Scott and his top deputy for flood recovery, Doug Farnham, had previously said the administration was working on an appeal of Trump’s decision, which came in October. 
The state is asking the feds for a major disaster declaration, which in this case, would allow towns in Caledonia and Essex counties to unlock Federal Emergency Management Agency funding to cover the costs of repairing critical infrastructure and starting new projects to halt the risk of future flooding, among other possible expenses.

In a press release Friday, the governor’s office said its appeal pointed to how it can be expensive for towns to rebuild their infrastructure in accordance with modern flood resilience guidelines. It also pointed to “the cumulative economic effect on the state and communities that have seen catastrophic floods in each of the last three years.”
Some towns in the rural region experienced flooding in 2025 on the same day they experienced flooding in 2024 and 2023.
“After submitting our disaster declaration request, we learned about more damage that wasn’t included in our initial submission,” Scott added in the release. “This information significantly increases financial burden for repairs which we believe strengthens our appeal.”
Officials said previously that recovery costs were proving to be higher in the Caledonia County town of Sutton — seemingly the worst hit this year — than they previously thought. Sutton suffered more than $1 million in damage, according to Scott’s office.
Friday’s appeal was sent to FEMA, according to the press release, which will review it and then send a recommendation to Trump, who will approve or deny the request.
It’s far from a guarantee that Trump will change his mind after seeing Vermont’s appeal, though. At least two other states — Maryland and Michigan — had appeals for disaster aid stemming from major weather events rejected by the White House this fall.
Trump’s decision to reject Vermont’s initial request for aid for the 2025 flooding came on the same day he also denied aid requests from several other states that are largely Democratic, but he approved requests from several Republican-leaning states. 
A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, of which FEMA is a part, contended previously that Trump’s decision was not politically motivated and was instead due to a determination that Vermont could pay for its recovery needs on its own.
An analysis last month by the Pew Charitable Trusts found that without federal assistance after the most significant disasters, many states would see their reserves depleted. Vermont is among the most vulnerable states to such federal funding cuts, according to the analysis.
Trump’s rejection of disaster aid had no recent precedent for the state. Vermont received the major disaster declarations it sought following the flooding in 2023 and 2024, when President Joe Biden was in office.
Its 2025 request is for federal aid for towns; the state did not seek aid for individuals this year, as it did the previous two years.

(Photos courtesy of the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources)As a public debate begins about agriculture and water pollution in South Dakota, a new report shows the effects of a $3 million effort to mitigate the problem. 
South Dakota’s top state Senate Republican and the governor sparred this week over whether the state should tighten agricultural regulations to address water pollution. Senate President Pro Tempore Chris Karr, R-Sioux Falls, told a legislative committee that with most monitored rivers and streams in the state too polluted to support at least some uses, such as swimming, fishing or boating, the state can no longer “dance around” the idea of more regulations on agriculture.
Gov. Larry Rhoden, a rancher, blasted those comments as “misinformation” made “out of ignorance” and said Karr would be “set straight.” 
With so much polluted water, SD lawmaker says state can no longer ‘dance around’ ag regulations

Meanwhile, a final report quietly emerged about an effort to keep cattle waste out of lakes and streams and reduce chemical and sediment runoff from farms. Karr was the prime sponsor of the bill that created the 2021 initiative. The state Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources managed it. It paid $3 million to help landowners contain livestock waste or plant grass and other vegetation along streambanks in the Big Sioux River watershed.
Jay Gilbertson, manager of the East Dakota Water Development District, said the enrolled vegetated strips, called buffers, filter pollution and stabilize stream banks. Livestock are required to be kept out of the areas for part of the year, except during limited times and circumstances when grazing and haying are allowed. 
According to the report, 67 projects created 83 linear miles of buffers, protecting 1,219 acres. The project contracts last for 10 years. They prevent an estimated 1,484 pounds of phosphorus, 6,415 pounds of nitrogen and 953 tons of sediment from entering the Big Sioux River watershed each year.
Payments increased after low interest
The program started slowly. Nobody had signed up for it by January 2023, two years after it was approved. 
“The feedback that we got back was that we’re not paying enough to really move the needle,” Hunter Roberts, secretary of the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources, told lawmakers at the time.
So, the department began paying more.
Governor says lawmaker will be ‘set straight’ on suggestion to regulate agricultural water polluters

DANR materials say that under the original cash-incentive program, a 50-foot, half-mile buffer under a minimum 10-year contract would have yielded a total payment of about $5,000 for cropland and $1,300 for pastureland over 10 years. Under a new formula Roberts outlined, the rates for the same examples increased to about $13,000 for cropland and $3,400 for pastureland.
Additionally, the department allowed the funds to be spent on livestock waste containment systems. Two of those were installed, involving 69 cattle. The department also allowed landowners to “stack” their program payments on top of payments from the federal government’s Conservation Reserve Program, which pays landowners to take marginal land out of agricultural production. That meant landowners could receive both federal and state payments for eligible acres, plus another incentive if those stacked acres are enrolled in a Game, Fish and Parks program that pays landowners to allow public access for hunters. 
“Everybody seems to like free money or at least additional money,” Gilbertson said. “And these activities got the ball rolling, and it turned out to be pretty popular.”
Gilbertson credited lawmakers, including Karr, for launching the initiative.
“It was a great example of the Legislature stepping forward, stepping up and saying we need to invest in our natural resources here in South Dakota,” he said.
Benefits and worries beyond 10 years
Sushant Mehan is an assistant professor and water resource engineer at South Dakota State University. He and a team are quantifying how the buffer initiative changes vegetation and downstream water quality.

He said buffers are often on flood-prone, low-yield acres, and the research already shows enrolled acres are more productive during the times when grazing and haying are allowed than they would be under year-round grazing.
“So, if people go that route, ultimately, it’s a win-win situation for them,” Mehan said. 
Mehan frames the benefits of buffers as both direct for landowners and indirect for everyone paying a water bill. He said filtering out contaminants is a costly business for water systems, and those costs are passed along to customers. 
Mehan said the next step is figuring out where buffers will do the most good. The team’s ongoing work is about mapping which enrolled acres are “truly critical” to maximize water-quality gains.
Gilbertson worries that maintaining the buffers after the 10-year contracts expire could be difficult if landowners expect a similar payment.
Paul Lorenzen administers the state’s watershed protection program for the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources. He said the program included cost-sharing for fencing and alternative water sources. He said once those investments are in place, landowners may choose to keep the buffers even after the checks stop. 
Lorenzen said other programs with similar 10-year commitments have seen producers stick with the practices once they experience the benefits, and he hopes buffers will follow the same pattern.

(Pool photo by Tanner Ecker/Bismarck Tribune)The North Dakota Supreme Court has upheld North Dakota’s abortion ban as constitutional after the court failed to meet the supermajority required to overturn the law.
The Friday decision reverses a lower court’s ruling from last fall that struck down the law and found that women have a right to seek abortions until the point of fetal viability. 
Three of the five justices found the law unconstitutional: Daniel Crothers, Lisa Fair McEvers and Daniel Narum, who sat on the case in place of Douglas Bahr, who recused. Chief Justice Jon Jensen and Justice Jerod Tufte found the law constitutional.
North Dakota Supreme Court hears arguments over abortion ban

The ruling followed more than two years of litigation over an abortion ban signed into law by then-Gov. Doug Burgum in April 2023. The law bars abortion in all cases except rape or incest if the mother has been pregnant less than six weeks, or when the pregnancy poses a serious physical health threat. Psychological conditions do not count as serious health risks under the ban.
The state’s Republican-dominated Legislature passed the 2023 law with overwhelming support from both chambers just weeks after the North Dakota Supreme Court struck down its previous abortion ban.
A group of reproductive health care doctors and an abortion clinic sued the state over the new policy, arguing that it did not fix any of the problems the high court identified with the prior ban. The plaintiffs said the law endangered the lives of pregnant women and denied doctors due process by not specifying when an abortion may be performed for health reasons.
The state of North Dakota maintained that the ban was not vague and was necessary to protect unborn children.

They were displayed on a table at a downtown Providence shop Friday afternoon in a collection of popular toys families might be considering purchasing for their kids this holiday season. 
But they’re also among the most dangerous, according to the latest “Trouble in Toyland” report recently published by the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), a Denver-based consumer rights nonprofit. 
It’s the 40th year the group has published its annual list of toys that could be dangerous to children, Henry Welch, a campaign associate for the Rhode Island chapter, told reporters gathered outside Craftland Friday afternoon.
In the past, Welch said the biggest dangers with toys were choking hazards and lead.
“A lot of the toys that we found that were dangerous are no longer available,” Welch said. “However, some of these dangers are still out there, including some toys that seemed like a dystopian science fiction of the past that are now available.”
Exhibit A among those dystopian toys is that teddy bear on the table. 
Sold for $99 by Singapore-based FoloToy, “Kumma Bear” uses OpenAI models to hold “both friendly chats and deep conversations to stimulate curiosity and learning,” according to its now-gone product page.
But the PIRG report found Kumma’s programming had very few guardrails in place.
Kumma told researchers where they could find knives in a household, Welch said. It also said where matches could be found, along with directions on how to light them.
“One thing that we found that was really disturbing was that Kumma the teddy bear would talk about sexually explicit content with our researchers,” Welch said. “That obviously is not appropriate for children.”
Kumma has since been removed from the market, CNN reported Wednesday. But Welch warned that AI-powered toys will remain a problem if the market continues to be unregulated.
“These toys aren’t really tested well enough,” he said.
AI may be the biggest issue of the day, but choking hazards continue to be a big issue in toys — in particular, the tiny water-absorbing polymer beads next to Kumma bear. 
Dr. Stephanie Ruest, an assistant professor of emergency medicine and pediatrics at Hasbro Children’s Hospital, told reporters the beads remain a persistent problem for the emergency department.
Beads start off small, roughly the size of a peppercorn. But when exposed to liquid, they can grow to the size of a cherry tomato. That includes bodily fluids, which makes them really dangerous if swallowed, Reust said.
“It can cause blockage, which is a surgical emergency,” she said.
Welch noted that the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has issued new standards, setting a maximum size of 9 millimeters in diameter, but that parents should continue to be careful when purchasing the product.










One thing that we found that was really disturbing was that Kumma the teddy bear would talk about sexually explicit content with our researchers. That obviously is not appropriate for children.

But the Consumer Product Safety Commission recalled it in March because it contains a resin that can cause skin, eye and respiratory irritation if inhaled, touched or ingested when still in liquid form. The resin contains an acrylate (hydroxyethylmethacrylate “HEMA”) in amounts prohibited in children’s products by the Federal Hazardous Substances Act. 
“But I was able to buy it on eBay and received it after a couple of days with no warning,” Welch said.
Welch and Reust recommend parents and guardians keep tabs on which toys have been recalled by visiting recalls.gov.
Among Ruest’s biggest fears for children is ingesting button batteries.
“This is truly a medical emergency,” she said. “They can burn holes through the esophagus. They can burn any place a child may lodge them.”
Really any small toy continues to pose a choking hazard, depending on the age of a child. A good way to test its chokability is through a toilet roll or by comparing it to the size of your child’s fist, Reuset suggested.
“If you have a toy that can freely pass through a toilet paper roll without getting stuck, or the toy — or pieces of the toy — is smaller than a child’s fist, those are toys a child may choke on and you may want to avoid those,” she said.
Another way to prevent choking is to properly store toys.
“A lot of things we see in the emergency department are young children who get into things that weren’t meant for them,” Reust said. “They find them lying around the house as their sibling was playing with it.”

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Oklahoma residents may get to vote to eliminate property taxes for homes they live in.
Two lawmakers and a former legislator on Friday filed papers with the Oklahoma Secretary of State to circulate an initiative petition to let voters decide to gradually reduce some property taxes and end them in 2029.
State Question 841 would not apply to bonded indebtedness incurred by schools, counties, municipalities or other political subdivisions prior to Dec. 31, 2026.
The change would be effective Jan. 1, 2027, when an amount equal to about 33% of the full assessed value of the homestead would be exempt. The next year, it would increase to nearly 67% before being eliminated in 2029.
The measure would reduce ad valorem revenue by $400 million in 2027, $800 million in 2028 and $1.2 billion in 2029, according to the petition.
The proponents of the petition are former Rep. Mike Reynolds, R-Oklahoma City; Sen. Shane Jett, R-Shawnee; and Rep. Jay Steagall, R-Yukon.
It would be a statutory change and require 92,263 signatures.
Schools, cities and counties rely on property tax revenue to purchase equipment, build facilities and maintain infrastructure.
Reynolds said he expects some criticism of the measure.
One of those critics is Oklahoma County Commissioner Jason Lowe, a former Democratic lawmaker.
“That would destroy county government,” he said, adding that it would eliminate jobs and services.
Oklahoma County does not receive revenue from sales tax, he said. Property tax is its only form of revenue, he said.
“That is a scary proposition,” Lowe said, adding that it is irresponsible.
Reynolds said it will be up to the Legislature to determine how the funds will be replaced, adding that it will have three years to do so.
“For years, Oklahomans who live in a home here and take up primary residency have never truly owned their home and property taxes are evidence of that,” Steagall said.
Even if the home is paid off, the owner will still have to pay property taxes to the government or have their property seized by the government, Steagall said. 
The measure won’t cut off property taxes for businesses or people that rent homes, Reynolds said.
It will encourage homeownership because payments will be less, Reynolds said. 
“Businesses that are apparently buying houses all over the nation will have a harder time competing against local residents,” Reynolds said.
Steagall said the timeframe gives the entities receiving the property tax revenue time to address replacing those streams.
“The initiative petition does not have the intent of making it impossible for cities or counties to collect revenue necessary to run critical operations that they are responsible for,” Steagall said. “It just puts into perspective here that property taxes are going to be a revenue source that is off limits.” 
A new state law being challenged at the Oklahoma Supreme Court makes it more difficult for people to get issues on the ballot.
But Reynolds believes the petition will be successful.
“I think that this will be popular enough that we shouldn’t have a problem getting the necessary signatures anyway,” Reynolds said.
Steagall said elimination of property taxes is widely supported.
Supporters hope to get it on the November 2026 ballot.

(Photo by Narumon Bowonkitwanchai/Getty Images)Iowa State University officials are working to develop a faster track to semiconductor careers and establish a talent pipeline in the international, high-demand industry through a new training program.
Powered by a three-year, $30 million grant from the National Science Foundation, the 12-month program will provide students with virtual and hands-on learning and training in the foundations and skills that are needed to make a career in semiconductor chips, said ISU associate professor of electrical and computer engineering Santosh Pandey. Pandey is team leader on the project.
Pandey, who teaches a 13-week course each fall where students build semiconductor chips, said enrollment before the COVID-19 pandemic ranged from 10 to 12 students, but has since grown to classes of 40.

“In recent years, we have had students who are very interested in learning about semiconductors. They take our courses, and the job opportunities have opened up, especially since the chip shortage happened after the pandemic,” Pandey said. “A lot of companies are recruiting, and they want students with advanced skills in semiconductors.”
Described by the Semiconductor Industry Association as “the brain of modern electronics,” the association’s website states semiconductors are materials created from pure elements and an incredibly important component of electronic devices like medical equipment, computers, smart phones and more.

Traditional educational paths to the semiconductor industry can include the completion of a master’s or doctorate degree, Pandey said, which takes too long with current and projected employee shortages. According to the team’s grant application abstract, the talent gap in the industry is growing, and by 2030 there are predicted to be more than 61,000 unfilled positions.
The new program will get students the training they need at an accelerated pace, Pandey said, with the support of faculty mentors and industry experts.
“That was the whole motivation, to ramp up the formal education process and to condense it, to give it in a package form,” Pandey said.
Aiming for future growth
In its inaugural year, Pandey said the program will admit around seven students. Plans are to expand enrollment to nine students in the next year and then to 12 students in the next, for a total of 28 students for the length of the grant.
Community colleges are a crucial part of this initiative, Pandey said, as students attending two-year institutions are one of the targeted demographics for enrollment in the program. ISU will partner with Iowa Central Community College, Iowa Western Community College and Eastern Iowa Community Colleges to offer their students a chance to apply, as well as certain ISU students.
Students need to have physics and math courses listed on their transcript in order to qualify, Pandey said. Those interested in applying will submit their transcripts to a National Science Foundation portal that is set to open over the college’s Thanksgiving break at the end of November.
Pandey said selections of the first cohort will take place in January and the program will kick off in February, starting with virtual instruction until summer arrives. This is when students will get hands-on experience in the ISU Microelectronics Research Center and at PowerFilm Solar, an Ames-based company focused on solar cells and other power solutions.
“In the first year, we will see what is the retention of the materials that we are teaching, how good the students can absorb the material, and can they actually line up internships and job opportunities after they graduate,” Pandey said.
Students to receive expert training, mentorship
Six U.S. semiconductor companies, including PowerFilm Solar, Collins Aerospace in Cedar Rapids, Western Digital in California, Wolfspeed in New York, Canon Nanotechnologies in Texas and Analog Devices in Massachusetts, are partnering with Pandey and his team for the program. The companies are helping to steer what students will study, Pandey said, as well as planning to give talks and interact with students.
As these companies have told Pandey they’re looking for hires who already have hands-on experience, he said students participating in the program will also have a faculty member to act as a mentor and work with them on research projects. Students will also train in leadership skills and have access to the ISU campus and its resources, including peer mentors, study groups and more.
“There is a critical shortage within the country for advanced skills in this area, and we want to be the leaders to provide that, at least within Iowa,” Pandey said.

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Gov. Phil Murphy submitted nearly 100 nominations to a slew of state boards and commissions Thursday in what is likely to be the grandest tranche of nominees before he leaves office on Jan. 20.
Many of the 97 nominations referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday would extend the terms of individuals already sitting on a range of state bodies, though others would install individuals in new and consequential positions and keep them there at least partway through Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill’s term.
Micah Rasmussen, director of Rider University’s Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics, said Murphy’s lame-duck move is “not unusual at all.”
“Lame duck is an opportunity to clear the deck, and that’s going to be true of any outgoing governor,” Rasmussen said. “I guess the thing that makes it a little unusual for New Jersey standards is that you have a Democrat who’s succeeding a Democrat.”
Sherrill is the first Democrat to succeed a two-term Democratic New Jersey governor in more than 60 years, and her pending ascent as the state’s chief executive could complicate some nominations, though other positions can be filled or emptied at the governor’s say-so.
The list of new Murphy nominations is long and varied, and includes some of the governor’s top advisers.
Mahen Gunaratna, Murphy’s communications director and a close longtime aide, was nominated to a seat on the Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield board of directors. The part-time post comes with an $82,000 salary.
Gunaratna, who has led the administration’s messaging on public worker health benefit reforms, would fill the seat currently held by former Assemblyman Ralph Caputo.
“I think his nomination in this case may have more to do with his involvement in the subject matter and his interest in the subject matter,” Rasmussen said.
Murphy nominated his chief counsel, Kate McDonnell, to a seat on the Rowan University-Rutgers Camden Board of Governors, along with Community Affairs Commissioner Jacqueline Suárez.
Hudson County Democratic Chairman Craig Guy received a nomination to the board of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and Kevin O’Toole, the board’s chairman, was nominated for another term.
Murphy nominated Republican former state Sen. Kip Bateman, Democratic State Committee vice chair Peg Schaffer, and Brian Woods, chief of staff to the 8th Legislative District’s GOP lawmakers, to the State Parole Board. Schaffer is also Somerset County’s Democratic chairwoman.
Former Hunterdon County Democratic Chair Arlene Quiñones Perez was nominated to Montclair State University’s board of trustees.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/0JS19906_1-1024x736.jpg,,,2025-11-21 16:57:58.666732

(Getty Images)Idahoans may weigh in on the state’s transition to managing Medicaid through a private, third-party company. 
The Idaho Legislature during the 2025 session approved House Bill 345, which moved oversight of Idaho’s entire Medicaid program to a managed care organization, added work requirements for some people, and required cost sharing of services for participants, among other sweeping changes. 
Idaho governor signs bill to privatize management, add work requirements to Medicaid program

The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare is seeking public comment through a statewide survey that’s open through Dec. 31, according to a press release from the agency. The survey is aimed at Medicaid members, providers, managed care organizations, and pharmacy benefit managers. 
“Our goal is to build a managed care system that truly reflects what Idahoans need from their health care,” Health and Welfare Director Juliet Charron said in the release. “We want to hear directly from the people we serve and from those who deliver care. Your voices will help us build a system that supports better access, strong outcomes, and long-term sustainability.”
The agency is also hosting in-person listening sessions around the state to hear from people currently using Medicaid, family members or caregivers of those on Medicaid, health care providers, and other community partners. 
The listening session schedule is:

Dec. 15, 2025 | Rexburg
Jan. 6, 2026 | Caldwell
Feb. 3, 2026 | Virtual only
March 10, 2026 | Gooding
April 7, 2026 | Boise
May 26, 2026 | Coeur d’Alene
May 28, 2026 | Lewiston

Idaho health officials have said it will take years to shift Idaho’s Medicaid program to managed care, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
Idaho Medicaid to be privately managed in 2029, health officials expect

Many of Idaho’s Medicaid services had been provided what’s called a “fee-for-service” model, by which health care providers give the care to participants and then get reimbursed by Medicaid. Around 256,000 Idahoans use Medicaid services, according to numbers reported in September by Health and Welfare. 
The state briefly went to a new model in which services overseen by local doctor-led organizations, in a unique-to-Idaho system called value-based care, which is expected to end in 2026. 
Under managed care, a private contractor, or MCO, will oversee all services, such as doctor visits, prescriptions and hospital stays. 
The work requirements under the new program will affect patients in Medicaid expansion, a program approved by Idaho voters in 2018 to open eligibility to those who fell in the gap between earning too much for traditional Medicaid and not enough to qualify for federal premium assistance to afford private health care through the state marketplace. 
As of September, there were 89,881 people using Medicaid expansion services in Idaho.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota State Investment Board on Friday delayed approval of roughly $1.3 million in bonuses to 12 Retirement and Investment Office employees intended to reward strong performance of the state’s investment funds.
Seven of the bonuses exceed $100,000, with the top one exceeding $293,000. If the bonuses are ultimately accepted, it would be the first time the agency awards them.
Bonus pay is common in other states’ investment programs, said Retirement and Investment Office Executive Director Jodi Smith, though the agency didn’t implement the pay structure until 2024.
It introduced the new compensation plan to encourage investment managers and other staff at the Retirement and Investment Office to bring in more money for the state. The Legislature gave the agency the authority to create the pay program in 2023.
The Retirement and Investment Office invests state money on behalf of the State Investment Board, some of which is managed by in-house investors. The top four funds are the Legacy Fund, the Public Employees Retirement System, the Teachers Fund for Retirement and Workforce Safety and Insurance. 
Smith said offering bonus pay helps make jobs at the agency attractive, and incentivizes employees to make as much money for North Dakota as possible.
“We’re not here to support a typical state agency,” she said.

For employees to get the bonuses this year, the State Investment Board’s top four funds had to exceed certain earnings benchmarks between July 1, 2024, and June 30, 2025.
The benchmarks are meant to represent standard market performance, Smith said, so that employees are only rewarded if the state’s investments do better than average. Employees can also get additional bonus pay based on individual performance. Smith noted that a third-party consultant was hired to set the performance benchmarks.
The funds outperformed the benchmarks by more than $191 million.
Compared to that sum, a roughly $1.3 million reward for employees is a “modest and reasonable payout,” Smith wrote in a Friday memo to the State Investment Board.
According to Smith, most other states dole out bigger bonuses.
The bonuses don’t come from taxpayer money, they’re funded by earnings on the agency’s investments.
Most of the 12 employees recommended for bonuses are eligible for awards of up to 50% or 75% of their salaries, according to the memo. Top officials can receive up to 90% or 100% of their annual pay.
If the awards are approved, the largest bonus — $293,280 — would go to the chief investment officer, representing 94% of their annual salary of $312,000. The second highest bonus would be $170,726 to the deputy chief investment officer, who has a salary of $197,600.
Smith is not among those up for a bonus this year, since she only became the permanent executive director of the Retirement and Investment Office in June, she said. She said she will be eligible for a bonus in the future.
The State Investment Board on Friday delayed voting on the approval of the bonuses to address some unresolved legal questions raised by board members, Smith said. A board member had asked a question about the state law that created the bonus pay program and legal staff did not have the time to answer it before the meeting, she said.

Gov. Kelly Armstrong, chair of the State Investment Board, said Friday he has some reservations about the bonuses. He said he thought the state intended for it to be more difficult for the funds to meet their investment benchmarks.
Still, Armstrong said he doesn’t want to “pull out the rug” from underneath employees who were promised bonus pay.
Office of Management and Budget Director Joe Morrissette also said he has concerns about the program. Morrissette voted against adopting the pay plan in 2024 when he was on the State Investment Board as a Public Employees Retirement System appointee.
He said that the Bank of North Dakota and North Dakota Mill also offer employees bonuses, but that they’re not as large as those proposed by the Retirement and Investment Office. Other agencies can offer performance bonuses of $1,500 annually, he added.
“Generally, bonuses are very limited in state government,” said Morrissette, who still serves on the board as Office of Management and Budget director.
Morrissette said that while he supports offering the bonuses to investment managers, the awards are also available to some employees in more administrative and operational roles. He said he’s not sure that’s fair when people in similar positions in other state agencies don’t get those kinds of bonuses.
The State Investment Board on Friday also voted to keep working with a consulting firm, Funston Advisory Services, on a plan to restructure the State Investment Board.
The firm in a presentation to the board highlighted that the Retirement and Investment Office is under-staffed compared to similar state agencies, among other findings.
Smith pointed to this as another reason why her staff deserves the bonuses. She said it’s noteworthy that the state’s funds made so much money given the agency’s staffing constraints.
“Despite all these things that are kind of stacked against the agency, they’ve still been able to succeed,” Smith said.

Derek Kitchen said Thursday he’s joining the race to represent a newly drawn Utah congressional district favoring Democrats.,"Former state Sen. Derek Kitchen is pictured at the Utah Capitol in this undated photo. (Utah Senate Democrats)Former state Sen. Derek Kitchen said Thursday he’s joining the race to represent a newly drawn congressional district that is Utah’s first to lean Democratic in more than 20 years. 
Kitchen’s announcement follows two other Democrats — state lawmaker Katheen Riebe and former congressman Ben McAdams — in announcing a bid for the U.S. House seat ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. 
“Now, Utah has a newly drawn district — a strong, solidly Democratic district — and for the first time in a generation, we have the chance to elect a progressive leader who reflects the values of the people who live here and who has what it takes to fight back against Donald Trump and the MAGA Republican agenda,” Kitchen said in his announcement.
Utah Democrats likely to win congressional seat in 2026 if judge’s map order stands

“I’ve always fought for the issues that matter, even when it’s tough,” Kitchen continued. “I’m ready to carry that fight all the way to Congress.”
He is known in Utah for being one of the plaintiffs who sued the state in 2013, successfully overturning Utah’s ban on same-sex marriage. Kitchen went on to serve on the Salt Lake City Council and won election to the state Senate in 2018, where he served one term before losing in the Democratic primary to now-Sen. Jen Plumb.  
As Democrats work to recapture a majority in the U.S. House, they see the new district in Utah as an opportunity to help accomplish that goal. 
“Every seat counts,” Ken Martin, chair of the Democratic National Committee, said in a statement earlier this month. 
Utah’s new map comes after a yearslong court battle that reached the Utah Supreme Court before landing back before a judge in Salt Lake City. A coalition of voting rights groups and voters sued after the state’s GOP-controlled Legislature in 2021 chose its own congressional map, instead of adopting new boundaries created by an independent, voter-approved commission. 
The state’s Republican legislative leaders have said they intend to appeal and keep fighting for their preferred maps.
While in the Utah Legislature, Kitchen noted he was in a minority of openly LGBTQ+ lawmakers nationwide and learned how to work with colleagues across the political aisle. 
In 2023, he was appointed by President Joe Biden’s administration as senior vice president at the federal Export-Import Bank, which aims to support U.S. jobs by encouraging the export of American goods and services. 
He’s also a restaurant owner who said running a small business taught him valuable lessons in serving people and building community.

Attorneys for the state and the AHSAA did not have comment after the hearing. Ivey and Ledbetter said in a joint statement Friday that they will continue to advocate for CHOOSE Act student-athletes.
“With today’s court decision, the temporary restraining order remains in place, allowing our CHOOSE Act student-athletes to continue competing,” the statement said. “We look forward to finding a permanent solution.”
A message seeking comment was left with the AHSAA Friday.
The CHOOSE Act is a voucher-like program that allows families to claim up to $7,000 per qualifying child for non-public education expenses, including private school tuition. The AHSAA considers the funds to be financial aid and requires CHOOSE Act recipients who transfer to another school to not participate in athletics for one year.
Ivey and Ledbetter allege that AHSAA’s eligibility requirements discriminate against student athletes who receive CHOOSE Act funds.
Gaines granted a temporary restraining order against AHSAA on Sept. 5. Ivey and Ledbetter added another plaintiff, Jaclyn Hall, parent of a CHOOSE Act recipient, in September.
AHSAA says the regulation is meant to ensure fairness. Attorneys representing the AHSAA  said in a filing last week Ivey and Ledbetter had no standing to file the lawsuit.

Most of the 137 people in quarantine Friday were students and staff at three public schools in the Upstate. The state health department did not say how many of the active measles cases came from each of the schools. When a student at a school tests positive, the schools send home every unvaccinated student to prevent spread, health officials previously said.
Lyman Elementary has 57 people in quarantine, Boiling Springs Middle School has 55, and D.R. Hill Middle School has one, according to the health department. The department did not specify how many unvaccinated people were students versus staff.
One person with an active case worked at Greenville Spartanburg International Airport and may have exposed travelers and fellow employees to the virus between 9 a.m. and 7 p.m. on Nov. 10 and 11. Another attended Way of Truth Church in Inman the evening of Nov. 7 and the morning of Nov. 9, according to the health department.
Anyone who visited the airport or church on those days should monitor themselves for measles symptoms and call a doctor if they get sick, according to the health department.
Symptoms of measles typically begin between a week and 12 days after exposure with a cough, runny nose and red eyes, along with a fever. Cases can then cause a red, blotchy rash that appears first on the face and spreads to the rest of the body.


Where to get vaccinated
From noon to 3 p.m. on Monday, Nov. 24, the mobile vaccination clinic will stop at Mt. Moriah Baptist Church in Spartanburg.


The best way to keep from getting and spreading measles is to get vaccinated, state epidemiologist Linda Bell has said.
Typically, children receive two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, which is about 97% effective in protecting from the virus. All but two of the people who contracted measles were unvaccinated. The two who had their vaccines only had one dose, which is less effective than the full two doses.
After Monday, the state health department will stop routinely operating the mobile vaccine clinics is has run since mid-October. But organizations can still request a mobile clinic date through the health department’s website.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/measles-vaccine-1024x719.jpg,,,2025-11-21 15:58:07.991553

(Photo by Clark Kauffman/Iowa Capital Dispatch)State, city and county inspectors have cited Iowa restaurants and stores for hundreds of food-safety violations during the past several weeks, including offenses related to moldy and expired food, insects and  dirty kitchens.
The findings are reported by the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing, which handles food-establishment inspections at the state level.
Listed below are some of the more serious findings that stem from inspections at Iowa restaurants, stores, care facilities and other businesses between Oct. 10, 2025, and Nov. 13, 2025. (Earlier this year, DIAL began withholding from public disclosure all food-safety inspection reports for eight days past the date of inspection.)
The inspections department reminds the public that its reports are a “snapshot” in time, and violations are often corrected on the spot before the inspector leaves the establishment.

El Senor Cactus, 1534 S. Gilbert St., Iowa City – During a Nov. 13 visit, a Johnson County inspector observed that the internal temperature of the restaurant’s grilled chicken reached only 152 degrees. The chicken was immediately removed from service and recooked to the required internal temperature of 165 before being served. In addition, house-made “Cancun sauce” had been held beyond the seven-day limit and had to be discarded.
The inspector also noted that several containers of prepared foods and sauces stored in a kitchen cooler did not have the required date-markings to ensure freshness and safety, and the vacuum-sealed frozen fish was being thawed while still sealed, creating a risk that any spoilage would go undetected.
Also, two containers of raw chicken were left out to thaw at room temperature on a food-prep table, a container of cooked beans was stored on the kitchen floor, and the inspector noted “excessive debris” that had built up in the microwave ovens and the interior of the kitchen’s two-door cooler.
La Mich Grocery, 1215-1221 Franklin St., Waterloo — During a Nov. 13 visit, a Black Hawk County inspector cited this establishment for 12 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number, and noted that the three-bay sink used to sanitize dishes did not have the required amount of sanitizing solution. Also, the establishment’s “food safety certification” had expired, and food items prepared several days earlier were holding at 45 to 48 degrees — too warm to ensure safety — and had to be discarded.
In addition, the salsa in the retail cooler was not date-marked to ensure freshness and safety, and a designated handwashing sink in the meat-deli area had meat debris in it, indicating it was being used for purposes other than handwashing. The inspector also noted, without elaborating, that the business “was not date-marking items correctly,” and that enchilada sauce and maize de pozole were being held past their maximum seven-day shelf life. Also, cooked food items were being cooled in large, sealed containers, a process that slowed the cooling process.
St. Ambrose University Cafeteria, 518 W. Locust St., Davenport — During a Nov. 12 visit, a Scott County inspector noted that access to handwashing sinks was blocked by a garbage can and a pail of detergent, and that food items — including homemade raspberry filling, fruit dip and lemon cream — were dated Oct. 24, a full 19 days prior to the inspection, indicating they had been held beyond the maximum of seven days.
Also, an open bag of lettuce was not date-marked to ensure freshness and safety; raw chicken was stored over ready-to-eat food items, risking cross-contamination; the food-prep coolers in the main kitchen and a cooler at the pizza station were marred by excess food debris, as were the pop dispensers and the salad station’s prep cooler.
The inspector also noted that there were no date-markings on food items inside the walk-in cooler or on opened bags of spinach in the “allergy food station,” or on the homemade salad dressing. In addition, the large stainless-steel mixer in the salad-prep area was marred by rust and peeling paint, and the floor underneath the kitchen equipment in the main kitchen was peeling and coming apart.
Jersey Grille, 5255 Jersey Ridge Road, Davenport — During a Nov. 10 visit, a Scott County inspector noted that kitchen employees were not following accepted handwashing practices, and that multiple unspecified food items were being held past their discard dates.
Also, the ice machine and fountain-drink machine each contained “debris and gunk,” there were no paper towels at four of the handwashing sinks in the kitchen and restrooms, the walk-in freezer’s compressor was leaking fluid onto “food and packaging” inside the cooler, food was being stored on the floor, and several food items were missing labels bearing the date of their opening or preparation.
In addition, soy sauce was being stored at room temperature rather than being refrigerated, apples were “discolored and rotting,” and heavy whipping cream that was dated Aug. 26, 2025 – 10 weeks prior to the inspection – was still being served. Also, vacuum-sealed frozen fish was being thawed while still inside its packaging, creating a risk that any spoilage would go undetected, and the floor below the fryers, the surface under the grills, the oven trays, the kitchen ceiling and the vent hoods were all marred by “debris, dust and gunk.”
La Leona, 2075 John F. Kennedy Road, Dubuque — On Nov. 7, a City of Dubuque inspector visited the establishment for a preopening inspection and cited the establishment for nine risk-factor violations. The inspector denied the business a license until a reinspection could take place at a later date.
Among the violations: The ice machine was marred by a layer of dust and debris and needed “a thorough cleaning before it is used,” there were no handwashing sinks in the ware-washing area or the women’s restroom, all of the handwashing sinks lacked soap, and all of the food-contact surfaces needed a more thorough cleaning, with all of the equipment noted as having a layer of dust. “Entire restaurant needs a more thorough cleaning,” the inspector observed.
Gordie’s Bar & Grill, 108 13th St., Centerville — During a Nov. 6 visit, an inspector for Appanoose, Davis, Lucas and Monroe counties found lettuce dated Oct. 17, 2025, and a can of Raid Ant & Roach Killer, unapproved for use in a commercial food establishment, in the kitchen. The inspector also reported finding sliced cheese and diced tomatoes that were not dated to ensure freshness and safety. “No thermometer to check food temperatures,” the inspector reported.
Izumi Sushi & Hibachi, 941 E. San Marnan Drive, Waterloo — During a Nov. 4 visit, a Black Hawk County inspector cited this establishment for 14 risk-factor violations, an exceptionally high number. Among the issues: sushi rice that was being prepared and then held was not marked with the time it was to be discarded; there was an unspecified “buildup” of some kind in the ice machine; raw meat was stored above ready-to-eat sushi ingredients, risking cross-contamination; and a food handler rinsed their hands while they were still gloved after being instructed to wash their hands.
In addition, a food handler breaded shrimp and other raw food products and then, without washing their hands, began handling ready-to-eat crab rangoon; fish to be used for sushi was not first removed from vacuum-sealed packaging before thawing, creating a risk that any spoilage would go undetected; a thermometer for checking food temperatures could not be located; gnats were found by the beer taps; the business was reusing soy-sauce buckets for food storage, and there was a buildup of ice inside the walk-in freezer.
Buchona’s Sports Bar & Grill, 229 16th Ave. SW, Cedar Rapids — During a Nov. 3 visit, a Linn County inspector cited this establishment for failing to sanitize dishes after washing and rinsing, and for failing to date-mark any of the food in the kitchen to ensure its freshness and safety.
The inspector also noted that while some food stored in the coolers and refrigerators was covered, many items were stored without lids or covers, exposing them to the risk of contamination. “Evidence of mold on shredded cheddar cheese,” the inspector observed.
Legends American Grill, 1425 W. 19th St., Newton — During a Nov. 3 visit, a state inspector made note of expired food items, including au jus with a discard date of Nov. 1, and sauteed onions and salsa that each had discard dates of Oct. 31. Also, equipment and utensils were not being sanitized as required, and the ice machine was unclean, with debris in the interior.
Baxter’s Grocery & Grill, 108 E. Main St., Fremont — During an Oct. 29 visit, a state inspector noted that all of the items in the coolers lacked date-markings to ensure freshness and safety. “Establishment does not appear to have a date-marking policy in place,” the inspector observed.
In addition, the interior of the ice machine was unclean, and food items in hot-holding — including marinara sauce measured at 120 degrees and beans measured at 127 degrees — were not hot enough to ensure safety and had to be placed on the stove and reheated to at least 165 degrees.
In addition, chicken was being thawed in a pot of standing water and the coolers lacked thermometers to help maintain safe food temperatures. “Floors, walls and ceiling in kitchen area not clean,” the inspector observed.
S & K Gas and Food, 18820 Bellevue Cascade Road, Zwingle — During an Oct. 29 visit, a state inspector cited this establishment for 10 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number for a convenience store that offers ready-to-eat sandwiches and limited food service. The inspector reported finding a bucket labeled “transmission oil” that was air drying in the kitchen along with various utensils and noted there were no date-markings on containers of commercially precooked hamburgers, sausages and egg patties.
Also, the handwashing sink was being used to store items and there were no records on file related to a certified food protection manager being on staff. The person in charge agreed that there would be at least one certified food protection manager on staff by April 29, 2026.
The business was last inspected in October 2020, according to state records.
The Corner Lounge, aka TNT Services, 207 E. Main St., Belmond — During an Oct. 27 visit, an inspector noted that cooked roast beef was being held at room temperature, with no heat source, and was measured at 97 degrees. The roast beef was then discarded.
Also, access to the kitchen handwashing sink was blocked, and the refrigeration unit of the kitchen’s make-table was not working, which meant that ham was being held at 58 degrees and sliced tomatoes at 63 degrees. In addition, the walk-in cooler was not working properly so cooked beef was holding at 46 degrees and cooked chicken at 45 degrees.
“Many foods were voluntarily discarded today,” the inspector noted. “Several prepared foods in the walk-in cooler were not date-marked.”
The inspector concluded the person in charge was not monitoring food and equipment temperatures, employee handwashing, food-cooling procedures, or ensuring that the food placed in storage was protected from contamination. “Dead insects” were observed throughout the kitchen and dishwashing areas, and containers of cooked food were “sitting directly on the floor in the walk-in cooler.” The stove, oven, kitchen walls and kitchen floor were not clean, the inspector added.
Jack Trice Stadium, Iowa State University, 1800 4th St., Ames — This inspection took place on Oct. 25, during the ISU vs. Brigham Young University football game. During the visit, a state inspector noted that the ice machine for the Sweet & Savory concession was visibly soiled, the sanitizing solution used by Campbell’s Corndogs had no detectable amount of sanitizing fluid in it, and Tom’s Coffee in the northeast section of the stadium was storing items in the designated handwashing sink.
Several concessionaires were holding hot food items below 135 degrees, including taco meat in the main kitchen that measured 79 degrees, pizza at Thirst Quenchers that measured 113 to 116 degrees, and pizza at Sweet & Savory that measured 110 to 120 degrees. The items were either discarded or reheated to at least 165 degrees.
Also, the Carlos Quesadillas outlet in the northeast section of the stadium had no hot water at the beginning of the inspection. Some concessionaires — including the median-floor skybox and Thirst Quenchers in the northwest section of the stadium — were not writing down the internal temperatures of food items or the time when the items were removed from temperature control so the staff would know when they  needed to be discarded. At the Victory Bell in the stadium’s northeast area, hot dogs were thawing out at room temperature.

This is Stories From The States. I’m Chris Fitzsimon. Here at States Newsroom, we know there’s a lot going on around the country every week, in every state. This week, we’re talking about mid-decade redistricting. Texas and California have grabbed most of the headlines in the battle. Now, GOP led states like Indiana are facing pressure from the president to redistrict. All while some states like Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio and Utah already have enacted new maps for the 2026 midterm elections. But Utah’s case is unique. That redistricting fight was spearheaded by Utah voters who ultimately won. Firstm that’s where we’re heading, and we’ll hear from one of the plaintiffs in the case.
Katharine Biele  
All you have to do is make a map that is fair to everyone. Everyone’s voice should matter.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Then we’ll check in with the Brennan Center for Justice to find out if all this mid-decade redistricting business is actually normal. Up first is a Utah News Dispatch reporter. We’ll hear from her in just a moment.
Chris Fitzsimon  
A Utah judge recently approved a redistricting map that would give Democratic candidates a good chance at winning one of the state’s US House seats in the 2026 midterm elections. This redistricting dispute started back in 2018 though, way before the Trump administration started pushing for mid-decade redistricting to rig the maps to try to keep control of the US House in 2026. Katie McKellar, a senior reporter from the Utah News Dispatch, has been closely covering this for years. She joins us now. Hi, Katie.
Katie McKellar  
Hi. Thanks for having me.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Thanks for being with us. All right, let’s jump in. Tell us about this. This case, it nowhere near started just this year. Give us a little bit of background on what’s at stake here.
Katie McKellar  
Oh yeah, there’s a long history here in Utah. So back in 2021, that year, the Republican majority Utah legislature repealed and replaced a ballot initiative that was narrowly approved by Utah voters in 2018. And that ballot initiative  driven by anti gerrymandering groups called Better Boundaries, sought to implement an independent redistricting process here in Utah, meant to guard against gerrymandering, and they argued that there were too many Democratic, independent and even more moderate Republican voters here that were being dispersed or cracked through the redistricting process. And so they put Proposition 4 on the ballot for voters to decide whether it should become law, and it passed. But Republican leaders here have long believed that they have the final say when it comes to ballot initiatives, and so they repealed and replaced Prop Four with a law known as SB 200 and essentially, what that law did was water down Prop Four and turn the independent redistricting commission that was supposed to draw the state’s maps into an advisory body that could ignore those maps.
Chris Fitzsimon  
So basically, the voters decided they wanted to do this with the independent commission. The Republican legislature said, ‘No, thanks’. We’re going to turn this into an advisory commission, even though the voters didn’t want that?
Katie McKellar  
Exactly, exactly. And so instead, they repealed and replaced that law with one that that turned into an advisory body that they could ignore. And so even though that independent commission drew a set of maps that year, lawmakers do their own and they adopted those maps and that congressional map and that set created four solidly Republican congressional districts, and that prompted pro democracy groups like the League of Women Voters of Utah, Mormon Women for Ethical Government and a handful of Salt Lake County voters who felt disenfranchised by that new congressional map to get together and sue. And they alleged that that 2021 map was a blatant gerrymander, and that lawmakers violated their rights to reform their government through a ballot initiative.
Chris Fitzsimon
So really, the lawsuit was about the ballot initiative as much as it was the districts. Sounds like.
Katie McKellar  
Absolutely it was about both. It was about gerrymandering and lawmakers overstepping on a ballot initiative. And so after that case spent several years winding through the courts. Ultimately, the Utah Supreme Court, on an appeal, sided with the plaintiffs on the claim that lawmakers violated their right to alter and reform their government, and that led a district court judge to deem the 2021 map the result of an unconstitutional process. So she didn’t rule, she didn’t weigh in on whether it was a gerrymander, but she did say it was an unlawful map because it was the result of repealing and replacing a ballot initiative. And so she she voided that 2021 map and ruled that Utah must go through a court ordered redistricting process to put in place a lawful congressional map to be used next year in the 2026 elections, and that’s how we got where we are today.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Thank you. It’s not a simple topic. I think you did a great job explaining it for us. And so tell us when the Trump administration got involved and people thought that they were going to have some role in this.
Katie McKellar  
So while mid, mid decade redistricting is is a debate happening all over the country right now, Utah’s mid-decade redistricting process right now is unique, because this was court ordered this was a judge saying Utah lawmakers overstepped, we need to fix it. And so it’s very unique compared to the other conversations happening in states like California and Texas.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Right. And so now tell us what happened. The map that was chosen does appear to give Democrats a chance at winning one of these districts. From what I’ve read, a lot of this revolves around Salt Lake County, which is the most populous county in the state.
Katie McKellar  
Yeah, so over the last several a couple of months, really, this court ordered process took a long time. The judge took several weeks to hear from both sides, the legislative attorneys and attorneys for the plaintiffs and each side. She gave an opportunity to submit some maps to consider. So the legislature voted on a map known as map C that lawmakers contended abided by Proposition Four’s criteria, and that would be fair. And you know, looking at that map compared to the 2021 map, it is true that it was a bit more competitive for Democrats, but it would still result in four pretty solidly red congressional districts, and then the plaintiff submitted two options. One map was a lease change map based off of the map that the lawmakers approved to just kind of tweak the boundary so it didn’t split as many cities. Or they also submitted another one that was drawn with an algorithm that was created based off of Proposition Four’s criteria, and that map is the one the judge ultimately picked. And in that map, there’s the first congressional district is concentrated around the northern part of Salt Lake County, which is a very populated part of Utah. And the result is three pretty, like, really safe Republican districts, and one pretty safe Democratic district.
Chris Fitzsimon
Somebody described to me that the old maps that they were under and some of the proposals that weren’t adopted look like a pizza cutter had done them that they divided up most of the population into into pizza slices so the Republicans could maintain control.
Katie McKellar  
Oh yeah, that has been a strategy for a long time. And you know, the plaintiffs in the lawsuit alleged was blatant gerrymandering Republicans here, they like to describe it as pizza slice, or mixing urban and rural voices, so that urban and rural voices in each district are represented on the federal level. Well, the plaintiffs allege, you know, that’s just cover to crack Salt Lake County into four different pieces so that there would not be a Democratic district.
Chris Fitzsimon  
And what was the reaction there, when the court chose the map that gives the Democrats a chance to claim one of the districts?
Katie McKellar  
Oh, the the plaintiffs in the case were thrilled. They thought that was a great win, because that map, to them, was based wholly off of Propositions Four’s criteria. Democrats were thrilled, Republicans were angry. There’s been a ton of backlash from Republicans. I mean, even before the judge picked that map, some Republican lawmakers began saying, if she didn’t pick their map that they submitted to the court map see that they would argue it would amount to malfeasance, because they still firmly believe, despite all the court rulings, that the Utah constitution ultimately gives them and only them, the ability to pick maps in the redistricting process. And so couple of things have been happening. Republicans and a group called Utahns for Representative Government are pursuing another ballot initiative to repeal Proposition Four to go on the ballot in 2026 for voters to consider. And in the meantime, I think we can still expect plenty of court appeals, legislative attorneys saying they’ll be willing to take it all the way to the US Supreme Court if necessary. But you know, barring some crazy upset, because we’ve already hit the deadline for a map to be used in 2026 even if they went on appeal. I don’t know if there’s even time to put a different map in place for 2026 but 2028 who knows? We’ll just have to see.
Chris Fitzsimon  
The judge has been attacked, right? And there’s even been like talks of impeaching the judge. It really has gone to a new level it seems like.
Katie McKellar
We’ll have to see if those threats are just threats, or if, if lawmakers actually try to carry that out. One lawmaker has said he’s open a bill file to do articles of impeachment, but I haven’t been able to get the senate president or the house speaker on record solidly saying yes, we’re going to try to impeach her, so we’ll have to see.
Chris Fitzsimon
Right. Well, we will check back with you. Katie, thanks for all your great reporting there, and thanks for being with us. Thanks. Chris. Katie McKellar is a senior reporter at the Utah News Dispatch. That outlet is a part of state’s newsroom. Since chatting with Katie, the Utah judiciary has issued a statement addressing threats to Judge Diana Gibson, who ruled on the maps. They addressed the heated political reaction as well as the threats of violence to Judge Gibson saying, “threats of violence against judges or court personnel are unacceptable, dangerous and may violate state of federal laws”. As Katie mentioned, the approved map drawn by the plaintiffs of Utah’s redistricting lawsuit was a collective effort of nonpartisan groups, faith based organizations, a legal center, and a handful of Salt Lake County voters who all said they just wanted fair maps. In a moment, we’ll meet one of the plaintiffs from that case. We’ll be right back.

Chris Fitzsimon  
After almost seven years of a legal battle against a GOP led state legislature in Utah, a broad coalition of plaintiffs finally had their congressional district map approved by federal judge. It wasn’t easy, and has involved a referendum that lawmakers ignored, legal machinations and now calls to impeach a judge. Joining us now with one of the people who was part of this redistricting fight, Katharine Biele is the President of the League of Women Voters of Utah. She joins us now. Hello, Katharine. Thanks for being here.
Katharine Biele  
Thank you so much Chris.
Chris Fitzsimon  
So Katharine, your group was one of the plaintiffs in this case, and now a judge has approved the maps you and other Utahns had sought, right.
Katharine Biele  
They did. I mean, we were thrilled.
Chris Fitzsimon
You were thrilled. I was gonna ask your reaction. Were you surprised?
Katharine Biele  
Not completely. We had very good arguments. I mean, our arguments were based in the Utah State Constitution, Article One, Section two, which gives the citizens the right to change the form of government. So we had a very good argument. We were never trying to leave the legislature out of it. We totally expect the legislature to draw the maps. All we require is that they draw them fairly.
Chris Fitzsimon
Just to be clear, the maps that had been drawn or that were drawn by the General Assembly, or the ones that they were were promoting, really, I always hear it as an outsider to Utah, hear it described as like pizza slices, which keeps sort of all the parts of Salt Lake City separated in effect.
Katharine Biele
And it’s not just Salt Lake City, but Salt Lake Salt Lake County. This is where the hub of the population lives. They divided the county into four slices going down to the very tip of Southern Utah, St George, so we in urban Salt Lake have the same representative as those down in southern Utah.
Chris Fitzsimon  
And what was the reaction from the legislature and the proponents, or the I guess the people who wanted to continue to draw the maps the way they had been drawn.
Katharine Biele  
The legislature is up in arms. They will not stop this should have been easy. I mean, how hard is it to draw a fair map? It’s not a partisan thing. It is. Just look, this is these are communities of interest. Salt Lake County is one community of interest. Southern Utah is another. The rural, rural areas are another. So it’s just really not that hard. They were furious because they thought we were taking away their responsibility, which we are not.
Chris Fitzsimon  
You know, Utah has a reputation, I think, from afar, and I think I’m sure it feels that way a lot of times in Utah you have Republican governors in the past have reached across the aisle. There’s been a lot of national publicity. They’ve been the leaders in sort of a different kind of campaigning. So I think there’s a perception that politics in Utah hasn’t gotten to the bitter level that we’ve seen around the country. And yet it feels like in this case, maybe that has changed some.
Katharine Biele  
I will say that it may be changing a little. This is all based around the national politics and the kind of national politics that are coming down to Utah. There are many people here, many legislators who think that whatever Trump says and whatever he does, they should do however. We also have enough. I mean, we respect the legislature, and the legislators do have good intentions. They just have to get away from the whole idea that only Republicans can be in charge of everything.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Do you have trouble as a citizen activist or a member of an organization, getting some voters to understand really what’s at stake. I think sometimes, even when I’m talking to folks about redistricting battles, and we’ve had a lot of them in states that I’ve been in, people sometimes their eyes glaze over and they want to talk about a lot of other issues. But this feels like a in some cases, a technical thing.
Katharine Biele  
Well, and this is it’s hard, it is very difficult, and I think the legislature has made it even. More difficult on purpose. They want the citizens to be confused and to say, ‘Okay, we’re going to leave it to the legislature, because we don’t get it.’ It’s not that hard. All you have to do is make a map that is fair to everyone. Everyone’s voice should matter. We don’t all win. We just need to have a voice. I have heard as a league of women voters. We register voters all the time. What they say to us is, why should we vote? We know what the outcome will be. This at least gives those voters a chance. Is it over? No, it probably will never be over. I mean, the legislature has talked about appealing. You know, if they appeal to the Supreme Court, that is really a delaying tactic, because our Supreme Court ruled unanimously in our favor. So it’s unlikely that they would do anything different. But I can’t say I’m not a lawyer. They have talked about running an initiative, which is ironic, a citizens initiative to overturn a citizens initiative. And that is exactly what you said. It’s because people are confused, and they think, Oh, well, we can confuse them more, and they will just vote our way to get rid of Proposition Four.

This week, a federal court blocked Texas from using their new congressional maps for the 2026 election. Texas was the first state pushed by the President to take part in this unusual mid-decade redistricting scheme. This move has led state lawmakers across the country to talk about redistricting when they only discuss it every 10 years. Is all this mid decade redistricting now going to be the new normal nationally? Coming up, an expert from the Brennan Center for Justice will help us figure that out. Then Evening Wrap newsletter author Danielle Gaines will join us about the story she’s looking out for. We’ll be right back.

Congressional district maps are generally redrawn every decade after the US Census, unless a court intervenes and orders state lawmakers to redraw them to settle a lawsuit. But the Trump administration has been pushing GOP led states to redistrict this year, purely for political reasons, to make it harder for Democrats to take over control of the House in the 2026 election. What are the long term effects of the break from precedent, and what happens if it becomes the new normal and maps are drawn every two years instead of every 10? We spoke with Kareem Crayton. He’s the vice president of the Brennan Center for Justice’s Washington DC office, and he has a doctorate in political science. Just a note. We spoke with Kareem before the news broke in Texas this week where a federal court blocked Texas from using their new congressional maps for the 26th election. Now they have to go back to their 2021 maps, which, by the way, are already gerrymandered by the Republican controlled General Assembly. He joins us now, Kareem, thanks for being here. Delight to be with you. Thank you. Well, what do you make of this overall? I think if we were sitting here a year ago, it’s hard to imagine the pressure being brought on so many states to dramatically change the way they draw district lines.
Kareem Crayton
Yeah, about a year ago, I think most of us thought that the only movement was going to be in the courts, with things that were already on the table. I think it is hard to have predicted such a massive number of states jumping into the pool and that most of the disruption and chaos is coming really at the instigation of the White House.
Chris Fitzsimon  
It puts a good government advocates like folks at the Brennan Center in a bit of a tough place at the beginning of all this national mid-decade redistricting discourse, after Governor Greg Abbott announced that he was doing that in Texas, there was a lot of discussion about, should states that have commissions or states that are committed to trying to drawing on gerrymandered districts also play what did you make of that sort of the machinations there?
Kareem Crayton  
Well, I would say the tough position that we’ve been in is actually one that preceded Governor Abbott’s move, and it is where the Supreme Court of the United States failed to adopt a national standard. In the absence of that, notwithstanding the fact that the Supreme Court said it had no particular opinion about political gerrymandering, number of states saw that as an invitation. And I think what we’re seeing is the result of that. So both. For what Texas has done, and California and other states have done, in reaction, is in some ways not surprising, if also quite lamentable.
Chris Fitzsimon  
To have a legislature, for example, Texas, who already gerrymandered the districts with their own majority come back and, in effect, re gerrymander them. Is this? What is this unprecedented? Had you seen anything like this before?
Kareem Crayton  
I think, writ large, it is unprecedented. It is fair to say that states have gone back to the well in the past, first time where we’ve seen, you know, the legislature in Texas at least go back and say, Oh, we didn’t gerrymander enough. And certainly, when you add to that, the National reaction where some states are going back to say, the public, we want to do a re gerrymandering of this state, is that okay, in light of all the other things that you’ve seen, and in California, the people said, Yes,
Chris Fitzsimon  
I covered redistricting in North Carolina for a long time. And what do you make of this? For the voters? I think it’s already sort of hard to explain to folks who don’t do this for a living, who are just living their lives trying to make ends meet, and now they can’t vote for the person they used to their districts are different. How do you communicate this effectively, the importance of this to folks who aren’t really involved in the political process.
Kareem Crayton  
The people that are supposed to be served by the redrawing of districts are the people who are supposed to be represented, and those are voters, and not the electeds. And what you see with these changes, in the absence of a national standard is that people who live right next to each other, who share the same city, who understand the same sets of issues that affect them all are now divided by essentially arbitrary lines, and they’re done really for no other purpose than to serve a political interest, and in fact, an interest that might not even be in the state that’s supposed to be represented. So I think all of these, you know, line drawing and re line drawing efforts are bringing people farther and farther away from power and democratic system. People aren’t supposed to be, particularly in elections, the source of power, and that’s of real concern.
Chris Fitzsimon  
We also had some news recently from the Indiana Capitol Chronicle, despite visits from the vice president and pressure from the president, many Republicans there are choosing not to participate in this mid cycle redistricting.
Kareem Crayton
Well, we’re seeing a lot of folks, I think, look at this and say, one, what does it cost us to try to do this? Yes, maybe the White House really wants us to do it, but what do we lose by going back to the will and redrawing the map? And frankly, it is probably not off of anybody’s mind. The fact that we had elections in November that I think, surprised a lot of people. And so if you’re doing these redraws, you’ve got to think about the world, not just as it exists right now, but what it’s going to look like a year from now and beyond. And in places where, if you’re a Republican you’re looking at, you know, what was pretty much a clean sweep behind the Democratic Party. And you got to wonder, is there a line at which and pardon the pun, but yes, if you cross that line in drawing new district maps, do you make yourself less likely in a democratic wave year to be competitive? Again? This is sort of done from the perspective of partisanship. But what is lost in all of this is the people ultimately are going to want to choose. And I think the real challenge that a lot of people are grappling with is, well, look, we might want a certain political outcome, but if the public overwhelmingly sees us as grabbing more power than we’re due, it might be that there’s a wave so big that we can’t gerrymander our way out of it.
Chris Fitzsimon
You mentioned a national standard. Is there some, some world, ideal world, where all this publicity and frustration leads us back to a conversation about how everybody should do redistricting in some fair and open and honest way?
Kareem Crayton
Well, I certainly hope so. The Congress of the United States still has the ability to say to the public, you know what? We hear you. And there should be a national standard, and we’re going to carve one. To carve one out that might not be true, that may or may not be true of this existing Congress, but the public is frustrated enough. It’s entirely possible that, you know, the public votes for people who will step into the breach. And by the way, it’s important to note you now hear both Republicans and Democrats, often, many of them on the losing end of a redistricting fight. Say, though there should be a national standard. So I think the more that becomes, as you point out, a priority for the public as a whole, but also for the elected to recognize. You know, in the main, this may or may not be a matter of whether or not I gain from a particular line drop, or whether the country gains overall from a system that makes sure that people at the forefront of how districts get drawn

Coming up. We’ll check with evening rap newsletter writer Danielle Gaines, stay with us.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Joining us now is Danielle Gaines. She writes States Newsrooms, daily newsletter called The Evening Wrap Danielle, it’s great to see you. Let’s let’s jump in. Talk about the big things this week and what’s coming up. First of all. What big stories Did you notice this week?
Danielle Gaines
Well, we’ve had some coverage about the changes that are coming to programs in the United States who have typically assisted refugees when they arrive here, and so our reporter in Rhode Island spent some time at the refugee Dream Center there, and she was talking with women in a class that’s meant to improve their English skills, but it’s also about so much more for them. So it’s like cultural, emotional, social. It was a really beautiful story just getting to know the women, but it also kind of touched on the fact that this was a place that is meant to be filled with love help these people feel at home, and instead, a lot of the emotion there has been replaced with fear, which is all too familiar to this group of people and uncertainty the folks who go there are among hundreds of 1000s of lawful immigrants who will soon lose food benefits in the US, as provisions of the one big, beautiful Bill act take effect. And in addition to food benefits, there are other things coming up that are big changes for programs that we established to help people get on their feet so the work requirements and Medicaid are going to be a problem. These are folks who aren’t working because they’re trying to gain proficiency in English so they can work, and they’ll lose support during that process. The story also had an economic analysis of refugees and immigrants in Rhode Island that I found really interesting. So 15% of the state are immigrants, and $5.5 million in annual food benefits will be gone under these provisions, and soon child tax credits will be gone as well, to the tune of $30 million so it’s a big shift on a family level, but also, you know, on a state economic level,
Chris Fitzsimon  
Yeah, I think that bill still feels like it’s hanging over so many people. When the when those provisions take effect?
Danielle Gaines  
Yeah, one of the coordinators there said that’s going to be, quote, disastrous, once it all kind of takes shape together.
Chris Fitzsimon
What about coming up next? What about things to look for?
Danielle Gaines  
Yeah, so this week, I’ve been featuring a special mini series from our reproductive rights reporting team on the state of state shield protections for abortion medications. And so there’s a lot that has been going on with that, and a lot that is going to be going on with that. So over the series of stories, our team looked at the status of state shield laws as well as efforts to puncture them, as well as challenges to mifepristone in lawsuits and the federal regulatory level. So there is an ongoing lawsuit related to the federal regulations The ACLU is seeking information, kind of just looking at what is the Trump administration’s FDA actually looking at with these long established medications, and who are they talking to as they’re looking at it. So that’s a lawsuit to be on the lookout for. And then on the state side of things, shield laws that protect abortion providers have been established in lots of states to protect them from out of state lawsuits, but a new bill is taking effect in Texas, and that aims to kind of puncture the durability of those laws. It’s was described as the first bill in the country to explicitly target shield laws and shield providers, and it gives any Texan the power to sue anyone involved in mailing an abortion pill to the state. So we’ll have to see what unfolds there.
Chris Fitzsimon  
It seems like then, I mean, it’s been ongoing, but the next frontier of the whole abortion debate seems like the battle over these, this medication and access to it. Yes, agreed. Well, what about one last thing? What shall we leave us together with?
Danielle Gaines
Well, just a time for Thanksgiving. I figured that we’d talk about food waste, not to be a downer, timely, but our friends at the Iowa capital dispatch covered a study by the State Department of Natural Resources, and that study found that Iowans throw away, on average, 200 pounds of food each year. When you account for industrial food waste. On top of that, it’s about 300 pounds. Wow. And that’s actually less than what the EPA estimates for the country as a whole, which is between 492 pounds and more than 1000 pounds. So this study was just a way to look at how to cut down on food waste, how food waste can be diverted, how to avoid it in the first place. So I thought I’d share some of the tips that I gleaned from it. You know, the first one is to purchase your food thoughtfully, and then, in terms of disposal, you can seek ways to donate something that you don’t want, share it with a neighbor, a friend, compost it instead of sending it to the landfill. My personal favorite is to just immediately freeze. So if you have a veggie tray at Thanksgiving, like, don’t just shove it the back of your fridge to let it waste away. Cut it up right away, put it in a baggie, and then some night, you’ll want soup, and it’ll be right there, ready cut up for you.
Chris Fitzsimon  
That’s a great idea. It does seem at every party, the veggie tray is the last to go.
Danielle Gaines  
I know it’s such a shame. I also think you could waffle iron just about anything. From Thanksgiving, which is a great way to use up leftovers.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Wow, I haven’t thought of that one. I might try that. Do I really appreciate you as always you being with us.
Danielle Gaines  
Yes, thank you so much.

Credit: Related DigitalA handful of environmental advocacy groups on Thursday submitted a petition to intervene as energy regulators review contracts for one of the state’s largest energy companies to supply energy for an incoming data center in Saline Township. 
The Sierra Club, Michigan Environmental Council, Natural Resources Defense Council and Citizens Utility Board of Michigan are calling on the Michigan Public Service Commission to initiate a contested case proceeding in reviewing DTE Energy’s contracts, arguing that this type of proceeding is needed for the groups to properly evaluate the company’s proposal and advocate for Michiganders who will be impacted by the project.
At the end of October, DTE filed an ex parte request with the commission, which oversees Michigan’s energy companies. This type of request does not require public hearings, nor does it allow interested parties to conduct discovery and file testimony for the commission to review before making its decision on the contracts. 
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel filed her own request asking the commission to treat the matter as a contested case to ensure customers aren’t left to foot the bill on energy costs tied to the project.
While the public service commission has since announced plans to hold an online session for public comments, Nessel argued that taking comments without hosting formal hearings on the matter or declaring a contested case, amounted to “performative listening rather than thorough public scrutiny.”
Michigan regulators to host public hearing on DTE contracts for Saline Township data center

As of Tuesday, Nessel’s office said the commission had not responded to her request. Matt Helms, a public information officer for the public service commission, declined to comment Friday when asked if the regulatory body had responded to either Nessel’s request, or the environmental organizations’.
In a statement to the Michigan Advance, Ryan Lowry, a DTE spokesperson, said the contracts under review by the public service commission ensure that its customers rates will not increase as a result of the data center project, which is being developed by Chat GPT creator Open AI, Oracle and Related Digital. 
“DTE, like the Attorney General and the [public service commission], is focused on customer affordability, which is why we have taken additional steps in our contracts with Oracle to ensure the data center will absorb all costs associated with the storage assets that are being developed as part of this project,” Lowry said.
However, both Nessel and the environmental intervenors argue the company hasn’t provided enough evidence in its request to prove that residents will not be impacted by the deal. 
“Transparency is not optional. Under Michigan law, the [commission] cannot approve utility requests that will result in increased costs for ratepayers without giving other interested parties an opportunity to fully participate in the proceeding,” Elena Saxonhouse, a managing attorney with the Sierra Club’s Environmental Law Program, said in a statement. “With so many data center proposals on the way, and so many questions about how each project will impact already high utility bills for Michiganders, the [commission] cannot allow utilities to rush through contract approvals without scrutiny.”
In their filing with the public service commission, the environmental groups pointed to the body’s decision in March to deny Consumers Energy, another major energy provider, ex parte approval in seeking to revise its terms of service for large energy customers like data centers, with the commission noting “The electric load of new data centers presents unique and significant cost implications, and the development of an evidentiary record to consider the… application is prudent and reasonable.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Related-Digital-Rendering-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-21 15:58:07.991553

Chris Murphy said he’s ‘never seen anything like’ Trump's posts. Sen. Richard Blumenthal said the president was 'normalizing violence',"U.S. Sens. Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal slammed President Donald Trump for calling a video published by Democratic lawmakers “seditious behavior, punishable by death.”
“I’ve never seen anything like what the president said yesterday,” Murphy said during a press conference in Hartford on Friday morning. “The president made a threat of execution against his political opponents.”
On Thursday, a video posted to X featured six Democratic lawmakers — all veterans of the military and intelligence services — addressing U.S. service members and encouraging them to protect the Constitution, even if that means defying orders.
“Americans trust their military, but that trust is at risk. This administration is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens,” the lawmakers said in a video montage. “No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution. We know this is hard and that it’s a difficult time to be a public servant.” 
The legislators featured in the video were Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado, Reps. Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania and Rep. Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire. 
While the video did not point to any specific “illegal” order, it came in the wake of Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops to U.S. cities, and in the midst of U.S. military airstrikes on vessels allegedly carrying drugs in the Caribbean and Pacific, which the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said violated international law. 
Trump on Thursday responded with a slew of posts on his social media platform, Truth Social. “Insurrection. TREASON!” read one post. “This is really bad, and Dangerous to our Country. Their words cannot be allowed to stand. SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS!!! LOCK THEM UP???” read another. 
The president also reposted a comment by another user that read, “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD !!”
During an appearance on Fox News on Friday, Trump walked back those comments, saying he wasn’t calling for the lawmakers’ execution. “I’m not threatening death, but I think they’re in serious trouble,” Trump said. 
Connecticut Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, said he didn’t agree with the president’s comments, but he believed people on both sides of the aisle have contributed to the growing political violence in the country.
“I would not say those comments. No one should be calling for anyone’s death,” Harding said. “We need to tamp down the rhetoric on both sides. Period.”
Blumenthal said Trump’s irresponsible comments stood in direct contrast to the sentiments he expressed after the murder of Charlie Kirk, when there were bipartisan calls to bring down the heat on political rhetoric. The senator also said he was worried Trump’s comments risked inciting violence among his most loyal supporters.
“It isn’t just that he is threatening public officials with death and violence. He is inflaming and encouraging his extremist followers,” Blumenthal said. “He is normalizing violence in this country. That is reprehensible for any public official, but particularly for the leader of the United States.”
On Thursday, Murphy posted a strongly-worded video to X calling on the wealthy and powerful who have “been sitting on the sidelines” to take a stand. “If you’re a person of influence in this country, maybe it’s time to pick a [expletive] side,” Murphy said.
On Friday morning, he reiterated that stance. 
“This is a moment to put your country and your democracy before your financial wellbeing,” Murphy said. “I don’t want to be in a world where death threats from the president of the United States become normalized and become background noise.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TRUMP-SEDITION-1121-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-21 15:58:07.991553

Ned Lamont tapped Josh Hershman, a former deputy commissioner at the Connecticut Insurance Department, to succeed Andrew Mais.","Andrew Mais, who has led Connecticut’s Insurance Department for nearly seven years, announced Friday he is retiring from the position next week.
Gov. Ned Lamont tapped Josh Hershman, CEO of Immigrant Life Insurance Company of America and a former deputy commissioner at the insurance department, to succeed Mais.
“I’ve been at the department for almost seven years through some interesting times — the externalities we’ve had to face — everything from COVID to the federal government issues this year,” Mais, 66, said in an interview. “It’s been a demanding position.”
He declined to share his next move, other than to say he looks forward to spending time with his family.
Mais has overseen the department during several turbulent years, as insurers have persistently requested large increases on long-term care insurance plans and on health care coverage.
Department leaders faced criticism from residents over their approval of many sizable rate hikes for long-term care insurance.
A Connecticut Mirror investigation found the annual cost of maintaining those policies has leaped for many due to miscalculations by insurers on how long people would live, the price of care and how many would need it. Consumers face large rate increases, often exceeding 50% and, for a few dozen people, as high as 174%, according to a CT Mirror analysis.
A review of rate hikes from January 2019 to October 2024 shows that more than 17,000 people with long-term care policies have gotten hit with increases of 50% or more. Some of the biggest companies in the market, including Genworth Financial, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and Transamerica Life Insurance Company, requested hikes for five years in a row beginning in 2019.
Lawmakers introduced more than a dozen pieces of legislation this year aimed capping increases, increasing transparency around rate hikes and other consumer protection measures. Some called for audit of the insurance department’s rate review process. The insurance sector opposed many of the bills.
Last week, NBC Nightly News published a report on long-term care insurance rate hikes in Connecticut that followed CT Mirror’s coverage.
“It’s all about consumer protection in what is often a difficult environment. We’ve had a team here … that has been steadfast in their commitment to that, so I feel good knowing we have done everything we can,” Mais said Friday.
“I believe there comes a time when somebody new should take over, somebody new should take the helm. I think I’ve done as much as I could for at this department. I spent the last almost seven years working with everyone to try to protect consumers. It’s simply time to pass the torch.”
Insurers in recent years have also requested steeper rate increases on health care plans, including seeking a 23% average hike on individual policies this year and 20.4% in 2022. The department approved average increases of 16.8% this year and 12.9% in 2022.
While running the insurance department, Mais focused on “ensuring that Connecticut consumers have the resources they need to adequately protect themselves and their properties and mitigate their risk,” officials with Lamont’s office said in a statement. That included the establishment of the Connecticut Severe Weather Mitigation and Resiliency Advisory Council in 2024, which aims to help homeowners and businesses maintain more resilient properties.
He worked previously for Deloitte’s Center for Financial Services and as a director at the New York State Insurance Department. Mais also led conversations on race, diversity and inclusion at the state level and within the insurance industry.
Mais’ last day is Nov. 28. Hershman will begin work on an interim basis Dec. 12. Lamont said he will formally submit his nomination to the legislature at the start of the 2026 regular session in February.
From 2019 to 2022, Hershman was deputy commissioner and chief operating officer of Connecticut’s insurance department, where he led projects that explored AI’s impact on insurance and championed data-driven regulatory modernization. Before that, he practiced law with a focus on complex business planning and litigation, officials said. He lives in Guilford.
“Focusing on consumer protection is the top priority of the insurance commissioner; consumer protection from the top down to the bottom will be my No. 1 priority,” he said in an interview.
“Having innovation in [insurance], trying to bring more opportunity for consumers, will help mitigate some of the cost issues that exist. Affordability is a huge issue in the state of Connecticut when it comes to health insurance, homeowners’ insurance — every insurance is expensive — and I’m going to do my very best to try to alleviate the affordability issue in Connecticut.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024_1021_SR_CommissionerMais_032-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-21 15:58:07.991553

Mike Rogers’ bid for the upper chamber of Congress has formally entered the race.
Former Michigan Republican Party Co-Chair Bernadette Smith launched her campaign to seek the GOP nomination for the U.S. Senate on Thursday, and with a campaign ad detailing her background and values.
Michigan Advance was the first to report that Smith had resigned this month from her state party post with ambitions to launch a Senate bid. It was an open question on whether she planned to run against Rogers, who is positioned as the party’s frontrunner in the race, or if she was eyeing an independent bid to forge an easier path to the November 2026 general election ballot.
A message seeking comment from Rogers’ campaign was not returned at the time of publication.
Smith made those rumors a reality when she formed a campaign committee with the Federal Election Commission.
In an email to donors, delegates and the party’s voters, Smith officially launched her campaign.
“America is at a critical point. Families are carrying heavy burdens. Freedoms are being challenged. Far too many elected leaders have forgotten who they serve,” Smith said in the email. “I am stepping forward because it is time to return to the principles that shaped this nation. Faith. Family. Freedom. These principles will direct every effort I make as we work to protect our liberties, strengthen our communities, and rebuild trust in public service.”
The Michigan Democratic Party responded to Smith’s campaign in a statement.

'We get to close our case successfully and on a happy note,' a DCF case worker said.","Cherie Yopp turned to her 11-year-old niece, Sherray Fortes, in a New Haven courtroom Friday, ready to finalize her adoption. After four years and 32 court dates, Sherray was finally legally hers.
“This is definitely a special day for our family,” Yopp, a special education teacher and case manager in Bridgeport, told relatives and state Department of Children and Families personnel gathered in the courthouse. “I know she has a bright future and I’m just here to guide her along the path.”
Sherray was placed with Yopp on an emergency basis four years ago amid worries about her parents’ mental health and substance use, according to DCF spokesman Peter Yazbak. Eventually, Sherray’s relatives and DCF decided it would be in her best interest to remain under her aunt’s care, and licensed Yopp for relative foster care.
Sherray has since made the honor roll with high honors and developed her love for art, music and the step team.
Addressing Yopp in the courtroom Friday, Sherray said, “Cherie, you’ve had me for such a long time and you love me even though I’m bad sometimes. … But you still love me within.”
Sherray was one of over 40 children who were adopted across Connecticut on Friday to mark CT Adoption Day. DCF has completed nearly 220 adoptions in the state in 2025 so far, according to Yazbak.
Sherray’s adoption by a member of her family is the type of placement Connecticut aims to achieve. DCF prioritizes reunifying children with their biological parents. But when that isn’t possible, it emphasizes kinship adoptions, where children are placed with another member of their family.
Over the last six years in Connecticut, around half of children placed in care outside their homes have been put with some member of their family, according to Yazbak.
John Rogers, program supervisor at the DCF office in New Haven, said the department has observed that kinship placements tend to have better outcomes. He said children are usually most comfortable with family members, especially immediately after they’re removed from their biological parents’ care.
“I’m not raising her by myself,” Yopp said of Sherray. “My kids are helping raise her. My sister’s helping. My dad who’s 90 has words of wisdom who’s helping raise her.”
Sherray’s adoption was four years in the making. The process for legal adoption is lengthy, and is especially prolonged if a biological parent protests the adoption. That’s what happened in this case.
“When it’s a family adoption, there’s a whole lot of family dynamics. Our family is very, very, very close-knit,” said Marie Barnes, Yopp’s sister.
The court is bound to consider protests by biological parents, and always prefers reunification if it would be safe for the child.
“Every bio parent has a due process,” Rogers said. “We respect that effort. Our goal is in every case to get a child home safely to their bio parent.”

Melissa Hodges, the social worker for this case, said that Yopp stepping up to care for Sherray has done “amazing things” for the child.
After a child is legally adopted, DCF has no further mandated involvement with the family.

Patrick Morrisey) The Trump administration has approved about $545 million in funding for West Virginia’s plan to expand broadband access across the state. 
The National Telecommunications and Information Administration approved West Virginia’s proposal to the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment Program, Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced Friday. 
“This technological upgrade will connect every corner of West Virginia and facilitate the jobs and opportunities needed to move forward,” Morrisey said in a news release. “We’ve worked closely with the Trump administration to secure this historic investment and are proud to provide these possibilities to the people of West Virginia.” 
BEAD is a $42.45 billion federal grant program funded through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed by congress in 2021 that aims to connect every American to high-speed internet by funding partnerships to build infrastructure.
West Virginia was approved for $1.2 billion in BEAD funding last year under former President Joe Biden. 
The Trump administration in June announced plans to revamp the program, remove “burdensome regulatory requirements” and institute changes aimed at lowering costs. West Virginia revised its application down from connecting 110,000 locations to nearly 74,000 locations across the state. 
NTIA administrator Arielle Roth said in a news release Friday that “Benefit of the Bargain” reforms brought the plan’s cost down from $959 million to $545 million, a savings of 43%. 
“Congratulations to West Virginia on the approval of its BEAD Final Proposal — an important milestone in the state’s path toward universal connectivity,” Roth said.
The state’s approved plan includes nearly $546 million for 142 deployment projects that will connect 73,044 unserved and underserved locations throughout West Virginia. The federal agency is reviewing other allowable uses for additional funds and will issue updated guidance in the future, Morrisey said in a news release.
The build out phase of the project will take four years, through 2029, to complete, Morrisey said. 
Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va. praised the announcement in a news release Friday morning, saying that it brings West Virginia closer to deploying the largest amount of broadband funding for the state to date. 
“I am thrilled that West Virginia’s BEAD plan has been approved by the Department of Commerce,” Capito said in the release. “This means West Virginia is another step closer to better-connecting our homes, businesses, and classrooms across the state. I have had dozens of conversations with the Administration and our state officials, and while there is still a long road ahead to getting more West Virginians connected, we are well on our way with today’s announcement. I look forward to continuing to help our state in any way that I can as the plan moves its way through the approval process at NIST.”
In a news release Friday, Sen. Jim Justice, R-W.Va., who submitted the state’s initial proposal for the funding in November 2023 when he was governor, said he made sure the state was in the best position possible to receive the funding so it could keep modernizing its broadband infrastructure. 
“This funding is an absolute gamechanger and will cover thousands of locations throughout the state, fostering new opportunities, jobs, education, and investment,” Justice said. “This doesn’t get done without the Trump Administration, the NTIA approving West Virginia’s final proposal, great partners like Sen. Capito, and the countless state and federal stakeholders who made this possible. This historic investment in broadband technology and infrastructure will have a tremendous impact on West Virginia.”",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/unnamed-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-21 15:58:07.991553

Buffalo is among the older industrial cities where residential properties have drawn interest from corporate investors. (Photo by John Normile/Getty Images)As corporate ownership of residential property across the country rises nationwide, researchers from the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy and the Center for Geospatial Solutions, which is housed at the institute, warn this rising trend has complicated the housing market for first-time buyers.
According to a joint “Who Owns America” report, nearly 9% of residential parcels in 500 U.S. counties are owned by a corporation. The concentrations exceed 20% in some cities, including St. Louis, Missouri; Harrisonburg, Virginia; and Franklin, Ohio. 
Researchers told Stateline they define “corporate ownership” as any rental property held under a formal business entity, whether a single-property LLC or large institutional investors such as Blackstone. They also track three factors: whether the owner is a business entity, whether it is based in- or out-of-state, and the size of its housing portfolio.
Roughly 2% of residential lots are owned by out-of-state investors. Investors have shifted their capital to older industrial metros such as St. Louis, along with Buffalo, New York, and Akron and Toledo in Ohio, where rents are rising and vacancy rates are extremely tight.
Can states, and a little bit of faith, convert church land into affordable housing?

Although corporate owners currently hold a modest share of all residential parcels nationwide, their footprint is expanding steadily, said Reina Chano Murray, associate director at the Center for Geospatial Solutions.
“Corporate ownership may look small on paper, around nearly 9% across the counties we studied, but that share is steadily increasing,” said Chano Murray. “Even if corporate owners don’t make up a huge percentage right now, the trend line is clear. They’re growing.”
This past year, states took a major step in attempting to use legislation to rein in corporate ownership of rental homes. According to an August report by the conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute, lawmakers in 22 states have introduced such legislation in 2025, including in California, New York and Texas. Cities in Indiana have capped the percentage of single family homes that can be rented in a neighborhood. 
AEI, however, believes the issue of corporate land ownership is a “narrative [that] is not supported by empirical evidence,” highlighting that less than 1% of institutional investorship is in residential property, according to its report. 
Earlier this year, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, proposed a 75-day moratorium on institutional or corporate investors buying single- and two-family homes to disincentivize those groups from buying up housing stock at the cost of individual buyers.
Washington state lawmakers have floated caps on how many units a single investor may own. In 2024, Colorado enacted a law that gave cities a right of first refusal on some multifamily property sales. Locally, some redevelopment authorities in Cincinnati and Minneapolis are using their own capital to compete, by directly acquiring and preserving single-family homes for low- and moderate-income buyers.
The impact of corporate residential ownership, researchers at the Lincoln Institute say, is most severe for first-time buyers, who are increasingly outbid by cash offers from well-endowed investors. 
“For first-time homebuyers, it’s a double whammy. Units are being removed from the marketplace, and investor competition is driving up prices,” said George McCarthy, president and CEO of the Lincoln Institute. “Cash-only transactions make up nearly a third of single-family sales this year, and those aren’t families with briefcases full of cash.”

(Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Municipal elections cost Indiana significantly more per vote than midterm and presidential contests, according to a state study released Thursday.
The analysis, conducted by the Voting System Technical Oversight Program at Ball State University, also found traditional precinct systems carry higher per-vote costs than newer vote centers setups.
“Transparency is one of our top priorities,” Secretary of State Diego Morales said in a Thursday news release. “By making this report available, it’s evident how hard our team is working to strengthen elections and serve every Hoosier with integrity.”
Hoosier voter turnout down, but better than before

House Enrolled Act 1633, approved in April, directed Morales to consider whether changing up municipal elections timing or mandating vote centers statewide would save money. Turnout was another factor.
During debate, lawmakers from both parties revealed distrust of his spending decisions and his penchant for self-promotion.
The law required Morales’ office to conduct at least three public hearings, but he held five. The results were submitted to the General Assembly’s Legislative Council ahead a Nov. 1 deadline, according to the news release.
No policy recommendations were made, however.
Municipal elections under the microscope
In an analysis of elections held from 2018 to 2024, municipal elections were about as expensive to administer as midterm elections, but brought in fewer voters — resulting in higher costs per vote.
In the 2022 midterm general elections, for instance, the cost per vote was about $5.26, while the 2024 presidential general contest was $5.47.
But it was $15.62 for the 2023 municipal general election.
Aligning municipal elections with larger cycles could “modestly” increase participation in the midterms and presidential elections, according to the study, which noted several thousand voters who cast ballots in local races abstained from the even-year contests.
The move “would lead to significant increases” in the number of Hoosiers participating in municipal contests, however.


The boost in turnout would “more than mak(e) up for” those lost through “ballot fatigue.” That’s when voters lose interest in lengthy lists of choices or become overwhelmed by the options.
VSTOP recorded 74 comments related to municipal election timing, with 60 in opposition and 14 in favor. Hoosiers against changes feared national issues would drown out local ones, while supporters cited cost savings and turnout gains. Local election administrators said it should be a choice.
Vote center push evaluated
In precinct-based systems, voters must cast their ballots at one assigned precinct location. The vote center model has fewer polling locations but a voter can cast their ballot at any location within their counties of residence on Election Day.
VSTOP found that vote center counties have spent less, on average, per voter than precinct counties during midterm and presidential elections since 2014. Precinct counties spent less in the first year studied, 2012.
The pandemic-era 2020 election was excluded from the analysis of vote centers and precincts because its administration was “abnormal.”


Staffing is likely the primary driver of savings, per the study. Fewer locations generally means lower staffing requirements.
On average, vote center counties spent $15,912 on poll worker pay — compared to $28,325 average for precinct counties.
Those that transitioned to vote center systems between the 2018 and 2022 midterm elections used 22% fewer poll workers, according to the study. And those that made the change between the 2016 and 2024 presidential elections used 19% fewer poll workers.
VSTOP cautioned, however, that data limitations “make it challenging to draw firm conclusions about differences in staffing needs between the two models.”
The study made no findings on equipment-related savings, citing a lack of reliable data and the complexity of both use and contracting.
Discussions with county election officials, however, indicated that most deploy comparable amounts of equipment regardless of voting model.
Transitioning could even cost more, because of the technology purchases or upgrades that could be involved.
There was little evidence that vote centers impact turnout, according to the report, or voter experience.
VSTOP logged 88 comments related to the potential vote center requirement, with 61 Hoosiers opposed and 27 in support. Most didn’t object to the concept of vote centers, but didn’t want the model to be mandated for all counties. Local election administrators also said it should be a choice.
Lake County got a shout-out for its “unanimous” opposition. Commenters argued the aging population would lack the transportation needed to get to the more sparsely located vote centers.

New estimates released Thursday put the total tab for the Oct. 5 rampage at $623,000 to $914,000 excluding taxes. The biggest cost driver is damage to a historic chenille rug nearly a century old in the state reception room, according to the Department of Enterprise Services.
It could cost $100,000 just to move the rug and affected drapes to another location for the repairs, the agency said. It will require storing them in a climate-controlled space at an estimated $750 per month, which doesn’t count toward the total estimate. 
Repairing the unique rug, which suffered smoke and fire damage, will cost from $443,000 to $719,000 while estimates for restoring historic mohair drapes that were burned are between $19,350 and $34,200.

The state reception room will be open for the 2026 legislative session beginning in January, according to the agency. It is used for public tours, class visits, press conferences and bill signings by governors. 
In the Oct. 5 break-in, Gunnar Schubert allegedly parked his car on the sidewalk of the campus flag circle, broke into the Capitol through a window, set fire to county, state and U.S. flags, tipped over busts of George Washington and Martin Luther King Jr., burned a piano and tried to light the carpet on fire, among other damage. The episode lasted about 10 minutes.
Schubert, 29, faces two criminal charges, second-degree burglary, a felony, and third-degree malicious mischief, a gross misdemeanor. He has yet to be arraigned as he awaits an evaluation to see if he is mentally fit to stand trial. A hearing on his competency is set for January.
Schubert played baseball at Gonzaga University and is a former minor league player. 
The incident has stoked concerns of politically motivated violence locally, after the killings this year of Minnesota state House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as Republican commentator Charlie Kirk. 
The state has already spent about $34,000 to replace damaged flags and broken glass, not to mention staff time and materials. Another $30,000 in repairs for the busts, marble and teak flooring and piano is in progress.

“Clients can expect their total benefit balance to be available as soon as today,” the agency said in a press release. 
The slowdown was the result of a software system issue. December benefits are expected to be issued on time. 
The nation’s largest food assistance program was paused beginning in November after the federal government said it would not use emergency funds to pay for the program, even though benefits have continued to flow to states in past shutdowns. 
Confusion ensued after more than a dozen states sued the Trump administration for its refusal to issue benefits. Mississippi said it would begin issuing partial benefits Nov. 10 in accordance with guidance from the United States Department of Agriculture, the federal agency that administers the program.
The state Department of Human Services announced that food assistance benefits were set to resume as normal on Nov. 13 after the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history came to an end. 
About 1 in 8 Mississippians — over 350,000 people — receive food assistance through SNAP. More than 67% of participants are in households with children, and about 41% are in households with older adults or adults with a disability. In four Mississippi counties, over a third of residents rely on the program to purchase food, according to a report from WLBT.
The state Department of Human Services awarded a contract to Deloitte Consulting LLP to improve the agency’s software system in May. Most MDHS eligibility systems were created over 35 years ago, according to the press release announcing the award. The software upgrades are set to be complete in 2027, according to Jones.

Josh Stein’s office said Thursday, expanding access for western summer camps that provide mental health resources.
Trillium Health Resources, headquartered in Greenville, will use the money to send children and families to the Henry’s House program — a camp for children ages 6 to 16 designed to aid with post-disaster trauma, as well as a broad swath of physical and medical needs.
“This program will be a lifeline for parents and children who are still healing from Helene,” said Matt Calabria, who leads Gov. Josh Stein’s office for western recovery, in a news release.
The new money builds on an already established state program, WNC Thrive, that provides after-school, weekend and summer programming for children in western counties affected by Helene.
Earlier this year, the NC Department of Health and Human Services sent $1.75 million to Vaya Health, which serves 32 western counties, to establish the program. More than 1,000 children attended the program’s camps across multiple locations this past summer, according to the governor’s office.
The new camps put on by Trillium will be located at Victory Junction — a camp in Randleman founded by former NASCAR driver Kyle Petty. In a July announcement of the program, NC Division of Mental Health director Kelly Crosbie called it “a much-needed respite option for families and caregivers.”

Patrick Morrisey announced his appointment to the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals on Friday. (Photo courtesy of the West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey)Gov. Patrick Morrisey appointed Charleston attorney Gerald Titus III to the state Supreme Court of Appeals on Friday.
Titus — who most recently worked at the law firm Spilman Thomas & Battle — will fill the seat previously held by Justice Tim Armstead. Armstead died in August after a year-long battle against cancer.
Armstead was elected in 2020 to a 12-year term on the state’s highest court. Titus, as an appointee, will serve in the seat until the May 2026 election. The winner of that election — which is a nonpartisan race — will serve out the remainder of Armstead’s term, which ends in 2032. Titus said he intends to run for the seat.
Titus said Friday that, while on the Supreme Court, he would be “committed to the rule of law” and apply that law “as it is written.”
“I believe it’s critical that the court remain impartial and ensure fairness for all parties,” Titus said. “… Judges are called upon to make difficult decisions, and I look forward to applying my full legal abilities and training to reach the right result under the law. I am committed to the rule of law and ensuring fairness for all parties.”
In his role at Spilman Thomas, Titus focused on “broad-based” legal work, including corporate litigation, acquisitions, criminal defense and environmental and regulatory issues, among other topics.
On the state Supreme Court, Titus — along with the body’s four other justices — will be responsible for deciding numerous cases, including those brought against and by the state of West Virginia through the attorney general.
According to campaign finance reports with the Secretary of State’s office, Titus and his wife, Meredith, contributed a combined $3,800 to West Virginia Attorney General J.B. McCuskey in the 2024 election cycle. Titus also gave $2,800 to Supreme Court Justice Haley Bunn’s 2024 election campaign.
Titus was one of four candidates provided to Morrisey by the Judicial Vacancy Advisory Commission to fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court. The other finalists for the seat were Eric Hudnall, a staff attorney at the Supreme Court; Steven Redding, a circuit court judge for Berkeley and Morgan counties, and Robert “Booster” Ryan, a former circuit court judge in Grant, Mineral and Tucker counties who currently serves as prosecuting attorney in Hardy County.
Titus said he was “especially honored” to be selected from among the other “excellent candidates.”
This is the second Supreme Court appointment made by Morrisey over the past few months. In August, he appointed Fayette County Circuit Court Judge Thomas Ewing to take the seat formerly held by Justice Beth Walker. Walker announced in April that she would retire in June.
In addition to his work at Spilman Thomas, Titus also previously served as an assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of West Virginia’s violent crime division. He holds a bachelor’s degree in politics and American history from Washington and Lee University. In 2003, he received his law degree from the same school.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/unnamed.jpg,,,2025-11-21 14:57:53.193667

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra proposed freezing property taxes at a gubernatorial campaign meet-and-greet in Des Moines Friday as he told supporters about his vision for making Iowa more affordable.
The Republican from Hull told supporters at the Des Moines event early Friday about his role in crafting the “big, beautiful” budget reconciliation bill alongside Trump and Republican leaders. The tax cuts passed in the measure, like the increased estate tax exemptions and preserving tax credits for certain small businesses and research and development efforts, will help Iowa’s economy, Feenstra said.
Feenstra said important work has already been done in Congress to make the U.S. and Iowa economies more competitive, but added, “Here’s the deal: We need somebody to sell it,” as well as further Republicans’ goals in providing more opportunities for business to succeed at the state level.
As a fourth-generation Iowan who has worked with the Trump administration, Feenstra said he was the right person for the job.
Feenstra, considered a frontrunner for the Iowa GOP nomination, officially launched his campaign for governor in late October, following months of having an “exploratory” campaign that began shortly after Gov. Kim Reynolds announced that she would not run for reelection.
He held his campaign kick-off in Sioux Center earlier in November, and has said his campaign will focus on working with President Donald Trump to enact an “America First” agenda in Iowa while vowing to take the state to “new heights.”
If elected, Feenstra said Friday, his mission as governor would be to make Iowa “the most business- and ag-friendly state in the country,” improve the state’s education system, and lower costs for Iowans. He highlighted property taxes as a top concern, saying this will help Iowans deal with higher costs of living and incentivize more businesses to create jobs in the state.
“We’ve got to be the business state, we got to sell it,” Feenstra said. “We have to dramatically lower our property taxes, we’ve got to continue to reduce regulation. We got to cut property taxes, lower and freeze them.”
Reducing property tax costs has been a major goal for Iowa Republicans at the Statehouse for several years. Reynolds signed a law in 2023 aimed at limiting the growth of property tax costs, and in 2025, Republican legislative leaders introduced a new proposal, which ultimately did not make it to the governor’s desk, to change Iowa’s property tax system from a “rollback” to a “revenue-restricted” system in an effort to reduce costs.
Reynolds has stated multiple times that in 2026, her final legislative session as governor, she plans to introduce legislation on property taxes — though she has not said what her approach may be to lowering costs. The governor has held meetings with local government and community leaders throughout the state in recent months focused on the subject as she and her team plan to draft legislation.
Though many Iowans are in favor of lowering property taxes, local government officials and advocates say cuts could lead to reductions in the local government services residents rely on. At an event in Davenport Tuesday, Reynolds said Iowans will “have to be open to having your services maybe delivered differently,” the Quad-City Times reported.
“If you want everything to stay the same, then it’s probably going to be very hard to reduce your property tax burden,” Reynolds said, according to the Times. “Is there ways that we can provide centers of service? Is there a way … two or three or four counties (can) work together more collaboratively when it comes to EMS? Is there ways that we can utilize our hospitals in rural Iowa more efficiently than we are right now with public health services?”
When Feenstra was asked what impact cutting — or freezing — property taxes would have on government services, he said he believed there was a “new way” essential services can be delivered.
“Whether it be law enforcement, EMS, all these things — there’s a new way to do this,” Feenstra told reporters. “There’s a new way to do this, to be transparent on what property taxes look like, what’s being paid …” and what property tax rates could be frozen or lowered.
“I plan to create that vision, and make sure that gets done,” he said.
Feenstra did not share specific policy proposals or property tax changes he would enact as governor, but said he believed a property tax freeze could be implemented by starting with a specific group, like senior citizens. However, he said he believed lowering property taxes was important for all groups, pointing to property tax costs as a major consideration for small businesses seeking to start or stay in Iowa.
“It’s the number one cost when it comes to small business. Before you even turn on the lights, you’re paying property taxes,” Feenstra said. “So we’ve got to figure out a solution to lower them, to make sure that they can grow and stay successful and keep their doors open.”
He also said he would work to lower health care insurance premiums as governor.
“You (think) about the two biggest things, the two costliest things of small business and families — it’s usually health care, and it’s usually property tax, things that they got to pay,” Feenstra said.
The cost of rising health insurance premiums has been a major discussion in federal politics as one of the main drivers of the government shutdown that ended last week. Senate Democrats resisted passing a federal spending bill without the extension of Affordable Care Act enhanced tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025, but this goal was not met as seven Senate Democrats and one independent voted to approve the stopgap funding measure without ACA tax credit language.
While Senate Majority Leader John Thune agreed to hold a vote in December on a bill related to the ACA tax credits, House Speaker Mike Johnson has not agreed to do the same. If the tax credits are not extended, Democrats and health care advocates say premiums are expected to double for people receiving health coverage through Health Insurance Marketplaces.
Feenstra said, as a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, he has been looking at multiple proposals on lowering premium costs. Trump has said he would only support a measure to provide direct health care payments, while some Republicans, including U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn of Iowa, have said they would support a temporary extension of the enhanced ACA tax credits.
“We want to come out with a new plan that dramatically lowers premiums for families and for small businesses when it comes to health insurance, and that’s what hopefully we’ll roll out here very shortly,” Feenstra said. “… There’s some exciting proposals, again, how we can directly give money to the small business, or give directly money to the family, to lower that premium cost. So that’s what we’re looking at right now.”
The Des Moines meet-and-greet was one of the first stops on a statewide tour, with more events scheduled next week in Dubuque, Denison, Council Bluffs and Sioux City.

A group of state attorneys general, including Vermont’s Charity Clark, are challenging the U.S. Department of Agriculture over recent guidance released about food aid eligibility.

New federal guidance received Oct. 31 will cause some green card holders in Vermont who arrived as refugees or asylum seekers to lose food benefits at the end of the month, state officials said Thursday. 
Meanwhile, State Attorney General Charity Clark and colleagues from 20 other states sent a letter Wednesday to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, requesting corrections to what they argued are incorrect legal interpretations in that guidance.
“It’s really unfortunate that the feds changed the rules,” said Tracy Dolan, director of Vermont’s State Refugee Office. “These folks didn’t do anything wrong — they didn’t fail to meet conditions that other people were meeting.”

The USDA’s October memo was intended to clarify eligibility changes to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, laid out in July’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Vermont already announced a number of related rule changes in recent months, including expanded work requirements for eligible households to receive benefits, and a loss of access for some noncitizens, including a group of immigrants who assisted the U.S. military overseas.
Previously, Vermonters who entered the country as refugees or asylees were still eligible for 3SquaresVT, the state’s version of SNAP, provided they had a green card. Many do, Dolan said, since those humanitarian programs provide the opportunity to apply for a green card shortly after arrival. Though wait times can be long, applicants are generally successful.
But the USDA is now telling states that the new law means these groups are subject to a five-year waiting period in order to be eligible, according to the Vermont Department for Children and Families. As of Dec. 1, according to officials, 22 households of legal permanent residents will lose partial or total access to federal food assistance. Minors will not be affected by the change, state officials said.
The state’s previous alterations to noncitizen eligibility had already cut off or decreased benefits for 119 households in the program.
Miranda Gray, a deputy commissioner with the Department for Children and Families, said the Oct. 31 memo had “clarified for us that we had another group” of households who are not eligible for the program under the new law.
“SNAP is a federal program … that we have to adhere to,” Gray said. 
The State Refugee Office will be providing grants totalling roughly $108,000 as a temporary relief measure for affected families, Dolan said. The original figure before the latest guidance was $106,000, Gray said, but officials have slightly increased the amount of the grant as more than 20 more households were hit by new rule changes.
The funds will be dispersed gradually to especially vulnerable households via the Vermont office of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, or USCRI, and the Ethiopian Community Development Council. Payments will end in January, and are intended to provide a “ramp down” for those affected by recent rule changes, Dolan said.
Nonetheless, she said, the need will inevitably outstrip these resources. Though some impacted households are more vulnerable than others, everyone has had to “scramble,” Dolan said, by adding more hours at work to an already tough schedule or finding other ways to make ends meet.
Sonali Samarasinghe, the director of USCRI Vermont, agreed in an interview late last month discussing the original allocation. The state’s grant, while “very welcome,” will not solve the problem.
“What we want to do is provide as much help as possible to the most vulnerable of households,” she said, adding “a lot of them are single moms.”
The joint letter to the USDA from the attorneys general of 20 states and the District of Columbia argued that President Donald Trump’s administration incorrectly interpreted some groups’ eligibility for benefits, including refugees, asylum seekers, and Special Immigrant Visa holders who worked with U.S. forces in Afghanistan. State officials also have concerns about how the five-year waiting period is being defined. 
Authored by New York State Attorney General Letitia James, the document also criticized USDA’s four-month delay in issuing guidance and its immediate deadline for implementation.
“We request that the USDA correct the mistakes in the Guidance’s interpretation of (The One Big Beautiful Bill Act) … and hold States harmless for any errors resulting from the delayed, misleading, and inaccurate Guidance,” the letter stated.
“The Federal Government is failing states and our citizens and leaving us in an awful position of trying to comply with confusing laws and an incredibly poorly timed guidance,” Clark said in an emailed statement Friday.
Gray said she was aware of Clark’s joint letter and that her team would continue to seek additional federal clarification as it becomes available.
USDA did not respond to requests for comment.

(Courtesy photo)The Bipartisan Public Lands Caucus, which was co-founded by Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke and New Mexico Rep. Gabe Vasquez in May, made its first official endorsement of a bill.
Zinke’s introduced his Public Lands in Public Hands Act in 2024 and reintroduced it for the current congress early this year.
The bill is aimed at keeping public lands under the management of public agencies and prevent the selloff of land — a major flashpoint during budget discussions in Washington this year that led to the formation of the bipartisan caucus.
According to the bill’s text, it would ban the sale or transfer of most public lands managed by the Department of the Interior and U.S. Forest Service except under specific conditions and where required under previous laws. Transferring publicly accessible federal land tracts over 300 acres and for public land tracts over 5 acres accessible via a public waterway would require congressional approval.
Zinke did not respond to a request for comment on the caucus’ endorsement of his bill by publication. However, when he introduced the bill, he said conservation bills are a critical part of the Montana way of life that ensure the ability to pass that on to future generations.
In a press release put out by Rep. Vasquez, the Caucus emphasized that “Public lands power rural outdoor economies, support cultural traditions, and strengthen communities.”
“Like so many New Mexicans, I grew up hunting, fishing, and camping on public lands. Those experiences shaped who I am today,” Vasquez said. “These lands don’t belong to one party or to a handful of wealthy interests—they belong to all of us. This endorsement is a meaningful step as the Public Lands Caucus works to ensure our lands stay in public hands for generations to come.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025-05-07_mbo_0683-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-21 14:57:53.193667

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)  There’s officially less than a year to go before the 2026 midterm elections where the balance of the U.S. House will hang in the balance and could come down to just a few seats.
While a Democrat hasn’t been elected to the U.S. House in the state since Rep. Pat Williams finished his ninth term in Congress as the state’s sole representative in the late 1990s — two Democrats have launched primary campaigns for the chance to go head-to-head with Western. Rep. Ryan Zinke.
Matt Rains, of Simms,  and Russ Cleveland, of St. Regis, have similar backgrounds in agriculture and as veterans.
Cleveland enlisted in the Navy and served as an aviation electrician until 2009, according to his website’s bio. Simms attended West Point and served as a Blackhawk helicopter pilot for the Army.
Zinke, meanwhile, is well known for his three decades as a Navy Seal and was the first of the elite special force team to serve in the House.
Cleveland announced his run for Congress this spring, touting his roots in Montana.
He grew up in Stevensville before attending school at Montana Tech in Butte. After the Army, he and his wife founded a startup company focused on quality child care in Colorado that during the COVID pandemic turned into a remote learning organization serving thousands of children.
Cleveland and his family moved back to Montana in 2021 to a ranch in St. Regis.
Matt Rains, who announced his campaign last month, has tried his hand in the Montana political world before.
In 2020 he ran in the Democratic primary for the state’s then-at-large congressional seat, but withdrew and endorsed eventual Democratic nominee Kathleen Williams. Rains subsequently pivoted to campaign for a state House District seat representing Cascade County, but lost in the primary.
Rains is a fourth-generation rancher and worked as Chief of Staff at the Montana Farmers Union, until announcing his campaign.
Montana’s two congressional seats are rated as “Solid Republican” for the eastern seat held by Rep. Troy Downing, and “Likely Republican,” for Zinke’s seat, according to the Cook Political Report.
Zinke won his two most recent races in 2024 and 2022 with 52% and 49.6% of the vote. He has been endorsed for re-election by President Donald Trump.

Photographer: Elijah Nouvelage/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesProposals for data centers will be subject to state review under new rules the Georgia Department of Community Affairs adopted Thursday at its quarterly board meeting in Savannah.
The board unanimously expanded what constitutes a “development of regional impact” to explicitly include data centers. The addition of a category called “technological facilities” was needed because DCA’s 12 regional councils weren’t in agreement on how to treat data centers, facilities that house servers and other computer equipment increasingly needed to support artificial intelligence.
DCA Deputy Commissioner Rusty Haywood Credit: Mary Landers/The Current GA
“If you take the submissions that we have received specific to data centers, some regional commissioners, some regional commissions were processing those as industrial, some were processing them as commercial, and some were not processing them at all because they didn’t seem to fit within the definitions of either of those two categories,” DCA Deputy Commissioner Rusty Haywood said. “So what we have done is created a technological facilities category that would encompass that type of development.”
DCA paused the review of data centers in June. The new rules apply outside of the Atlanta region to data centers of at least 500,000 square feet — equal to the area covered by about nine football fields. Within the Atlanta Regional Commission’s territory, that threshold applies only to rural areas. Data centers in Atlanta’s urban and suburban areas areas are subject to a lower threshold of 300,000 square feet.
The DRI process allows “those in proximity to a proposed development of significant scale have the opportunity to comment and weigh in before a development occurs,” DCA Deputy Commissioner Rusty Haywood told the board.
The developers of data centers, which use massive quantities of water and electricity, will be required to estimate how much of each they’ll need for a new facility.
The DCA doesn’t give projects a thumbs up or down, however.
“The regional commissions are not weighing in positive or negative,” Haywood said. “This board is not weighing in positive or negative. That’s entirely a local decision. This process does not infringe on the local government’s decision-making authority. If they want to approve such a development, they have that right do so. If they wish to oppose it they have that right.”
DCA received 16 written numerous public comments on the proposed changes to the DRI process. Most were in support of the new classifications and modifications, Haywood said. Some urged the board to adopt the more stringent 300,000 square foot threshold for all data centers. The Georgia Water Coalition was among the public commenters weighing in.
“The Georgia Water Coalition is excited to have a clear statement of when data centers must participate in the DRI process,” Amy Sharma, executive director of Science for Georgia and the coalition’s data center committee chair, told The Current GA Thursday. “DRIs are often one of the only windows that planners and the public have into a very opaque process. Since the pause, everyone has been flying blind. While we would have preferred for the DCA to adopt our more stringent definitions and guidelines, we cannot let perfect be the enemy of good. We look forward to continuing the conversation and increasing transparency into this unprecedented development boom.”
 Solar farms process added

The DCA board also approved the DRI process for solar farms of 300 acres in urban areas and 500 acres in rural areas.
“We added (solar farms) as a category because some regional commissions said those are developments that are occurring at a large scale and having an impact within the state,” Haywood said.
Solar supporters are taking a wait-and-see attitude about the change.
“We hope it facilitates transparency and more solar farms,” said Jennette Gayer, director of Environment Georgia.
Other changes to the DRI categories include the addition of a traffic element for commercial developments; those expected to generate 10,000 or more vehicle trips per day will require the DRI process.
“If you just take a general Publix grocery store, that’s probably going to be about 4,000 trips a day,” Haywood said. “So it’s not something that a grocery store would qualify as a development of regional impact. It’s got to be something of a larger scale to hit that threshold.”

“After careful consideration, much prayer and reflection, and after long conversations with my family, my closest friends and advisors, I’ve made the decision not to run for governor in 2026,” Ryan said in a statement.
Back in August, Ryan began considering a run to succeed Gov. Mike DeWine after former U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown decided to run for U.S. Senate rather than governor.
While he was debating, Acton set record-breaking fundraising numbers for a Democrat this early in a gubernatorial race and began collecting endorsements from state and county leaders.
Acton is expected to face off against the GOP-endorsed Republican candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, a Cincinnati businessman.
“No matter what corner of the state I’m in, it’s clear Ohioans are struggling with rising costs. Whether it’s healthcare, childcare, gas or groceries, there’s too much money going out and not enough coming in. And while the special interests that run our state are doing just fine, they’ve made a mess for the rest of us, and I will not allow a billionaire Washington insider like Vivek Ramaswamy take us down an even worse path. I’m running for Governor because it’s time for a change.

The seven-term congressmember is running on protecting Californians from the Trump administration and from rising prices. While he’s developed a reputation as a professional GOP antagonist, the challenge will be proving he has what it takes to deliver on the elusive affordability promise.


Rep. Eric Swalwell, a former Democratic presidential candidate who helped lead the second impeachment of President Donald Trump, has officially entered the fray to succeed California Gov. Gavin Newsom in next year’s gubernatorial race.
His core message? “Prices are too high and people are scared.”
Swalwell, 45, a prominent Trump antagonist on social media and a cable news darling who ran a short-lived bid for the White House in 2019, made the announcement Thursday night at the tail end of a nearly 10-minute interview with late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. 
After joking that California was “the greatest country in the world,” to laughs from the Los Angeles studio audience, Swalwell grew serious and decried how Californians have been disproportionately targeted by a second Trump administration, whether through vengeful immigration raids or the cancellation of critical cancer and health research. 
“This great state needs a fighter and a protector,” Swalwell said.
In a video posted to his campaign website, which went live shortly before his appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” aired, Swalwell says “no one will keep California safer” than he will. He name-drops Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi — the San Francisco titan of Democratic politics who recently announced her own retirement — and points to her decisions to appoint him to the House Intelligence Committee and as one of four Trump impeachment managers following the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. 
Swallwell’s announcement comes a day after billionaire liberal activist Tom Steyer announced he is running to replace Newsom when he terms out in 2027. At least six other high-profile Democrats are also running, including former Rep. Katie Porter, former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. Prominent Republican challengers include Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and former Fox News contributor Steve Hilton. 
The challenge for the seven-term congressman, who said recently he was among the latest of Trump’s political enemies to be targeted for investigation by the Justice Department, will be proving he can govern for Californians at home in addition to sparring with Republicans on the national stage. 
“We can say that we’re the fourth largest economy in the world — and we are, and I love to brag about that — but what does that mean if you can’t afford to live here?” Swalwell told Kimmel on Thursday. 
On that front, Swalwell offers no concrete policy promises in his initial launch, but instead cites his experience as a planning commissioner and city councilmember for his hometown of Dublin, the Bay Area suburb nestled east of Hayward and west of Livermore. He represents the same region in Congress.
“I’ve worked as a planning commissioner and city councilman in a place of low income and low expectations and helped lead my hometown to become one of California’s most prosperous cities,” Swalwell’s campaign site says. “I’ll take that approach to the whole state.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/112125-Eric-Swalwell-WM-Getty-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-21 13:57:43.101816

Ron DeSantis warned Friday that President Donald Trump’s push to drill off the Florida coast could “weaken” environmental protections and interfere with military training.
DeSantis referred to the U.S. Department of the Interior’s plan to reinvigorate oil drilling off of Florida and Southern California for the first time in decades. The federal government has not allowed drilling in federal waters in the eastern Gulf since 1995 because of oil spill concerns, the AP reported.
“We supported the 2020 decision that the Trump administration made at the time, we worked very closely with them. I thought it was very thoughtful policy in 2020,” DeSantis said during an unrelated Crystal River press conference Friday morning.
“Now what the Interior Department is proposing to do is really to go back off that policy, and I think that would weaken protections that we worked very hard to establish offshore.”
Those protections reflect environmental fears of damaging Florida’s coastlines and marine life and the military’s ability to train in the Panhandle. Florida has multiple military bases in Panama City and Pensacola.
“[The military says] it’s really important to be able to have that access to be able to do key training,” the governor continued. “We hope that they double down on the 2020 policy and not push ahead with what Interior wants to do now.”
This is one of the rarer instances of DeSantis breaking with Trump since the 2024 elections. The tension between the two ahead of and throughout the presidential primary had been replaced with a quieter complacency. Both Trump and DeSantis have been tightly aligned on most conservative issues, especially immigration, while public disagreement has stayed at a muted minimum.
‘Dead on arrival’
According to the Associated Press, the proposal targets six offshore lease sales between 2027 and 2030 along the California coast. It would also spur drilling at least 100 miles offshore of Florida in South-Central Gulf region and compel more than 20 lease sales off the Alaskan coast.
Backlash has been swift in all targeted states. In Florida, DeSantis became the latest Republican to add his voice to join a bipartisan outcry at the plan, joining lawmakers like U.S. Sen. Ashley Moody and U.S. Rep. Jimmy Patronis. U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, a leading Trump ally, helped persuade the president in 2018 to drop a similar offshore plan when he served as governor.
Trump agreed at the time to maintain a drilling moratorium until 2032. Earlier this month, Scott and Moody co-sponsored legislation to codify that moratorium.
In 2010, the Gulf was rocked by a massive oil spill caused by an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform. Eleven men were killed, the rig began to sink, and a catastrophic oil leak sprouted from the well, NOAA reported. It would take three months to cap the spill, allowing roughly 134 million gallons of oil to seep into the ocean in the largest such spill in the nation’s history.
Politicos aren’t the only ones concerned about the new proposal.
Sierra Club Florida called the plan “unacceptable” and potentially detrimental to both the state’s environment and the economy.
“President Trump and his administration may be eager to hand out blank checks to oil and gas companies, but it will not be at Florida’s expense,” Javier Estevez, the group’s political and legislative director, said in a written statement. “We refuse to allow our coastal economies, quality of life, and irreplaceable natural resources to be sacrificed for corporate profit.
“Any such proposal is dead on arrival, and we will work tirelessly to ensure our coasts are protected.”

The U.S. is trying to facilitate a total financial support package of up to $40 billion for Argentina, but only $20 billion comes from U.S. government funds.
The deal includes a $20 billion currency swap between the U.S. Treasury and Argentina’s central bank. That was authorized in October and was heavily criticized in both countries, especially after President Donald Trump initially tied support to President Javier Milei’s performance in the October election in Argentina. Critics argue that using financial assistance to influence foreign elections sets a dangerous precedent.
The remaining $20 billion was originally expected to come from private banks and sovereign wealth funds, coordinated by the Treasury Department to invest in Argentine debt. But in November 2025, a group of banks backed out of a plan for the matching $20 billion package, instead opting to explore a smaller, short-term loan deal, according to reports.

(Andrew Roth | Michigan Advance)A political action committee that works to elected pro-Israel Democratic candidates up and down the ballot has thrown its weight behind U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens of Birmingham.
On Thursday, the Democratic Majority for Israel PAC, or DMFI, endorsed Stevens and three other candidates in various races across the nation.
Stevens is one of a handful of Michigan U.S. Senate candidates on the Democratic side of the race, which also features state Sen. Mallory McMorrow of Royal Oak, Abdul El-Sayed, former director of the Wayne County Department of Health, Human and Veterans Services, and research health specialist Rachel Howard.
DMFI PAC said it was endorsing Stevens because she was one of several incumbent electeds who have “stood firm against extremism, antisemitism, and efforts to undermine America’s alliances.”
“DMFI PAC is proud to support these exceptional candidates, and we’re firmly committed to helping them win their races,” DMFI PAC Chair Brian Romick said in a statement.
Stevens said she was honored to garner the endorsement of DMFI PAC.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“As a proud pro-Israel Democrat, I believe America is stronger when we stand with our democratic allies, confront antisemitism and extremism, and keep our promises to our friends abroad and our working families here at home,” Stevens said in a statement. “In the Senate, I’ll keep fighting to protect our democracy, support Israel’s security, ensure the ceasefire holds in Gaza, and deliver for Michiganders in every corner of our state.”
McMorrow and E-Sayed have both said they will not take money from corporate PACs and that includes money from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC. Both candidates have called Israel’s actions in its war against Hamas in Gaza a genocide of the Palestinian people.
In a statement to Michigan Advance, El-Sayed campaign spokesperson Roxie Richner said that 33 Palestinians were killed in Gaza on Thursday, and that American tax dollars paid for it.
“Meanwhile, our kids’ schools are crumbling, and they tell us we don’t have money to fix them,” Richner said. “Taking an endorsement and campaign money from those that defend this misappropriation is disqualifying.”

(Photo by U.S. Department of Agriculture)After an unnecessary, weeks-long disruption, more than 1.4 million Ohioans should have their federal food benefits for November, a spokesman for the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services confirmed on Thursday. 
Even though a federal judge ordered him to disburse the funds, President Donald Trump held up the payments to 42 million Americans starting on Nov. 1. 
Trump blamed the disruption on the partial shutdown of the federal government. But the government had money to temporarily fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Federal courts ordered him to do so as other presidents have done so in all previous federal shutdowns.
The suspension of benefits sparked a crisis, with many Ohio food pantries reporting record demand.
After the government reopened last week, the state agency that administers SNAP started working to get food benefits out the door.
The Ohio Department of Job and Family Services “has distributed benefits to over 95% of all SNAP recipients in Ohio,” spokesman Tom Betti said in an email Thursday afternoon. “We expect to be at 100% by tomorrow. 
Because of the way that funds flow through the system, there are a small number of cases that require manual activity on our part to push them through to the beneficiaries and is a common occurrence that happens every month.”

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)The Centurion Foundation, the Atlanta nonprofit trying to buy Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital, appears undeterred by the state’s pursuit of an alternative buyer.
At least, that’s the image it presents in federal bankruptcy court hearings and media statements. 
But internal emails to state regulators obtained by Rhode Island Current reveal the foundation’s distress over potential competitor Prime Healthcare, and its unhappiness  with the state for allegedly standing in the way of the deal.
In a Nov. 7 email to the Rhode Island Attorney General’s Office and the Rhode Island Department of Health, Centurion CEO Ben Mingle asked the state to cease its discussions with Prime, which Mingle claims are making it harder for the foundation to close the deal. He also blamed the state for its “continued lack of support” in easing the financial conditions needed to secure its purchase.
“Over the course of much of 2025, we repeatedly requested direct financial support from Rhode Island and unfortunately that support did not materialize,” Mingle wrote. “We strongly believe that a show of meaningful financial support from the State during our prior financing attempts would have made them successful.”
Mingle’s letter set off a series of tense exchanges with Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, whose office has played a key role in regulating the sale of the state hospitals, including in federal bankruptcy court since January, when Prospect filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
“Since approval, first by the State and then the Bankruptcy Court, the State and others have shown extraordinary patience and flexibility as Centurion has attempted to secure financing to complete the acquisition,” Neronha wrote in a Nov. 10 email response to Mingle. “The reasons for your inability to secure committed financing are irrelevant to the primary need to get the hospital transactions closed and to mitigate the current losses at the hospitals.”
Centurion received conditional approval to buy the hospitals from their now-bankrupt owner, Prospect Medical Holdings, in June 2024. But Centurion, and its local subsidiary, CharterCARE Health of Rhode Island, has struggled to secure the investor-backed bond financing needed to close the deal, despite multiple revisions by state regulators and the state’s quasi-public financing agency meant to ease the financial requirements. 
Amid delays, Rhode Island Health and Human Services Secretary Richard Charest reached out to Prime, his former employer and owner of Landmark Medical Center in Woonsocket, to gauge the company’s interest. Gov. Dan McKee’s office condoned the courtship as a “Plan B” focused on keeping the safety net hospitals afloat, especially after Prospect signaled its intent to shutter the hospitals by the end of the year because of growing operating losses.

True feelings exposed 
Centurion has repeatedly shifted questions about Prime back to its own commitment to the hospital sale. But Mingle’s email does not hold back in his criticism of the California hospital chain operator.
“Prime Healthcare has a very clear track record across many years in its ownership and management of hospitals, regardless of whether they are technically for-profit or ‘non-profit,’ Mingle wrote. “Rhode Island residents can expect another operator that calls the shots from California, one that will reduce the scope of services at [Fatima] and [Roger Williams,] and one that will significantly dwindle access to high quality physicians.”
Leaders with the union representing 1,200 hospital workers at the facilities have also expressed concern with Prime’s record, citing a trio of Justice Department settlements and cost-cutting measures at other hospitals nationwide.
Noel True, a spokesperson for Prime, touted Prime’s recognitions for safety and care at Landmark in an emailed response on Friday.
“As a nonprofit public charity, Prime Healthcare Foundation is honored that state leaders turned to us, recognizing our mission-driven work saving Landmark Medical Center from bankruptcy in 2013 and transforming it into a hospital recognized for award winning care with eight consecutive Healthgrades Patient Safety Excellence Awards, Leapfrog ‘A’ ratings, and the distinction of being ranked #1 in Rhode Island for social responsibility by the Lown Institute,” True wrote. “Our mission has saved hospitals across the nation, created thousands of jobs, uplifted communities and has never led to a single hospital closing — even in the most challenging times.”
In a rare moment of alignment, McKee and Neronha separately defended the state’s ability to consider alternative proposals.
“You, however, seem to think that conditional approval precludes the State from responding to interest expressed in the Rhode Island hospitals from other entities, especially when your ability to close after all this time remains speculative,” Neronha wrote. “Nothing in Rhode Island’s decisions or law provides you with the exclusive right to purchase the hospital or to be the only party with approval to do so or limits Rhode Island’s obligation to evaluate alternative transactions in accordance with the exercise of its regulatory authority.”
Backing up Neronha, McKee said the state’s precautionary steps were “the right and responsible course of action.”
“Waiting and doing nothing is simply not an option and would pose an unacceptable risk to the well-being of our health care system and the Rhode Islanders who rely on it,” McKee said in an emailed response Friday.
Neronha also underscored the urgency, concluding his letter by noting that “time is running out.”

Out of time
Avoiding the dire consequences of closing the hospitals appears to be one point of agreement between the feuding sides of the deal. 
The hospitals offer 500 beds between them, including 104 beds for behavioral health patients, which represents more than one-fifth of the state’s behavioral health beds. They saw a combined 50,000 emergency room patients last year, while employing 2,400 people. Roger Williams houses the only fully accredited bone marrow transplant unit in the state. 
“We strongly believe that Centurion and CharterCARE are best positioned to support the health care needs of these communities — truly nonprofit health care, locally controlled and in partnership with local physicians,” Mingle wrote in a second email to state regulators on Nov. 14.
With that in mind, Mingle proposed two “alternative scenarios,” with timelines, to close the deal, both of which extend beyond the Nov. 30 short-term financing plan for the hospitals, and may also require more leniency from state regulators.
In the first option, Centurion would still rely on investor-backed bond financing to buy the hospitals, closing no later than Jan. 15, 2026. The proposal relies upon the state and Prospect agreeing to share the tab for hospital operations until closing.
Alternatively, Centurion could close by Dec. 15 using a short-term loan from Bank of America, using the state-controlled hospital fund and other cash on its balance sheet as collateral. Bond financing finalized “on or about” Jan. 15, 2026, would pay off the bank loan and release the collateral.
“We are diligently pursuing both of the above Scenarios to bring this transaction to closure as soon as possible,” Mingle wrote. “In addition, we are willing to consider other proposals from the State or others to ensure that CharterCARE Health of Rhode Island’s ability to ensure that the health care needs of the communities that it will serve are fully preserved and maintained.”
Neronha was unpersuaded.
“It does not appear that you have any more certainty with respect to financing under either of the scenarios described in your November 14th letter than you did a week ago,” he wrote in a Nov. 17 emailed response. 
He also noted that even if the state agreed to put up more money to keep the hospitals open until Centurion can close a deal, Prospect, and the federal bankruptcy court must also be convinced.
And he again made clear that Rhode Island is not locked in on Centurion as the only potential buyer until it satisfies the conditions tied to its approval.
“Rhode Island cannot give and has never given you any exclusivity because as regulator it reacts to requests for, or changes in, ownership or other changes based on the State’s evaluation of the facts relevant to the changes being requested and from the perspective of Rhode Island’s residents and their need for health care.”
Neronha’s office met with representatives from Prime Healthcare on Thursday, according to news reports. A spokesperson for Neronha’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday on the outcome of the meeting.
A spokesperson for the Rhode Island Department of Health did not respond to requests for comment Friday.
Progress on Prime
However, attorneys for the AG and Prospect are scheduled to offer an update on the sale proceedings in federal bankruptcy court on Tuesday, Nov. 25. At a status conference earlier this week, Thomas Califano, an attorney for Prospect, said there was “progress” toward a deal, but did not offer specifics. Califano also indicated that Prospect and the AG’s office had tentatively agreed to extend their cost-sharing agreement for hospital operations through December to allow more time to finalize a buyer.
The existing agreement, which funds hospital operations through November, requires that whoever buys the hospitals repay Prospect’s bankruptcy estate and the state for money spent on hospital operations — about $6 million in total for November.
That’s roughly the same amount of money Centurion is seeking to recoup from Chartercare Foundation, a charitable foundation tied to the hospitals until 2014. But so far, Centurion’s requests to “return” donations made to the Chartercare Foundation have been rebuffed.
Mingle also sought Neronha’s help in forcing the Chartercare Foundation to relinquish assets which Mingle said were intended to support Roger Williams and Fatima, and can now be given back under the return to nonprofit status. 
Neronha did not want to get involved.
“Centurion’s inability to persuade the Foundation to invest in its acquisition effort speaks for itself,” he wrote to Mingle. “The Attorney General’s regulatory role is limited to situations where the charitable funds are not properly used.”
Paula Iacono, the Chartercare Foundation’s executive director, declined to comment in an emailed response Friday.

States are passing laws to target private equity transactions of health care facilities, such as hospitals. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)As more private equity firms buy health care physician practices and facilities, states are pushing back on acquisitions that some critics say could potentially gut health care infrastructure. 
This year alone at least seven states, including California, Indiana, Massachusetts, Maine, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington, have enacted laws requiring more oversight over private equity acquisitions in health care. Private equity involves pooling resources from pension funds, endowments, sovereign wealth funds and wealthy individuals to buy controlling stakes in companies and boost their value — often with the goal of selling at a profit within a few years.
Private equity firms argue that their role in upgrading technology and increasing efficiency helps health care access, especially in rural and other underserved areas.
‘Shell game’: When private equity comes to town, hospitals can see cutbacks, closures

Private equity interest in health care has been around for a while, but really started to grow in the past decade, said John McDonough, a professor of public health practice at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Now there are private equity interests “in every imaginable iteration of medical care,” from hospitals to nursing homes, hospice care, physician practices and even veterinary care, he said. 
This year, several states have passed laws to increase oversight and transparency of private equity’s continuing acquisitions. 
Massachusetts and California enacted laws requiring more groups that were not included under previous reporting requirements, such as private equity firms, real estate investment trusts and management service organizations, to now notify the state if they make a health care acquisition and to give the attorney general more power to investigate the transactions. Indiana passed a law that gives the attorney general authority to investigate market concentration. 
Oregon passed an oversight law that not only limits how much private equity firms can buy up a health care market, but also bars private equity firms from having any control over clinical operations. The law also gives the state power to block any pending transitions that violate the law. California also enacted another law that prohibits private investors from interfering with the judgment of physicians and dentists. 
New Mexico passed a law that strengthened its 2024 Health Care Consolidation Oversight Act, which temporarily gave the state regulators more oversight over transactions. The new law makes that oversight authority permanent and more expansive, while also establishing penalties for non-compliance with reporting requirements. And Washington state passed a transparency law creating a registry of all health care entities. 










The purpose of the dealmaking is to enrich the owners as quickly as possible, and then get out and move on to your next conquest.


– John McDonough, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health


Maine passed a law to impose a one-year moratorium on all private equity or real estate investment trust purchases of hospitals. 
“The purpose of the dealmaking is to enrich the owners as quickly as possible, and then get out and move on to your next conquest,” McDonough said. “And so there’s a fundamental conflict there between duty to patients as a primary obligation and return on profits to shareholders.” 
According to researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, the number of acquisitions of physician practices rose from 816 in 2012, to 5,779 in 2021. Researchers also found that some single private equity firms captured 30-50% of specialty practices in local markets.
With limited congressional oversight on private equity actions in health care, states play a critical role in reining in predatory practices, said Michael Fenne, senior policy coordinator at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a watchdog group that monitors private equity activity.
“There’s not really federal law that targets private equity acquisitions in the same way [as laws] that states have been passing recently,” he said.

Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration this week projected an updated surplus of nearly $2 billion for this fiscal year, up $213 million from last month. And that huge cushion, equal to 8% of the General Fund, would be even larger had President Donald Trump and Congress not extended federal corporate tax cuts otherwise set to expire. Connecticut links its corporate tax system to the federal code — as do several other states.
But that corporate tax revenue hit, estimated at slightly less than $140 million, is more than offset by surges in state income and other business tax receipts. The sharpest growth comes in income tax receipts tied to quarterly filings, a category dominated by capital gains and other investment-related earnings.
State officials had been expecting good news since Nov. 10, when fiscal analysts for the legislative and executive branches upgraded revenue projections by $1.1 billion from a joint forecast issued April 30. Legislators already had anticipated some of that growth in the latest state budget, which they adopted last June.
Advocates for greater social services and health care spending say a $213 million bump upward to an already enormous state surplus means Connecticut is well positioned to help its most vulnerable residents as federal funding shrinks.
An omnibus measure Trump and Congress passed in July would curb funding for: health insurance subsidies; grants to combat homelessness; and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP benefits for immigrants, young adults, veterans and people experiencing homelessness.
The Connecticut Department of Social Services estimates the latter cut could affect as many as 36,000 residents here between Dec. 1 and March 31.
Advocates for free and reduced meal services in Connecticut schools expect the SNAP cuts will trigger a reduction in federal aid for subsidized school breakfast and lunch programs.
Lamont, whom legislators gave sole discretion to propose what federal cuts, if any, Connecticut should reverse by tapping this $500 million state fund, has not said yet what he’ll do.
But while that response fund is temporary — expiring in early February — the federal cutbacks that social service advocates worry about would continue indefinitely. In other words, if Connecticut taps the $500 million reserve to help combat homelessness or help provide health insurance, groceries or school meals in December and January, advocates would expect Connecticut to continue dedicating state funds indefinitely — meaning likely for years to come.
State legislators and Lamont likely won’t resolve that larger question until after the regular 2026 General Assembly session, which starts on Feb. 4.
“I do worry about using short term monies to pay for long term obligations,” the governor said this week. “I think that’s something that’s gotten us in trouble in the past. [But] we’re going to take care of people in need.”
But Connecticut’s state finances haven’t been “in trouble” for quite a while.
State budget surpluses have averaged about $1.8 billion per year since 2017, when aggressive budget caps were installed to force big savings. And given that only roughly one quarter of state spending is discretionary, leaving $1.8 billion or 8% unspent is huge.
“The chaos in Washington D.C. is made worse by inaction or delayed action here at home,” said Emily Byrne, executive director of Connecticut Voices for Children, an economic policy and advocacy group. 
“While the government shutdown may be over, the harm is not gone,” Byrne said. “The Congressional mega-bill kicked off thousands of Connecticut residents from food assistance and tens of thousands more are struggling to meet the new, rigorous work requirements to receive SNAP. Over one hundred thousand residents are wondering how they’re going to afford health coverage next year and many more are worried about the new rigorous work requirements placed on beneficiaries of Medicaid.”
Byrne added, “Connecticut must be vigilant and proactive so that our residents are protected. We’re talking about people’s lives. The state must act now.”
CT For All, a progressive coalition of more than 60 faith, labor and other civic organizations, has argued for years that state surpluses don’t honestly reflect excess, unneeded dollars. Rather they involve vital resources siphoned away from core programs. Lamont and the General Assembly have used more of these surpluses, about $10 billion since 2020, to accelerate paying down Connecticut’s hefty pension debt.
“To call this money ‘a surplus’ is a lie,” said CT For All Director Norma Martinez-HoSang. “Year to year we underestimate the money available for spending, while public education institutes and social services are underfunded and policies that would improve our lives are taken off the table.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/BOND-COMMISSION-0801-SR-10-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-21 13:57:43.101816

Tryouts and recruiting for the inaugural roster are expected to ramp up over the next year, with the first group of Lightning flag football players set to take the field in fall 2026.
WILMINGTON, Del. — Women’s flag football is quickly becoming one of the fastest-growing varsity sports in college athletics — and Goldey-Beacom College is betting big that Delaware should be part of the first wave.
Goldey-Beacom announced Oct. 16 that it will launch a women’s flag football program for the 2026–27 academic year, making the Lightning one of the first colleges in Delaware to sponsor the sport at the varsity level and positioning the school as a regional leader in a rapidly expanding game.
The move comes as women’s flag football gains momentum nationally, pushed by NCAA recognition, investment from the NFL and the sport’s upcoming debut in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.
A national trend meets a local opportunity
In February 2025, the NCAA Committee on Women’s Athletics recommended women’s flag football for inclusion in the Emerging Sports for Women program, a key step toward full championship status once at least 40 schools sponsor the sport.
The NAIA officially sanctioned women’s flag football in 2020 and held its first championships in 2021. The NJCAA followed in 2023, widening the pipeline for two-year college athletes. Today, more than 65 NCAA schools sponsor women’s flag football at the club or varsity level, with at least 20 more expected by 2026.
Colleges are adding programs for several reasons:

It is less equipment-intensive and generally safer than tackle football.
It attracts new female athletes, many of whom did not play traditional high school sports.
It offers a fresh way to boost campus spirit, enrollment and alumni engagement.

With flag football set to be an Olympic sport in 2028, athletic directors see a rare chance to build a new women’s program at the ground level — and to offer scholarships in a sport that is only going to grow.
Goldey-Beacom “gets in on the ground floor”
That is exactly how Goldey-Beacom’s athletic leadership views the opportunity.
Director of Athletics Jeremy Benoit has framed the decision as a strategic move that aligns the college with a sport on the rise, noting that Goldey-Beacom is “getting in on the ground floor” just as interest in girls’ and women’s flag football is exploding at the high school level and drawing support from the NFL.
The 2026–27 season will mark flag football as the college’s 15th varsity sport and is expected to fold into competition within the Central Atlantic Collegiate Conference, where a conference championship could be in place as early as 2027.
By acting now, Goldey-Beacom aims to become a destination for female athletes from Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland who want to keep playing flag football beyond high school.
Tim Griffiths, the college’s Academic Interventionist Coach for the past four years, was named the inaugural head coach
A coach built for a startup program
To lead the new program, Goldey-Beacom turned to someone who already knows its student-athletes and has a record of building teams from scratch.
Tim Griffiths, the college’s Academic Interventionist Coach for the past four years, was named the inaugural head coach. Griffiths is a former Division II football player at Mansfield University and a past captain of the U.S. National Rugby Team. He has extensive experience launching athletic programs in public education — a background that translates directly to starting a new varsity sport.
Griffiths calls flag football the “ultimate team sport,” and says his vision is for the Lightning “Bolts” to be a force not just on the field, but in life.
He stresses that the program will be built on leadership, sportsmanship and self-confidence as much as playbooks and playcalling, and that academics will remain central. Goldey-Beacom recently celebrated a 91% NCAA Academic Success Rate and 57 student-athletes named to the Central Atlantic Collegiate Conference All-Academic Team.
Delaware’s chance to lead in a new women’s sport
For Delaware, Goldey-Beacom’s decision marks a significant step. The college becomes one of the state’s first institutions to commit to women’s flag football at the varsity level, giving local high school athletes a nearby option to continue in the sport without leaving the region.
With the college’s proximity to the Philadelphia Eagles and the NFL’s growing investment in girls’ and women’s flag football, Goldey-Beacom officials believe there will be opportunities for clinics, joint events and exposure that few campuses can match.
As colleges across the country race to add women’s flag football, Goldey-Beacom is betting that an early start — and a clear focus on both academics and leadership — will make the Lightning a flagship program in the Mid-Atlantic.

You can read more about the section here.

On my first day of school in Mississippi, a boy pinned me to the ground and made me eat dirt. I was a California kid dropped into the Deep South in the 1980s and learned quickly that I didn’t belong. That moment set the tone for the rest of my years there.
My family was multiracial. My sister had been adopted from Korea. Back home, that didn’t raise eyebrows. In Mississippi, people would ask where we “got” her, as if she were something that came with a label. I saw people living in tarpaper shacks just down the road from our home in Madison.
Even as a kid I could feel something settled in the ground and in the air. A weight. A history. A tension that told me everything I needed to know without anyone saying it out loud. I understood early that the place was not built for someone like me.
When I finally left after seventh grade, I made myself a promise: I would never set foot in Mississippi again. And for almost 40 years, I’ve kept that promise. I planned my life around avoiding the state, even once choosing to vacation in Europe so I wouldn’t have to attend a company retreat in Biloxi. Mississippi was a closed chapter. A place I ran from and never looked back.
Then came Lane Kiffin.
The irony is obvious. I grew up in a UCLA and San Francisco 49ers household. Lane Kiffin is USC and the Raiders. He survived getting fired on an airport tarmac while coaching the University of Southern California football team. He survived Raiders owner Al Davis publicly dressing him down like he had no business holding a headset.

Yet, he looks calmer in Oxford than anywhere he has ever been. Maybe he has found his elusive peace in Mississippi. And I respect that deeply. Peace was not something Mississippi ever offered me.
Kiffin and I are opposites, but we share one thing. We have lived like vagabonds. Always on the move. Always trying to outrun something. For him, it was pressure, expectations and the shadow of his own potential. For me, it was a childhood I wanted to forget and a place I refused to return to. Mississippi wasn’t my place, but maybe it’s his. And there is something admirable about seeing a man find a home in the last place anyone expected.
He has made me rethink things I didn’t think were up for reconsideration. I find myself rooting for him to stay, and in a strange way, rooting for the people of Mississippi to win this one. LSU and Florida can circle all they want. I hope he stays right where he is.
I’m not saying I’m ready to book a ticket back or retrace the streets of my childhood. But I can say that I no longer feel the hard line I once drew. Mississippi will probably never be my place, but I can appreciate that it has become someone else’s. And in watching Lane Kiffin settle into the life he has built there, I’ve felt something I never expected.
A softening. A shift. A recognition that even the places we leave can still hold something worthwhile.
So, yes, I’m rooting for him to stay. I’m rooting for Ole Miss to keep its coach. And for the first time in my life, I’m rooting for Mississippi, too.

Free.,New federal student debt rule seen as tool to enforce Trump agenda,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/new-federal-student-debt-rule-seen-tool-enforce-trump-agenda,,"WASHINGTON — A new U.S. Department of Education regulation to narrow eligibility for a key student debt relief program for public service workers has drawn strong opposition from advocates who argue the regulation is an attempt to target organizations whose missions do not align with President Donald Trump’s agenda. Under a final rule slated to take effect in July, employers that participate in “unlawful activities such that they have a substantial illegal purpose” would be excluded from the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which is meant to encourage college graduates to pursue careers in public service.The language of the final rule, which focuses on issues such as gender-affirming care and illegal immigration, has also raised concerns it meant to enforce the Trump administration’s priorities.At least three lawsuits from Democratic attorneys general, cities, labor unions and nonprofit advocacy groups argue that the regulation is overly vague and exceeds the department’s authority. The rule would hurt not only the institutions that benefit from the program, but the public service workers themselves, Winston Berkman-Breen, legal director at the advocacy group Protect Borrowers, told States Newsroom.“It’s not just about the macro effect of whether these organizations, including governments, will be able to do the work they do,” he said. “It’s also the individual financial health and security of borrowers and their households that will be really, really detrimentally affected by this rule, and we’re already sort of seeing that happen.” The organization is representing a coalition of cities, nonprofit advocacy groups and labor unions in one of the lawsuits over the regulation. Here’s a closer look at the policy and what it would mean for borrowers and employers: What is Public Service Loan Forgiveness?Congress created the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, or PSLF, in 2007 via the College Cost Reduction and Access Act to incentivize people to take on public service careers. PSLF forgives the remaining student debt for borrowers after they make 120 qualifying monthly payments while working for an eligible employer. How will the regulation work? The department’s final rule — which stems from a March executive order — is only forward-looking, meaning workers would not lose any credit earned prior to the July 1, 2026, effective date. Under the policy, the Education secretary can determine “by a preponderance of the evidence” that an employer has taken part in “illegal activities such that the organization has a substantial illegal purpose.” Affected employers can either reapply to serve as a qualifying employer after 10 years or try to regain eligibility in a quicker timeframe if they enter into a “corrective action plan” that needs the secretary’s approval. The activities that could disqualify employers, according to the department, include: “Aiding and abetting” illegal immigration or “illegal discrimination”Providing gender-affirming careSupporting terrorism or “engaging in violence for the purpose of obstructing or influencing” federal government policyTrafficking children across states “for purposes of emancipation from their lawful parents”Violating state lawsWhat’s the debate about?Though the administration has framed the rule as an effort to punish “criminal activity,” advocates and Democratic officials see it as a way to target organizations that are not aligned with the administration’s goals.“The bases for the disqualification that are in the final rule for the secretary of Education are pretty clearly just proxies for being engaged in activities that this administration doesn’t agree with or that don’t align with its agenda,” Berkman-Breen said.He pointed to supporting immigrant communities, gender-affirming care, transgender rights, diverse hiring, teaching an accurate portrayal of racial history in this country and the right to peaceful protest as examples. Berkman-Breen said these activities are “very clearly things that this administration in other parts of the government has already attacked in civil society and in the states and local communities, but they’re now bringing that sort of attack into the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.”In response to a request for comment, the department shared a statement from Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent, who said “it is unconscionable that the plaintiffs are standing up for” what he describes as “criminal activity.” “This is a commonsense reform that will stop taxpayer dollars from subsidizing organizations involved in terrorism, child trafficking, and transgender procedures that are doing irreversible harm to children,” he said. “The final rule is crystal clear: the Department will enforce it neutrally, without consideration of the employer’s mission, ideology, or the population they serve.”How will employers be affected? Michele Zampini, associate vice president for federal policy and advocacy at the Institute for College Access & Success, said the final rule will divert nonprofits’ ability to focus on their mission and impede their ability to keep staff on and attract new workers.The final rule “will have the effect of putting a lot of nonprofits doing a lot of really important work in their communities in a defensive position, whether they’re being preemptively defensive to try and avoid running afoul of the administration, or whether they’re already kind of in a position where the administration has identified them as a target,” she said. Zampini, whose group aims to advance affordability, accountability and equity in higher education, added that the program was crucial in attracting talent to service-oriented work. “PSLF is a big part of what ... enables people to take on what may be lower-paying jobs in exchange for being able to manage their debt over time,” she said. “If people don’t have that option, or even if they feel like they don’t have that option or are afraid they won’t have that option, it becomes a lot harder to kind of attract people to those roles.” What legal challenges have come out against the policy? The administration is already facing a handful of lawsuits over the final rule, with critics urging federal courts to vacate the policy and deem it “unlawful.”The challengers include a slew of cities, labor unions and nonprofit advocacy groups who filed suit in a Massachusetts federal court Nov. 3. Another lawsuit was brought the same day in the same federal court from Democratic attorneys general in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington state and Wisconsin. Four nonprofit advocacy groups also filed a suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Nov. 4 against the administration over the rule.",,,,2025-11-21 12:57:20.887893

in a 181-page opinion issued Thursday evening, the three-judge panel dismissed claims brought by the North Carolina NAACP, Common Cause, and individual voters against districts used in the 2024 election 
In those lawsuits, which were brought in 2023, plaintiffs claimed that congressional and state Senate districts in the Piedmont, Mecklenburg County, and eastern counties were drawn to dilute the power of Black voters. 
Republican legislators said they did not use racial data in creating the districts. 
The judges, all Republican appointees, held a six-day trial last summer. Their opinion said Republican map-drawers “did not act with discriminatory purpose,” and that opponents failed to prove any of their claims. 
“After considering all the evidence, we find that Plaintiffs have failed to prove that the North Carolina General Assembly drew state Senate or federal congressional districts with the discriminatory purpose of minimizing or canceling out the voting potential of black North Carolinians. The racial data necessary to execute such a discriminatory purpose was not used in drafting the 2023 Senate or congressional plans,” the judges wrote. 
“The circumstances surrounding the plans’ enactment and the resulting district configurations and composition are consistent with the General Assembly’s non-racial motivations, which included traditional districting criteria, North Carolina law, and partisan performance,” the opinion continued.
The judges did not rule on the claims against the newly drawn 1st Congressional District, which Republicans reconfigured last month in order to elect another GOP member of the U.S. House. A hearing on those claims was held Wednesday.

Also of note

Former state legislator and first Black Political Director of the Michigan Democratic Party Fred Durhal Jr. passed away late Wednesday, prompting incoming Detroit Mayor Mary Sheffield to eulogize Durhal, saying she was “deeply saddened” by the passing of a “remarkable leader and tireless advocate for Detroiters.”
Among the many messages of remembrance and condolence, was a statement from Curtis Hertel, chair of the Michigan Democratic Party.
“Fred Durhal Jr. is a giant of Michigan politics, and his impact on the city of Detroit and the entire state of Michigan will be felt for generations to come. He was a state House representative, the Chairman of the Michigan Legislative Black Caucus, and the first Black Political Director of the Michigan Democratic Party. As a state legislator, when Detroit was in bankruptcy, Durhal fought to protect pensions for city workers—saving countless families from poverty in one of the city’s darkest chapters,” Hertel said. “Throughout his entire life, Fred Durhal Jr. was a fighter, dedicating his life to helping others through public service. His loss is felt deeply by this party and across the state, and our thoughts are with his children and grandchildren.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Advance-at-a-glance-political-roundup-v2-1024x662.png,,,2025-11-21 12:57:20.887893

William Dickens, a member of the Raleigh chapter of American Descendants of Slavery, doesn’t think Black people should get involved. Dickens said he doesn’t recall Latinos supporting Black people during their struggles.
“People just try to turn us into the mule for everybody, while at the same time, we’re suffering, we’re drowning,” Dickens said. “Who’s supporting us?”
American Descendants of Slavery is an Atlanta-based grassroots group that, among other things, advocates for reparations for the descendants of slaves. Dickens said he isn’t speaking for the organization.
Dickens noted Trump made gains with Latino voters in the 2024 presidential election. According to the Pew Research Center, Trump garnered 48% of the Latino vote compared to Kamala Harris’ 51% share. Trump won 36% of the Latino vote in the 2020 presidential election.
“They [Latinos] voted for him and now they get what they get,” Dickens said, a sentiment also shared by other Black people across various social media platforms.
Dickens said Black men are harmed most by illegal and legal immigration. They lose out in the competition for jobs, which also keeps their wages lower than they should be, he said. 
“So, what you’re looking at is a direct impact of immigration, leaving us jobless, homeless, leading to us going to prison,” Dickens said.
But other Black people see Latinos as allies who must be supported. In Durham, for example, the Union of Southern Service Workers has been a staunch supporter of Latino causes and present at recent immigration protests.
“In the Union of Southern Service Workers, we know that joy and solidarity is the best antidote against fear and division,” Mama Cookie Bradley, a union member, said in a statement. “We stand united with working people and communities across North Carolina in declaring that there is absolutely no emergency that justifies the presence of federal immigration forces in Durham.”

Jovita Lee, a program director for the NC Black Alliance, said whether Black people know it or not, they should be concerned about what’s happening to Latinos in North Carolina and across the country.
The Alliance is opposed to federal immigration agents being in North Carolina as part of Trump’s mass deportation efforts, Lee said.
“I won’t decide if folks are right or wrong in regard to their personal opinion [about immigration], but I will speak to fact – and the fact of the matter is these practices are indeed harming both brown communities and Black communities,” Lee said. 
She compared immigration agents to “slave patrols” in the antebellum South that had the authority to stop and question enslaved people and to search homes without warrants.
“This narrative around that it has nothing to do with us, I would disagree with,” Lee said. “The discriminatory practices and the racism that it is rooted in is very reminiscent of what we saw in our own history.” 
While President Trump initially said federal agents would target the “worst of the worst” undocumented immigrants, including violent criminals and gang members,  Lee said the administration can’t be trusted to “stick to the script.”
“Folks are being picked up or identified strictly based on appearance, color of skin, how they may look, how their accent may sound, and that is absolutely rooted in discrimination,” Lee said. 
Some African Americans are likely sitting out protests out of fear of being mistaken for a Black immigrant, Lee said. And historically, African Americans and Black immigrants have viewed immigration differently, she said.
“I think all of that is kind of influencing that opinion that some Black Americans may have when it comes to immigration not being a topic they want to engage or talk about,” Lee said.

Floyd McKissick is a former state senator who now chairs the Durham Committee on the Affairs of Black People, an influential political action committee and advocacy group. McKissick said the committee has not met since federal agents arrived in North Carolina, but any member could bring it up at next month’s meeting.
“I think that to the extent to which organizations want to become involved as allies …  today, it may be Latinos, tomorrow it may be African Americans,” McKissick said. “You know, who’s going to be next on the hit list?”
The committee, he said, is concerned about the “totality of the tone of the current administration” and the divisiveness occurring in the country as a result of it. 
“It’s exacerbating fears and prejudices, rather than bringing people together,” McKissick said. “We might not have a dog in this particular fight, but this fight is part of a total messaging that’s going on that’s not positive, and it’s something that we should be deeply concerned about.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4648-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-21 11:57:22.380779

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)After a week of swatting attempts on his colleagues, GOP Sen. Andy Zay on Friday confirmed a bomb threat at his vehicle rental business.
“Yesterday, my business in Huntington was targeted with a bomb threat, which is part of the recent troubling pattern against lawmakers in Indiana,” he said in a news release.
“It’s unfortunate that my family and I continue to be threatened for my work as a public servant and state senator,” Zay continued. “This is no way to weigh in on any public issue, even if you do not agree with my stance. My office is always open, and I encourage constituents with any concerns to reach out.”
Zay is supportive of a controversial proposal to redistrict Indiana’s congressional boundaries — and make Indiana’s two blue districts red — ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
Four fellow Senate Republican caucus members have been targeted in attempted swattings this week, with another reporting unspecified “violent threats,” but they are all against redistricting or are undecided.
“Swatting” involves hoax calls or reports to emergency services intended to trigger armed responses — and can have lethal consequences for unwitting victims at the swatted location.
“I want to be clear: I strongly condemn these acts, which have no place in our political process,” Zay said. “While the intent behind these intimidation threats seems to be to instill fear in public officials, I can assure my constituents that I remain committed to serving our district, being your voice and continuing my work at the Statehouse.”
The Indiana State Police is investigating the string of incidents.
Zay thanked police and said, “I am hopeful that state and local law enforcement will be able to find those responsible and hold them accountable for their actions.”

(Andrew Fraieli for Colorado Newsline)A new poll of Colorado voters found that nearly three-fourths of Coloradans think the political situation in the U.S. is in crisis, and almost two-in-three voters in the state think political violence will worsen over the next few years. 
The Colorado Polling Institute asked 622 voters likely to participate in the 2026 election where they stand on politics in the state and nationally, with an oversample of Hispanic voters. They were asked about specific elected officials from Colorado, affordability and spending, immigration, health care, President Donald Trump and the Republican and Democratic parties. 
Aspect Strategic, a Democratic political firm, worked with New Bridge Strategy, a Republican political firm, to conduct the poll between Nov. 1 and Nov. 5, when the federal government was still in the midst of its record-breaking shutdown. The margin of error is 3.95% for the overall sample and 6.38% for the Hispanic sample.

Democrats and unaffiliated voters in Colorado were significantly more likely to have said the state of politics in the U.S. is in crisis, with 84% of Democrats saying so and 78% of independent voters saying so, while 49% of Republicans said so. 
(Colorado Polling Institute)
Just under half of the respondents, 47%, think Colorado is headed in the right direction, and those who think the state is going in the wrong direction, 44% of respondents, think so more intensely, Lori Weigel with New Bridge Strategy said. While only 7% of those who think the state is going in the right direction say it definitely is, 28% of those who say it is going in the wrong direction say it definitely is. 
Democrats are more likely to think the state is going in the right direction while Republicans are more likely to think it is going in the wrong direction. Democrats control all statewide elected offices in Colorado and have majorities in both chambers of the Colorado Legislature. 
Concerns about immigration, cost of living and housing affordability are the top issues voters said they want the state government to address, followed by homelessness, health care and mental health, and schools and education. 
The majority of respondents also have concerns about the state budget or believe it is in crisis, with fewer people saying the budget is in good shape than in a March poll CPI conducted. Most respondents think the economy in Colorado will get worse over the next year.
Consumer spending
More Coloradans cut spending on non-essential items over the last year compared to voters nationally, which CPI determined by asking a question used in a national poll Quinnipiac University conducted in September. In Colorado, 61% of respondents said they have cut spending compared to 42% nationally. 
(Colorado Polling Institute)
“It’s a notable distinction from where the American electorate is right now in terms of that perception,” Weigel said. “And it could be that some of the higher cost of living, cost of housing, all those related things might be bearing a little more of a burden here in Colorado.”
Favorability of state officials including Gov. Jared Polis and U.S. Sens. John Hickenlooper and Michael Bennet has decreased slightly since CPI’s poll in March. While 51% of voters found Polis favorable in March, 45% did in the November survey. For Hickenlooper, a Democrat, 49% found him favorable in March, while 43% found him favorable in November. In March, 45% of voters found Bennet, also a Democrat, favorable, while 41% found him favorable in November. 
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, who is running against Bennet in the Democratic primary for governor in 2026, has less name recognition among Democrats but slightly higher favorability. Among Democrats, Bennet has a 3-to-1 favorability ratio while Weiser has a 4-to-1 favorability ratio. 
National politics
Colorado voters’ opinions on Trump have not changed much since a March poll: 58% of voters said they had an unfavorable opinion of him then while with 59% say so now. Of the Hispanic oversample, 66% view Trump negatively, Kevin Ingham of Aspect Strategic said. 
Almost three quarters of Coloradans think Congress should extend Affordable Care Act tax credits for people who purchase health insurance through the individual marketplace, on par with what voters nationally said in a September KFF poll. Extending the tax credits was a primary point of debate around the shutdown, as most Democrats refused to vote for a funding package that did not extend the credits. The average increase in Colorado for ACA consumers is estimated to be 170% when the credits expire this year. Democrats are more likely to support extending the tax credits, while more Republicans support letting the credits expire. 
(Colorado Polling Institute)
A majority of Colorado voters, 54%, said the Trump administration is going too far on deporting immigrants. Of the Hispanic voters polled, 59% said Trump has gone too far. A quarter of Coloradans think the administration’s immigration enforcement is about right, and 19% say it hasn’t gone far enough. 
Half of all voters think local law enforcement should be allowed to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement, while 37% of Hispanic voters think so. A Colorado law prohibits local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration operations.  
Hispanic voters were nearly twice as likely to know someone who has been detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement — 8% of all voters know someone, while 14% of Hispanic voters do. The poll also asked if respondents have seen ICE in their community or have heard of ICE presence even if they haven’t seen them personally. Thirteen percent of Colorado voters have seen ICE, while 15% of Hispanic voters have. More than half of respondents, 55%, said they have heard about ICE in their community but haven’t seen its presence, while 47% of Hispanic voters have. 
“Voters do have some concerns about how ICE is behaving. When we ask, 64% of all Coloradans and 73% of Hispanic voters were concerned that ICE was detaining people who should not be detained,” Ingham said. “And those concerns were quite intense, because half of all Coloradans and 56% of Hispanic voters said that they were very concerned about this.”

(Courtesy of Union Omaha)OMAHA — Union Omaha soccer and the City of Omaha are planning to build a 6,500-seat sports stadium to anchor a new 20-acre mixed-use entertainment and housing district in the downtown of Nebraska’s biggest city.
The campus — proposed to rise on a largely unused area north of Cuming Street, near where the College World Series is played — comes after an earlier downtown site fell through for the state’s first and only professional soccer club.  
As planned, the City of Omaha would own the estimated $140 million open-air stadium on the tract of land east of the Millwork Commons area and is in the process of buying the land from Union Pacific Railroad.

Financial and other details are contingent on various city and state approvals. The first step is securing the property, said Deputy City Attorney Jennifer Taylor. A land purchase agreement is on the City Council agenda for Tuesday. 
But progress of the project also could hinge on the city and soccer club’s ability to access a bottlenecked state incentive for sports complexes that requires approval from Gov. Jim Pillen.
 24-7-365 village

Union Omaha officials foresee a 24-hour village with an estimated 500 residences occupied in part by athletes. Shops, dining and offices would surround the sports complex that also would be home to a new women’s soccer team and feature various community and sporting events.
“It’s been a long and winding circular road, but we’re very happy,” said Larry Botel of Alliance Sports, which owns Union Soccer. He anticipates up to $400 million in development on the 20 acres, beyond the stadium investment.
If all goes as hoped, construction would start next year, and Union Soccer would be playing at its new home stadium in the 2028 season. 
For its upcoming 2026 season, the two-time USL League One champions will play at Creighton University’s Morrison Stadium in downtown Omaha.
Botel described the new soccer stadium campus — along with nearby Charles Schwab Field of the men’s College World Series and the CHI Health Center arena and convention center — as a stadium district.

“They’re all within a 10-minute walk of each other,” he said “We’re going to be sharing amenities like parking and things like that. It’s all coming together to create a very robust stadium district for the city — it’s exciting.”
The plan has been evolving for about a year, Botel said, after the earlier site became financially unfeasible. He said the venture would be funded by both private and public dollars.
At least one difference in the current plan is a larger role by the city, which would own the sports facility. It would have 6,500 fixed seats, with overall capacity reaching about 8,500 fans who could also be in the berm and standing-room spaces. The estimated $140 million includes infrastructure costs as well.
 Potential headwinds

One source of anticipated funding to assist with construction expenses would be the “turnback” state sales tax revenue available through the Sports Arena Facility Financing Assistance Act, he said.
Tax-increment financing also will be requested, as well as an occupation tax and possibly direct city financing using tools such as capital improvement dollars, according to a statement from the city and Union Omaha.
Omaha Mayor John Ewing called the vision “huge” and said it would be a draw for jobs and urban living.
“The stadium and surrounding district would offer another reason to live, work and play downtown, strengthening our urban core,” he said. “It demonstrates what’s possible when public and private partners share a vision for growth that benefits the entire community.”
Heath Mello, president and CEO of the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce, called the project “catalytic.”
“It adds energy to our urban core, helps recruit and retain the workforce of the future and creates a professional sport destination that strengthens Omaha’s competitiveness with other growing U.S. cities.”
The plans come to light on the heels of statements by Pillen, who has been skeptical about the use of a turnback tax via the Sports Arena Facilities Financing Assistance Act.
Under the related law, for an applicant to tap into the incentive, the governor has to be among a majority vote of the SAFFAA board. He said he would not consider approval of any project until next June. 
“I stand with Nebraska taxpayers, and against more special interest carveouts to our sales tax base when the Legislature has not yet closed the loopholes necessary to deliver lasting and transformative property tax relief to Nebraska homeowners, farmers and ranchers,” he reiterated Friday on social media.
This is a developing story.

(Photo by Amanda Brown for New Jersey Monitor)The special election for Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill’s vacant seat in the House will take place April 16, the governor announced Friday. 
Gov. Phil Murphy (D) issued a writ of election to fill Sherrill’s House vacancy after her resignation from Congress went into effect at 11:59 p.m. Thursday. Sherrill (D) becomes governor on Jan. 20.
Murphy directed that a special primary election be held on Thursday, Feb. 5. The deadline for primary candidates to file nominating petitions is Monday, Dec. 1, at 4 p.m.
Democrats jockey to replace Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill in Congress

The race to succeed Sherrill in the House is already a crowded one. At least 10 Democrats and one Republican have already announced campaigns, including Essex County Commissioner Brendan Gill, former Rep. Tom Malinowski, and Lt. Gov. Tahesha Way. 
The person elected by voters on Thursday, April 16, will fill out the remainder of Sherrill’s current term, which ends Jan. 3, 2027.
The 11th Congressional District includes parts of Essex, Morris, and Passaic counties.
In-person early voting for the special primary will run from Jan. 29 through Feb. 3, and for the special general election from April 6 through April 14.
National Republican Congressional Committee spokeswoman Maureen O’Toole blasted Murphy’s special election timeline as “blatant political corruption designed to protect Democratic insiders and silence voters.” 
“By setting a ballot deadline to just after the Thanksgiving holiday, he’s denying access for anyone outside the political machine to qualify and give voters a real choice at the ballot box,” she said in a statement Friday.
Sherrill, who will be New Jersey’s 57th governor, defeated Republican Jack Ciattarelli by a 14-point margin in the gubernatorial race earlier this month.

Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 30 into law Oct. 2, immediately legalizing the year-round sale of E15 in California. (Stock photo via Getty Images)Farm state politicians have been trying for more than a decade to pass legislation that would allow E15 — gasoline containing 15% ethanol — to be sold year-round across the country. While E15 can be sold from Sept. 15 to June 1 each year, an antiquated glitch in the Environmental Protection Agency’s fuel regulations prevents gas stations from offering it each summer when America’s roadways are the busiest.
When I served in Congress, we got close and for his part, President Donald Trump tried to use administrative powers to remove that glitch during his first term in 2019. But, threatened by the competition of more ethanol, oil refiners sued to stop Trump — and they won. The courts found that only Congress can permanently remove the summertime E15 barrier.
So, with the 2025 congressional calendar ticking away, year-round E15 remains stuck in the mud and Big Oil’s ethanol barricade remains in place. Meanwhile, corn farmers are harvesting the largest-ever crop in history, corn prices are plummeting, farm bankruptcies are on the rise, and grain is piling up across the Midwest. Year-round E15 would provide an immediate demand boost and brighten the otherwise grim prospects in farm country.
E15 typically sells for 10-30 cents less per gallon than regular gasoline, meaning the summertime barrier prevents consumers from accessing a lower-cost, cleaner-burning option that includes a higher content of American-made fuel.
But here is the ironic twist. On Oct. 2, with the stroke of a pen, California Gov. Gavin Newsom did what President Trump and Midwest lawmakers haven’t been able to do. He signed Assembly Bill 30 into law, immediately legalizing the year-round sale of E15 in California, the nation’s second-largest gasoline market.
In signing the bill, Newsom stated, “While we continue the critical work to stabilize our state’s fuel market, we’re cutting red tape to provide consumers with more options as we continue our transition to cleaner transportation.” He also cited a recent study by the University of California, Berkeley and the United States Naval Academy, showing E15 “could lower gasoline prices by up to $0.20 per gallon and save Californians as much as $2.7 billion annually.”
Because California has its own unique gasoline specifications, the seemingly immovable EPA summertime barrier that bedevils states across the country simply doesn’t apply in the Golden State. California retailers can now sell E15 fuel 365 days a year.
Newsom’s move to allow year-round E15 could boost demand for ethanol by 600 million gallons, providing a sorely needed increase in corn demand. If California gas stations adopt E15 statewide, over 200 million bushels of additional corn — equivalent to the entire annual corn crop in Texas or Kentucky — will be needed to satisfy the new demand.
Adding to the intrigue is the fact that Trump and Republican lawmakers continue to promote the idea that Newsom and California have “waged war on liquid fuels.” Yet, the allowance to sell E15 year-round in the state would cement California as the single largest market for corn ethanol in the country.
All of this leads to some natural questions. Are Trump, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and GOP lawmakers really trying hard enough to secure year-round E15 and open new markets for farmers? If California, the bastion of electric vehicles, can get it done, why can’t our leaders in Washington? If the president and his fellow Republicans want to “Make America Great Again” doesn’t that start with supporting American workers and helping all Americans save money?
While farmers are caught in Trump’s trade war, the president and Republican lawmakers appear headed for yet another round of bailout payments, rather than creating new demand opportunities for our nation’s corn and soybean growers. If they really want to help America’s farmers, they should simply follow California’s lead and do whatever it takes to allow year-round, nationwide E15 sales as quickly as possible.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/biofuelnozzle-1024x673.jpg,,,2025-11-21 11:57:22.380779

Filing in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan, the groups Beyond Nuclear, Don’t Waste Michigan, and Michigan Safe Energy Future argue that the plant, which was previously under decommissioning status, is legally barred from resuming operations. 
By granting Holtec an exemption from those regulations the three groups argue the commission violated the Atomic Energy Act, the Administrative Procedure Act and the commission’s own regulations. They asked the court to find the commission’s decision in violation of the law, and to bar the commission from approving Holtec’s exemption request.
“This lawsuit alleges that the [commission] and Holtec didn’t just bend the regulations. They both broke the law to resurrect a reactor that was fifty plus years old, poorly maintained and could not compete in the open market. Palisades is not needed, way too expensive even with massive public subsidies, and unsafe,” Wallace Taylor, co-counsel for the groups bringing the suit said.
Prema Chandrathil, a public affairs officer for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said the body does not comment on ongoing litigation.
However, Chandrathil reiterated that the commission has been conducting “methodical, thorough and independent reviews of licensing actions and conducting real-time inspections of the plant’s maintenance, testing and repairs of systems and components required for plant startup.”
“The plant can only startup when this work is completed and the [commission] determines that plant systems, components and programs meet federal requirements,” Chandrathil said. 
While the organizations filing the suit have raised several concerns about the conditions of the plant and the safety of a restart, Patrick O’Brien, Holtec’s director of government affairs and communications, said the commission’s approval to reauthorize operations at the plant “followed a rigorous, independent review under the agency’s existing regulatory framework.” 
“As we move toward the plant’s historic restart, our top priority is ensuring the plant is prepared to return to long-term safe and reliable generation,” O’Brien said.

Davids wants House vote on ACA tax break. Sen. Moran is eager to shield FAA from shutdowns. Rep. Estes strives for CBO transparency.,"U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, D-Kansas, says the U.S. House should vote on legislation to extend tax credits useful to people who secure health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. In this image, Davids speaks during a Feb. 28, 2025, news conference in Kansas City, Kansas. (Photo by Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids of Kansas joined five dozen colleagues requesting a House vote on legislation extending federal tax credits set to expire at the end of December that were implemented to moderate Affordable Care Act insurance costs.
In the letter signed by 59 lawmakers and sent to House Speaker Mike Johnson, the coalition said a bill preserving the tax credit would allow more than 24 million Americans in the ACA to avoid substantial premium increases in 2026. Sky-high premiums could prompt as many as 4 million people to drop health coverage.
Davids said 160,000 Kansans relied on federal tax credits last year to save an average of $700 annually on health care premiums.
“Families in Kansas and across the country are staring down massive health care price hikes because Congress hasn’t done its job,” said Davids, the Democrat representing the 3rd District in the Kansas City area. “Republican leadership in the Senate has already promised a vote to extend ACA tax credits. There is no excuse for the House to stall any longer.”
Davids said a bipartisan majority in the House support action to mitigate rising health care costs. While Democrats have sought a tax-credit extension, Republicans complained the credits were costly to the government and helped boost insurance company profits. The Congressional Budget Office estimated it would cost the $350 billion in the next decade if the subsidy were extended.
“Inaction here will decimate millions of Americans’ budgets and force impossible decisions between receiving necessary care and other basic needs,” the letter said.
 
Moran: Aviation shutdown
U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, chairman of the Senate Aviation, Space and Innovation Subcommittee, said the 43-day government shutdown inhibited operation of the Federal Aviation Administration, caused widespread flight delays and interrupted an estimated $6 billion in travel spending.
Moran convened a Senate hearing to lay the groundwork for legislation capable of shielding the industry during government shutdowns.
“We convened this hearing because of the importance of the aviation and travel industry, a vital component of our nation’s economy,” Moran said. “We must do our part to enable the FAA and the Department of Transportation to make certain that America remains the standard for aviation and air safety.”
In March, the Kansas Republican introduced a bill that would insulate the FAA by making emergency funding available for critical operations and to pay air traffic controllers.
“When Congress fails to act, the FAA and the aviation industry suffer,” Moran said. “The people who work in the airports and in aviation cannot further afford the instability and chaos.”
The U.S. Travel Association reported more than $6 billion in travel spending was lost because of the inability of aircraft to fly as a result of the shutdown.
Moran said he was pleased the problem with flight delays had eased ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. A record 31 million passengers were expected to fly from Nov. 21 to Dec. 1. The busiest days were expected to be Sunday Nov. 30 and Monday Dec. 1.
 
Estes: CBO transparency
U.S. Rep. Ron Estes, a Kansas Republican serving the Wichita area, said transparency and accuracy of the Congressional Budget Office was essential to the federal legislative process.
During a House budget committee hearing, Estes told CBO director Phillip Swagel that reports issued by the office had a dramatic impact on bills in the House and Senate. CBO, which operates as designated budget scorekeeper, influenced public perception of legislation, Estes said.
“We need to make sure that CBO works to improve scores, to actually make sure that they align with reality,” Estes said. “Unfortunately, as we’ve talked about previously in the committee room, CBO sometimes falls short of making those good estimates that help us make decisions.”
Estes said an example was the CBO’s estimate on the 2022 Inflation Adjustment Act, which focused on health care, climate and taxes, and was signed by President Joe Biden. Estes and GOP U.S. Reps. Tracey Mann and Jake LaTurner of Kansas voted against the bill. Davids voted for it.
Estes said the CBO’s initial report said the energy and climate provisions of the bill would cost $391 billion. Credit Suisse concluded the cost was closer to $800 billion, he said.
“My struggle, and I think a lot of our struggle, is that we’re literally making trillion-dollar decisions based on this information, so we want to make sure it’s the best possible,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/250228_davids-p02-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-21 11:57:22.380779

The Missouri National Education Association is seeking to stop the state from distributing more tax dollars to private schools, saying the $50 million appropriation of general revenue to the MOScholars program is illegal.
Currently, the state has used $38.1 million of the $50 million allocated by the legislature for scholarships, according to the deposition of Trent Blair, program manager for the State Treasurer’s Office. 
The MNEA is asking a judge to stop the outflow of the remaining funds and bar the state treasurer from creating new rules for MOScholars that revolve around the use of general revenue.
“The General Assembly has far overstepped its authority and violated five provisions of the Missouri Constitution by using an appropriations bill to construct out of whole cloth a scheme to divert general revenues to what are essentially vouchers for the payment of private school tuition for elementary and secondary school students,”Loretta Haggard, the teacher’s union’s attorney, wrote in a September court filing.
A month prior, Judge Brian Stumpe denied the MNEA’s request to issue a temporary restraining order that would bar the state from using any of the $50 million while the court case plays out. Stumpe did not elaborate on the denial and simultaneously denied the state’s request to dismiss the case.
The MNEA contends the appropriation of general revenue to MOScholars is not authorized in state statute. It frequently cites the 2021 law that set up the MOScholars program, which uses nonprofits as funding administrators.
The law describes the program as donation-based. Donations are eligible for a tax credit equal to 100% of the contribution up to 50% of an individual’s tax burden. But funding MOScholars directly through state revenue, as was done in the fiscal year 2026 budget passed in May, lacks “statutory framework,” Haggard argues.
Missouri teachers union asks judge to freeze private-school-voucher payments

Statutory silence on whether a program can use general revenue does not mean the state is barred from doing so, William Seidleck, principal deputy solicitor general, told Stumpe in August.
“The pertinent question… is not whether the underlying statute allows beyond doubt an appropriation from the treasury — it is instead whether it obviously prohibits the General Assembly’s action,” Seidleck wrote in a September filing.
Joining the defense of the $50 million voucher program is EdChoice, an Indiana-based advocacy group representing three families who say they benefit from the state’s funding of MOScholars. The group’s attorney is Todd Graves, a prominent Kansas City lawyer and chairman of the Herzog Foundation — which has an affiliated nonprofit that is one of six organizations soliciting donations for and administering MOScholars scholarships.
The trial is likely to revolve around the interpretation of state law, with few exhibits and witnesses listed in pre-trial filings.

In the U.S., close to half of families with children 3 and under struggle to purchase diapers. In Connecticut, it would take 38,136,000 diapers each year to fill the diaper gap, according to a study published by the Urban Institute in September. And in the past few months, this “diaper disparity” has only gotten worse.
“The phones are ringing,” Janet Stolfi Alfano, the CEO of The Diaper Bank of Connecticut said. 
According to the Urban Institue, the average monthly cost of diapers for one child is $100. The median American family could only afford to spend $65 per month. 
Alfano, who has worked at the bank since 2007, said the current need in Connecticut is “great.”
“We can’t keep up with the emails and phone calls lately,” Alfano told the CT Mirror in late October. “Over the past few months, it feels as bad as COVID at least.”
November was no different. As families struggled without SNAP benefits during the government shutdown, Alfano said there was a bit of an uptick in need from October.
The Diaper Bank of Connecticut alone distributed 24,139,948 infant and toddler diapers from 2021 through June 30, 2025. But this still wasn’t enough, and Alfano worries the need will just continue to grow as benefits and social services are cut for residents across the nation.
According to the study, the Capitol Region Council of Government is the most vulnerable to the diaper disparity. This region includes Hartford.
Black and Hispanic residents in Connecticut are also disproportionately more likely to experience this need than white residents.
The effects of this disparity go beyond families, the study found. While not having enough diapers can increase a child’s risk for diaper rash or urinary tract infections, it can also force a parent to miss work or school. The National Diaper Bank found that, nationwide, one in four parents missed work or school because they could not afford to purchase diapers.
And personally, parents or caregivers who cannot afford diapers are twice as likely to report feeling depressed, and one in four reported skipping meals to afford diapers. 
Along with the withholding of SNAP funds earlier this month, Alfano said that issues like the recent formula recall can also put a large burden on families. 
“Folks who are already close to the breaking point are there,” Alfano said. “Everyone is trying to piece it together.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/96G4Q-where-are-families-struggling-the-most-to-purchase-diapers--1024x809.png,,,2025-11-21 11:57:22.380779

Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (via U.S. House)U.S. Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick was indicted this week by a grand jury in Miami for allegedly stealing $5 million in federal disaster funds and laundering them toward her 2021 congressional campaign.
Cherfilus-McCormick, D-Miramar, according to a news release from the U.S. Department of Justice, laundered funds from an overpayment from a contract between her family’s health care company and FEMA for COVID-19 vaccination staffing.
According to the indictment, Cherflius-McCormick and other defendants routed the money through several accounts, as well as to friends and relatives, who then donated to her campaign.
“Using disaster relief funds for self-enrichment is a particularly selfish, cynical crime,” said U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in the news release. “No one is above the law, least of all powerful people who rob taxpayers for personal gain. We will follow the facts in this case and deliver justice.”

The DOJ says the representative could face up to 53 years in prison if convicted.
The case is being investigated by the FBI Miami office and the IRS-Criminal Investigation Florida Field Office.
She also, and her tax preparer, were charged with conspiring to file a false federal tax return.
Among the defendants is the representative’s brother, Edwin Cherfilus.
In a social media post, Cherfilus-McCormick called it “an unjust, baseless, sham indictment — and I am innocent. The timing alone is curious and clearly meant to distract from far more pressing national issues.”
Cherfilus-McCormick stepped down from leadership on the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee Thursday.
U.S. Rep. Greg Steube, R-Sarasota, called the alleged behavior “one of the most egregious abuses of public trust I have ever seen.”
“Stealing $5 million in taxpayer disaster funds from FEMA of all places is beyond indefensible. Millions of Floridians have relied on FEMA after devastating hurricanes, and that money was supposed to help real disaster victims,” Steube wrote on social media.

The spending bill now on Gov. Maura Healey’s desk includes language critical to the overhaul of the former Naval Air Station South Weymouth, which supporters say could unlock thousands of units of new housing plus plenty of space for commercial activity on a site that has been mostly idle for nearly 30 years. 
Sen. Patrick O’Connor, a Weymouth Republican whose district includes the property, called the proposal that cleared the Legislature “the last step” necessary to allow development to resume after a series of delays. 
“We feel confident that this is going to be the last time that we’ll have to go to the Legislature and the last time we’re going to have to act on this,” O’Connor told CommonWealth Beacon in an interview before the final vote. “We really have a very reputable development team that the community has bought into, and we just want them to have the runway to start getting to work.” 
The 1,400-acre site, which also reaches into neighboring Rockland and Abington, was first commissioned in 1942. During World War II, it served as the home base for a blimp patrol squadron and assisted with recovering test torpedoes for the US Navy.  
After the war, the base went through several transformations. It stored naval aircraft, offered flight training, and hosted what a town history called a “secretive research and development outfit.” The facility closed in 1997.

Efforts to redevelop the property, which offers ample space for housing just 15 miles south of Boston with access to the MBTA’s commuter rail network, have gone through a series of stops and starts over the past 15 years with several different developers and changes in ownership.  
A proposal to build a megamall was shot down. An earlier attempt at extensive mixed-use development under developer LNR collapsed during the 2008 Great Recession. In 2013, Connecticut-based Starwood Property Trust purchased LNR, and in the following years, another company called LStar bought the site, then ran into financial trouble and sold off parcels of the land to different owners. 
 At that point, O’Connor said, the project “looked like a really complicated puzzle” with “five different landowners” who each had separate interests.  
“I’ve been working on this project for almost 20 years, and every time that we get momentum, something crazy happens, like the financial crisis of 2008,” said O’Connor, who also served on the Weymouth Town Council before joining the Legislature. 
The outlook has improved over the past half-decade. Global investment firm Brookfield Properties became the master developer in 2020, responsible for managing the overall vision of the project, and a series of agreements have once again tied the parcels together. 
But project leaders say Beacon Hill needs to get involved because the state law that created the Southfield Redevelopment Authority to oversee the project is still based on prior zoning and planning that predates the most recent changes. 
O’Connor said the language tacked onto the Legislature’s fiscal year 2025 closeout budget would formally “combine all those properties” and bring the project into alignment with the most recent zoning plan approved by the three towns. 
Some construction has taken place, erecting about 1,000 housing units on one corner of the parcel, but locals expect that a full project could provide up to 6,000 units and millions of square feet of commercial space.

O’Connor said New England Development, a Boston-based real estate development firm plans to lead the on-the-ground work with financing from Brookfield. 
It’s been a personal project for House Speaker Ron Mariano of Quincy, whose district includes the base.  
“The language included in the supplemental budget is a meaningful step towards realizing the decades-long goal of revitalizing a community through the development of thousands of new units of housing, and through the creation of commercial and recreational space, that will benefit the residents of Weymouth, Abington and Rockland,” Mariano said in a statement to CommonWealth Beacon. “As a lack of housing continues to drive folks out of Massachusetts, this project is a blueprint for how the Commonwealth can address the housing crisis head on and bolster economic development at the same time.” 
Although O’Connor is optimistic the bill will achieve development liftoff, there’s still one more major to-do looming on the horizon: access to water. 
One of the chief issues impacting plans over the year has been the lack of a permanent water source to the site. There’s enough water availability right now to start the project, according to O’Connor, but in the long term, he expects the only viable solution is to add Weymouth and potentially its neighbors to the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority network. 
Last year, the House sought to provide $1 billion toward expansion of the MWRA — which provides sewers but not water to Weymouth — as part of a housing bond bill, but the measure did not survive negotiations with the Senate. 
In August, the Healey administration awarded a $32 million infrastructure grant to Weymouth to cover costs of water, sewer, and roads at the base. The funding got rave reviews from locals, with Weymouth Council President Michael Molisse calling it a “major milestone.” 
Healey dubbed the proposed redevelopment “game-changing” in a press release 
O’Connor said the state grant will allow both the town and the base to get “ready for the potential expansion of the MWRA.” But he stressed that more action will be needed down the line. 
“At some point in this development, it will stall if the MWRA is not brought in there, because there is no other permanent water source,” O’Connor said. “We’ve explored almost every single option, and really, there’s nothing outside of MWRA that would be feasible at that site.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/weymouthtower-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C705&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-21 10:58:25.743795

Trump and some Republicans argue that the limited regulations already enacted by states, and others that might follow, will dampen innovation and growth for the technology.
Critics from both political parties — as well as civil liberties and consumer rights groups — worry that banning state regulation would amount to a favor for big AI companies who enjoy little to no oversight.
While the draft executive order could change, here’s what to know about states’ AI regulations and what Trump is proposing.
What state-level regulations exist and why
Four states — Colorado, California, Utah and Texas — have passed laws that set some rules for AI across the private sector, according to the International Association of Privacy Professionals.
Those laws include limiting the collection of certain personal information and requiring more transparency from companies.
The laws are in response to AI that already pervades everyday life. The technology helps make consequential decisions for Americans, including who gets a job interview, an apartment lease, a home loan and even certain medical care. But research has shown that it can make mistakes in those decisions, including by prioritizing a particular gender or race.
“It’s not a matter of AI makes mistakes and humans never do,” said Calli Schroeder, director of the AI & Human Rights Program at the public interest group EPIC.
“With a human, I can say, ‘Hey, explain, how did you come to that conclusion, what factors did you consider?’” she continued. “With an AI, I can’t ask any of that, and I can’t find that out. And frankly, half the time the programmers of the AI couldn’t answer that question.”
States’ more ambitious AI regulation proposals require private companies to provide transparency and assess the possible risks of discrimination from their AI programs.
Beyond those more sweeping rules, many states have regulated parts of AI: barring the use of deepfakes in elections and to create nonconsensual porn, for example, or putting rules in place around the government’s own use of AI.
What Trump and some Republicans want to do
The draft executive order would direct federal agencies to identify burdensome state AI regulations and pressure states to not enact them, including by withholding federal funding or challenging the state laws in court.
It would also begin a process to develop a lighter-touch regulatory framework for the whole country that would override state AI laws.
Trump’s argument is that the patchwork of regulations across 50 states impedes AI companies’ growth, and allows China to catch up to the U.S. in the AI race. The president has also said state regulations are producing “Woke AI.”
The draft executive order that was leaked could change and should not be taken as final, said a senior Trump administration official who requested anonymity to describe internal White House discussions.
The official said the tentative plan is for Trump to sign the order Friday.
Separately, House Republican leadership is already discussing a proposal to temporarily block states from regulating AI, the chamber’s majority leader, Steve Scalise, told Punchbowl News this week.
It’s yet unclear what that proposal would look like, or which AI regulations it would override.
TechNet, which advocates for tech companies including Google and Amazon, has previously argued that pausing state regulations would benefit smaller AI companies still getting on their feet and allow time for lawmakers develop a country-wide regulatory framework that “balances innovation with accountability.”
Why attempts at federal regulation have failed
Some Republicans in Congress have previously tried and failed to ban states from regulating AI.
Part of the challenge is that opposition is coming from their party’s own ranks.
Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, said a federal law barring state regulation of AI was “Not acceptable” in a post on X this week.
DeSantis argued that the move would be a “subsidy to Big Tech” and would stop states from protecting against a list of things, including “predatory applications that target children” and “online censorship of political speech.”
A federal ban on states regulating AI is also unpopular, said Cody Venzke, senior policy council at the ACLU’s National Political Advocacy Department.
“The American people do not want AI to be discriminatory, to be unsafe, to be hallucinatory,” he said. “So I don’t think anyone is interested in winning the AI race if it means AI that is not trustworthy.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP25113797609746-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-21 10:58:25.743795

A Lombardo-Ford contest, in keeping with Nevada gubernatorial campaign tradition, promises precious little in the way of a policy debate. Instead, each campaign — again, keeping with tradition — can be expected to spend most of their campaign war chests puffing up micro-scandals (that by the way have nothing to do with lowering the cost of anything) so as to cast the other as History’s Greatest Monster, a stinky poophead, etc. 
And neither have begun spending much money doing that yet.
In other words, early days.
But one noteworthy result in the survey finds Lombardo ever so slightly upside down — 34% approval, 36% disapproval, and 30% in the “neutral or no opinion” camp.
On the one hand, roughly a third of those surveyed neither approving nor disapproving of the governor sort of makes sense, because neither Lombardo’s achievements (given more time and application I’m sure I could think of one) nor his blunders (like the recent epic floperoo of a special legislative session ha ha) have attracted the attention of casual voters.
On the other hand — but relatedly — barring salacious scandals or inescapable crises like a pandemic, for most people, governors are rather out of sight and out of mind. Governors tend to enjoy positive approval ratings nationwide if for no other reason than when when asked if they approve of their governor, many polling respondents say yes, even though what they might really mean is “Governor? Yeah, I guess there should probably be one.”
So if the poll’s accurate and more Nevada voters disapprove of Lombardo than approve of him, it probably doesn’t reflect the considered judgment of a citizenry who have been carefully tracking Lombardo’s performance and know his chief accomplishment as governor is not actually accomplishing anything, but setting veto records. 
Rather, Lombardo’s disapproval rating could just signify the default sentiment of owly contemporary voters toward elected officials: they all suck.
It could also reflect that Lombardo has an “R” after his name, which means his neck is adorned with an albatross by the name of Trump; 39% of Nevada voters surveyed approve of Trump, 54% don’t.
As attorney general, Ford’s public profile is even more obscure than Lombardo’s. That’s why it’s quite unfortunate the Emerson poll did not also pit Lombardo against Alexis Hill, the Washoe County Commission chair who is challenging Ford in the Democratic primary. 
Yes, Hill’s profile is even lower than Ford’s. But it wouldn’t be surprising if she, or virtually any lightly known Democrat, performed as well in a poll a year out from the election as Ford does. Lombardo vs. virtually anyone not named Lombardo might also be a dead heat right now.
Emerson is also assuming Ford is the likely Democratic nominee. True, almost immediately after announcing his candidacy, Ford was endorsed by all five Democrats in Nevada’s congressional delegation and nearly every Democrat in the state Legislature. 
At the time it seemed one point of the mass endorsements was to yell “don’t even think about it” at former Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak, who had been publicly mulling a candidacy. 
The endorsements also seemed to assume that other than Sisolak, no other viable Democratic candidate for governor was on the horizon.
That assumption, like the one Emerson evidently made when excluding Hill from its poll, might turn out to be right.
It also might prove to be premature.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/governor-office-sign-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-21 10:58:25.743795

As plans and announcements for new AI data centers proliferate across Michigan, a Howell Township trustee is telling people that the parent company for Facebook and Instagram is behind another project planned on more than 1,000 acres of agricultural land.
Bob Wilson, a member of the Howell Township Board of Trustees, confirmed with Michigan Advance on Thursday that Meta was pushing the project. But Wilson said he and members of the board have known about the development for months now. 
Messages seeking comment from Meta’s public affairs and press office were not returned at the time of publication.
In September, Wilson took to Facebook, ironically, to say that he was one of several people in the Howell area who took a bus to New Albany, Ohio, to tour the community, which has become a hotspot for data centers, the Livingston Post reported. 
Meta has a data center in New Albany, Ohio.
Wilson said then that he believed a Meta data center could possibly land at the facility when completed with a $9 billion investment. It was his estimation that the center, if approved, would take up at least 20% of the 1,000-acre space with the remaining space for the data center.
On Wednesday, the Livingston County Planning Commission heard from locals about a decision to rezone the farm land to build the data center. The commission ultimately rejected the project and recommended that the Howell Township Board of Trustees reject the project, as well.
The board met Thursday evening to discuss the project and unanimously voted in favor of a six-month moratorium on data center applications. However, members of the group Stop the Data Centers Livingston County say that the moratorium as passed does not apply to the current developer and that a December 8 meeting of the Howell Township board will decide that project.
Local governments should serve residents, not corporations. Data centers do the opposite.

“The public overwhelmingly asked for a moratorium on rezoning applications to pause the current data center proposal. Instead, the attorney drafted a moratorium that only applies to site plan applications, a completely different stage in the process,” Breanne Green, one of the group’s leaders, told the Advance. “Because of that narrow definition, the moratorium does not apply to the developer’s rezoning request. The developer is still allowed to move forward, and the Township Board can still approve the rezoning next month. This means the most consequential decision — whether to rezone hundreds of acres for a hyperscale data center — is not paused.”
Green noted that Trustee Tim Boal made a motion to expand the moratorium to include rezoning approvals, which she says would have aligned with the community’s request. However, Green said no one seconded his motion and it died without discussion.
“Technically, if the rezoning is approved, later steps such as site plans would be on hold under the moratorium — but the critical gateway decision remains fully open. In practice, residents asked for a hard pause across the board, and the board delivered the opposite. There is also concern that if the Township later amends its ordinances to require data centers to be located in Industrial zoning (as many communities do), developers could pursue legal action if they’ve already secured rezoning under the current rules. In short: the moratorium does not pause the current project. It only delays later stages, not the rezoning decision the public is most concerned about,” Green said.
MLive also reported Thursday that Wilson confirmed Meta was behind the project. Wilson further told MLive that he met with a Meta “land crew” both in person and over a Zoom call, and that they didn’t hide the ball that they worked for Meta.

In an interview with the Advance, Wilson said that it was possible the developer on the project would build the center and then sell it to a third-party, like Meta or others exploring AI, much like Google.

The incident happened when Mark Avent of Escondido, Calif.,  was helping build out the cultivation and manufacturing facility at 5401 Bulwer Ave. in St. Louis, which is owned by Blue Arrow Missouri LLC. 
Blue Arrow hired Avent in 2022 through a one-year, $100,000 contract to procure the necessary equipment to grow and manufacture marijuana products and train employees on the machines. 
During that time, a lab technician accidentally mishandled a commercial vacuum which was used to clean the lab equipment. The vacuum blew fine marijuana dust particles into the air, and Avent suffered a severe asthma attack that led to a heart attack.
The jury unanimously found that Blue Arrow was at fault for 85% of Avent’s injuries, and Avent carried 15% of the fault. 
“We’re very pleased with the verdict,” said William Meehan, Avent’s attorney. “We think that the jury was very perceptive and that they realized my client had life-threatening, life-altering injuries and that he’s never going to be the same.” 
Blue Arrow’s attorneys had argued that Avent was partially responsible because he wasn’t wearing a mask even though he knew he had issues with asthma.
“Mr. Avent was a highly intelligent, highly skilled individual who knew how to set up new labs,” said David Simmons, Blue Arrow’s attorney, in his closing argument Thursday. “And he also knew how to protect himself.”
During the trial, one cannabis expert said the only mask that could have protected Avent from the amount of fine dust particles blown into the air that day was an industrial face respirator, not a surgical mask. 
Lisa Avent, Mark’s wife, said the jury may have missed the significance in the difference in types of masks necessary to prevent such a medical emergency.
The jury awarded $2.5 million in damages to Mark Avent and $500,000 to Lisa Avent for distress. 
In their closing arguments, Meehan had suggested the jury award $5 million to the couple, and Simmons suggested the awarded amount be $325,000.
“We’re not happy with the 15%, but I could live with it,” Meehan said. “The number is big enough, so we’re happy. And now it’s a matter of getting this company to pay.”
A separate lawsuit is ongoing to determine which of the company’s three insurance plans may need to cover Avent’s claim. 
Blue Arrow’s attorneys declined to comment on the verdict, or whether or not the company will appeal the decision. 
In the meantime, Meehan said his clients will begin a “multi-front collection effort,” to get the claim from insurance companies and possibly garnish the company’s accounts. 
John Wilbers, founder and chairman of Blue Arrow, was not present at the verdict because he was attending his mother’s funeral. Wilbers, a personal injury attorney in St. Louis, started Blue Arrow with his mother, Kathy, who was the majority owner of the two cultivation, one manufacturing and one dispensary licenses the state awarded them in 2019, according records obtained from the Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation.
Wilbers told The Independent Tuesday said he intends to take care of Avent. 
“If somebody’s injured, we’re going to help them,” he said.
After the lab accident, Avent was taken to the emergency room and lost consciousness in the ambulance. Doctors inserted a stent in his heart to save him, Meehan said, and he still hasn’t fully recovered four years later. 
On top of his ongoing medical bills, Meehan said Avent has lost at least $130,000 a year in income because he can no longer work in the marijuana industry.
Mark and Lisa Avent said after the four-day trial that they were exhausted but relieved. They initially filed the lawsuit nearly three years ago.
“We’re just glad it’s over,” he said.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Avents-scaled-e1763735962357-1024x698.jpg,,,2025-11-21 10:58:25.743795

SPP applied for federal permission to fast-track applications to add power to the grid, saying it is necessary to maintain grid stability. (Submitted: Southwest Power Pool)TOPEKA — An environmental organization is challenging a federal decision that allows the Southwest Power Pool to fast-track applications to bring new utility generation online.
In May, the Southwest Power Pool announced it had applied to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, for permission to implement an Expedited Resource Adequacy Study, or ERAS, process, the organization said in a news release.
SPP is a regional transmission organization that covers 14 states, including Kansas, and is one of seven approved by FERC as nonprofit member agencies that oversee transmission infrastructure, ensure utility system reliability and manage the wholesale electricity market.
“SPP developed ERAS in collaboration with its stakeholders and in response to an imminent and growing need to bring new generating resources online before the region’s generating capacity is outpaced by its electricity needs,” the news release said.
The ERAS process allows its members to nominate qualified generation projects for fast-track review, which could mean SPP will grant generator interconnection agreements to ERAS participants by March 2026, a news release said.
In July, FERC approved the ERAS process.
The Sierra Club, a national environmental organization, filed a lawsuit last week to stop ERAS. In a news release, the organization cited concerns about fast-tracking “the interconnection of mostly fossil-fueled generation to the power grid.”
Sierra Club also filed a lawsuit against a similar plan that FERC approved for the Midcontinent Interconnection System Operator.
“The lawsuit challenges FERC’s approval of the Expedited Resource Adequacy Study (ERAS) process, which allows the fast-tracked projects to pass significant upgrade costs to residential customers, and to skip over and also pass significant upgrade costs to clean energy projects that have been waiting for years to connect to the grid,” Sierra Club said in a news release.
SPP officials are reviewing the Sierra Club’s filing, said spokesman Seth Blomeley.
“We remain confident in the merits of our plan, which was approved by FERC,” he said.
SPP’s senior vice president of engineering, Casey Cathey, said recently that energy needs within the SPP’s region are expected to nearly double in the next decade.
The Sierra Club doesn’t believe the expedited process is needed, the organization’s news release said.
“In fact, SPP has suggested in other regulatory contexts that its other reforms to the standard interconnection queue will address any resource shortfalls for the grid it manages,” the organization said.
Sierra Club also pointed to Duke University research that shows new demands for electricity, such as from data enters, can be managed through load flexibility.
“FERC’s approval of SPP … line-cutting proposals will only add to the disruption that has prevented hundreds of gigawatts of clean energy from coming online to serve projected resource needs,” said Greg Wannier, Sierra Club senior attorney. “The result will be higher monthly bills for tens of millions of people by locking in new gas-burning power plants ahead of cheaper, shovel-ready clean energy projects. If FERC will not enforce its own fair market rules, the courts must do it for them.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SPP-Corporate-Office-3-1024x581.png,,,2025-11-21 10:58:25.743795

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Federal authorities say they arrested 14 people suspected of being in the country illegally during the raid on paper distributor Bro-Tex in St. Paul earlier this week.
The Department of Homeland Security, in a statement on Thursday, said those arrested include an individual with past domestic abuse charges and a person suspected of illegally reentering the country, a felony. The statement did not provide more information about those arrested.
“Worksite enforcement remains a cornerstone of our efforts to protect public safety, national security, and economic stability while rescuing individuals who may be victims of labor trafficking or exploitation,” an unnamed spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement sent to the media Thursday evening.
News of a raid in St. Paul quickly circulated online, drawing a large crowd of protesters who attempted to interrupt the operation by blocking the vehicles of masked agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations and the FBI. Agents used chemical irritants and physical force to remove the protesters.
The action drew condemnation from local elected officials and immigrant advocacy organizations.
“This raid did not make Minnesota safer. This raid did not protect workers. This raid tore 14 people away from their families and destabilized an entire neighborhood,” the Immigrant Defense Network, a coalition of immigrant, labor, faith and community organizations, said in a statement.
At least three of the workers have been publicly identified by their families.
Erik Godinez Alarcon told Sahan Journal that his uncle, Camilo Morales Sanchez, and cousin, Jamie Solano Godinez, were detained while working at Bro-Tex.
In an online fundraiser, Karla Alarcon Hernandez said her father, Carlos Alberto Alarcón Avila, had also been detailed. She said he has lived in the St. Paul area for many years.

Mike Rogers, now a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, called for President Donald Trump to accept a peaceful transition of power and condemned election denialism by Trump and his allies. 
“The president and some in his party are refusing to accept the outcome of the election, instead sowing doubt and conspiracy,” Rogers wrote in a Washington Post op-ed one day prior to the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol Building. “This was an election that multiple independent observers, the courts and both parties have found to be free and fair. To imply otherwise is self-serving and stokes further discord in our country.”
“President Donald Trump’s attempts to influence the electoral processes in Michigan, and elsewhere, is cause for both concern and alarm, and should be roundly rejected by both Democrats and Republicans alike,” he wrote in a Detroit News op-ed about a month earlier urging Michigan officials to certify the results. “It is well past time that the president accepts that he lost and begin the peaceful and orderly transition of power to President-elect Joe Biden.”
Now, Rogers, endorsed by Trump in his second Senate election in two cycles, is espousing his own election denial about his 2024 Senate bid — saying in October, without offering evidence, that a van of ballots was delivered to a polling place in Detroit. He embraced similar rhetoric during the 2024 campaign as well.
Rogers says he didn’t violate voter registration law he helped to pass 

As he heads into 2026, Rogers is surrounding himself with a campaign full of those who also repeatedly questioned the results of the 2020 election. 
Meshawn Maddock and Kenneth Thompson, for example, were both granted federal pardons by President Trump earlier this month for their alleged role in the “false electors” scheme that sought to cast Michigan’s electoral votes in 2020 for Trump, despite the state voting for former President Joe Biden. 
Both Maddock and Thompson are now county co-chairs on the Rogers campaign, in Oakland County and Ionia County, respectively.

“Mike Rogers has either lost every last photon of sanity,” wrote Jeff Timmer, a former executive director of the Michigan Republican Party and the Chief Operating Officer of the Lincoln Project, “or he’s a lying pr**k who is cynically exploiting mushy MAGA minds in his desperation and thirst to be liked by them rather than normal American Michiganders.”
Rogers’ campaign did not respond to a request for comment from the Advance.
Rogers’ switch up demonstrates a greater trend in Republican politics — that it is increasingly hard to be a GOP candidate with a national or statewide profile without taking part in some level of election denial.

In 2022, for example, PBS tracking showed that of GOP gubernatorial candidates, 28 flat-out denied or fueled denial of the 2020 election compared to just eight who defended the results, and in secretary of state races, 19 Republicans denied or doubted the results while seven upheld Biden’s victory. Both GOP candidates in Michigan, Tudor Dixon and Kristina Karamo, respectively, fell in the category of expressly denying the results. 
“Something we’re seeing nationally as well as in Michigan, is general mis- and disinformation that really undermines public trust,” said Alexa Solis, a Senior Communications Manager for All Voting is Local. 
Maddock and Thompson are not the only election deniers on Rogers’ team. Nearly a dozen of the other county co-chairs named by Rogers in June had made statements online promoting conspiracy theories on the presidential election or the Jan. 6 riots. Norm Shinkle, one of the co-chairs in Ingham County, was the sole member of the State Board of Canvassers who refused to certify the 2020 elections, even as the other Republican on the board certified them. 
“Looking ahead into 2026 there are definitely risks of election sabotage,” Daniel Rivera, Michigan senior campaign manager for All Voting Is Local, said. “Especially since these pardons happened and these folks are back out in the community, I would say it could serve as a blueprint to undermine and challenge election results, but we’re ready to fight back for those future attempts.”
Rivera works to ensure public trust and confidence in elections, emphasizing that election officials, regardless of party, are largely committed to ensuring that elections run smoothly and are free and fair. 
“What we see as another challenge, are these partisan attempts to overturn the will of the American people,” he said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Facetune_04-10-2024-08-19-56-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-21 09:57:54.237209

(Screenshot)A confirmation hearing for President Donald Trump’s pick to fill a judicial vacancy in Alaska was largely uneventful on Wednesday.
Aaron Christian Peterson was nominated by Trump this month after getting support from U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, and on Wednesday, the U.S. Senate’s judiciary committee held a hearing on Peterson’s nomination and two other prospective judges bound for other states.
Senators’ attention largely focused on the other two men — David Fowlkes for a judgeship in Arkansas, and Nicholas Ganjei for a seat in Texas — and senators frequently used their time in the hearing to discuss their own views, rather than seek information about the nominees.
“Here I am asking the questions and giving the answers — it’s like the bar exam, except I’m giving the answers,” said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, at one point in the hearing.
Peterson, who lives in Eagle River, is a natural resources attorney for the state of Alaska and has extensive experience as a criminal prosecutor.
Speaking to the committee, he said he has “a deep familiarity with the laws that are specific to Alaska,” naming the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act as one example.
“I have a wide variety of experience in the arenas that are likely to come before the district court, and hopefully I’ll be able to preside over those matters if I’m fortunate enough to be confirmed,” he said.
Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, asked all three nominees if they had ever been accused of sexual harassment or made unwanted sexual advances toward someone. 
All three said no.
Alaska’s most recent pick for the U.S. District Court, former Judge Josh Kindred, was appointed during the first Trump administration but resigned and was disbarred after an investigation found had committed significant sexual misconduct while in office. 
Sen. Adam Schiff, D-California, asked all three nominees whether they believe Congress is prohibited from imposing a code of ethics on the U.S. Supreme Court.
Peterson, answering third, echoed his potential colleagues and said it would depend on the circumstances, but that he does have concerns about whether such a thing would violate the U.S. Constitution’s separation of powers doctrine.
Currently, the U.S. Supreme Court is closely aligned with President Trump, and members of the court have repeatedly accepted financial and physical gifts from people affected by issues before the court. 
Republicans generally oppose new ethics restrictions on the court; Democrats generally favor them. 
Hawley asked the judicial nominees whether they believe a district court judge has the ability to issue injunctions that can halt nationwide actions.
Many of the Trump administration’s programs, when challenged in court, have been at least temporarily halted by local injunctions, and Peterson said the issue is in flux, in part because of a new U.S. Supreme Court ruling.
Sullivan, who does not sit on the judicial committee, read a prepared statement introducing Peterson. 
“Aaron is a lifelong Alaskan. He knows and understands our great state and the federal laws that reflect on Alaska. I think he will be a great federal judge. I urge his nomination be sent to the Senate floor with positive votes from all the members of this committee,” Sullivan said.
Peterson was one of several people suggested to the president by a committee formed at Sullivan’s behest to consider nominees for two current vacancies on the federal bench in Alaska.
That committee deliberated in secret, and the list of applicants — and of proposed nominees — has never been revealed.
Murkowski used a more traditional process to propose nominees to the president, relying on advice from the Alaska Bar Association. Peterson’s name did not appear in that application process, and the Bar Association did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday.  
Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Nebraska and chair of the judiciary committee, said members of the committee will submit written questions to the nominees by Nov. 26.
After that, the committee is expected to vote on the nominees and send them to a vote of the full U.S. Senate for confirmation.

BRATTLEBORO — Brattleboro Memorial Hospital CEO Christopher Dougherty, on an unexplained leave of absence the past seven weeks, won’t be returning to his job.
“The parties agree that under the current circumstances it is best for Chris to depart and for the hospital to bring in new leadership,” the not-for-profit facility said in a written public statement Thursday night.
The 500-worker hospital, one of Brattleboro’s three largest employers, named Dougherty as its chief executive officer in spring 2022. In the past year, he faced an operating budget shortfall and related questions from state regulators before announcing Oct. 3 that he was taking leave.
Dougherty, who previously led Shriners for Children Medical Center in Pasadena, California, hasn’t commented publicly. In its statement, Brattleboro Memorial Hospital said, “Chris is proud of his accomplishments and grateful for the opportunity to have led the hospital.”
“BMH would like to thank Chris for his service over the past three-and-a-half years and wish him all the best in his future endeavors,” the statement said.
The 61-bed hospital will search for a new CEO, Chloe Learey, its acting board chair, said in a Facebook video. Until another leader is hired, doctors Elizabeth McLarney, an orthopaedic surgeon, and Tony Blofson, a primary care physician, will continue as acting co-CEOs.
Past and present administrators have blamed the hospital’s fiscal problems on everything from too many unpaid patient bills to their own staff’s rising health insurance costs. In response, they have launched a hiring freeze, let go of six administrators and hired two outside advisers — Ovation Healthcare, a national support organization, and David Sanville, a former chief financial officer at Windsor’s Mt. Ascutney Hospital.But regulators at the Green Mountain Care Board have questioned the accuracy of the budget numbers and ordered the hospital to revise them or risk becoming the first Vermont health care facility to receive state intervention under a new law.

The chain of California nursing homes owned by Shlomo Rechnitz has faced state scrutiny for years, including an unsuccessful effort by then-Attorney General Kamala Harris to stop him from acquiring more facilities. Now, a series of recent lawsuits has brought renewed attention to his companies. 
Elder care advocates say Rechnitz’ companies are Exhibit A in how regulators at the Department of Public Health fail some of California’s most vulnerable citizens.
Rechnitz’ companies have denied allegations in all of these cases, which include several that are scheduled to go to trial next year and two in 2024 that resulted in multimillion-dollar judgments against the companies. 

Mark Johnson, an attorney for the facilities and their holding company, Brius: “It is accurate that nursing homes are the target of abusive lawsuits that accomplish nothing but depleting resources for patient care.”

Wendy York, a Sacramento attorney specializing in nursing home abuse, said that watching elderly and disabled residents repeatedly suffer the same types of injuries in these facilities “feels like a broken record. It feels like Groundhog Day.”
In 2021, a CalMatters investigation found that the state Department of Public Health allowed Rechnitz and his companies to operate 18 nursing homes while delaying a decision on granting licenses to them. The state had kept the license applications in a “pending” status after he acquired them. Rechnitz and his companies were allowed to continue operating five additional homes even after the state denied licenses for those facilities.
Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law meant to address the issue, but state regulators in 2023 granted Rechnitz’ companies the licenses to operate the homes just before the measure took effect.
Now, some of those facilities are the subject of patient lawsuits, including one that resulted in a $2.3 million judgment against Country Villa Wilshire.

CA law seeks to preserve civil rights in K-12 schools

A new California law aims to expand civil rights protections in K-12 schools while the federal administration under President Donald Trump moves to shut down the U.S. Department of Education and its Office of Civil Rights, reports CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones.
In October California lawmakers passed a measure to create an Office of Civil Rights within the California Department of Education. The office includes an antisemitism coordinator, who will investigate complaints and train school districts on how to prevent antisemitism. The office is also required to submit to the Legislature an annual discrimination report, which would include information such as the number of complaints.
Before Trump’s return to the White House, most K-12 anti-discrimination enforcement fell on the federal government’s Office of Civil Rights. But in March the Trump administration began laying off nearly half the staff at the federal education department, closing numerous branches of the Office of Civil Rights, including the one in California. On Tuesday the administration also unveiled a plan to spin off the education department’s key areas of oversight to other federal departments.

Lieutenant governor votes against UC tuition hike

The University of California Board of Regents voted Wednesday to continue its annual tuition hikes, despite pushback from some regents and undergraduate students, writes CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn.
The tuition model allows the public university system to increase undergraduate tuition and systemwide fees by as much as 5% annually. But what undergraduates pay for tuition once they enroll doesn’t change, since their rate would be locked in that year for up to six years upon enrollment. Graduate students, who are not on the same tuition model, would continue to see annual tuition increases. 
The regents voted 13 to 3 to approve the plan, which begins in 2026-27. UC officials say the plan ensures the system can collect more revenue as the costs of educating students increase. 
Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, one of the regents who voted against the move, said the decision to increase tuition continually should be reviewed at least annually, not left alone for years at a time. Undergraduates also denounced the plan. About half of in-state undergraduate students at UC live in households with incomes below $120,000.

Diego Emilio Bollo, president of the undergraduate student association at UCLA: “The students are not the UC’s backup budget plan.”

The ninth grader was standing in her bedroom in their second-floor unit early one morning when a bullet whizzed past her neck and through a wooden door, sending splinters into her face.  
She screamed and dropped to the floor, thinking she’d been shot. 
“Those bullets came right through my bedroom walls and ricocheted throughout the place,” said Latisha Feazell, a resident of Pine Ridge Gardens Apartments, better known as Rebelwood, in south Jackson, Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2025. Credit: Vickie D. King/Mississippi Today
At first, she had trouble sleeping after the incident. But Feazell has since adjusted to routine gunfire at Pine Ridge Gardens, better known as Rebelwood – one of the most troubled apartment complexes in Jackson.
“I’m not scared anymore,” said Feazell, who recently graduated high school. “I hear a shot, ‘Oh they’re shooting in the back.’ That’s it.”
But she does wish management would patch the other bullet holes in their walls: in the kitchen cabinet next to where they keep cereal boxes, a foot away from their living room window, beside the front door. 
These scars represent just a sliver of the grim housing conditions plaguing some of the more than 400 residents of this federally subsidized complex. Mold and mildew. Electrical problems. Broken windows. Rusty appliances. Water leaks. 
These hazards are not a secret. City, state and federal officials who oversee Rebelwood know the complex is plagued. They’ve documented the issues in police reports and physical inspection forms.

But their oversight has so far failed to result in lasting improvements to the perennially troubled complex – a result, experts say, of low inspection standards and weak enforcement. 
The deficiencies persist even as regulators have required Rebelwood’s owners to make repairs. 
In 2023, Rebelwood passed its most recent routine inspection by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development with a score of 78 out of 100. HUD records show the inspection identified life-threatening issues with the complex, but a spokesperson for the agency would not provide information about the violation. 
“Does it look like a 78?” said Bridgett Simmons, an attorney with the National Housing Law Project.
“These cabinets were just like this when I moved in here,” said Pine Ridge Gardens resident Stephanie Taylor, Tuesday, Oct. 14, 2025. “I keep asking and nothing gets done.” The complex is better known as Rebelwood. Credit: Vickie D. King/Mississippi Today
The complex is also overseen by the Mississippi Home Corporation, a state housing finance authority that awarded affordable housing tax credits to a previous owner of the complex. During Rebelwood’s last routine inspection in 2018, the agency gave the complex three tries and six months to correct the issues, such as a burned floor, broken window panes and roaches. 
Based on the authority’s inspection cycle, Rebelwood should have been reinspected by now. But Scott Spivey, the Mississippi Home Corporation president, said work pauses during the COVID-19 pandemic created a backlog. Two days after Mississippi Today submitted a public records request for inspection and audits, Mississippi Home Corporation scheduled an inspection for later this month. 
Even if the inspection finds problems at Rebelwood, Spivey said his agency lacks the ability to take stronger action for older complexes like Rebelwood because the greatest enforcement capability it has is to ban them from seeking future tax credits – something owners may have no intention of pursuing, anyway.
“Our tools for enforcement, our arsenal, is vastly compromised,” Spivey said.
Jackson is far from the only city to struggle with upkeeping its affordable housing stock. But Simmons said that is no excuse when “people, in particular the tenants at this property, are being harmed.” 
Mayor John Horhn created a housing task force in July, soon after he took office. His action was spurred in part by water shutoffs at complexes where landlords had failed to pay their water bills. 
“No landlord should put a family in harm’s way,” Horhn declared during his State of the City address in October.

Jennifer Welch, a rental property owner who chairs the task force, said the city intends for its rental registry, created by ordinance in 2022, to help ameliorate some of these problems by using it to track landlords throughout Jackson. The city does not have any active code enforcement cases against Rebelwood, according to a public records request. 
But while the city works to get the registry going, conditions at Rebelwood continue to deteriorate. 
Last year, its previous owner, a New Jersey-based affordable housing behemoth called the Michaels Organization, sold the complex along with 10 others in Mississippi to another New Jersey company. The buyer and current owner, Treetop Companies, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. 
“People just talk about it and keep talking about it and nothing has happened,” Tonia Cowart, a housing navigator with Stewpot Community Services, said about the dire problems at apartment complexes in Jackson. “It kills hope. It makes you feel like well, ain’t nothing ever gonna change.”

Continued violations
Rebelwood is a collection of brick-and-tan buildings tucked off Terry Road, down a hilly, wooded driveway. On the sunny October day that Cowart visited the complex, no security could be seen. The gate was open, plywood covered several unit windows, and a gray door to the front office was locked. Dogs slept under trees, so still they seemed dead.
It felt as if Rebelwood had no landlord at all. 
As Cowart walked to a courtyard near the front of the complex, looking for tenants to talk to, a tall, sinewy man named Calvin Williams emerged from his apartment and insisted on sharing his story. 
A 63-year-old painter and maintenance worker, Williams said he’s been surrounded by squalor since he moved to Rebelwood two and a half years ago. The outlets in his bedroom don’t work, so he’s had to squish his belongings into his living room and use a MacFyvered system of electrical cords to power his heart monitor. 
In recent weeks, he’s been distracted by a more pressing issue: hot water falling from the light in his kitchen ceiling. 
“It’s hot as hell because it dropped on my shoulder and burned it,” Williams told Cowart. 
Cowart has helped tenants secure units at Rebelwood and hears about problems like this regularly. But her ability to take action as a navigator is often limited to what she can see: Before she places a client in an apartment complex, she will undertake her own inspection to ensure the unit is up to code. 
Rebelwood’s regulators are supposed to catch a fuller picture.

During Mississippi Home Corporation’s 2018 routine inspection, records show the agency examined 22 out of 160 units, flagging issues at 15. In the unit that would eventually become Williams’, the inspection found that a smoke alarm was “chirping.” 
Mississippi Home Corporation deemed the complex out of compliance, Spivey said. It would take three more inspections before the agency recorded that Michaels had made all the repairs.
Each time the housing agency followed up at Rebelwood and found it noncompliant, though, invoices show they levied a fine against Michaels.
That fine – the agency’s standard fee for noncompliance – was $110. The maximum fine for failing to file annual paperwork on time? $3,000.
By mid-2022, Michaels had racked up $3,330 in fines and begun trying to sell Rebelwood.
That same year, HUD flagged the company for defaulting on the terms of the contract that allows it to draw down federal funding for Rebelwood, according to a lawsuit filed in Hinds County last year. 
“Default means something serious is happening and now you are subject to the enforcement mechanisms,” Simmons said. 
HUD did not answer questions from Mississippi Today about why the company defaulted. But the plaintiff, another out-of-state investment company that was seeking to buy Rebelwood from Michaels, alleged the complex suffered from widespread issues, including fire damage to multiple units, a lack of carbon monoxide detectors and “major housekeeping and infestation problems.”
Within six months, HUD had deemed the property back in compliance, the lawsuit says. The complex would pass its HUD inspection the following year. 
But its new owner, Treetop, is repeating some mistakes of past owners. While Rebelwood is currently in good standing with Mississippi Home Corporation over its physical condition, it is out of compliance after failing to submit its 2025 annual report on time.

Paralyzed by distrust 
Williams has tried his best to make his apartment home, decorating it with posters and a Dallas Cowboys-themed pendant light. But he can’t hide the smell: His unit reeked of mold and bleach, and his kitchen floor was slick with water. Cowart asked if she could get closer to take a video of the ceiling leak.
“It just ain’t no light up in there,” he said. 
When regulators can’t improve a property, Cowart said tenants need to stand up for themselves. It’s a lesson she learned from her mom when they lived at Rebelwood in the 1990s, their first apartment in Jackson. 
“We had to go hard,” she said. “It’s like, you’re being bullied and you finally have to say, ‘OK, what you gonna do?’”

But the violence at Rebelwood makes it hard for people to trust each, let alone work together. News articles regularly feature the complex for shootings and killings. A social media creator dedicated an entire Facebook page to videos of fights there.
Williams says he trusts his dog, Peanut Butter, more than any human at the complex. Earlier this year, he said he was sitting on his bed when a man walked past his window, a bag of meat in hand, calling out to see if anyone would help him cook it. Williams said he looked at his red charcoal grill and decided to help. 
“By the time I got the cornbread out, I heard the gunshots,” he said. The man with the meat had been gunned down.
“There’s mold been growing in here all over the place. And the toilet isn’t halfway attached to the floor anymore. I’ve asked to get this stuff taken care of and it’s still not taken care of,” said Latisha Feazell, Tuesday, Oct. 14, 2025. The apartment complex is better known as Rebelwood. Credit: Vickie D. King/Mississippi Today
Mississippi Today interviewed the homicide victim’s mother, Henrietta Cooper-Middleton, who said the complex should be shut down.
“I had told him that he needed to be careful about going over there, because I had heard it was dangerous and people were getting killed,” she said. 
Multiple tenants told Mississippi Today that they are withholding rent because the landlord has not made repairs to their units. But this step, a common tool for tenants, lacks force so long as Rebelwood continues to draw down federal funds. The average rent a tenant pays at Rebelwood is just $145, while HUD pays $1,010 per filled unit, according to data from the agency. 
Residents also may not know who to complain to: While some residents across the state take initiative to identify that Mississippi Home Corporation has some oversight and submit complaints, the agency hasn’t recorded any recent complaints from Rebelwood. 
When it feels no one is looking out for them, Cowart said some residents find their time is better spent trying to leave. 
Feazell’s brother, 20-year-old Keymone Feazell, says he goes to work at a steel fabricator and comes home and tries not to talk to anyone. The family, which is from Jackson, moved to Rebelwood after a stint in Texas, they said, because it was the only affordable unit they could find.
“We don’t belong out here,” he said. 
Often perplexed by what they witness at the complex, the siblings are biding their time until work or school takes them elsewhere. Their mom, Latisha Feazell, is on a waiting list for another affordable housing complex, but it’s in Vicksburg, and she doesn’t want to move there. 
Keymone plans to become a truck driver. He wants to get paid to see the country – and to get as far away from Rebelwood as he can.

It stems from a surge in antisemitic incidents in California following the Israeli attacks on Gaza in 2023.,"In summary
The new law aims to educate school staff and investigate discrimination complaints. It stems from a surge in antisemitic incidents in California following the Israeli attacks on Gaza in 2023.


At a time when the federal government is dismantling civil rights protections in K-12 schools, California is expanding them — although some wonder how far the state will go to combat discrimination in schools.
A new law, signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom last month, creates an Office of Civil Rights within the California Department of Education. The office will have a staff of at least six, including an antisemitism coordinator, who will educate school districts about the harms of bias and investigate discrimination complaints. 
“I think it’s a good idea and the state of California will pull it off. The risks are small and the possibility for good is large,” said Gary Orfield, co-director of the Civil Rights Project at UCLA. “But for it to be successful, it has to have real responsibility and real power.”
The new law stems from a surge in antisemitic incidents in California last year following the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks in Israel and the ensuing conflict in Gaza. Authored by Assemblyman Rick Zbur and Assemblywoman Dawn Addis, the law is intended to eliminate anti-Jewish and other bias in the classroom and ensure that students of all ethnicities and religions feel protected.
But the road to Newsom’s desk was not smooth. The bill faced tough opposition from the California Teachers Association, the state’s largest teachers union, which argued that the law would limit teachers’ right to free speech by curbing their ability to discuss the conflict in Gaza or other topical issues. The union declined to comment for this article.
Zbur, a Democrat from Los Angeles who was among the law’s authors, said the new Office of Civil Rights and the antisemitism coordinator are not intended to punish teachers. The idea, he said, is to help schools stamp out bullying, discrimination and other acts targeting specific groups of students. 
“The idea that this law is about policing is hogwash,” Zbur said. “It’s intended to be productive, to provide districts with resources so they can prevent students from being harmed in school.”
Federal layoffs and closures
Discrimination has long been illegal in California schools. Individuals who feel they’ve been discriminated against can file complaints with the state’s Civil Rights Department or with their local school district. But much K-12 anti-discrimination enforcement has fallen on the federal government’s Office of Civil Rights. Created in the mid-1960s, the office investigates complaints about a range of issues, such as school segregation, unfair discipline practices and whether students with disabilities or English learners are receiving the services they’re entitled to. 
In March, the Trump administration announced it was laying off nearly half of the U.S. Department of Education workforce and closing numerous branches of the Office of Civil Rights, including the one in California. That’s meant a steep decline in the number of cases and long delays for those the office investigates. In the three months after the Department of Education cuts, for example, the office received nearly 5,000 complaints but investigated only 309. 
On Tuesday, the Department of Education went even further, spinning off some of the agency’s largest responsibilities to other federal departments — including much of the administration of  elementary and high school funding. Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation’s conservative vision for the country that so far Trump has followed, calls for the Office of Civil Rights to become part of the Department of Justice and for it to “reject gender ideology and critical race theory.”
The U.S. Department of Education didn’t respond to a request for comment.
‘Cutting off funding, that’s what works’
California’s new Office of Civil Rights will have a director and several coordinators who will oversee anti-discrimination cases based on race and ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation and religion. The director and anti-discrimination coordinators will be appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Legislature, likely after Jan. 1.
The office will provide schools with materials about preventing discrimination, and work with districts that have been the subject of complaints from students, families or the public. In serious cases, the office will recommend more intensive assistance to the state Department of Education to correct problems. For districts that persistently flout anti-discrimination laws, “the department may use any means necessary to effect compliance,” according to laws already in place. That may include cutting funding for textbooks or other materials found to be discriminatory.
The office will also submit an annual report to the Legislature on the overall picture of discrimination in schools, including the number of complaints, how they were resolved, and their outcomes.
But to be successful, the office will have to be nonpartisan, transparent and fair, Orfield said. Cases against a school should include strong evidence, and schools should have the opportunity to defend themselves and appeal a verdict if they believe it was wrongly issued. 
And the office should not shy away from cutting funds to schools that don’t comply, he said. In the 1960s and ‘70s, the federal Office of Civil Rights cut funds to more than 100 schools in the South that refused to desegregate — a move that may have been the only way to force compliance, Orfield said.
“Cutting off funding, that’s what works,” he said. “Although if you’re going to have sanctions, there must be due process.”
Photo ops and reports?
Mark Rosenbaum, senior special counsel for strategic litigation for the public interest law firm Public Counsel, agreed that enforcement will be the key to whether the new office is effective.
“If the office just issues reports and does photo ops, we don’t need another one of those,” Rosenbaum said. “The issue is whether or not they can enforce these rights across the board.”
He’d also like to see the office take a more proactive approach instead of only responding to individuals’ complaints. Education itself, he said, is a civil right, and too many students are not receiving the high-quality lessons in safe, well-equipped schools that they’re entitled to. Rosenbaum’s firm recently sued the state over substandard school facilities.
Still, he’s happy to see the office get off the ground, particularly in light of the federal cuts to civil rights enforcement.
“There’s an urgency for California to fill a void,” Rosenbaum said. “It should have happened decades ago, but it’s a good start.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/021125-ICE-Schools-Salinas-LV_CM_30.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-21 08:59:02.660949

At the same time, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in recent months appears to be refraining from conducting agricultural workplace raids, even as it scours Democratic-led cities for immigrants who are in the country illegally.
“We really haven’t seen agriculture targeted with worksite enforcement efforts, and early this year we did,” said Julia Gelatt, associate director of U.S. immigration policy at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.
The shifts come as many Americans are concerned about the rising cost of food, creating political problems for a president who campaigned on lowering them. Last week, the administration also announced it would lift tariffs on some foreign food products, including bananas, beef, coffee and tomatoes.
To ease labor shortages on farms and ranches, the administration last month made changes to the federal H-2A visa program, which allows employers to hire foreign workers for temporary agricultural jobs when there aren’t enough U.S.-born workers available. Under the new rule, the Department of Homeland Security will approve H-2A visas more quickly.
“Our immigration system has been broken for decades, and we finally have a President who is enforcing the law and prioritizing fixing programs farmers and ranchers rely on to produce the safest and most productive food supply in the world,” the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in an email to Stateline.
But the move to increase the supply of foreign agricultural workers conflicts with a July statement by Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins that “the promise to America, to ensure that we have a 100% American workforce, stands.”
Rollins also said the administration was committed to the mass deportation of immigrants who are here illegally, but that it would be “strategic so as not to compromise our food supply.” Ultimately, she said, the solution would be increased automation of agricultural jobs.
The government has issued about 420,000 H-2A visas for agricultural workers every year since 2023, which amounts to about half of the 812,000 agricultural worker jobs. They are concentrated in states that grow fruits and vegetables as opposed to grains, which are increasingly planted and harvested using machines. The government expects an additional 119,000 visas to be issued under the new rule.
Almost half the H-2A visas in the 2025 fiscal year were in Florida (60,000), Georgia (44,000), California (37,000), Washington state (36,000) and North Carolina (28,000).
Lower wages
The new H-2A rule also includes new hourly wage guidelines that vary by state but are lower than previous wages, and allows employers to charge workers for housing that used to be free. In North Carolina, for instance, the new rate is $11.09 for unskilled workers compared with $16.16 last year. In California, the rate is $13.45 for unskilled workers compared with $19.97 last year, though minimum wage laws in California and some other states would apply to those jobs, according to a Cornell University analysis.
In North Carolina, farmers are looking forward to lower labor costs, said Lee Wicker, deputy director of the North Carolina Growers Association, a trade association that brought 11,000 guest workers to the state through the H-2A guest worker program last year.
“If you think farmers are making more money in these conditions, you’re wrong. They’re going broke,” Wicker said. Workers will take a pay cut under new guidelines and will have to pay for housing, but that may help farmers stave off bankruptcy, he said.
“I’m not saying the workers are going to be happy about this, but I think they’ll come back. Wages have gone down before and they kept coming,” he added.
Jeffrey Dorfman, an agricultural and resource economics professor at North Carolina State University, said the changes will be a boon to the state’s farmers.
“The move to lower the H-2A wages by the Trump administration will be very well received by growers in North Carolina and will save farmers tens of millions of dollars statewide,” Dorfman said. “For many farmers, it will turn money-losing crops into money-making crops, if prices stay about where they are now.”
Unionized California farmworkers are opposed to the pay cuts and loss of free housing in the new guest worker visa plan, said Antonio De Loera-Brust, a spokesperson for the United Farm Workers, which represents about 10,000 workers in California.
The union sued the administration over ICE raids in the fields earlier this year, but recently “it’s been pretty quiet,” he said.
“For us it’s been really a one-two punch,” De Loera-Brust said. “First came the raids, which hurt workers, and now in order to appease business interests, they make all these concessions on wages and the guest workers program.”
Fewer raids
The administration quickly walked back a June directive to avoid raids on the agriculture and hospitality industries. Nevertheless, ICE raids on those employers have been more infrequent in the months since.
In June, ICE raided a dairy farm in New Mexico and a meatpacking plant in Nebraska. Since then, the agency has raided only a handful of food and agriculture employers, such as a July raid on a California marijuana grower and an Arizona restaurant chain, and a September raid to arrest Wisconsin dairy workers.
Earlier this month, ICE agents descended on an onion farm in Northern California, arresting four immigrants on charges of illegally selling farmworker visas.
Even as ICE ramps up its activity in North Carolina cities such as Charlotte and Raleigh, Wicker, of the growers trade group, said farms in the state have not been targeted.
Gelatt, of the Migration Policy Institute, said that’s been true of farms and ranches in many states since June.
“In past administrations we’ve seen a very quiet de-emphasis of immigration enforcement at farms. You don’t need to make an announcement. You don’t need to fight in the courts,” Gelatt said. “It is possible just to direct enforcement activities away from farms. It’ll be hard to know if that’s happened now, but I would not be surprised.”
While farmworkers in California are seeing some relief from raids, life is still uneasy for them, De Loera-Brust said.
“Overall, they have clearly slowed down [raids] in ag areas, but that’s not policy. They could resume at any time. People are living with uncertainty,” he said.

A New York Times investigation recently revealed that California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara struck a secret deal with insurance companies, giving them regulatory favors while allowing them to dump tens of thousands of policyholders. 
It was a bombshell. But for those of us living through this crisis, it wasn’t news. 
As survivors of the Los Angeles fires, we’ve spent 10 months inside the collapse of California’s insurance system. In a survey of  insured L.A. fire survivors, 70%  report their recovery has been impeded by delays and denials. 
A system that should be a safety net has become a wrecking ball, destroying our finances, our health and the futures we’ve worked so hard to build for our kids. California’s recovery is being dragged down by the collapse of its insurance system and by one official’s failure to stop it. 
California has some of the nation’s strongest consumer protection laws. Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara simply hasn’t enforced them. Even after survivors submitted more than 400 reports of delays and denials, he approved a billion-dollar rate hike for State Farm in May while delaying scrutiny of its misconduct. 
There’s a name for this: regulatory capture. It’s when an official charged with regulating an industry ends up serving that industry instead. In California, that concept is embodied by Ricardo Lara. 
For nearly 10 months, we’ve called on Lara to fulfill the duties of his office. In August we gave him a clear roadmap outlining five urgent actions he could take immediately to end the illegal delays and denials. Among our recommendations: that he freeze insurers’ rate hikes until fire survivors are made whole, and that he require insurers to be transparent in their loss estimates.  
So far, he has failed to act. 
The situation is critical. More than 8 in 10 Los Angeles fire survivors remain displaced, and most will lose their housing coverage within months. Each day of inaction pushes more families into housing insecurity and despair. 
Two crises now define California’s insurance system: Families can no longer buy or renew coverage, and those who still have it often can’t access the benefits they’ve already paid for. 
Lara has failed on both fronts. 
As the New York Times reports, Lara’s secret 2023 deal let insurers dump tens of thousands of policyholders in exchange for future rate hikes — and insurers did, just months before the L.A. fires. Families were left scrambling for coverage or were pushed into the state’s high-cost, low-benefit FAIR Plan. 
The deal was sold as a way to keep people out of the FAIR Plan. Instead, enrollment has doubled. And for those who still have insurance, a different disaster begins the moment they try to use it. FAIR has been sued for denying smoke damage claims, and consumers have complained for months about customer service, payment delays and slow response times.

We know what happens when insurance fails. California’s five most destructive fires, between 2017 and 2020, destroyed 22,500 homes and, as of this year, only 38% have been rebuilt. The data is clear: when insurance pays promptly, communities recover. When it doesn’t, families are broken forever. 
That is where the Los Angeles recovery is headed. Progress has stalled because the system meant to protect us has become the obstacle. 
As insurance erodes, California’s housing market is starting to show strain. Without coverage, homeowners can’t buy, sell or refinance. Lenders are retreating, property values are falling and construction is stalling. 
What began as an insurance crisis is rapidly becoming a credit and housing crisis that threatens the stability of the entire state economy. 
Lara has failed to stop illegal insurer delays and denials, and he has encouraged the mass dumping of policyholders. Whether his failure stems from intent or incompetence is a matter for the investigations now examining his conduct. 
What matters urgently is that he leaves — now.  We call on Gov. Gavin Newsom and other state leaders to urge his resignation and appoint new leadership at the Department of Insurance.

,California,2025-11-21 13:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,A spate of new studies gives the lowdown on California’s sky-high living costs,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/11/california-high-living-costs-studies/,How costly is it to live California? Let us count the ways with new studies comparing everything from mortgage payments to a gallon of gas.,"We Californians know, or should know, that while living in this state has many positive aspects, we are paying through the nose for the experience.
A flurry of recent studies drives home how deeply California residents must dig to meet costs of living that are either at or near the highest of any state.
One comes from the Legislative Analyst’s Office, the Legislature’s advisor on the state budget, delving into the astronomic costs of buying a home.
The LAO study found  “California home prices far exceed the rest of the country.” Mid-tier homes, those roughly in the middle of the price range, are more than twice as expensive as the typical mid-tier home elsewhere in the U.S. Monthly payments for such homes run about $5,500 in California, 74% more than what they were 25 years ago.
The study also found that the annual household income needed to qualify for a mortgage on a mid-tier California home in September  was about $221,000 — more than two times the median California household income in 2024, which was $102,000. 
For a bottom-tier home, about $136,000 in annual income is needed to qualify for a mortgage — about 33% higher than median household income was in 2024.
The data illustrate why California has the second lowest rate of home ownership in the nation. Just 55.3% of Californians live in homes they or their families own, slightly higher than New York’s ownership rate.
It’s not surprising that hundreds of thousands of California residents, unable to aspire to home ownership, have decamped for more affordable states, such as Texas, where home prices are a fraction of California’s.
Those who do migrate to other states find not only are houses much less expensive but fuel for their cars and utilities to light, heat and cool their homes are markedly less expensive.
The Center for Jobs & the Economy, an offshoot of the California Business Roundtable, continuously monitors energy costs in California and other states. Its latest report says gasoline, averaging $4.64 a gallon in California, is as much as $1.50 a gallon higher than in Texas and other states. California’s electrical power rates are roughly twice as high.
Another take on California living costs comes from the Transparency Foundation, a conservative economic think tank.
It gathered a wide variety of factors and calculated living costs for an upper-middle class California family with a $130,000 annual income. It concluded the family would pay $29,753 more per year than the national average for housing, utilities, health care, taxes and other costs of living.
“This report should be a wake-up call to all Californians, that they are being unfairly punished by the bad policies imposed on them by their politicians — and they are literally paying the price for it,” Dave McCulloch, the foundation’s chairman, said in a statement about the report.
A new poll by the Public Policy Institute of California confirms that Californians worry about living costs. Nearly a third of those polled said they, or someone in their household, have reduced food purchases to save money.
The California Farm Bureau revealed this week that a traditional Thanksgiving dinner for 10 people next week will cost a California family $72.61, well above the national average of $55.18.
Finally, there’s a new report from WalletHub, a website devoted to personal finance,  implying that Californians are taking on more debt to pay their rising bills.
In this year’s third quarter — July through September — the average California household added  $880 in new debt, increasing the total owed to $259,773, second only to residents of Hawaii.
All together, Californians’ personal debt increased by $11.8 billion during the quarter. Now it’s nearly $3.2 trillion, just a bit lower than their $3.6 trillion in annual personal income.

Corrections spending is still over budget,Cayla Mihalovich,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/11/prisons-budget-overspending/,"California's $17.5 billion prison system is over budget, contributing to a projected state deficit. Some groups want him to close more prisons.","In summary
California’s $17.5 billion prison system is over budget, contributing to a projected state deficit. Some groups want him to close more prisons.


Some of the red ink in California’s budget deficit is coming from unplanned spending in state prisons, according to a new report from the Legislative Analyst’s Office.
The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is on track to exceed its budget by roughly $850 million over three years despite recent cuts that include four prison closures and some labor concessions that trimmed payroll expenses. The state budget included $17.5 billion for prisons this year.
The office attributed the corrections department’s shortfall to both preexisting and ongoing imbalances in its budget. The analyst’s annual fiscal outlook projected a nearly $18 billion deficit for the coming year, which follows spending cuts in the current budget.
The corrections department last year ran out of money to pay its bills. In May, it received a one-time allocation of $357 million from the general fund to cover needs including workers’ compensation, food for incarcerated people and overtime. 
Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco in a June 17 letter to the Department of Finance said he was “shocked and disappointed that (the corrections department) overspent its budget by such a significant amount” while the state faced a $12 billion general fund shortfall that resulted in cuts to key health care and social service programs. 
“These were dollars that could have been used to provide basic services to some of our most underserved communities,” wrote Wiener. “While this year’s budget included measures requiring departments to ‘tighten their belts’ and reduce state operating expenses by up to 7.95%, (the corrections department) did the opposite, and overspent by nearly three percent.”
Without having any new dedicated funding to align its actual costs with its budget, Wiener warned, deficits “will likely persist” and put additional pressure on the general fund in years to come.  
That’s despite Gov. Gavin Newsom’s attempts to save the state money through prison closures. Newsom in May moved to close the state prison in Norco in Riverside County next year, the fifth prison closure under his tenure. 
Newsom’s administration estimates it saves about $150 million a year for each prison closure, which lawmakers and advocates regard as the only way to significantly bring down corrections spending. A spokesperson for Newsom’s Finance Department declined to comment on the analyst’s projection. Newsom will release his next budget proposal in January.
“We are allowing wasteful prison spending to continue while Californians are being told to tighten their belts and brace for deep federal cuts to core programs,” said Brian Kaneda, deputy director for the statewide coalition Californians United for a Responsible Budget in a statement to CalMatters. “We are spending millions on prisons that could be safely closed. That is government waste, not public safety.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/072623_San-Quentin_SN_CM_33.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-21 08:59:02.660949

(Photo by alacatr/Getty Images)Utah’s data centers would have to report to the state how much water they’re using every year under a proposal advancing at the state Legislature. 
The vast centers housing rows of servers would have to pay up if they don’t disclose water use, said Rep. Jill Koford, R-Ogden. The bill she’s sponsoring would fine them $10,000 for every day they’re out of compliance. 
“We’re very serious about protecting Utah water and making sure that we’re using it wisely,” Koford said.

A legislative water development panel agreed, voting unanimously Thursday to send the proposal to the full House for consideration. State lawmakers convene for the 2026 legislative session in January. 
More data centers are cropping up in Utah and around the country to power artificial intelligence and other digital services. The construction is drawing attention to the massive amounts of water it can take to cool servers, with some using up to 5 million gallons of water in a day — more than 12,000 times the average use for a household of four.  
Koford said the National Security Agency’s data center in Bluffdale uses more than 23 million gallons a year, while Novva, a low-water-use data center in West Jordan, uses about 85,000. 
If the Utah bill passes, officials in the Division of Water Rights will get to see which data centers use the most water, but the public won’t. When it posts the numbers online, the state will remove identifying information to try to protect the companies’ intellectual property, Koford said.  



Let us know what you think...


 


“We have some really great partners who are bringing in economic development to the state, and they are reinvesting in our communities and in water,” Koford said of the data centers while speaking with reporters. 
But she has questions, she added: “What are you diverting? What are you consuming? What are you discharging? So that we can get a handle on it and plan for the future.” 
The bill has support from the Great Basin Water Network, a conservation group. No one spoke up to oppose it Thursday. 
Koford said the proposal won’t cap how much water the centers can use. Whether the state would impose limits in the future is “a reasonable question to ask,” she said. 
To date, the main source of information on data centers’ water use comes from cities’ permitting processes, Koford said, “but our state engineer and our state water division has been left out of that conversation.”
Similar bills have surfaced in at least six states, including Oregon, Indiana and Georgia, according to the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators.

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)TUSCALOOSA — Daniel DiDonato says he’s been passionate about elections since he was a young child. He remembers watching the 2016 presidential election as a fourth grader. 
That’s why DiDonato, an 18-year-old political science major at the University of Alabama, worked late at night and used a free redistricting app to draw six new Alabama Senate district maps, and submitted them, unsolicited, to a federal court in a lawsuit over potential Voting Rights Act violations in Alabama’s state Senate districts.
On Monday, U.S. District Judge Anna Manasco ordered that one of DiDonato’s maps be implemented in the case.

“You can be the change you want to see in policy. You can be the change you want to see in government. Literally, you can do anything you set your mind to,” DiDonato said in an interview in Tuscaloosa on Thursday. “It’s extraordinarily cliche, but I did that.”
Whether the map remains in place is uncertain. Richard Allen, a special master charged with overseeing the new maps; Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen, and attorneys for a group of plaintiffs who challenged the original Senate districts as racially discriminatory have all leveled criticisms of the map. The state may appeal Manasco’s order, though no appeal had been filed as of Thursday afternoon. 
DiDonato identifies as a Democrat but said his affiliation did not influence his decisions. He said he was not familiar with the racial or partisan makeup of Montgomery and did not “turn on” the partisan and race filters on the software until he finished all six maps.
“I don’t possess more than a passer-byer’s familiarity with the area. My understanding is limited to that,” he said.

The case

Manasco, a Trump appointee, ruled in August that Alabama’s Senate maps violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. That provision prohibits voting laws or procedures that purposefully discriminate on the basis of race, color or membership in a language minority group. 
Manasco ordered new district lines to be drawn in Senate Districts 25 and 26, currently represented by Sens. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, and Kirk Hatcher, D-Montgomery, respectively. She ordered a second district in Montgomery that had a 50% Black voting age population, or something close to it. 
Gov. Kay Ivey said in September that she would not call a special session to redraw the map, citing a pending decision in the U.S. Supreme Court, Callais v. Louisiana, in which the justices are considering whether majority-minority districts are constitutional. A ruling is expected by next summer.
Manasco ordered the implementation of Remedial Plan 3 Monday. The map was drawn by 18-year-old Daniel DiDonato. (Map from court documents)
Manasco then appointed the same team that redrew the state’s congressional districts in 2023 to remedy the state Senate issue. Richard Allen, the special master, submitted three maps, with two being what he thought was best to remedy the VRA violation. The special master only submitted Remedial Plan 3, DiDonato’s map, to strengthen his case for Remedial Plans 1 and 2.
“The special master puts forward Remedial Plan 3 because, while it weakly remedies the Section Two violation, the comparison of Remedial Plan 3 to Remedial Plans 1 and 2 demonstrates the impact of modifying a third district (District 30) on the effectiveness of the remedy,” Allen wrote in an October court filing. “Additionally, given the small region in which the remedy is being effected, the special master lacked a third remedial plan that would modify only three districts, would more adequately remedy the Section Two violation, and would materially differ from Remedial Plans 1 and 2.”
Remedial Plan 3 extends Senate District 25 into southern Montgomery and extends Senate District 26 into Elmore County, which is currently in District 25. 
It changes the Black voting-age population from 29% to 51.1% in Senate District 25 and 66.1% to 43.9% in Senate District 26.

DiDonato’s process

DiDonato said he used Dave’s Redistricting, a free online app, to create the maps. All of his work was done late at night either in his dorm room or in a common study area in Martha Parham Hall East, a male community-style residence hall located near Bryant-Denny Stadium.
He often worked over the course of a few days until 3 a.m., snacking on Trolli sour gummy worms or Starburst, but absolutely no caffeine.
“No caffeine late at night. That’s my policy,” he said. 
In the redistricting software, DiDonato was able to hide partisan and racial information, allowing him to draw the districts without intentional gerrymandering. His goal was to create population equality between the districts. In the end, the districts differ by two people.
“The legal standard is that with state legislative districts, plus or minus 5% is acceptable,” he said. “They try to keep the population deviation between districts as low as possible. One thing that my plan did is I did my best to achieve exact population equality.”

According to correspondence between DiDonato, the special master and Manasco’s staff, DiDonato submitted his plans to the team on Oct. 1. He was later invited to a hearing on the maps by Charles Singleton, a clerk at the Northern District of Alabama Federal Court, on Oct. 27. DiDonato could not attend due to lack of transportation.
Messages seeking comment from Manasco’s staff were left Thursday afternoon, but no response had been received by publication time.
Secretary Allen objected to all three of the plans the special master submitted, but said Plan 3 was “the least bad of several bad options.”
“I guess the state was right,” DiDonato said. “They claim mine was the least objectionable, because it achieved the required remedy in a way that left more of the current plan intact relative to the special master’s Remedial Plans 1 and 2.”
The plaintiffs in the case said that the map was the “weakest remedy” to Manasco’s August ruling and requested Remedial Plan 2 to be implemented because it gave Black voters a near-guarantee to elect a candidate of their choosing. 
Messages seeking comment were left with Allen on Thursday. Davin Rosborough, an attorney representing the plaintiffs, did not comment Thursday afternoon.
Manasco told the plaintiffs in her Monday ruling that a guarantee is not required to remedy the Section 2 violation. DiDonato argued the same.
“I found the assertion that my plan didn’t provide two districts in which African-American voters had an opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice … I found it a bit rockheaded,” DiDonato said. “The court found that the plaintiffs weren’t entitled to two districts in which Black voters would elect a candidate of choice, only that they have an equal opportunity to do so.”
DiDonato does not expect any financial compensation. The special master and his team will bill for their work and legal costs. In 2023, the special master billed the state for more than $500,000 for the redrawing of the state’s congressional districts.
“The best I can get is a thank you,” he said. “They are going to bill hundreds of thousands of dollars, and this time, one of their maps wasn’t picked. I find that deeply hilarious.”

Political implications

DiDonato’s plan does not favor either Hatcher or Barfoot should they run for re-election in 2026. Using votes from the 2024 Presidential election, Senate District 25, which is currently held by Barfoot, becomes solidly Democratic.
According to the redistricting software, DiDonato said Senate District 25 would have elected Democratic nominee Kamala Harris by double digits. In reality, 64% of the district chose President Donald Trump.
“It goes from being a safe red district to a reliably blue district,” he said.
A message seeking comment from Barfoot was left Thursday afternoon.
The same principle applies to Senate District 26, held by Hatcher. The software showed the district turning in Republican candidates’ favor by about four percentage points. In 2024, 75% of the district chose Harris.
“This is a district that was invincibly blue, like, 75% Democratic at the last election. Now it voted for Trump,” DiDonato said. “Neither incumbent is favored in a vacuum to win re-election. And I’m like, ‘Oops, I did that.’ I guess this was an unintended partisan impact.”
Hatcher declined to comment on the changes in a text message Thursday afternoon.
These political implications is why DiDonato chose to be anonymous in court documents, since the age of majority in Alabama is 19. 
“I wanted to proceed with discretion, with privacy,” he said. “While the process was playing out, I didn’t want it to get tainted by games from outside forces, if you will.”

‘Your passions mean something’

As a 2024 graduate of Russell County High School in eastern Alabama, DiDonato said he would not have the confidence to pursue his dream without his teachers and guidance counselor. 
“In the most literal sense, they were the ones who pushed me to be where I am now. I’m eternally grateful to be a Russell County High School Warrior,” he said.
DiDonato’s father Anthony said in an interview Wednesday that he was shocked his son’s map was selected, but proud.
“When he gets into politics, he’s in his own little world. That’s his thing,” DiDonato’s father said. 
DiDonato turned 18 after the 2024 Presidential election, so he has not had the chance to vote yet. But that did not stop him from trying to make an impact on his government.
“There will be the things you are passionate about that have meaning,” he said. “I want this to be a reminder that you can change things for the better. Even if you’re just some person who has a passing interest in something. It is important somewhere to someone for something.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC_0284-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-21 08:59:02.660949

The trucking industry is a major economic driver supporting multiple sectors, but lately it is facing challenges due to a lack of freight to haul and labor constraints.


The Missouri Department of Transportation estimates that over 985 million tons of goods pass through Missouri annually, with a net worth of $1.1 trillion. About 87% of these goods are moved by trucks.


“If we’re doing our job right, you don’t notice us,” Tom Crawford, president and CEO of the Missouri Trucking Association, said. “The shelves are full, and life is good.”


Crawford said that the economy has a direct impact on the trucking industry due to its integral role in the supply chain.


“Our industry is a reflection of the economy,” Crawford said. “A few years ago, the economy was running and gunning — everybody was spending like it was. So we got a lot of demand for goods.”


Consumer spending across the United States surged between 2021 and 2022, rising about 9%, and then about 5.9% from 2022 to 2023, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Meanwhile, inflation remains elevated as the consumer price index rose approximately 3% on an annual basis since September 2024.


“You’re buying less than you did in 2022,” Crawford said. “You’re probably spending the same amount of money, but you’re not buying as much.”


Crawford explains that these economic changes are usually reflected back in the trucking industry’s demand for freight hauling. When there is an increase in consumer spending, there may be the challenge of finding more drivers to haul goods. While when the economy is facing a downturn, there might be a challenge of finding freight loads to haul.


One area where Crawford said this is often apparent is in the construction industry.


“When you see construction starting, with the ground being worked and foundations being set, you are also seeing a spike in freight demand,” Crawford said. “All of the raw materials, like concrete, gravel, and lumber, have to be delivered by truck. So changes in construction activity directly drive the volume of loads the trucking industry handles, especially in segments like flatbed trucking.”
 Labor challenges 



There have been nationwide concerns from trucking organizations about the shortages of truck drivers. Representatives from the American Trucking Association, the largest trucking organization in the U.S., testified before Congress in July to address the issue of a driver shortage, among other challenges.


Labor shortages have been an ongoing issue for the trucking industry, which caused the Biden administration to introduce the Trucking Action Plan in 2021.


One of the Trucking Action Plan’s main goals was to reduce barriers for individuals seeking commercial driver’s licenses. As part of this effort, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration provided over $30 million in funding to help states expedite the commercial driver’s licensing process.


The CDL process involves first obtaining a learner’s permit by passing a knowledge test and meeting age and medical requirements. Drivers then complete training and pass a skills test, which includes vehicle inspection, basic maneuvers and on-road driving.


The current Trump administration has sought to reverse the Biden administration’s efforts to reduce barriers for the CDL licensing process. To do so, it has made the English Language Proficiency aspect of the test an out-of-service violation.


“It’s really all about safety, because, you know, if you think about it, if someone cannot understand what a road sign means, then that could be a real issue,” said Sicily Waters, director of communications for the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. “And that’s really why I think everybody has really galvanized and supported this issue. The actions that this administration has taken are rooted in safety, and that’s not a partisan issue.”


Reporting from Missourinet indicates that 484 commercial drivers have been cited and pulled from driving on Missouri roads as of Oct. 21 because they are not fluent in English, according to information from the Missouri State Highway Patrol.


Crawford acknowledged that many drivers in Missouri’s trucking industry speak English as a second language. However, he stressed that it is the responsibility of employers to verify English proficiency during the hiring process.


“I know several members who have drivers for whom English isn’t their first language, but they are conversant,” Crawford said. “That’s what the law requires, and that’s a safe driver.”

She worries that day will be soon if the state doesn’t come up with money to plug the hole left by depleted pandemic funds that were enhancing the Child Care Payment Program.
Keyes’ situation is far from unique. Overall, 16,000 Mississippi families are on a waitlist for child care vouchers as a result of expired Covid-era funding, according to the Mississippi Department of Human Services. During the pandemic, the federal government gave states $52 billion to enhance vouchers that help working families afford child care. Since the money has dried up, that stability is withering away. Parents are losing their jobs, children are suffering inconsistent care, child care workers are being laid off and providers are going without pay or shuttering their facilities, according to advocates and industry leaders who spoke with Mississippi Today. 
“It’s a huge crisis for child care centers and parents, and we’re hearing from them every day,” said Carol Burnett of the Mississippi Low-Income Child Care Initiative. “This one center’s (Agape’s) experience times a thousand is really what’s happening in Mississippi right now.”
The Mississippi Department of Human Services (MDHS) has resumed vetting families coming up for redetermination – an annual review of eligibility, explained Mark Jones, chief communications officer at the agency. If families earn too much to qualify for the vouchers and fall off or leave the program, those families will no longer receive vouchers, and the department will begin working through the waitlist. 
For the first time during the last legislative session, Mississippi lawmakers appropriated $15 million of state funds to the child care voucher program. However, that was less than half of what the department requested. Thousands of families were left on the waitlist. 
Given the need, advocates hoped the Legislature would put more money toward the program this year. But in September’s Legislative Budget Committee hearing, MDHS did not ask lawmakers for money for child care. 
Instead, Bob Anderson, director of the Mississippi Department of Human Services, asked for $15 million to pay for the state’s Supplemental Nutrition Access Program (SNAP) after the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill, which Congress passed and President Donald Trump signed into law in July, gutted the program and turned much of the costs over to states. If received, that $15 million that Anderson requested will go toward administrative costs of implementing new federally-mandated bureaucratic requirements for checking if SNAP recipients qualify to receive those benefits. 
In the spring, the Legislature could choose to appropriate money for child care. But in light of Anderson’s request – and his silence on the need for more resources for child care despite ongoing waitlists – experts suggest the need to stop the bleeding after historic federal funding cuts has shifted the state’s priorities when it comes to making child care more affordable
Meanwhile, nurturing the state’s youngest citizens remains a burden for child care providers like Keyes, who is having a hard time keeping her center financially afloat. 
“I’m just handling it day by day by day by day right now,” she said. “And sometimes I feel like I’m underneath the water and just my face is up with my nose and I’m really trying not to come under because the community needs us.”
‘She grew up here’
Keyes said she has done everything in her power not to have to kick families out. She had to let six of her employees go, reduced four of her staff members from full-time to part-time and picked up the slack herself by taking on extra responsibilities such as bus driving and preparing lesson plans. She has also stretched resources further and offered discounted tuition to parents who offer work in exchange around the school, such as cutting the grass. She says that’s what community means to her. 
“Putting them out is not going to benefit me because I’m going to just be sitting up here wondering, ‘Where are they?’” Keyes said with a laugh. “What benefits me is knowing they’re in a safe place and then the mom or dad can continue doing what they need to do – working or going to school.”
Many of the children she serves come from households of young, single parents or are being cared for by grandparents. Nearly two-thirds of the school’s families are currently receiving vouchers or have in the past. 
Jazmine Donerson and her sister, Jalan Donerson, both have children who attend Agape and have accrued over $8,000 in unpaid tuition fees after losing their vouchers in June and August, respectively.

“I recently just lost everything in an apartment fire,” said Jazmine Donerson, a single mom who interns as a medical assistant full-time and works an evening shift at Family Dollar. “When I lost the voucher, it was hard for me to make payments. If my daughter wasn’t able to come to this daycare, I wouldn’t have anybody to watch her. I wouldn’t be able to go to school and try to better both our lives.”
She says the debt and the anxiety of getting kicked out or seeing the facility close weigh on her. But mostly, she said she is overwhelmed with gratitude for the consistency in care that Keyes has offered. 
“My baby started here when she was nine months, not walking, not talking. Now she won’t stop walking – or stop talking,” Jazmine Donerson joked. “She grew up here.”

Consistency is critical for young children, explained Biz Harris of the Mississippi Early Learning Alliance, and it’s often the first thing to go when care becomes too expensive. 
“To have to move around and have an uncertain child care situation, it causes anxiety and stress in the parents, and it causes anxiety and stress in the baby – even if you don’t see it, it’s there,” Harris said.
And it’s not just families or child care workers who are affected. Nationwide, the loss of pandemic funding for child care will cost states $10.6 billion in lost economic activity, according to a study conducted by the Century Foundation, an independent think tank in New York. 
Child care is more expensive in the U.S. than any other country explained Elliot Haspel, a nationally recognized child and family policy expert based in Colorado. Haspel said that is because there is no coordinated public child care system like there is for K-12 education,
“We treat child care in this country much more like a private, individual commodity like a gym or a restaurant than we do more of a public or social good like public schools or fire departments or roads or parks,” said Haspel. “So, there’s very little public money in the system, and the economics don’t work without it.”
Keyes has never thought of what she does as babysitting, or anything other than a public good. She views herself as an educator of her youngest charges. Research backs up that perception. The first few years of life are the most critical years for learning and development. 
“At the end of the day, we are an early learning institution,” Keyes said.
Getting creative
As of now, it’s not clear how long Keyes’ child care center will remain open or what approach state leaders will take to ensure funding. 
Advocates have called on the state in recent months to use unspent welfare money to fund the voucher program. But using Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) funds outside of what was allocated for the Child Care Development Fund is prohibited, according to federal guidance. 
The Child Care Development Fund is the federal block grant that primarily funds the voucher program. States can transfer up to 30% of TANF funds to CCDF, and Mississippi transfers the maximum amount. 
Other states, such as Ohio and Texas, have set up direct payment programs to use additional funds carried over from previous years for child care. Jones with Mississippi Department of Human Services said the agency is committed to following official federal guidance regarding conversion of TANF funds to the child care voucher program. 
The agency also has opened a Request for Proposals, Jones said, to use TANF funds for “work support” – programs that help those in low-income jobs remain employed. Proposals include child care, Jones said. The subgrantees will be announced in 2026.

Meanwhile, Gov. Tate Reeves asked lawmakers to provide $1 million this session to expand child care access for workers across the state. The program, according to his annual Executive Budget Recommendation, would be a public-private “tri-share model” in which employers, employees and the state government share the cost of child care. 
“Any revenue to child care is welcome and wonderful, so that’s that,” said Burnett of the Mississippi Low-Income Child Care Initiative. “But it is a small investment, and the other effort Mississippi has put forward that involved businesses participating was an employer tax credit they could get for investing in child care – and there has been practically no take-up on that.”
Without the promise of help from the state, Keyes plans to start delivering orders for DoorDash in the coming months to earn extra income. Keyes said she doesn’t have the heart to lay anyone off before the holidays, but she doesn’t know how much longer she can hold out. 
Keyes said she hopes that officials will get as creative as she’s had to get to stay open – and that they’ll follow through. She keeps praying because she believes care and education are the foundation to life. 
“It’s not about money for me – I don’t pay myself a salary,” said Keyes. “I do it because I want to see the children grow. When you have a great beginning, you have a great ending. In child care, we’re the beginning for everything. We pour into them what they need.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/19140229/3X0A5363.jpg,,,2025-11-21 08:59:02.660949

U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens of Birmingham was noted as the most effective Democrat in terms of technology-based legislation, whereas U.S. Sen. Gary Peters of Bloomfield Township earned a spot as most effective in several different areas of legislative policy, the report showed.
For Peters, he was listed as being most effective on education, energy, government operations, immigration, macroeconomics, trade and transportation. Of all the Democratic senators listed in the report, Peters was one of three lawmakers to hold the top spot in multiple policy areas, followed only by U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with the Democratic Party.
“Consistent with his pattern of lawmaking effectiveness in the 117th Congress, Sen. Gary Peters, Chair of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs, led the Government Operations and Technology policy areas (both of which had clear ties to his committee),” the report said.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The list did not cite a single member of the Republican delegation in the U.S. House of Representatives as being most effective in any of the given policy areas.
Peters is retiring from the upper chamber of Congress at the end of his term next year and is not seeking reelection, giving Michigan Democrats and Republicans an open race to replace him. But as the report shows, whomever wins the 2026 election will have big shoes to fill.
For Stevens, the designation as being most effective on the technology policy front could give her a good boost in her own campaign to replace Peters, as she is one of three Democrats vying for the party’s nomination in August. She currently faces state Sen. Mallory McMorrow of Royal Oak, former director of the Wayne County Department of Health, Human and Veterans Services, and research health specialist Rachel Howard.

New maps open challenges to Darrell Issa,Deborah Brennan,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/11/san-diego-redistricting-midterm-election/,"If Proposition 50 survives the legal challenges, the new voting map could lead to the lone Republican seat in San Diego - the 48th Congressional District represented by Darrell Issa - flipping to the Democrats.","In summary
If Proposition 50 survives the legal challenges, the new voting map could lead to the lone Republican seat in San Diego – the 48th Congressional District represented by Darrell Issa – flipping to the Democrats. 


Eleven Democrats are vying to unseat Rep. Darrell Issa, a San Diego Republican, after California’s redistricting measure turned his reliably red district into a slightly blue one that will be a key swing race in next year’s midterm elections.
Rep. Mike Levin, a San Clemente Democrat, can breathe easier, as Proposition 50 carves out new boundaries that make his swing district more safely Democratic. 
The new voting map reflects California’s bid to offset Texas’ effort to secure control of the House by adding five Republican seats in November. California voters approved the redistricting plan proposed in Proposition 50 by nearly 20 points in a special election this month.
Both redistricting efforts are embroiled in litigation. On Tuesday a federal court blocked Texas from using its new maps, finding that they would harm Black and Latino voters in that state. Last week the U.S. Department of Justice sued to overturn California’s maps, arguing that they unlawfully considered Latino voters in the new districts.
If California’s redistricting plan withstands that challenge, the new voting map could help Democrats flip the lone Republican seat in San Diego. The 48th Congressional District, represented by Issa, will switch from a 12-point Republican advantage to a 4-point Democratic lead, based on voter registration. 
A crowd of Democrats 
The more favorable odds have drawn a wide field of challengers, including Issa’s former opponent, Amar Campa-Najjar, who lost to Issa in a previous version of the district in 2020, San Diego City Council Member Marni von Wilpert, and several contenders from the Coachella Valley.
The passage of the redistricting measure triggered a statewide game of musical chairs, setting in motion the chairs as well as the players. 
The current 48th District covers conservative East County San Diego communities. The new district moves west and north, losing much of that backcountry and adding the North County San Diego cities of Escondido, San Marcos and Vista. It also includes ultra-liberal Palm Springs in Riverside County, where Democratic voters outnumber Republicans by more than four to one.
Those new lines absorb part of the current 41st District in Riverside County, represented by long-standing Republican Rep. Ken Calvert.  His current district will move entirely to Los Angeles and Orange County, so Calvert plans to run in the new 40th District in Riverside and Orange County against fellow Republican, Rep. Young Kim. 
Meanwhile, three Coachella Valley Democrats who were among eight challengers against Calvert for his Riverside County district have now jumped into the race against Issa.  Attorney Anuj Dixit, school board member Abel Chavez and entrepreneur Brandon Riker all switched gears to campaign for the new 48th District.  Another Palm Springs candidate, Marc Iannarino, a Navy veteran and bartender, threw his hat in the ring. Political observers note that the Coachella Valley candidates come from a smaller and more liberal portion of the new district.
“These are three candidates who really know Palm Springs, but they’ve got to reach out to moderate, purplish voters and to know who San Diego voters are,” said Dan Rottenstreich, campaign manager for von Wilpert.

“This is not a deep blue seat,” Rottenstreich said. “This is going to be among the top five heavily contested races in the country.”
Who can win the swing race?
Von Wilpert and Campa-Najjar, the two highest profile contenders, each argue they’re the best candidate to navigate the slim partisan advantage.
Both have prominent endorsements. Former Senator Barbara Boxer, numerous state and local leaders and the Democratic women’s political action committee Emily’s List are supporting von Wilpert. A slate of congress members including San Diego Reps. Mike Levin, Scott Peters and Sara Jacobs have weighed in for Campa-Najjar.

All the challengers face a well-established incumbent for a district that – despite its partisan shift – will still be a toss-up.
Von Wilpert, a former prosecutor in the San Diego City Attorney’s office, won her city council seat in 2020, running against a Republican opponent in a conservative-leaning district, Rottenstreich said
“With these new lines, CA-48 becomes one of the most competitive races in America, and a must-win seat to flip the House,” von Wilpert said in a statement on election day. “I’m the only candidate in this race who’s proven I can win tough elections, flip red seats blue, and deliver results for working families.”
Campa-Najjar, a Navy officer and former Obama campaign official, argues that his experience running against Issa in 2020 positions him to win Democratic and independent votes in the new district. 
“I see it as a rematch between me and Darrell Issa, with 10 other candidates,” he said. “I’m not running against them. I have great respect for them, but only one of us will win.”
Although he lost in 2020, Campa-Najjar said he gained a foothold in the conservative district, getting more votes than expected in the majority Republican district. 
Can Issa hold his seat?
Issa has served in Congress for more than 20 years in different districts. He originally held the 49th District – now represented by Levin – from 2001 through 2019, and retired when that district became competitive. In 2020, he won his current seat, holding it for the next two terms after it was redrawn during statewide redistricting in 2021.
Issa declined to answer questions from CalMatters, but in a statement he called Proposition 50 an “unprecedented purely partisan campaign that pitted neighbor against neighbor and divided the state as never before.”
Despite that, Issa said he plans to run again: “I’m not going anywhere. I’ll continue to represent the people of California — regardless of their party or where they live.”
The general election will reflect voter’s opinions about President Donald Trump; historically the president’s party usually loses ground in the midterms. Issa, a close Trump ally who has supported the president’s policies and nominated him for a Nobel Peace Prize, will have to lean into that record, Kousser said.
“He has to embrace him with his base and make the case to the middle that the Trump presidency has been good for their district,” he said.
The crowded field of Democrats could thwart some candidates in the primary, Kousser said. But it will likely benefit the party in the general election next November, forcing challengers to campaign early and gain traction with voters.
“Whoever emerges as the Democratic candidate is going to be battle-tested in that district,” he said.
A coastal swing district shifts left
The redistricting measure also shored up vulnerable Democratic seats, including Levin’s 49th District. It shifts south, adding coastal San Diego communities of La Jolla and Torrey Pines. Now 65% of the current district is in San Diego County; in the new district that climbs to 81%, Levin said.
With that come more Democratic voters, and even more left-leaning voters. The current district has a two percent margin of Democratic voter registration, which jumps to four percent under the new lines. But the Democratic advantage jumps to 12 percent when you compare the number of votes for former Vice President Kamala Harris vs. Trump in last year’s election.
That positions Levin more securely in his reelection race. He faces Republican San Diego County Supervisor Jim Desmond, along with two other Republicans and a non-partisan candidate.
“The southern shift of that district makes it more blue in terms of the democratic registrations, and the political leanings of the independents,” said Paul Mitchell, the political data expert who drew California’s new voting lines. “So that district for him is a big improvement.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/011724_Darrell-Issa_REUTERS_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-21 08:59:02.660949

(Photo: Hugh Jackson/Nevada Current)A federal lawsuit alleges a Las Vegas real estate brokerage operated by George Kypreos, president of Las Vegas Realtors, conspired with Zillow to obtain clients, garner hidden fees, and steer prospective buyers to costly mortgage loans that were not in their interest. 
An amended version of the lawsuit, filed in a U.S. district court in Washington state, includes brokerage defendants in California, Florida, Oregon, and Nevada, and includes inside information from a dozen current and former real estate agents and loan officers who revealed the allegedly deceptive practices. 
Kypreos’ brokerage, GK Properties, along with others, is involved in “fraudulently inducing home buyers into using Zillow Flex agents and illegally steering buyers into using Zillow Home Loans,” the suit alleges. 
The practice also allegedly violates the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), which prohibits kickbacks and referral fees.
Zillow and Kypreos did not respond to requests for comment. LVR, through a spokesman, declined to comment. 
The suit was amended on Nov. 19 to include allegations of conspiracy under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. It reveals details of Zillow’s alleged practice of steering buyers to costly home loans brokered by Zillow Home Loans, where loan agents are inexperienced, the complaint says, and directed to churn as many loans as possible, without regard for the customer’s best interest. 
Prospective buyers searching homes on Zillow’s website are tricked into signing up with a Zillow agent, the suit alleges, with Zillow receiving 40% of the agent’s commission, “a payment on the back end that is undisclosed to all parties involved.”
Zillow’s listings on its website feature a blue button that invites the prospective buyer to contact the agent. 
“Buyers, however, naturally believe they are contacting the listing agent. Instead, they are routed to a Zillow-affiliated buyer’s agent, who arranges a tour of the home by getting the buyer to sign a “Touring Agreement,” which “promises the buyer that the agent’s services are ‘free,’ but this is deceptive and not true,” the plaintiffs allege.  
The practice increases the price of homes, the suit contends. “If buyers were directed to sellers’ agents, they would be better positioned to negotiate a lower purchase price, because the seller would not have to pay commissions to the seller’s agent and the buyer’s agent.” 
Henderson resident Dale Koger, one of two Southern Nevada plaintiffs in the suit, clicked on the “Contact Agent” button of a house he hoped to see, “believing that he was contacting the seller’s agent,” the suit says. “Thereafter, he felt compelled to stay with that person as his agent. Plaintiff Koger believes that, because he was unable to contact the buyer’s agent, he paid higher commissions because he had to pay his buyer’s commission (as well as the seller agent’s commission.)”
The lawsuit notes that according to its Zillow profile, “the George Kypreos Team has sold a total of 7,050 properties, including 397 in the past 12 months, with an average sales price of $453,000. As a result, its approximate total sales are $3.2 billion, with $180 million in the last 12 months alone.”
While all of the George Kypreos Team’s agents have a “Top Agent on Zillow” badge on the site, three agents had zero sales in the past year, and another had only one, the suit says.
Kypreos became president of LVR in January after its elected president resigned two days into his term, following allegations of election tampering.
In July, some members voiced concern that Kypreos was attempting to pave the way for the sale of LVR’s Multiple Listing Service to a private party, a move some say would be a financial boon to LVR, but render the organization irrelevant in the long run.  
Vulnerable homebuyers have no choice, the plaintiffs assert, but to rely on realtors to navigate the complicated buying process. 
“Zillow surveyed this landscape and only saw pots of gold,” the suit says. “Zillow’s practices and policies in the real estate industry are not simply indifferent to the agents’ duties to protect their clients’ interests; Zillow actively schemes to subvert them.”
Zillow’s policies are designed, the suit claims, “to monetize every step of the home buying process—even if illegally—and to encourage, incentivize, and ultimately coerce agents into violating their fiduciary duties by disregarding their clients’ interests.”
 Zillow promotes itself as “transforming the way people buy, sell, rent and finance homes,” but this “transformation” comes at a steep cost for home buyers.
Real estate professionals have struggled to keep pace with a changing market in which their services are no longer essential to some, given the ability to view homes on websites. 
Last year, the National Association of Realtors settled a lawsuit that resulted in the elimination of standard 6% percent commissions. In its place is an arrangement that requires agents for buyers and sellers to negotiate terms with their clients. 
The NAR has also been criticized for discriminatory practices. 
Local real estate agents have long been concerned about Zillow’s role in sales and lending. 
In 2020, Las Vegas broker Mark Sivek said he feared Zillow will do to real estate agents “what Travelocity did to travel agents. They are diabolical in their evil genius. They say they’re just marketing. An agent who is paying to advertise on Zillow is feeding the monster that’s going to eat it.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/LVrealtors-48x1301-1-e1763684308285-1024x630.jpg,,,2025-11-21 07:56:50.536187

(Leah Romero for Source NM)Two southern New Mexico state representatives on Thursday evening told their constituents that they view Project Jupiter, the massive data center for which elected county leaders approved $165 billion in government-backed bonds, as a transparency failure that “sidelined” the community.
Rep. Angelica Rubio (D-Las Cruces) and Rep. Micaela Lara Cadena (D-Mesilla) spoke at a Thursday event hosted by the nonprofit organization New Mexico Water Advocates and expressed apprehensions that Project Jupiter’s plans to generate natural gas and tap into the region’s troubled water utility will exacerbate regional pollution and strain a water system that’s already pushed to the limit. Rubio noted that she has seen several recent headlines questioning whether the nation is on the brink of an artificial intelligence bubble and said the decision to approve $165 billion for an OpenAI and Oracle data center was a “gamble.”
Project Jupiter pits demand for data against New Mexico’s finite natural resources

“When the industry itself is signaling instability…it’s reckless for public institutions to lock themselves into these long-term subsidies and abatements and these water commitments. New Mexico took this gamble at the exact moment the market is now wobbly,” Rubio said. “For New Mexicans, there has been this long history of being told that the next big thing is what’s going to save us, whether it has been Spaceport, whether it was Virgin Galactic, Facebook, film incentives pitched as these permanent engines…now it’s Project Jupiter.”
Although Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced the data center as a $5 billion project in February, lawmakers and some southern New Mexico residents have voiced concerns over how quickly the deal appeared to come together. They also question whether the project’s $360 million payment in lieu of taxes — spread out over 30 years — is a fair return for $165 billion.
“When I first heard that the payment in lieu of taxes was going to be $360 million, I assumed that was annually,” Lara Cadena, who also serves as vice chair on the House Taxation and Revenue Committee, said. “To see that our county commission signed a deal to receive so little, I was just stunned.”
Critics take issue with the data center’s energy source, in particular. Plans call for a natural gas generating “microgrid,” a system that can solely rely on its own power rather than drawing from an existing grid. Project representatives have touted that as a way to prevent the data center from increasing nearby residents’ energy bills. But critics say the 2025 law that governs microgrids appears to exempt them from complying with the state’s landmark Energy Transition Act — which requires that utilities use 50% renewable energy by 2030 and 80% renewable energy by 2040 — until 2045, when it would be required to use fully renewable energy.
Sen. Michael Padilla (D-Albuquerque), who sponsored the legislative language in question, has previously disputed that characterization to Source New Mexico and insisted that the development must comply with every aspect of the clean energy law.
“It was a process failure, it was a transparency failure, it was a democracy failure,” Rubio said. “The community was sidelined.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jupiter1-1024x683.png,,,2025-11-21 07:56:50.536187

I want to start by saying that I am not an expert on Native history or Indigenous culture. I am an ally and an advocate. 
My goal is not to speak for anyone, but to stand with those whose voices are being overshadowed in this conversation.
At first glance, Vermont’s House Bill H.362 sounds like a step toward protecting Indigenous identity — a trap I admittedly fell for. But in function, H.362 does quite the opposite. To understand why, it’s important to look at what H.362 proposes to change, and what it threatens to undo.

What H.362 would change
H.362, introduced by Rep. Troy Headrick — the bill’s sole sponsor — proposes to overhaul Vermont’s process for recognizing Native communities and overseeing the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
H.362 would:

Retroactively re-examine Native communities already recognized under existing law;
Add new genealogical verification requirements;
Create multiple oversight bodies and “expert” panels; and
Mandate consultation with the Odanak and Wôlinak First Nations: sovereign Nations that share geography with Quebec, Canada.

On paper, these provisions claim to promote transparency. In practice, H.362 invites extra-jurisdictional and adversarial influence into Vermont’s domestic policy and erodes trust in the state’s settled recognition process that evolved through collaboration and consensus.
What H.362 threatens to undo
Fifteen years ago, Vermont passed Act 107, the law that formalized how the state recognizes Native communities, and created the Vermont Commission on Native American Affairs.
Act 107 was the product of public dialogue, bipartisan cooperation and input from both Native and non-Native Vermonters, alike. Multiple co-sponsors from both sides of the aisle crafted Act 107 as a good-faith effort to bring clarity, accountability and respect to state recognition.
That framework became settled law in 2010.
Now, H.362 attempts to reopen that settled process. If passed, H.362 would not only duplicate the safeguards Act 107 already provides, but would also embed international consultation into Vermont statute.
That’s not reform. That’s destabilization.
State recognition decisions must remain in Vermont. Allowing a legislator to lobby the interests of a First Nation located outside of U.S. jurisdiction in Vermont’s legislative process blurs constitutional lines and undermines the principles of state sovereignty.
Federal recognition vs. state recognition
Part of the confusion around this debate comes from misunderstanding what “recognition” means.
Federal recognition creates a government-to-government relationship between a Native community and the United States, granting sovereign status and eligibility to participate in federal programs.
State recognition, on the other hand, operates within a state’s borders. State recognition acknowledges Indigenous communities that live within the state’s borders and ensures inclusion in education, culture, and policy.
By inviting Canadian First Nations into Vermont’s recognition process, H.362 collapses that boundary and transforms a state-level cultural acknowledgement into an international affair. Vermont cannot legislate through consultation with sovereign entities outside of United States jurisdiction.
Doing so risks violating the Foreign Affairs Clause and the Indian Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which reserve such relations to the federal government.
The colonial framework of “legitimacy”
But the issue runs deeper than just legal mechanics. H.362 perpetuates a colonial framework; one rooted in the federal government’s obsession with “legitimacy” and definition. 
The idea that identity must be proven through paperwork or verified by outside authorities is a framework created by colonization itself. It defines what something is, by what something is not — who belongs, and who does not — through systems that Indigenous cultures never built and often run directly counter to Indigenous ways of knowing and belonging.  
By emphasizing external verification over community continuity, H.362 revives that colonial logic under the guise of reform. It tells Indigenous communities that share geography with Vermont that their identities remain subject to external judgement — precisely what Act 107 sought to move beyond.
Why this matters
Act 107 represents the best of Vermont’s legislative character: collaborative, bipartisan, and inclusive.
H.362 disturbs that by replacing collaboration with suspicion, stability with confusion, and consensus with unilateral influence.
Vermonters deserve laws that unite, not divide — especially now when social division is so highly contagious. Recognition must be shaped by the people and communities who live in Vermont, not by foreign authorities or those seeking to rewrite settled state law.
A Call to Action
Let’s honor the process that was built together and protect a recognition framework that reflects Vermont’s values: truth, respect and self-determination.
Because unity — not division — is what moves Vermont forward.
Vote NO on H.362 and keep Act 107 strong.

(Francis Chung/POLITICO via AP Images)Marie Gluesenkamp Perez told voters in her 2022 campaign that she was “definitely not your typical candidate for Congress.” 
After winning two consecutive U.S. House elections in Washington’s Republican-leaning 3rd Congressional District, she’s proven it. 
Her willingness to cross up her party leaders and crossover to vote with the GOP majority was on display again this week in an episode that made some of her Democratic colleagues uneasy, others outright hostile.
Gluesenkamp Perez, of Skamania County in southwest Washington, authored a resolution reprimanding a retiring Democrat from Illinois for a political sleight-of-hand aimed at ensuring he is succeeded by his chief of staff. 
House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, and pretty much everyone else in the Democratic caucus didn’t want the matter to reach the House floor.
It did. It wasn’t pretty. MGP — that’s how folks refer to her — found herself pitted against fellow Democrats enraged by her dogged pursuit of the public reprimand. 
The resolution passed 236-183, thanks to the votes of 213 Republicans.
Gluesenkamp Perez isn’t second-guessing her move.
“Everyday people here in Southwest Washington and nationwide want representatives who will seek to build rather than destroy, who will listen and do the work rather than bask in celebrity, and who will focus on substance, not slogans or sound bites,” she wrote supporters in a fundraising email Wednesday.
The Standard spoke with Gluesenkamp Perez on Thursday to hear if there’s been any fallout and if the experience might have her rethinking her relationship with the Democratic Party.
The following interview was lightly edited for clarity and length.
What conversations have you had with other Democrats in the caucus, members of leadership, or those who spoke during the floor debate?
You know, while it might not have been audible on the cameras, the heckling was pretty intense. I don’t take it personally. You can’t. It’s too easy to, you know, sort of condemn people. While we can condemn the actions, you do not condemn the person as an individual. That is a different question.
Have you spoken with any fellow Washington state Democrats about the events and what did they say?
Kim Schrier did also vote for this reprimand. I was really encouraged by that. Everybody’s got to make their own determinations about how they can best serve their district.
Given what transpired, have you entertained thoughts of leaving the Democratic Party and becoming an independent?
I’m a Democrat, and that’s why I feel it’s important to hold my party accountable. I feel I am more in line with democratic values on this than the other side. So this is not a signifier to me that I need to change parties. I think the party needs to change. But that’s different. That’s long work, right?
It’s not causing you to rethink your relationship with the party?
No, I’m a Democrat. Maybe I’m an old school one. Old school Democrats aren’t dead yet.
Former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney, last year, when she endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, spoke of the importance of putting country over party. I was thinking that maybe you were channeling that vibe a little bit Monday. Were you?
No. I wouldn’t say that I was thinking about any political figures during that. I was thinking about my neighbors and friends. I actually saw my grandparents and my parents right after the news broke about Representative [Chuy] Garcia. My family and my neighbors all had such moral clarity. I said, ‘Well, some people think that I’m out of my lane here, that I should just be thinking about timber and sea lions. Do you feel like I’m derelict in my duty to local issues here, if I go after this?’ And they said, ‘No, no. That is the reason that we care about timber policy in our schools. This is a natural consequence of that. Being rooted in place and local values does not end with just the material questions. It’s married to the values, the deeper values. 
You’ve touched on this a little already. But what’s been the response of your constituents?
Look, people are not necessarily paying attention to Chicago politics, but they are broadly losing confidence in Congress. I mean, Congress’s approval rating is in the gutters. Part of my point in the debate is like what use is it to win an election at all costs, even your own integrity, when you destroy the thing itself? That there is a definition of a Pyrrhic victory.
What do you think would be different in the House if there were 218 Marie Gluesenkamp Perezes serving?
People were like, ‘Why are you picking this fight?’ And I was like, ‘Why are you picking this fight?’ Because the facts are pretty clear. I’m not here to condemn the character and the legacy of Chuy Garcia. I’m saying that it’s wrong to collect signatures and sign the petition for your chief of staff to run and withdraw after the deadline is over. That’s what I’m saying is wrong. Like, why do you need to pick this fight with me? The facts are the facts. 
Sounds like you’re trying to hold up a mirror for your colleagues to see what others see is going on.
Change does not happen because of just condemnation. And grace is not just turning a blind eye. It is accountability and grace. Those things, that is where change can happen. And I’m not going to hold any grudges for anyone in this. I just did what I felt my community would want me to do, and that’s all I can do, is be faithful and humble.
They’ve got your back. That’s what you said. 
I felt it. It’s been really awesome honestly. I know where my friends are, I know who elected me. That was a real encouragement to me that night after the debate, folks from back home texting me and knowing that people were praying for me. It was pretty necessary.
I did wonder, if you’re concerned that, given what’s happened, your party might not be on the right course to regain the majority and effectively lead.
I think it is an encumbrance on your ability to lead if you are not willing to hold your own accountable. I think the work at hand is too serious to move forward without addressing these failings, which is why I felt it was necessary to bring this resolution forward.
It was not fun, but I also think it’s important for the body. There were colleagues who were like, ‘She’s a lawmaker for God’s sake. Why didn’t she make a law?’ Well, I cannot think of every weaselly thing and make it illegal. What I can do is say that there’s a culture of accountability and that we’re willing to be honest brokers in upholding our values.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Marie-Gluesenkamp-Perez--1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-21 07:56:50.536187

Representatives from northeast Washington’s 7th Legislative District are opening a district office in Tonasket next week.
Reps. Hunter Abell, R-Inchelium, and Andrew Engell, R-Colville, announced the new district office earlier this week, stating they hope to serve constituents’ concerns and questions. This is the first district office for both.
“The idea really came about because our district is the largest, most rural district in the state. It’s actually larger than nine U.S. states,” Abell said. “So with a district that large, our belief was that it was really important to have a brick-and-mortar presence somewhere in the district and somewhere where we don’t live.”
Engell said they initially considered two offices, one in either Omak or Tonasket and another in Colville. However, with an annual budget of $9,000, they decided they needed to find a balance between costs, access and functionality.
“We found a great location for an affordable price,” Engell said. “It has this little sign on the front that says, ‘All roads lead to Tonasket.’ It’s right on the Main Street so I think it’s going to be a great little location.”
Abell added they wanted the office located somewhere other than Colville, where most previous district offices have been.
“This is part of my ongoing commitment to the western half of the district, to make sure that we are there regularly, that we’re listening to people,” Abell said. “With Colville, it’s where Andrew lives, so I think Colville is already pretty well taken care of.
“I really want to make sure that we’re listening and talking to folks who live in Okanogan and Douglas (counties),” he said.
Abell said they plan to hold events or town halls where constituents can stop by to discuss issues, such as agriculture, affordability and tax burdens.
“This is a lot about what we hear in other areas of the district. And you know, I would hope that we’re going to hear from folks on those issues when they come and visit us in the district office,” he said.
Engell, who worked for former Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers in her Colville office for eight years, said having a physical location can help remove barriers and build trust between constituents and legislators. He added that the office will also serve residents without internet access.
“They might look in the window, and you look friendly on the other side, and so they might walk in, and you find out they’ve got an issue that we can help with,” Engell said.
Located at 215 N. Whitcomb Ave., the new district office will be having a grand opening from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Tuesday. Both representatives will be present. Afterward, the office will be open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Wednesday, staffed by their legislative assistants.
The district office will close during the first two months of the 2026 legislative session and reopen in mid-March. The legislative session begins Jan. 12.

Board members voted to restrict library materials for minors referring to transgender people and ""gender ideology,"" which the board did not define. (Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Public Library Service Thursday voted to restrict books for minors that address “transgender procedures, gender ideology, or the concept of more than two biological genders.”
The changes — which do not define what “gender ideology” is — group any books that discuss transgender individuals with items considered obscene, sexually explicit or any material deemed inappropriate.
“I think today was an incredible day for the people of Alabama, because it took a major step forward in putting parents back in control of what their children are exposed to,” said John Wahl, chair of the APLS Board and Alabama Republican Party. “And at the end of the day, that is what the APLS priority is. We want to put Alabama families in charge. We want them to make the decisions for what is best for their families.”
In a joint statement, groups including Read Freely Alabama; PEN America; Every Library and the Alabama Transgender Rights Action Coalition criticized the changes, saying they were pushed by right-wing and anti-LGBTQ+ groups.
“This broad language will likely result in any books with trans representation–regardless of their age-relevance–moved to adult sections of public libraries in Alabama,” the statement said. “The language in the code change does not define “gender ideology,” a vague, undefined term often used as an anti-LGBTQ+ dogwhistle.”
Wahl also introduced other amendments that the APLS Board adopted to require local libraries that the library cards they issue to minors prohibit them from having access to books and other materials in the adult section unless they have explicit permission from their parents or legal guardian.
The board also approved adding language to the code that requires libraries “recognize and comply with all state code, rules, and definitions adopted by the APLS executive board.”
The changes were more expansive than the original proposal made in March by Amy Minton, an APLS board member, that would have only prohibited positive depictions of gender ideology and transgender procedures in library materials for minors.
Wahl argued that removing the word “positive” would also limit material critical of transgender people.
“I don’t think that was ever the intent that we should be allowing negative content and not positive content,” he said.
Thursday marked the second time in three years that the APLS voted to update its administrative code in three years. Board members enacted the first set of changes that dealt with materials in the children’s section of libraries. In the summer of 2024, the board  required libraries to adopt policies to prevent minors from having access to materials that are considered obscene, sexually explicit or otherwise considered inappropriate.
Several groups, including the Alabama Library Association, have criticized the process that led to the vote as unfair and lacked transparency.
“This was all a mechanism for which they could have the end result that they already predetermined,” said Angie Hayden, one of the founding members of Read Freely Alabama. “I think that there has been a conflict of interest in Wahl’s role as ALGOP chair and APLS chair. I think he used one to influence the other.”
It is an accusation that Wahl denied.
“I also want to highlight to those who have tried to make the statement that this is already done, the wording was done and finished before this happened, that is not true,” Wahl said. “And you can see it based on the edits, the amendments based on the public comment.”

Fairhope

While the APLS Board voted to modify its administrative code, members delayed a vote on Fairhope Public Library’s compliance with the administrative code, which would reinstate its state funding.
“I know I have been working very hard to review the material, the books that they submitted,” Wahl said.
In March, Minton requested that the APLS Board vote to suspend state aid to the Fairhope Public Library after a handful of residents spoke during the public comment period that they found several books in the teens’ section of the library that violated the APLS administrative code enacted in 2024.

The Board voted to suspend the library’s funding. The Fairhope Library Board then reviewed the 17 books that parents challenged. They eventually reshelved seven of the books but retained the remaining titles in the teens section.
During the meeting in September, the Board decided to wait until it had reviewed the books that parents challenged themselves. Thus far, Wahl is the only member of the board who said he plans on reviewing the books and will report his findings to the rest of the APLS Board who will then take a vote on the fate of the funding for the Fairhope Public Library.
“Are you becoming the censor in chief for Alabama, that you are reading these books?” said Ron Snider at the Thursday meeting, one of the APLS board members. Snider moved to have the Fairhope Public Library’s funding reinstated, but his request failed to get the necessary support.
Even prior to the discussion, Snider requested that Wahl apologize to the Fairhope Public Library after the library was forced to forfeit all its remaining state aid for 2025 that totaled about $22,000.
“The action of the board, in postponing a decision until you were going to review some books, clearly implied to them that their remaining funding, the $20,000, was going to be available to them subject to approval,” he said at the meeting Thursday. “When we found out that was not, in fact, the case, we owe them an apology.”
Wahl said the rule was already in place and that libraries, including the Fairhope Public Library, knew of the rule, and that other libraries had their state aid withheld. However, only the Fairhope Public Library had its funding suspended because of the administrative code pertaining to inappropriate books located in a section dedicated to minors.
“I am sorry for any misinformation or for people’s misunderstanding, and that is genuine,” Wahl said, but did not apologize for the rule that forced the Fairhope Public Library to forfeit its remaining state aid.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_7724-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-21 07:56:50.536187

(Getty Images)The long-simmering disagreement over an Indiana congressional redistricting has exploded into a political spectacle, with President Donald Trump warning Republican state senators of electoral retribution.
Gov. Mike Braun piled on this week, pledging to “support President Trump’s efforts to recruit, endorse, and finance primary challengers” against fellow Republicans who don’t abide by Trump’s edict to redraw the congressional maps so the state has more GOP-friendly districts.
“That certainly is unprecedented to have a governor and the president threatening to support a primary opponent, but it’s just part of the system, too,” Sen. Travis Holdman told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. “But I’m not surprised by it.”
Holdman, R-Markle, is the third-ranking Republican senator as majority caucus chair and made himself one of Trump’s targets this week by announcing: “The message from my district has been clear — they do not support mid-cycle redistricting, and therefore I cannot support it.”

Holdman, who has been in the Senate since 2008, has not yet drawn any Republican primary challengers for his reelection bid next year.
At least two other Republican senators who’ve expressed opposition to redistricting — Spencer Deery of West Lafayette and Jim Buck of Kokomo — already have GOP opponents who’ve seized on the redistricting issue.
Paula Copenhaver, a top aide to Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith and the Fountain County Republican chair, announced her challenge to Deery on Tuesday, the same day Deery voted in favor of scratching a planned December redistricting debate and not starting the legislative session until Jan. 5.
“Hoosiers have watched weak leadership in the state Senate fail to deliver the redistricting plan needed to keep America on a path that will deliver affordability to American families,” Copenhaver said in her announcement. “District 23 deserves a senator who is unapologetically willing to take on the radical Democrats’ socialist agenda.”
Deery counters that he’s heard overwhelmingly from voters that they oppose redistricting, but said that “because of the D.C. influence, I suspect it will probably be a campaign rife with distortions about all kinds of things.”
Possible Republican primary landscape
The primary challenger threat from Trump and Braun, however, could be muted by the election cycle of senators who serve four-year terms.
Republicans now hold a 40-10 majority in the Senate, with 22 Republican-held and three Democratic-held seats up for election in 2026. Of those 22 Republican senators:

12 have announced support for redistricting.
Six have indicated opposition, but two — Eric Bassler of Washington and Greg Walker of Columbus — were already not seeking reelection next year.
Four haven’t announced stances on redistricting — Dan Dernulc of Highland, Greg Goode of Terre Haute, Rick Niemeyer of Lowell and Linda Rogers of Granger.

Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray, the principal target of Trump’s ire this past week, won a new term last year and his seat isn’t up for election again until 2028. Trump went so far as to label Bray “a Complete and Total RINO” — for “Republican in name only.”
Buck, a senator from Kokomo since 2008, has an announced challenger in Tipton County Commissioner Tracey Powell.
Powell maintained in a recent statement that redistricting was needed “to ensure that every voice in our state is heard and properly represented. Senator Buck has not been supportive of President Trump.”
Buck did not return a message seeking comment this week, but said in an August interview that he believed redistricting was unnecessary.
Sen. Kyle Walker is the other announced Republican redistricting foe up for reelection in 2026. Walker, however, represents one of the state’s few politically close state Senate districts, covering the northeastern corner of Indianapolis and the Fishers area in Hamilton County. He won the 2022 election with 55% of the vote. 
Beckwith says Senate ‘slapped’ Braun
Redistricting supporters want Indiana lawmakers to craft a map with all nine of the state’s congressional districts favoring Republicans. Those would be based on 2020 census data, like the current maps.

Those were drawn by Republicans in 2021 and maintained a 7-2 GOP majority — with Democrat Frank Mrvan holding the 1st District in northwestern Indiana and Democrat André Carson holding the 7th District, which covers much of Indianapolis.
Trump started the national redistricting fight by pushing Texas Republicans to redraw its congressional map this summer. The pressure on Indiana Republicans has included trips in August and October by Vice President JD Vance to Indianapolis.
Beckwith, who has had a contentious relationship with Braun as lieutenant governor, said he will be recruiting candidates to challenge incumbent senators after Bray “slapped” Braun in the face with last week’s announcement that the Senate wouldn’t take up redistricting in December.
“I was very offended by that. That was really uncalled for,” Beckwith told the Capital Chronicle. “I think that’s kind of what sparked it for me. I was like, ‘OK, if that’s what the Senate thinks of our governor, then we need a new Senate.’”
Beckwith presides over Senate sessions as lieutenant governor, but he has clashed before with the chamber’s GOP members. That included bashing “some squish senators” for scaling back Braun’s proposed property tax overhaul earlier this year.
Beckwith said he believes Trump’s political organization and groups allied with the president would provide financial backing and other campaign support for the primary challengers.
“We’re going to make people recognize, hey if you’re going to keep to the seat, you’re going to have to spend a lot of money to do it,” Beckwith said. “You’re going to have to work your butt off to do it.”
The campaign cash at play
Incumbent senators facing challengers can likely count on financial support from the Senate Republicans’ campaign committee, which ended last year with nearly $1.9 million in cash. It most certainly has more money now but an updated state Election Division report isn’t due until January.
Bray’s campaign fund, which can be shared with other candidates, had about $785,000 at the end of 2024.

Former Sen. Jim Merritt, who was a longtime member of the Republican leadership team before leaving the Senate in 2020, doubted the redistricting issue’s influence in the May 2026 legislative primary without Trump’s name on the ballot. 
“I think all the incumbents will be well funded. I think they’ll be able to raise money themselves,” Merritt said. “The Senate majority will back up these members who are with Senator Bray.”
Deery won his first term in 2022 after winning a four-way primary with 31% of the vote, with Copenhaver finishing third at 23%
Deery said he’s confident with his argument against mid-decade redistricting.
“I really find that strong conservatives understand that you don’t want to give the government a power that you wouldn’t want to give your worst political enemy,” he said. “What’s being suggested is that we give the power to establishment map makers, to choose their electorate before any election and not just once every 10 years. That is a power that should scare any conservative.”

Just like Jerry Maguire said way back in 1996, there’s an obvious conclusion brewing in Indiana’s redistricting fight: let’s stop trying to pin lawmakers down to vote for a fictitious map. Let’s put one on the table for everyone to see and debate.
This discussion has been going on for three months. At least 21 Republicans in the Indiana House and Senate have committed to voting yes on a map they either haven’t seen or is locked behind closed political doors. Others have come out against the very idea of redistricting mid-cycle, which would be unprecedented in Indiana.
But the majority are in the middle — taking the absolutely reasonable approach that they aren’t going to promise to vote for or against something they haven’t seen.
And for that reasonable approach, they are being attacked by President Donald Trump, who apparently has nothing better to do than threaten fellow Republicans in a flyover state with primary challengers.
“To this day, we have not seen a map we are being pressured to support. It’s probably in the desk drawer of some Washington, D.C. consultant,” said Sen. Sue Glick, R-LaGrange, this week.
Redistricting rift growing among Indiana Republicans

The national context is Trump is worried about the midterm elections, which historically result in big losses for the party in power. So, he is pushing Republican states to gerrymander their congressional maps to ensure the GOP picks up more seats.
So much for running on your accomplishments and letting voters judge you for your actions.
The Republican line of argument is that Democrats have gerrymandered current maps so badly it’s time for Republicans to do the same. If your son or daughter came to you and said kids in their class were cheating on tests and impacting the curve, would you tell them also to cheat?
It’s important to note that the maps in question — drawn by all 50 states after the 2020 census — have led to Republican majorities in the U.S. House in both 2022 and 2024.
Both sides lack integrity on the issue. Both sides should stick to their morals and values instead of abandoning them when power is at stake. And this also applies to Democrat-led states that have championed nonpartisan map-making only to reject that now. I’m talking to you, California.
Indiana lawmakers loved our 2021 maps. In fact, some of those now wanting a rewrite voted for them, or even helped create them. I have asked several legislators what is wrong with Indiana’s maps — and the answer is never about Indiana but other states.
The fight over redistricting is showing the best and worst of Hoosiers, depending on where you sit. It is tearing the Republican Party apart and could lead to a separation of powers fight as Gov. Mike Braun promises to find ways to “compel” senators to abide by his special session call.
Of course, he can’t “compel” them to vote the way he wants, but I do agree that the Senate has taken a dreadful approach by ignoring the governor’s constitutional right to call a special session. It’s a smack in the face of the highest order and I think is beneath what is supposed to be the more senior and respectful chamber of the General Assembly.
Whether you are for or against redistricting, showing up matters.
House Speaker Todd Huston says his caucus has the 51 votes necessary to move forward, and to keep the first two weeks of December clear — a wait-and-see approach. He could move the discussion forward by filing a proposed bill and map, holding hearings and voting.

(Photo courtesy of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression)An Alloway school board member sued state Education Commissioner Kevin Dehmer and members of the School Ethics Commission, alleging they impermissibly limited her freedom of speech by interpreting a state ethics law to bar board members from discussing school matters with their constituents.
Gail Nazarene filed the lawsuit after another member of the Salem County township’s school board filed an ethics complaint over Nazarene’s Facebook posts that asked constituents’ opinions on school tax increases. The complaint alleged the posts had created confusion and concern among the public, and had “conveyed the impression that Ms. Nazarene was speaking on behalf of the Board without authorization.”
“I didn’t join the school board to be told to shut up,” Nazarene said in a statement. “New Jersey officials claim the authority to punish me simply for asking folks questions about important issues, particularly when it affects their wallets. I should be free to communicate with constituents and get their views without being censored by state officials.”
Voters first elected Nazarene to the Alloway school board in November 2024 for a term that ends in 2027.

The root of the dispute lies in the School Ethics Commission’s interpretation of the School Ethics Act. That law bars school board members from making promises on a school board’s behalf, requires that they keep confidential information private, and forces them to avoid conflicts of interest, among other things.
The law’s text does not explicitly bar individual school board members from discussing school matters with their constituents, but a 2022 advisory opinion issued by the commission says school board members who discuss school matters with stakeholders risk ethics violations even if they appended a disclaimer declaring their statements are theirs alone, and not the views of the board they sit on.
Even posting links to already public information could expose a board member to an ethics complaint, the advisory opinion says. School board members found in violation of the law could face sanctions ranging from a reprimand to removal from office.
A spokesperson for the Office of the Attorney General, which typically represents state bodies in court, did not return a request for comment. A Department of Education spokesman declined to comment.
One of Gail Nazarene’s Facebook posts that led to an ethics complaint being lodged against her.
Nazarene’s attorneys said that advisory opinion had impermissibly chilled her speech, noting she had stopped reaching out to constituents or commenting publicly for fear of sanctions, including on a school regionalization plan she fears will limit Alloway’s control over its schools.
“Americans deserve to know what their elected officials think about important issues,” said Daniel Zahn, an attorney at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, which is representing Nazarene. “New Jersey is muzzling elected officials and preventing them from talking with their community, the very people they were elected to represent.”
The state could face a high bar to maintain its limits on school board members’ speech. The commission’s interpretation of the law imposes a content-based speech restriction because it specifically targets statements related to schools, Nazarene’s attorneys argue.
Such restrictions draw the highest level of scrutiny, and the government must prove they are not unconstitutional.
To do so, the government must show a legitimate interest in limiting speech — perjury statutes that help ensure people tell the truth in court are constitutional, for example — and use the least restrictive methods available to achieve their end.
“The state has no compelling interest — and not even a legitimate interest — in prohibiting elected representatives from communicating with constituents,” Nazarene’s attorneys said in their complaint.
Nazarene’s attorneys asked the court to declare the commission’s interpretation of the School Ethics Act unconstitutional and requested injunctions to block the body from limiting speech under that interpretation.

Mike Kehoe’s administration adds to the growing body of evidence that students need earlier and more meaningful career exploration to navigate this evolving economy (Catherine Lane/Getty Images).As a teacher and coach, I remember vividly the helplessness I felt when my students would ask me: “But how will this help me get a good job?”
For years, educators were often on their own when it came to helping students connect what they were learning in the classroom with where it might lead them in their careers.
Fortunately that’s changing, and November, designated as National Career Development Month, is a chance to commit to expanding career pathways in a more meaningful way – for our students, our workers, and our economy.
The stakes are high. Student test scores in Missouri remain below pre-pandemic levels, at the same time that technological advances like generative AI are threatening to upend the entry-level career pipeline. Succeeding in this more uncertain and dynamic future will demand greater resilience and flexibility than ever before.
A recent report issued by Gov. Mike Kehoe’s administration adds to the growing body of evidence that students need earlier and more meaningful career exploration to navigate this evolving economy. The DeBruce Foundation was privileged to be involved in this effort, which included input from experts, educators, business leaders, students and parents.
The final report issued this fall outlines a roadmap for improving career and technical education delivery systems in Missouri.
One major takeaway: Missourians overwhelmingly support career education — and want more of it. In a survey conducted in partnership with the Missouri Department of Secondary Education and the University of Central Missouri, 92.3 percent of Missourians expressed support for career and technical education (CTE), and more than 90% saw it as a pathway to higher education.
More good news came from business leaders, who also expressed a favorable view of CTE skills, as well as students, who the report found are generally aware of college credit transfer from CTE programs.
But room for improvement remains. One key priority: improve access to career exploration for elementary and middle school students, particularly in rural areas. The DeBruce Foundation’s own research backs this up, showing that students don’t consider enough career paths, and need earlier and more frequent exposure to career literacy skills.
The good news is that career literacy is gaining steam here in Missouri and across the country. Students in 1,480 school districts in all 50 states have used The Debruce Foundation’s free K-12 resources, designed to help students at the elementary through high school levels discover their work-related strengths and interests in ways that broaden their sense of what’s possible.
The foundation is also partnering with states like Maryland and Indiana to support career exploration in schools and embed career counseling tools and resources directly into local workforce centers, ensuring that individuals of all ages can access meaningful guidance and opportunity.
Our recent annual employment empowerment event featured powerful stories from Missouri and Kansas school districts leading the way in career literacy, including Blue Springs, Joplin, and Piper. Teachers in each district, across grade levels, are using our Agilities framework to help students identify their strengths and interests, and how those connect with the world of work.
The truth is, preparing students for empowered careers will take all of us.
For educators and counselors: Use this month to assess your career-exploration practices, and make sure you are helping students discover their strengths in ways that broaden their horizons, rather than limiting or labeling them. Ask: How can we encourage students to consider more career paths and understand the importance of network strength?
For employers and industries: Partner with schools and workforce centers — especially in rural communities — to help build career-literate workforce pipelines.
The Alliance for Healthcare Education in Springfield and the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation’s initiative for Real World Learning in Kansas City are examples of successful collaborations that can and should be replicated. Employers should also take a hard look at their hiring practices: research shows that people may be well-suited for jobs that seem vastly different from the job they do today.
So now is a great time to assess your openness to applicants from nontraditional backgrounds and varied experiences.
For policymakers and funders: make career literacy a priority this month — and every month. The Governor’s Workforce Report recommends making DESE’s regional career advisor roles full-time, rather than part-time and hiring nine new advisors to focus specifically on the K-4 grade levels. It also suggests that the state develop a K-12 career exploration toolkit and website.
These are smart investments that will yield long-term returns for our communities and our economy.
Missouri’s economic future will depend on how well people can move through change, not just into the jobs that exist today, but toward the opportunities that emerge tomorrow. Here in Missouri, the playbook is clearer thanks to the leadership behind the Workforce of the Future Challenge Report and ready-to-use career exploration tools, like those developed by The DeBruce Foundation and offered at no charge as part of our charitable mission.
This month, National Career Development Month, let’s turn intention into initiative. Let’s elevate career development from a checkbox to a coordinated, statewide strategy. And let’s empower every young Missourian and adult learner to name their strengths, claim their path, and thrive.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/student-loans-debt-money-roll-mortarboard-getty-1536x1200-1-e1726143026313-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-11-21 06:57:35.722883

(Photo by Baylor Spears)When Jacob Diener first heard that the status of hemp could be reviewed, he wasn’t too concerned. With his company, A Good Plug, the 32-year-old expected to continue producing small batch hemp products like gummies, brownies, and cheesecakes. 
“It seems around this time it happens every year that they want to re-assess the Farm Bill,” Diener told the Wisconsin Examiner. But 2025 was different and Diener, like others across the industry, was caught off guard when what amounted to a prohibition on his livelihood was discreetly attached to a deal to end the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. “It’s just weird and scary,” he said. 
Hemp businesses were allowed to flourish after the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, which legalized the production and distribution of hemp products with no more than 0.3% THC on a dry weight basis. But under new rules that were included in the stopgap spending bill ending the federal government shutdown last week, products must contain no more than 0.4 milligrams of THC per container.

Steve Hampton, owner of the Eau Claire-based company Steve’s Hemp, says that standard is biologically impossible to meet. “[The] hemp plant struggles to grow to meet that guideline before it’s even harvested,” Hampton told the Wisconsin Examiner. “So, we’re seeing upwards to 99% of the industry get wiped out from this.” 
THC is the primary psychoactive compound in the cannabis plant. Although hemp and the psychoactive variety commonly known as marijuana are the same plant species, they have different chemical compositions. Many cannabis varieties are cultivated with high levels of THC for markets in states where the plant has been legalized medical or recreational. 
Hemp, with far lower concentrations of THC, is mostly used for rope, paper and industrial products. It is also offered in states that do not have legal cannabis markets as an alternative — a source for  products containing delta-9 THC, THCa, THCp and other derivatives. 
The law reopening the government, however, effectively bans those products and gives the industry until next November to adapt or fizzle out. Erin Kelly, owner of the Wauwatosa-based hemp goods store Kelly’s Greens, told TMJ4 that even CBD products contain trace amounts of THC which make them effective medicine, and that the new rules would render that medicine ineffective. Wisconsin’s hemp industry is estimated to be valued at $700 million and accounts for at least 3,500 jobs, according to the Wisconsin State Journal. 
“Everybody’s frantic, you know, we’re all worried,” Hampton told the Examiner. Without an amendment to the new rules or legislative intervention, Hampton says the nation’s $28.4 billion hemp industry won’t survive, and that most of his own store’s inventory would be banned. 
More than just a cash crop
When he was a teenager in Fond du Lac, Diener was introduced to cannabis through his grandmother, who used it to manage her pain and chronic illnesses. He began using it to help with his stress and the early signs of Crohn’s disease he was experiencing
After years of working in the restaurant industry, Diener realized he wanted more out of life. “And so I started to get permission from my chef to start making candy in the kitchen behind the scenes, just learning the basics, but with the intentions that I wanted to make infused candy, gummy worms, stuff like that,” he said. “Stuff that I didn’t see on the market at the time.”
Hampton also became involved in hemp after experiencing the medicinal value of the plant. “I was a college student at the time,” he said, “and was looking for some relief with some back pain, some sore muscles from the gym. And my dad had actually bought me some CBD oil to test out for my birthday. And it was from a local farm up here in northern Wisconsin. That helped me a ton with what I needed it for.”

Hampton realized that there were not many such products marketed to younger people like him. He grew his business online before opening a storefront during Small Business Week in 2021. Today Hampton, 29, owns and operates his business alongside his wife and five employees. People of all ages come into his store. “In-store, we have a lot of customers who come in just looking for relief,” he said. Many of the customers are seeking a remedy for anxiety, as well as “a large handful of customers that have chronic pain,” he said. 
Steve’s Hemp carries flowers, vapes, gummies, candies, topical ointments and other products. Diener, who specializes in culinary cannabis products, makes everything from Nerds-covered gummies (a popular product he calls “Stoney Bites”) to other sweets. Diener describes his customers as “such a community of oddballs and people who have unique personalities. And that’s what I’ve always hoped for, and that’s kind of what I come from and who I am a person. People authentic to themselves.” 
The cost of  prohibition
Before the federal ban on THC-derived hemp products was added to the bill to reopen the government, Republican lawmakers in Wisconsin were already working on bills to restrict or prohibit the industry in the state. Representatives Lindee Brill (R-Sheboygan Falls), Jim Piwowarczyk (R-Hubertus) and others introduced what they called “a common-sense corrective bill” to close the “loophole” that allowed what they called “dangerous, psychoactive THC-laced products to proliferate in Wisconsin.” 
The lawmakers pointed to health advisory warnings issued by federal agencies about the use of delta-9 THC, and issues with unregulated markets across the country. In Wisconsin, hemp products from CBD to delta-9, HHH, THCa, and others can either be found at dispensaries where employees are often knowledgeable about their products, or at gas stations and smoke shops where customers don’t receive information and guidance. Wisconsin lawmakers have raised an alarm about emergency room visits and poison center calls linked to delta-8 THC and similar compounds, as well as concerns that children could easily purchase the products.

Hemp business owners say they often applaud common sense regulation. They also support fully legalizing cannabis in Wisconsin —  ending prohibition. To address concerns about health consequences and children’s access to cannabis, “what would really help that is regulation, not prohibition,” Hampton said.
Everything from clear packaging guidelines to age restrictions, lab testing and education about where the product comes from and what it does could be part of a legal regulatory structure, Hampton argued. Rather than allowing any gas station to carry hemp products, Hampton would like to see licensed facilities staffed by people who care about what they’re doing. “Our main goal with this business was to educate our customers, and know what’s in our product, and recommend what would work best for our customer,” he said. 
One 2024 study analyzing national poison data systems found that between 2021 and 2022, reports of exposure to delta-8 THC increased by 79%. The study also found that poison center calls for delta-8 were significantly lower in places where either delta-THC was banned, or where cannabis use was already legalized. “Consistent regulation of delta-THC across all states should be adopted,” the study recommended. Other poison center data shows that since 2022, exposures to delta-8 THC have plummeted, a trend which has continued into 2025. 
Prohibition also creates economic stagnation,  advocates contend. Tim Frey, of Ignite Dispensary and Cigar calls it “Wisconsin’s half a billion dollar loss.”
Frey lobbied against state Republican bills to restrict hemp, and he argues that hundreds of millions are essentially handed over to Michigan and Illinois every year when Wisconsinites make the sometimes difficult decision to travel across state lines to obtain cannabis. 
“Now that Minnesota is opening up, with the largest border, we’re probably going to be losing approximately up to $200 million,” Frey told Wisconsin Examiner. “And then if they came up with a small tax on hemp-derived stuff, that’s easily $100 million there, if not more, give or take. So it’s going to be around half a billion dollars that Wisconsin could use to give to law enforcement, get fentanyl off our streets, reduce property taxes, invest in roads” and other uses.

Hampton fears that now customers will go to the black market or risk being pulled over after driving to a neighboring state. “I just don’t understand why they thought that prohibition would be the right answer,” he said. 
As some Wisconsin legislators are working to enact a new prohibition on hemp products, others are trying to legalize medicinal THC cannabis in the state. Earlier this year, two-thirds of registered voters polled by Marquette Law School said that cannabis should be legalized in Wisconsin. Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers have introduced what would be one of the country’s most restrictive medicinal cannabis programs. 
Frey is cautious of the medical-cannabis-only approach, however, “because it’s very hard to qualify with some ailments,” he told the Wisconsin Examiner. He added that if Wisconsin passed a restrictive medical cannabis program, then it would open the door for the state’s indigenous tribal communities, as sovereign nations, to open their own recreational programs. “So then we would be a recreational state without the control, or the revenue,” he said.  
Diener said that when conservative lawmakers talk about cannabis, they sound at least 10 years behind the times. “I think that right now there’s such extreme viewpoints on it that are outdated, and really just don’t line up with today’s market or today’s values with the plant,” he said.
Frey believes that it’s past time Wisconsin had a serious discussion about legalization. “Limit the licenses,” he declared. “Control this, tax it, get licenses out there to responsible people that are going to do things the right way —  that card people, that do truth-in labeling, that care about the quality of their products.”
In addition to strict regulation, Diener said parents can protect their children from hemp products instead of the government banning them. “You have the responsibility just the same as if you have a gun in the home to keep your things in a safe space that your children cannot access,” Diener said. “You wouldn’t have your alcohol bottle sitting just, like, within reach or in a cupboard that your kids know they can access. Even growing up as a teen, when my mom knew that I was starting to go to parties and stuff, she would start to hide her alcohol.” 
After the federal hemp laws were changed, Piwowarczyk, in a television interview, said unsympathetically of hemp business owners that “you guys took a gamble when you decided to open up your hemp business.” 
Hampton counters that lawmakers like Piwowarczyk should “open their eyes, and look around, and actually meet with the constituents of their districts” who are the consumers driving the industry. 
Uneasy months ahead
For now, hemp distributors and their allies have until next November to adjust to the new federal restrictions. Frey said Wisconsin could provide some protection for the industry by enacting its own regulations for hemp products, similar to the way states have legalized cannabis industries despite the ongoing federal prohibition. 
There are already state-level legislative responses in the works, he said. One bill, AB 503, would redefine the definition of hemp to prohibit THC-derived products. Another, AB 606, would add hemp to the responsibilities of the agency in the Department of Revenue that regulates alcohol. A bill authored by Senate Democrats, SB 644, would create a regulated framework and age limits for hemp products, though it lacks Republican co-sponsors. Sen. Patrick Testin (R-Stevens Point) is circulating a draft bill for co-sponsorship that also regulates hemp products.

“That bill is probably the best, most common-sense written bill that I’ve seen,” Frey told the Wisconsin Examiner. While the Democratic bill would be promising, he said, he thinks it won’t gain Republican support. 
“It’s more crucial to protect this industry in Wisconsin than it is to craft the most perfect bill,” said Frey, adding that he thinks the hemp industry will get behind Testin’s bill “full force”. 
At the same time, however, Frey wonders whether the federal regulations will change by next November. He points out that the new law gives the industry a year to adapt instead of imposing a ban immediately. 
Frey thinks that if Wisconsin passes hemp regulations but the federal laws remain the same, then the hemp industry would risk losing its federal task deductions and also lose the ability to conduct interstate commerce. 
If there is no change to save the hemp industry, a cascade of effects will ripple out. Earlier this year, Hampton  opened a new manufacturing facility just down the street from the Steve’s Hemp storefront. In the middle of next year, he will likely have to close that as well, he said. 
Once the new law takes effect, “our hands are pretty much tied,” said Hampton. “My wife and I will have to find new jobs for each other, continue to make ends meet. And then those families that work for us — those employees that work for us — will have to do the same.” Until then, Diener said, “I am going to continue to serve the people who need us the most and work to continue growing this dream and keeping this dream alive.” 
Hampton and his employees “are obsessed and passionate about this industry,” Hampton said. “We started this industry with hopes to run a legal dispensary out of Wisconsin, and hopefully transition into that. Now that plan is crushed. And so we don’t know what we’re going to do. We’re just going to try to keep our hopes up, and try to fight as much as we can to keep [hemp] legal, and if that isn’t possible, get recreational cannabis pushed through the state of Wisconsin.”

Critics warn the congressional action may have unintended consequences.
The post Congress advances effort to overturn Biden-era coal leasing ban in Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s congressional delegation this week celebrated a major step toward invalidating the U.S. Bureau of Land Management’s Biden-era ban on new federal coal leasing in northeast Wyoming — home to one of the largest coal deposits and the most productive coal mines in North America.
But whether the effort will result in any new, major coal leases in the region is in doubt, and the congressional method to overturn the ban has infuriated conservation groups across the West who say it’s part of a larger GOP effort to upend decades of careful compromise to achieve “multiple use” on public lands.
Joint Resolution 130, introduced in October by U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman and Sens. Cynthia Lummis and John Barrasso, passed the U.S. House and Senate this week. The measure would overturn the ban by employing the rarely used Congressional Review Act to invalidate the BLM’s Buffalo Field Office Resource Management Plan, which was updated in December.
Under the Biden administration, the BLM suggested the ban would have little impact on the flagging industry, which primarily provides fuel to the nation’s aging fleet of coal-fired power plants, noting coal mines in the region already have legal access to enough reserves to continue mining at the same pace beyond 2040.

But both Wyoming’s all-Republican congressional delegation and the Trump administration have pointed to unprecedented electrical demands for artificial intelligence and other data computations. 
“The Biden administration’s relentless war on American energy was waged at every level, including in Wyoming’s Powder River Basin, where it halted coal leasing,” Hageman wrote Tuesday on the social media platform X. “Passing H.J. Res. 130 will restore our national energy dominance, protect Wyoming jobs and prosperity and reassert Congress’s authority over an unchecked administrative state.”
Despite a bullish outlook and moderate upticks for the industry in recent months, a test run to resume leasing federal coal in the Powder River Basin failed — some say spectacularly — in October. The BLM received a single bid for a coal tract in the Montana portion of the Powder River Basin for an unprecedented fraction of a penny per ton of coal. Days later, the agency indefinitely postponed another coal lease auction on the Wyoming side of the basin.

“It’s a sham,” Lynne Huskinson said of the notion that the Powder River Basin coal industry is being held back by the Biden-era leasing ban.
Huskinson worked for decades as a Powder River Basin coal miner in Wyoming and serves as chair of the Sheridan-based landowner advocacy group Powder River Basin Resource Council. The $186,000 bid that Navajo Transitional Energy Company offered for the 167 million-ton federal coal tract in Montana was so low that it might not have even covered “a big repair on one of their motor graders,” she asserted.
Congress is using the CRA to override previously approved management plans elsewhere in the West. Because these plans are shaped by a formal public comment process, conservation groups say overriding them flies in the face of local input about how to best manage America’s public lands. It may even invalidate other uses permitted under BLM resource management plans, such as grazing and oil and gas leases, some conservation groups say.
“Senators heard one consistent message today: Multiple-use is hard,” Center for Western Priorities Policy Director Rachael Hamby said in a statement Thursday. “Finding the balance happens on the ground, with the residents, scientists and small-business owners who know the land the best. That’s why it’s so foolish for Congress to use a blunt instrument like the Congressional Review Act to impose land management decisions from Washington.”
Gov. Mark Gordon cheered the effort to overturn the “misguided” coal leasing ban, noting the potentially long-lasting implications of using the review act. 
“When signed by the President, this action ensures that no future federal administration can authorize the large-scale termination of coal leasing in the area,” Gordon said in a prepared statement.

A red-tailed hawk at the Teton Raptor Center takes his name from the family that once ranched the land.
The post Jackson Hole’s avian ambassadors appeared first on WyoFile .","At the Teton Raptor Center in Wilson, staffers say Hardeman, an 11-year-old red-tailed hawk, has an all-too-familiar story.
A car struck the male raptor in 2017 and blinded his right eye. After being rescued and treated at the Alabama Wildlife Center, he failed a live-prey test, a requisite for release into the wild.
So he became an ambassador at the Teton Raptor Center, where he loves flight training and shredding newspapers.
The hawk’s name comes from the Hardeman family, which for decades operated the Hardeman Ranch in Wilson. The landmark Hardeman Barn is a centerpiece on the Raptor Center’s campus, where visitors can see displays and hear scientists lecture in the renovated hay loft.
Hardeman was one of three ambassadors at a recent Masters of the Sky lecture. Horous, a peregrine falcon, and Aura, a turkey vulture, completed the cast.
Horous takes the name of an Egyptian god usually depicted as a falcon. He is a retired hunting falcon who also likes shredding newspapers.
Aura, a turkey vulture, came to the center after people unintentionally imprinted on her. Named through a community contest, her moniker derives from the scientific label Cathartes aura, roughly translated to “cleansing breeze” and referencing her species’ role in cleaning up carcasses.
The Raptor Center, a nonprofit focused on education, research and conservation, offers a suite of public programs. The center has conducted groundbreaking migratory research on red-tailed hawks and other birds.

Wyoming needs to live up to the Cowboy Code by taking care of our own and doing what has to be done to ensure our neighbors have stable housing, writes guest columnist Kirsten Prosenick.
The post Homelessness isn’t just an urban problem appeared first on WyoFile .","As a state that prides itself on “equality,” we, as Wyomingites, must ask: Can resources be accessed equally? To understand why many Wyoming families are struggling, start with housing. Rising rents and shrinking resources show that hard work alone can no longer keep pace. These growing challenges have led to increased homelessness, yet stigma frames it as a personal shortcoming instead of a focus on policy breakdown. That narrative contradicts the Cowboy Code’s spirit — where we “take care of our own” and “do what has to be done” by confronting problems head-on, such as homelessness and an inadequate social safety net. 

Opinion

To put this into perspective, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development estimated that in 2024, Wyoming had the highest rate of unaccompanied youth in the country (20%), and further reported over 500 individuals experiencing homelessness at that time. But advocates warn those numbers are likely low, because HUD does a point-in-time count of people staying at shelters, transitional housing programs, or places not meant for habitation, like their cars. What about those who fall into homelessness after that count or who are crashing on a friend’s floor. The problem could be worse than it seems. So, what does this mean for our future? Without a real understanding of the problem, homelessness rates are likely to increase and affordable housing is likely to be less of a priority.
The image of homelessness is often people living on the street in densely populated cities, which leaves the struggles of rural states hidden in plain sight. And as HUD points out, places like Wyoming are up against unique barriers; there are too few shelters, limited social services and resources spread thin across vast distances.
Additionally, homelessness in Wyoming is driven by multiple, overlapping pressures: high rents that outweigh wages, a shortage of affordable housing, and challenges such as mental health struggles and substance use. These hardships are only intensified by Wyoming’s brutal winters, which make life on the streets not just difficult but dangerous. According to Wyoming’s Administration and Information, rental costs in 2024 increased to more than $1,000 a month, which is a complex barrier for anyone earning Wyoming’s minimum wage. Yet cultural and political resistance to raising wages persists, often framed as a matter of personal responsibility. The truth is when full-time work can’t cover the basics, the problem isn’t personal failure — it’s a fixed system that refuses to match up with the cost of living. 
Addressing the homelessness crisis requires a multidimensional, prolonged approach, but with consistency and integration, it is a manageable task. 
First, promoting access to affordable housing is essential. Programs such as the Wyoming Community Development Authority and Housing First have proven effective for some Wyoming towns. Those programs could expand to benefit the homeless population statewide. 
Second, raising awareness and increasing funding for mental health services and addiction treatment is also extremely significant. The key here is to understand that while these services may be available, they may not be affordable. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, in 2021, there were 20,000 Wyoming locals who did not receive appropriate mental health care; 52.6% of this population did not seek care due to the cost. Keep in mind, these services aim to promote safety and stability within society. 
Lastly, collaboration with the state of Wyoming’s governing officials, nonprofit organizations and local advocates could help promote inclusivity and build a uniform understanding of the seriousness of such social problems.
Equally important, Wyoming must confront the stigma surrounding homelessness and start advocating policy change rather than isolation and marginalization. By investing in sustainable solutions and standing with those struggling, the Equality State could live up to its name in more than words, and more importantly, exemplify human decency toward those who are struggling.

A hallway in La Follette High School in Madison. (Wisconsin Examiner photo)Initial special education reimbursement payments to school districts this year will be about 35% of their costs — about 7 percentage points below the estimated rate approved in the state budget.
When the 2025-27 state budget was passed by the state Legislature and signed by Gov. Tony Evers in July, policymakers boasted that their investments would bring the special education reimbursement rate to a historic 42% in the first year of the budget and 45% in the second year. 
While school districts will still receive more aid for special education costs this year than in previous state budgets, it appears that the state funding set aside probably won’t be enough to reach the rate that was estimated when the budget was signed in July.
The Department of Public Instruction (DPI) announced in a bulletin on Monday that initial special education payments for November through March would reimburse schools 35% of their special education costs. While DPI uses a slightly lower rate to avoid overpayment and this is not the final reimbursement rate, Chris Bucher, DPI director of communications, said in an email that the agency has anticipated the rate falling below the estimate.
Special education reimbursement rates for public school districts can vary from the estimate because it is a sum certain allocation, meaning that payments come from a fixed pot of money.
During the budget process, public education advocates, DPI and Gov. Tony Evers called for that to change to a sum sufficient allocation, meaning that the amount of money provided by the state would be enough to meet the set reimbursement rate. Republican lawmakers rejected the request.
Bucher said having a lower reimbursement rate than what is estimated has been relatively typical with budgets, given that there is a fixed amount of state funding as well as a rising amount of unaided special education costs and a rising number of students with disabilities.
According to a Legislative Fiscal Bureau memo released Thursday, in 2024-25 the state had appropriated about $574 million to special education aid. When the 2023-25 state budget was passed, the appropriation was estimated to bring schools to a 33.3% rate in each year of the budget. In November 2024, DPI estimated a rate of 29.16%, and the final rate for that school year was 30.64%.
Based on cost increases in recent years, DPI projected costs would grow by 4% for its 2025-27 state budget request. It had estimated that aidable costs would be about $1.8 billion in 2025-26 and $1.9 billion in 2026-27. Those estimates were also used as Evers prepared his budget request and as the Legislature prepared the budget. 
According to the new memo, DPI now projects that aidable costs in 2024-25 increased by an estimated 9% — a rate more than twice the original projection when the 2025-27 budget was being drafted.
For the 2025-27 state budget, the DPI requested about $2 billion across the biennium to cover special education costs for school at a rate of 90% by the second year of the budget and to change the funding from “sum certain” to “sum sufficient.”
Gov. Tony Evers also requested the change from sum certain to sum sufficient, though he requested increasing it to a 60% rate by the second year. The Joint Committee on Finance denied those requests instead choosing to provide $207 million in the first year of the budget to cover an estimated 42% of costs and $297 million in the second year to cover costs at an estimated rate of 45%.
Advocates called attention to the reimbursement rate in statements this week, saying the funding system needs an overhaul.
Peggy Wirtz-Olsen, president of the Wisconsin Education Association Council, the state’s largest teachers union, blamed the rate on lawmakers, saying that they “turned their backs on our most vulnerable children, failing to deliver on promised special education funding and leaving our students without the supports they need to succeed in school.” 
“This shortfall will mean even more communities forced into holding school referendums in 2026 just to meet basic needs, causing uncertainty and hardship for students who deserve better from their elected leaders,” Wirtz-Olsen said in a statement. 
Wirtz-Olsen said lawmakers have been “caught lying about the scant resources they are providing.” 
“It’s time for these politicians to fix Wisconsin’s school funding formula and fulfill what the state Constitution requires,” she said. “Taxpayers have had enough of picking up the tab on our property taxes to make up for their refusal to fund schools. If they won’t take action for the students who most need help, educators and families will.” 
Beth Swedeen, executive director of the Wisconsin Board for People with Developmental Disabilities, called on the state to change the way it funds school districts. 
“It’s time to build a budget that is rooted in real costs and can provide budget certainty to schools and parents that the promises made by the legislature will translate into real dollars schools can use,” Swedeen said in a statement. “We should not be in this position cycle after cycle where students with disabilities and schools are undercut by accounting codes.”

The latest round of cuts by Magellan of Idaho would affect peer support specialists who help people navigate mental health treatment, and specialized mobile teams that treat patients with severe mental illness who have struggled in routine treatment settings. The cuts, which call to end the services on Dec. 1, stem from the state’s attempts to avoid a projected budget shortfall.
Mental health providers worry the cuts could spur more violent critical incidents as people with severe mental health issues lose accessible treatment, said Laura Scuri, who co-owns Access Behavioral Health Services in Boise and leads the Idaho Association of Community Providers’ behavioral health subgroup.
“We don’t see that with people who are in treatment, any even low-level treatment,” Scuri told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview. “It’s the people who are not in treatment, who cannot engage in treatment. Those are the people that eventually become so psychotic that they engage and there’s a critical incident for the community.”

 Program cuts come as state attempts to avoid projected budget shortfall

After the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare cut pay rates by 4% for Medicaid medical providers and for private companies that run Medicaid benefits, which are called managed care organizations, Magellan announced plans to cut pay rates for Medicaid mental health services by 4-15%.
‘This perfect storm:’ How Idaho Medicaid cuts could affect everyone’s health care access

In a statement, Magellan Health spokesperson Kristen Durocher said the contractor doesn’t have many options for cuts. 
“Magellan understands and supports the State of Idaho in carrying out actions required to balance the state budget as required by the Idaho Constitution,” she said. “Given the limited available levers to reach budget targets, Magellan has worked with (the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare) to identify changes to optional programs that are allowable under the law. We will continue to partner with the state, providers, and members as we all navigate the changes before us.”
For the past two months, Health and Welfare has been working with managed care organizations to find ways to cut spending in their contracts, agency spokesperson AJ McWhorter said in a statement.
“The department and Magellan agree that there are no easy options to achieve the needed budget reductions,” he said. 
The state is planning to extend 4% Medicaid provider pay rate cuts for another year — after Idaho Gov. Brad Little permanently extended budget cuts. 
Even after the cuts, budget estimates released last week show the state is still on track to end this fiscal year in June 2026 with a $58.3 million budget deficit, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. Idaho’s revenues have dwindled the first few months of this fiscal year, months after the Legislature and Gov. Little approved $450 million in tax cuts.
The programs are likely being cut because there’s many services that Magellan “legally can’t touch,” Scuri said. 
“We have a constitutional requirement to balance that budget. And they walked out of there without that budget balanced last year. And this is the result of that,” she said. 
 What are the programs being cut?

One of the services Magellan is cutting is a program to treat patients with persistent, severe mental health issues who have struggled in traditional treatment options.
Through the program, called Assertive Community Treatment, doctors and nurses visit patients in their homes to help them stay on medication. By cutting the program, the state is shifting costs to jails and psychiatric hospitals, which are more expensive, said Tom Tueller, clinical director for Tueller Counseling Service in eastern Idaho, which runs a local team of providers on the program.

About 400 to 500 people across the state are on the program, he said. Many of them will end up homeless if the program ends, he said.
“It might cut the pot of money for the (Department of) Health and Welfare. But it’s going to add huge amounts of money to the hospitals and the jail systems, because that’s where these people are going to end up,” he told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview. 
It could also risk more violent episodes in the community, Tueller said. 
In 2010, the man accused of shooting Ryan Mitchell in Pocatello was receiving treatment through the program — until it faced cuts, Tueller said. 
Mitchell was visiting a local coffee shop when a 54-year-old man with schizophrenia shot him at point-blank range in the back, the Inlander reported.
Mitchell survived, with several severe medical complications. A month later, he asked political candidates at a public forum why he got shot, the weekly newspaper reported.
“The fact of the matter is this was caused by recent budget cuts to our mental health program. My question is … What are you going to do to fix it?” Mitchell said, according to the Inlander. 
With Magellan’s move to end the program, Tuller said “we’re going to have more victims out there like Ryan Mitchell.”

Magellan also plans to cut peer support services, a program in which people recovering from mental illness help support people throughout treatment. 
Executive Director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness Idaho Beth Markley said the cuts will be devastating. 
In rural areas, she said some of the state’s hundreds of peer support specialists drive hundreds of miles each month to meet people.
“There’s just no replacement for the service,” Markley said in an interview. “I feel very strongly that this is like somebody just went down a spreadsheet and started crossing lines off until they got to the required cuts — and didn’t take a look at like, ‘What is the most efficient use of taxpayer money for the results that you get?’”
Some substance abuse rehabilitation providers are also facing a cut from Magellan: They can’t do programming in the same buildings they offer sober housing in.
The cuts — on top of the recent pay cuts announced earlier — are unlike anything providers have seen, said Jason Coombs, founder of Brick House Recovery, a substance abuse treatment center in Boise and Idaho Falls.
“Our rates are going down, the cost of hiring and salaries is going up. And it’s scary times. I wouldn’t be surprised to see some treatment providers fold up, and minimizing access to care over these changes,” Coombs said.

This week the Trump administration, with the most corrupt cabinet in the nation’s history, moved to gut the Endangered Species Act while the world is experiencing what’s been called the “Sixth Mass Extinction Event” with more than a million species facing extinction from human-caused impacts.  
Since Montana retains virtually all of the species that were here when Lewis and Clark’s expedition rolled through more than 200 years ago, it’s particularly bad news. A number of those native species already listed as threatened or endangered could now face extinction – which would leave our state much diminished simply to favor extractive industries.
This is nothing new from a president and administration that seem to live in the past.  But inexorably denying the ever-worsening climate crisis and the fact that you cannot infinitely exploit finite resources for the demands of continuous growth does not make it reality. 
The changes would leave species listed as threatened exempt from any “blanket” protections and require formulation of extensive species-specific plans that could drag out for years, perhaps outliving the species they were supposed to be protecting and restoring. 
Likewise, although the Endangered Species Act didn’t mention “climate change” specifically, the new rules would intentionally deny consideration of the impacts from the radically changing climate that are occurring far faster than previously predicted and across a much larger spectrum of land, sea and air. 
As is so despicably common for this administration, the “favors” would be handed out to specific industries. For instance, changing the definition of “harm,” which means “altering or destroying” habitat essential to a specie’s survival, could allow mining, logging, and oil and gas exploration and development in what is currently considered “critical habitat.”
None of this is good news for the environment, our already pounded native species, or the future of Montana or the nation.  
Moreover, most of it makes no sense at all. 
Gutting the Endangered Species Act to enable more production is the last thing the oil and gas industry needs since there’s already an “oversupply” of oil and gas – and that’s coming from OPEC, the industry, and Wall Street.  Projections are for $55 per barrel oil or lower, which is barely above the break even point for exploration and development and surely not worth forcing species to extinction to open more critical land and water habitat to oil and gas production.
Of course the administration will face immediate legal challenges, including the fact that the Supreme Court has already ruled that considering “harm” to habitat is part and parcel of the goal of the Endangered Species Act.  
Ironically, Trump’s Supreme Court may have already hamstrung the changes in its ruling that overthrew the Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council decision – namely, that government agencies should not be given broad deference in the formulation or enactment of administrative rules that go beyond the limits and specific language of the enabling laws.  While the decision was descried by environmentalists and conservationists when the decision was handed down because they thought government agencies would be on their side, it will now likely limit what Trump’s administration can do — when government isn’t on your side. 
Rest assured, this will engender a legal battle in the coming years as well as driving some of Montana’s struggling native species to extinction.  Adding insult to that injury, it’s worth noting that Bozeman’s Property and Environment Research Center and Missoula’s Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation have already gone to court in support of the changes – and should be held fully accountable for the ensuing damages they will inflict on Montana’s threatened and endangered native species.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Yellowstone-National-Park-Grizzly-bears-1024x621.jpg,,,2025-11-21 16:57:58.666732

(Photo courtesy of UFO)A Kanawha Valley organization that typically distributes food to a dozen area pantries during the winter months will start that work early this year in response to increased need. 
United Food Operations, an organization founded in 1981 by representatives of West Virginia labor unions, will partner with South Charleston plastics manufacturer Covestro to make an emergency food distribution to its 12 participating pantries on Friday morning at its Institute warehouse. 
The organization usually contributes to 12 independent food pantries in Kanawha and Putnam counties beginning each January through April.
“Because the need is extraordinary — the economy is worsening and food and utility prices keep rising — we felt this is urgent,” UFO Chair Elaine Harris said in a news release. “Once again, our sponsors and volunteers are stepping up to take action.”
Harris said Covestro reached out to UFO with the idea to do an emergency distribution.
Earlier this month, the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which helps feed more than 275,000 West Virginians, was delayed two weeks during the federal government shutdown that also left thousands of federal workers in the state without a paycheck. The state of West Virginia contributed about $13 million to West Virginia food banks during the delay to help meet the increase in demand. 
Harris said the organization’s contribution to food pantries is not as big as it once was because the cost of food has increased. 
“We had volunteers down there [Thursday] morning putting the food on the pallets. And I’ll tell you, food on the pallets doesn’t look as great as it once did because of the cost of food,” Harris said. “So we’re getting it out. The pallets aren’t as high as I’d like for them to be. But we’re doing what we can do.”
United Food Operations was founded more than 40 years ago by union representatives under the West Virginia ALF-CIO umbrella. The organization is run by volunteers on voluntary contributions from employees and employers, area businesses and government. 
People can contribute to the organization at its website, unitedfoodoperation.org or by mail at Post Office Box 20441, Charleston, W.Va. 25362. Through Dec. 1, all locations of Green’s Feed and Seed are collecting food items for the organizations as well.
“There’s different ways that people can give, and if people want to volunteer, we love volunteers,” Harris said. “Our organization is 100% volunteer[-run]. Everything we bring in goes back out. Any money, it goes back out in the form of food, or if people want to donate food.”

John Rose took a dig at U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, his opponent in the 2026 Repubian gubernatorial primary, over a clause she sponsored in a federal government funding measure. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee gubernatorial candidate U.S. Rep. John Rose is taking a dig at the frontrunner, Sen. Marsha Blackburn, with a bill passed to keep senators from suing the feds for half-a-million bucks.
Rose, a Cookeville Republican, said in an X post Nov. 12, that the Senate sneaked a “poison pill” into the government funding measure enabling senators whose phone records were searched without their knowledge in the investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot to file suit for $500,000 each.
“This is exactly why Americans despise Washington,” Rose said.
He added that it was “wrong” for the Department of Justice under former President Joe Biden to target Republicans over the Jan. 6 incident. “But that doesn’t make it right for any senator to cash in retroactively at taxpayers’ expense,” he said.
WBIR reported that Rose filed legislation to block the measure and that Blackburn planned to sue the government. The House approved a repeal this week, but the Senate isn’t expected to vote on it.
Blackburn was one of eight U.S. senators, including Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, who had their phone records accessed without notification when special counsel Jack Smith investigated the attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Asked for comment this week, Blackburn spokesperson Joey Chester pointed the Lookout to a post she made Nov. 13 on X, formerly Twitter, saying, “I support the effort to repeal the Arctic Frost provision in the government funding bill.” The name refers to the Department of Justice investigation into the riot.
“As I have said previously, this fight is not about the money. It is about holding the left accountable for the worst weaponization of government in our nation’s history.”
Asked whether Blackburn initially planned to use the new provision to sue the government over phone records, Chester declined to answer.
But Blackburn told Just the News, a conservative news site, she is planning to sue the Department of Justice and FBI for invasion of her free speech and privacy rights as a member of Congress. The move wouldn’t conflict with her opposition to the Arctic Frost provision, which allows the senators to seek monetary damages. 
Hagerty and Blackburn, who changed their stances five years ago and voted to certify Biden’s election after the Jan. 6 riot, called it a “shocking day of lawlessness” in which she and her colleagues “watched in horror as rioters breached the security of both Houses of Congress and inflicted significant property damage upon those historical halls.”
In a joint statement, they said the nation would “rise above the chaos” that took place at the Capitol. 
In March, Blackburn also said those who defended the Capitol should be recognized for heroism. Several Capitol law enforcement officers died as a result of the insurrection, one that day and four others who later committed suicide.
Yet Blackburn has said nothing about President Trump’s move to pardon those who stormed the building. Trump also went on a pardoning binge in recent weeks, letting former Tennessee House Speaker Glen Casada and his ex-chief of staff, Cade Cothren, off the hook for corruption convictions, keeping them from serving prison time.
Another Republican gubernatorial candidate, state Rep. Monty Fritts of Kingston, said he agrees with Blackburn that the Jan. 6 probe was a “horrible weaponization” of the federal government.
“But I think it was a horrible thing by those senators who put that language in that they could enrich themselves at the expense of the U.S. citizen because of the misdeeds of the Department of Justice,” Fritts said.
Sen. Lindsey Graham is the only one who said he would take advantage of the provision, though the others signed on. Fritts said he was glad to hear Blackburn and Hagerty won’t.
“Surely to goodness, they don’t need $500,000 of our money,” he said.
Don’t call me Shirley.
Saving a grassy cross
Longshot gubernatorial candidate Fritts appears to have saved a grassy cross cut into a Kingston interstate median by persuading the state not to mow it.
Kingston personnel had been cutting off-ramp exit medians along I-40 and left what Fritts described as a “discreet” cross in the landscape. Someone complained about it, and the Department of Transportation was about to cut the grass until city officials told them they didn’t want it mowed, according to Fritts.
The Kingston Republican recently posted a video on X, formerly Twitter, calling the state mowing plan the sign of a “godless” mind-set.
State Rep. Monty Fritts, a Kingston Republican and candidate for governor, raised concerns the state might mow a cross cut into the grass of a state median.
“After wiser minds came together, I think they realized they didn’t have any business doing that,” Fritts said. 
Fritts contended the cross is offensive only to “people who are lost” spiritually.
The candidate said a “centralized and overreaching” state government in Nashville is becoming “more and more like D.C.” and that one person with the Transportation Department told him the cross was comparable to graffiti spray-painted on bridges.
A spokesperson for the Department of Transportation, which is responsible for mowing interstate medians, did not respond this week to questions about the matter.
Figures didn’t add up
The Tennessee Registry of Election Finance is inviting former Franklin mayoral candidate Gabrielle Hanson to a January hearing to explain discrepancies in her campaign finance reports.
Hanson, who caused a stir by inviting a white supremacist group to intimidate people at a Franklin City Council meeting, is supposed to tell the Registry board why some of her reports from 2023 didn’t quite add up. 
The Registry initially referred the matter to the Williamson County District Attorney’s Office after Peggy Kingsbury of Franklin filed a sworn complaint alleging Hanson’s reports contained inaccurate information.
An investigation found campaign receipts and a personal loan totaling $132,753 on her reports but that her campaign expenditures, including repayment of a personal loan, totaled $158,830. That would have left her campaign nearly $27,000 in the red, but the reports showed a final balance of $73,363, according to documents.
Franklin official Gabrielle Hanson appears to launch mayor campaign sans legal filings

A Williamson County Election Commission official told the DA’s investigator the report Hanson filed was a “mess,” with white-out all over it. The campaign insisted on using paper, instead of filing online. Another staffer advised that the numbers didn’t compute.
Hanson appointed herself as treasurer in July 2023, which is allowable but can pose problems with documenting financials while campaigning, an investigator reported. Her attorney told the DA’s investigator that nobody would serve as her treasurer after her alleged connection to white nationalists was reported.
Other reports from January and March 2024, which weren’t filed with the state until July 2024 showed a forgiven loan balance at $18,810. But because of the sworn complaint, an accountant’s review and the “discovery of monies” that weren’t noted as received, a final report was amended and showed the forgiven loan balance as $49,197.
The Registry board, which also can be forgiving if folks throw themselves prostrate and beg for mercy, could levy a civil penalty against Hanson. But more than likely, all will be forgiven, only a waste of her money.
More late filings
Five years after paying a $22,000 settlement fee to the Registry for multiple shortcomings, state Rep. Joe Towns is set to appear again before the campaign finance watchdog to explain why his filings are late again.

Towns, a veteran Memphis Democrat, was fortunate in that the board agreed to reduce penalties totaling $66,000 when it voted via email to cut him some slack in April 2020, as the COVID pandemic hit. 
That came after Bill Young took over as executive director of the Bureau of Ethics and Campaign Finance and despite Towns’ declaration that he wouldn’t pay one more “copper cent” to the Registry. Towns described himself as the “prodigal son” coming home when he made his case to the Registry board that spring.
Yet he’ll have to pay a $250 civil penalty for a late filing from 2024, and he faces hearings for two other discrepancies.
Five years ago, Towns said he was protesting what he felt were heavy-handed decisions by the Registry board. It’s not clear why his filings are coming up late once more, though he said earlier this year he’d been short on staff after his longtime assistant left. He didn’t respond to a phone call or text message.

(Photo by Ariel Skelley/Getty Images)Rural Idahoans enjoy a distinct way of life. One benefit is living in a tight-knit community while also enjoying the freedom to easily access the open space around you. This lifestyle can also mean going without things you have access to in a bigger town, but health care should not be one of them. As we celebrate National Rural Health Day, let’s support and protect the hospitals that serve our rural communities. 
Twenty-seven of Idaho’s community hospitals serve rural areas, but all 51 of them treat rural patients. Half of our rural hospitals operate with razor thin margins of less than 1%. They strive to maintain crucial services, including behavioral health and maternity care. 
Those services are difficult to maintain in rural communities and are often the first to be cut when finances get tight. The recent decision to reduce provider payments by 4% for treating Medicaid patients will add to the financial vulnerability small hospitals experience. While other states experience hospital closures, Idaho has managed to combine strong fiscal stewardship with innovative solutions to avoid a devasting outcome.
Hospitals do not close without warning, but some warning lights are flashing in Idaho. About 98.2% of Idaho is designated as a Primary Care Health Professional Shortage Area, affecting 57.8% of the state’s population. Idaho ranks last in the nation for physicians per 100,000 residents, and we are well below the national standard for the number of registered nurses needed for our size. 
Shortages create barriers to health care, particularly in rural communities. Lack of health care professionals adds to the pressure on hospitals.
Without a local hospital, Idahoans are forced to travel further to receive care. This means delayed emergency services and added expense and travel time. Communities like Salmon, home to the most remote hospital in the lower 48 states, would suffer devastating effects if Steele Memorial Medical Center was forced to close. 
Benefits of a strong hospital are not limited to patient care; it also impacts the economic well-being of a community. They provide valuable jobs, make purchases from local businesses, and generate millions in local and state tax revenue. Today, rural hospitals employ over 8,000 Idahoans, and our communities would not thrive without them.
Health care providers are facing more cuts, including those in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. However, OBBBA also dedicated funding to rural health programs. 
U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, acknowledged the situation with a statement that explained, “Rural hospitals have faced ongoing issues for many years, including low patient volumes, inadequate workforces, crumbling infrastructure, outdated technology and changing reimbursement trends. The fiscal vulnerabilities they face are multifaceted and often unique to each facility. The $50 billion rural hospital fund is intended to provide immediate relief to rural hospitals while allowing facilities to establish the tools necessary to be successful in the long term.” 
Idaho seeking $1 billion in federal funds for rural health care from ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ 

The state of Idaho has submitted a request for those rural health funds. By Dec. 31, we will know how much federal funding has been approved for programs in our state. Then, Idaho legislators will vote to decide whether to allow that federal money to flow through to our rural communities. 
Idahoans who rely on a strong health care system should urge to get that money out the door as quickly as possible and into the areas where it’s needed.
Many express their love of our uniquely Idaho way of life. Rural health care is a vital part of that life. Now is the time to dedicate the resources needed to preserve it.

(Getty Images stock photo)State officials recently prioritized reducing wait times for calls into Louisiana’s child abuse hotline, but achieving that resulted in hundreds of reports to its online portal going unhandled for days. 
They included “Priority 1” incidents, involving serious risk or harm that require immediate investigation from the Department of Children and Family Services. Those should be handled within 24 hours, but some sat for up to six days before supervisors assigned them to hotline staff. 
“At this point, we’re really jeopardizing the safety of children, and I feel like the public needs to know what’s happening here because that’s completely unsafe,” said Melanie Mann, one of the roughly 50 DCFS employees who staff the hotline. She said she has turned in her resignation, effective Dec. 1, after six years with the agency.

Use the Mandated Reporter Portal



Interviews with other centralized intake staffers confirm Mann’s account of online reports piling up through the first half of November. The employees asked not to be identified because they fear repercussions at work. 
Emails and direct messages shared with the Illuminator lay out details of the decision to place online reports on the back burner and the scramble that followed to shrink the stack. 
As of Wednesday morning, the online portal backlog had been cleared. Hotline staffers were required to work overtime to accomplish the task. 
State Sen. Regina Barrow, D-Baton Rouge, has been among the more prominent voices calling for improvements in the state’s child welfare system. In an interview Thursday at the State Capitol, she said she was still gathering information on the extent of issues with the DCFS hotline and its backlog.
The senator said she has been monitoring a restructuring of the department its leaders launched last month that started with the centralized intake team.
“We are concerned about what’s happening with our children, with our babies, and the response,” Barrow said. “The restructure of the department: What does that really look like? I mean, I don’t think we have a really good handle on what that looks like and what the delivery outcomes are.”
Mann said there was never a specific directive from DCFS leadership for the hotline staff not to handle online reports during their shifts, but she said the lack of personnel and emphasis on handling calls made it inevitable that the digital portal would be neglected. 
Supervisors have to assign intake workers reports from the online portal, and they were told earlier this month they could not dole out any reports when call wait times were over five minutes. Mann and others said the hotline has been down for hours multiple days this month, including a 12-hour stretch on Nov. 9. Once the hotline was restored, the staff had to reach out to people who tried to dial in while also fielding new calls. 
This left minimal time for supervisors to assign backlogged reports to the staff during their shifts, which was no longer an option once department leadership decided Nov. 13 the backlog would only be handled through overtime. But even when the hotline was working, some staffers said hours would go by without a call, and supervisors would still not assign them online reports. 
Officials with Children and Family Services did not respond to an interview request made Monday, nor have they provided answers to questions about the backlog and hotline sent in emails. A reporter was instructed to make a public records request after asking for details Wednesday on how many neglected backlogged online reports had high priority status.    
The department did issue a news release Wednesday afternoon, saying it “has not directed staff to prioritize one reporting method over another.”
Employee interviews and internal communication shared with a reporter refute that claim, with staffers explicitly being told as recently as Tuesday they could not start working on backlogged portal reports until their shifts were over.

Who uses the online portal and why
The hotline is supposed to be the first option for the public to report suspected child abuse, along with law enforcement when a situation needs immediate intervention. 
The DCFS online portal was set up for mandatory reporters, which include first responders, hospital staff, daycare workers and others who frequently interact with children. Depending on the nature of the abuse, they are required to contact police or the Department of Children and Family Services — and in many instances both must be notified. 
See a list of reporting requirements below
Online reporting is also a preferred option for individuals who aren’t comfortable sharing sensitive, graphic details about child abuse with someone over the phone, Mann said.
Mandatory reporters are urged to call the DCFS hotline first when they feel a child is in imminent danger, but Mann said many of them turn to the online portal when they can’t get through. 
“No one’s going to sit on the phone for two hours and hope that they’ll get someone to answer the phone,” Mann said, adding that she typically sees three or four online reports during each a normal 8.5-hour shift that involve children who face imminent risk. Her colleagues shared comparable numbers. 
Hotline staffers said leadership set a goal earlier his month for calls to its child abuse hotline to be answered in under 5 minutes. Children and Family Services did not respond to questions about the average wait time. 
Louisiana child welfare agency shuffle raises questions over abuse hotline staffing

The most recent state audit from fiscal year 2022 found the average was just under seven minutes with nearly 1,200 calls abandoned each month when people chose not to wait. That was 16% of the more than 6,300 calls made monthly.  
Last week, the hotline staff was asked to volunteer for overtime to tackle the online portal backlog, though they could only be compensated with paid time off, rather than extra pay, according to DCFS emails. Overtime became mandatory Monday after the volunteer approach didn’t eliminate the backlog.  
Questions about the backlog from the news media also put pressure on DCFS leaders to devote more after-hours manpower to the task, Mann said.  
“Failure to comply could lead to a recommendation for disciplinary action,” a DCFS manager wrote in an email to the centralized intake staff. The potential consequences include termination, according to state civil service guidelines. 
Because the abuse hotline is staffed around the clock, it meant workers had to log extra hours well into the night and early morning  working on online reports. Some staffers said they had no advance notice of the required overtime, leaving them little time to arrange care for their children. 
Supervisors were also required to clear 10 reports after the end of their shift, which Mann said is the equivalent of five hours of work. They were expected to work 24 hours straight if necessary, she said.   
“I believe that was a cover-up for [leadership’s] poor decision-making,” Mann said.
State Rep. Stephanie Berrault, R-Slidell, sits on the Louisiana House Select Committee on Women and Children and the chamber’s health committee, both of which handle matters pertaining to child welfare. In an interview Thursday, she said she was aware of efforts being made to improve the DCFS abuse report intake process.  
“Sometimes in transition, transition can look a little messy,” Berrault said. “But we are all closely following to make sure that where we’re going is going to get us to a place where we’re better responding to any reports, whether that’s through a portal or on phone. We are all very concerned to make sure that that’s all being addressed.”


Let us know what you think...


 

Backlog cleared, for now
The online portal backlog had surpassed 350 reports as of Nov. 13 when staffers were asked to volunteer for overtime. As of 10 a.m. Monday, there were 218 online reports that had yet to be assigned, leading to the mandatory overtime directive.
The backlog was around 100 late Tuesday afternoon when a DCFS manager sent a direct message to the intake staff telling them to notify her when their shift was over so she could assign them reports from the backlog. One hotline worker asked if they could process portal reports if they completed all their tasks before the end of their shift.
“You cannot begin your portals in your No ACD time,” the manager responded, referring to the last 30 minutes of a shift when workers don’t have to answer calls so they can complete required administrative tasks.
The backlog was eliminated as of 7 a.m. Wednesday, according to hotline staffers. The department’s news release in the afternoon said the same, adding there was “no wait time to speak with an agent.”
“I want to publicly thank the many hotline professionals who continue to take calls, process reports, and support their colleagues,” DCFS Secretary Rebecca Harris said in the statement. “Their commitment reflects the mission of this department.”
Mann said responsibility for the online portal backlog lies squarely with Harris and DCFS Assistant Secretary Bret Hanemann, who are restructuring centralized intake. Its staff is currently composed of remote workers, nearly all of whom will have to report to regional DCFS offices next month when they will likely be assigned to jobs handling cases in the field. The department is currently hiring to help staff a call center at the department’s offices in downtown Baton Rouge. These new employees will answer hotline calls and receive online reports.
Just because the backlog has been whittled down does not mean it won’t happen again, according to Mann, who predicted the reorganization and recent policy changes will adversely affect staffing at the department.
“They come in, they make these demands, they don’t understand what meeting those demands will entail, and the result is tragedy for children,” Mann said.

(Photo by Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)When Colorado Democrats assumed full control of state government in 2019, left-leaning lawmakers arrived at the state Capitol with a to-do list full of legislative priorities that had been blocked by Republicans and moderates in previous years.
 
Connecting the news in Colorado to the big picture.

Among them was a stronger pay transparency law, aimed at helping to close persistent disparities in wages along gender and racial lines. Backed by groups that advocate for economic and social justice, including 9to5 Colorado and the Colorado Center on Law and Policy, Senate Bill 19-85, the Equal Pay For Equal Work Act, was passed on mostly party-line votes and was signed into law by Gov. Jared Polis in May 2019.
Democrats enacted the law, which required employers to list pay ranges for all job openings and to maintain detailed records of their pay rates, over the objections of the Colorado Chamber of Commerce and a long list of business groups, who argued that the new burdens on employers would end up hurting the workers the bill was intended to help.
But six years later, there’s no evidence that those unintended negative consequences have come to pass in Colorado, a new working paper released this week by the National Bureau of Economic Research found. On the contrary, the study suggests positive “spillover” effects have led to across-the-board wage increases for Colorado workers.

“Overall, we find evidence that pay transparency in postings increased competition in the labor market, leading to positive impacts on wages even for incumbent workers and firms that were always posting wages, neither of which were directly targeted by the policy,” wrote the study’s authors, economists David Arnold, Simon Quach and Bledi Taska.
The study examined self-reported earnings and quarterly federal wage data from the two-year period surrounding the law’s effective date of Jan. 1, 2021. Both data sets show that worker pay rose 1.3% higher in Colorado when compared to other states.
Those positive effects for employees occurred despite the fact that compliance with the law isn’t universal; the NBER study found the percentage of job postings disclosing salary data rose from 35% to 70% in the year following implementation. More recent analyses have estimated that 1 in 5 job postings in Colorado are still noncompliant with the law.
The vast majority of complaints about violations of the transparency law are resolved through voluntary compliance letters, according to Colorado Department of Labor and Employment data. In 10 cases, CDLE has issued citations that included fines against employers, including a $298,000 fine against DaVita this year and a $79,500 fine against Lockheed Martin in 2022.

– Authors of a study of Colorado's pay transparency law


The Colorado law, one of the first of its kind in the nation, made headlines after it went into effect in 2021, when The Wall Street Journal reported on a number of large national employers who were seeking remote workers but excluding applicants from Colorado. Conservative pundits seized on those reports as an example of big government and liberal do-gooderism making things worse.
“Many employers are avoiding hiring Coloradans altogether,” wrote Ben Murrey of the Independence Institute in a 2021 op-ed. “Rather than helping women in the workforce, the law is disqualifying them from certain jobs entirely and creating a new equal pay of $0.00 per hour for the Colorado workers — men and women — who are missing out on good jobs.”

Business groups have continued to lobby for changes in the law. In 2023, the conservative Common Sense Institute listed SB-85 among the labor and employment policies that were harming the state’s growth and competitiveness.
But the NBER paper, which analyzed a comprehensive data set of job postings from labor market analytics firm Lightcast, found no impact on the overall number of jobs posted in Colorado from 2020 to 2021. Nor did it find evidence that employers changed requirements pertaining to education, skills or experience in their job postings to offset the increase in wages.
“Extending to all policy changes in our study period, we similarly find no impact on aggregate employment measured in the (quarterly wage data),” the study says. “As a result, the pay transparency laws do not appear to have any negative impacts on employment.”
Finally, the paper addresses concerns that employers may be avoiding complying with the law’s intent by posting excessively wide salary ranges — increasing “pay dispersion.” There’s no evidence that pay dispersion increased in Colorado in the year following SB-85’s implementation, the authors found.
“We find that employers are not posting wider salary ranges in their vacancies,” they wrote. “The policy does not decrease the informativeness of job postings.”

(Photo by Leila Navidi/Star Tribune)This story was first published by ProPublica in collaboration with the Star Tribune. It contains graphic descriptions of sexual abuse.
The girl pleaded not to go.
She fought with her father on the drive over, screaming and crying in his truck until they arrived at the office building for Bruckelmyer Brothers, a home construction company on the outskirts of Duluth, Minnesota. She was just entering her first years of grade school.
In the office, two men were waiting. One of them was Clint Massie, who the girl had recently told her parents had touched her genitals and groped her under her shirt. The other was Daryl Bruckelmyer, a preacher and leader of the Old Apostolic Lutheran Church down the road, where the girl’s family worshipped. Massie was a respected member of the congregation. Bruckelmyer had asked them all to the meeting, according to the girl’s account to police years later.
In front of the girl, her father and Bruckelmyer, Massie asked her for forgiveness. Looming over her, the three men wept. Then the girl’s dad and preacher allowed the man who had been sexually abusing her since kindergarten to hug her.
“It was one of the worst things ever,” she told police some 15 years later.
In accordance with one of the core tenets of their church, the matter was resolved. It was forgiven. It should now be forgotten. If she spoke of it again, she would be guilty of having an unforgiving heart and the sins would become hers.
But she could never forget. And neither could the other children.
Over the course of about 20 years in two states, Massie had, according to court documents and by his own admission, sexually abused children within the Old Apostolic Lutheran Church, or OALC, community. He touched girls under blankets when their parents were present, in the backseat of a car with other passengers — even in the pews at church. His abuse was such an open secret among the tight-knit congregation that mothers warned their daughters to stay away from him.
Some former victims, as adults, confronted preachers, including Bruckelmyer, about what Massie had done to them. Church leaders told Massie to stay away from the congregation’s children, and they sent him to a therapist who specialized in sex offender treatment.
But they never reported Massie’s crimes to police, as required by the law. Instead, Bruckelmyer and other leaders in the church encouraged the victims to take part in forgiveness sessions — which allowed Massie, now 50, to continue abusing children, according to an investigation by the Minnesota Star Tribune and ProPublica.

Massie did not respond to requests for comment but has denied abuse allegations relating to some individual victims in pending lawsuits. In December 2024, he pleaded guilty to four counts of felony criminal sexual conduct with victims under the age of 13. In March, a judge sentenced him to 7 1/2 years in prison. Church officials, including Bruckelmyer, were not charged in connection with Massie’s crime, but prosecutors said they should have done more to stop him.
“It gives the appearance of a group of people who are not just trying to protect someone — but something,” Mike Ryan, the St. Louis County assistant district attorney who prosecuted Massie, said at his sentencing. “And they have enabled something awful here.”
Law enforcement there first became aware of the allegations against Massie in 2017. They said that the church’s lack of cooperation — including pressuring potential witnesses and victims to stay quiet about the abuse and preachers failing to report it to authorities — was a major factor in the delay in bringing charges.
Bruckelmyer declined to comment or to answer a detailed list of questions. But in a 2023 interview with a St. Louis County detective, he acknowledged knowing about Massie’s sexual abuse and didn’t dispute that he took part in forgiveness sessions involving Massie and his victims.
He said it was up to the victims to report the crimes to police, a clear misreading of the law for mandated reporters — doctors, teachers and others who are required to report crimes against children.
“We don’t protect either one,” Bruckelmyer said of sexual abusers and their victims.
Bruckelmyer also told police his actions followed church protocol. An internal church document, obtained by the Star Tribune and ProPublica, suggests that, when appropriate, church leaders and others facilitate “a conversation with both parties together” — an action that experts who work with abuse victims say can add to a victim’s trauma. While the document praises the police and the justice system, it doesn’t mention mandatory reporting laws and gives preachers wide latitude on whether to involve police.

Kimberly Lowe, a lawyer and crisis manager for the church, said its preachers are unpaid and therefore might not be legally required to report sexual abuse of children. Asked if she believes the preachers are mandated reporters under Minnesota law, Lowe would only say that the language of the statute is unclear.
Bruckelmyer’s church, Woodland Park, is one of two OALC congregations north of Duluth, in the bluff region above Lake Superior. Some members live nearby, in a rural, forest-lined community. Members are not obviously identifiable by their clothing — they dress modestly but modernly, in muted colors and long skirts. Women do not wear makeup, jewelry or open-toed shoes and they keep their hair up in a bun, giving rise to the nickname “bunners.” According to church literature, members are to live simple, modest lives like Jesus did; television, music and dancing are seen as sinful, according to former members.
On a recent Sunday, the modern, unadorned sanctuary of the Woodland Park church, which seats 1,000, was full of families, parents soothing babbling and crying infants, older children clutching baggies of candy or toy cars.
At the close of the sermon, the preacher asked the entire congregation for forgiveness, which kicked off “movements” — a portion of the service when congregants embraced and begged one another for forgiveness for various sins, frequently in tears.
OALC is a conservative Christian revival movement that came to the U.S. with 19th-century settlers from Norway, Finland and Sweden, and it is not affiliated with any mainstream Lutheran denominations. There is no official count, but one academic study estimated 31,000 members worldwide as of 2016, with most in the United States. The church is rapidly growing, experts say, and the member count today is likely much higher. OALC’s emphasis on large families has created booms in places like Washington state and Duluth.
There are 33 OALC churches in the U.S. and Canada. Only men hold leadership positions. The less formal nature of OALC structure — a spokesperson said there’s no headquarters in the U.S. — means that, unlike sexual abuse scandals in the Catholic Church or Southern Baptist Convention, there’s no central authority to hold accountable. Still, news of the criminal case against Massie spread widely in the insular OALC, inspiring more victims to come forward in Minnesota and other states.
St. Louis County investigators say they have been contacted by current and former church members in South Dakota and Washington who allege they were victims of sexual abuse that was never reported to law enforcement. The Star Tribune and ProPublica have interviewed more than a dozen alleged victims of Massie and of other church members in Wyoming, Maryland and Michigan.
By forgiving men like Massie, prosecutors and police said, preachers created a situation where the alleged victims had to worship next to their alleged abusers — and allowed Massie to escape arrest and prosecution for years.
“He was so brazen about it — and there was so little done about it — that he thought it was permission,” Ryan said.

‘Church knows’ 
For the girl who said she was pressured to forgive Massie at Bruckelmyer’s office, the silence that followed only compounded her trauma. She reported struggling with debilitating anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder in her teens. She grew tense every time she walked into the church, especially when she saw Massie holding another little girl.
“I lived in darkness for so many years of my life because I couldn’t talk about it,” the girl said in a recorded interview with police. “Multiple times in my life I wanted to die.”
When she was 16 and in counseling, she told her therapist how Massie had abused her. The therapist reported it to the police, which is how the St. Louis County Sheriff’s Office in Duluth first learned about Massie in summer 2017.
Sgt. Jessica LaBore was the investigator assigned to the case. In a recorded interview, the girl reluctantly told LaBore how she used to sit with Massie and his wife, Sarah, at church, just a few rows from the front. Massie would snake his hands up her skirt and touch her thighs and genitals. Another time, at a gathering at the home of her parents’ friends, she said, Massie told her to get a blanket and began touching her underneath it, with her mom and dad nearby.
She told LaBore that she’d reported the abuse to a preacher, Calvin Raisanen, and that her mother had spoken to Bruckelmyer about it, according to police documents and a recording of the interview obtained through a public records request. Raisanen did not respond to requests for comment. In her own conversation with LaBore, the girl’s mother confirmed that Massie had asked forgiveness from her husband and daughter years ago.
Like some victims in the records from Massie’s case, she declined to speak to reporters for this story and is not being identified because the news organizations typically don’t name victims of sex crimes without their consent.
In an email to reporters, she wrote that she is still a member of the church and feels supported by its community: “I truly believe I’m in the right place.”

When LaBore interviewed Massie, he confirmed some important details about the allegations: Bruckelmyer was aware that several girls had accused Massie of sexual abuse. And he remembered asking for forgiveness at his preacher’s business office.
LaBore did not respond to requests for comment, but police reports show that the girl’s family stopped cooperating with the investigation. The mother told her that preachers at the church had spoken to Massie and that he’d “learned his lesson,” though the mother believed that Massie had “continued to sexually assault children after this point,” according to LaBore’s notes.
LaBore referred the case for charges to Deputy St. Louis County Attorney Jon Holets. In a statement to the Star Tribune and ProPublica, Holets said he also spoke to the victim’s mother, who informed him “that there had been therapeutic intervention, that ‘they were good’” and that her daughter did not want anything more to be done. Without the girl’s cooperation, Holets said he decided he could not bring charges against Massie, an outcome he said gives him “heartache” to this day.
Three years later, Massie again came to the attention of the sheriff’s office. Two crime-reporting hotlines received anonymous tips saying Massie had sexually assaulted “little girls” over the course of three decades. “Church knows but no action,” reads a police summary of one of the tips.
This time, LaBore went to Bruckelmyer. According to her notes, Bruckelmyer said the church encourages abuse victims to go to police, but he told her he believed it was “on them to do that.”
LaBore explained the state’s mandated reporting law to Bruckelmyer and told him that he and others at the church could be charged criminally if “somebody that they already know about” were to keep abusing children and they failed to report it.
“We are finding out from our investigations that these Mandated Reports are not being made, and instead, these incidents are being dealt with within the church,” she wrote in a departmental memo to update other detectives. “Sometimes the preachers are facilitating in the asking for forgiveness.”
For the second time, Holets decided not to bring charges, though this time it was about church preachers rather than Massie. In a statement to reporters, Holets said law enforcement decided to try to “educate” church leaders about their legal responsibility to report the sexual abuse of children.
“I believed it was more effective to work with existing leadership to influence practices and attitudes regarding child abuse reporting, rather than to pursue criminal enforcement at that stage,” Holets wrote. “That said, criminal charges for failure to report remain a possibility in such cases.”
When LaBore spoke to Bruckelmyer, she read him the entire mandated reporter law over the phone, line by line, then texted it to him.
Haunted by silence
In 2023, a call to police breathed new life into the case.
A woman told police that she’d been sexually abused repeatedly as a kid. Her abuser was a relative: Clint Massie.
The case landed on the desk of Sgt. Adam Kleffman of the St. Louis County Sheriff’s Office. He interviewed the victim and listened to the different ways the woman said Massie sexually abused her: the nights when she slept over after helping tend to his horses, the day when she rode a tractor with him, or swam with him and other members of her family at the lake.
Her mom had reported Massie to a preacher when she was a child, she told Kleffman. At the time, the preacher promised to handle it, she said, and told her mother never to speak of it again, not even to her husband. Later, she went through a session with Bruckelmyer, similar to the other girl, where she was pressured to forgive Massie and forget the abuse.
As an adult, she was alarmed to see Massie in church, hugging and kissing children about the same age she was when the abuse began, which is why she’d felt a duty to report it all these years later, she said.
“I went back to the same preacher, which is Daryl [Bruckelmyer], and said, ‘Why is he still able to hold kids and whatever?’” she recalled to Kleffman in a recorded interview. “And he’s like: ‘I don’t know. Like, we’ve told him that he’s not supposed to, but he still does.’”
Kleffman picked up where LaBore left off and contacted the girl who spoke to their office in 2017. She was now in her early 20s, married, a new mom living in Washington state. In a recorded conversation, she told Kleffman that the trauma — and in particular, the mandate that she remain silent about it — still haunted her.
Though the woman had tried to put time and distance between herself and Massie, Massie’s wife, Sarah, had asked for a meeting about a year earlier when the woman returned to Duluth for a visit. At a Starbucks, she said, Sarah Massie told her that the abuse was no big deal and she needed to forget about what happened. The conversation, the woman said, was “horrible.”
Sarah Massie declined to comment for this story.
The woman agreed to be part of the police investigation but told Kleffman that she had little faith it would go anywhere. It did not, after all, go anywhere last time.
“I can tell you,” Kleffman said, “you should have lots of faith in me.”
The investigator now had two victims. They gave him the names of others they suspected had also been abused by Massie. Kleffman tried to contact them, but some were reluctant to cooperate. One woman told Kleffman that Massie had asked for forgiveness. The sin, she said in the recorded call, was “washed away in the blood of reconciliation.”
“It is gone forever,” she told Kleffman.
“So you’re following what the church says to do,” Kleffman replied.
“I am following what God says to do,” the woman told him, before hanging up.

‘There could be hundreds’ 
On Feb. 10, 2023, Massie sat opposite Kleffman and Investigator Tony McTavish in a beige, windowless room at the sheriff’s office in Duluth. In a video of the interrogation, Massie downplayed the allegations as a series of accidents and misunderstandings. But as the 90-minute interrogation progressed, his demeanor shifted. He admitted he’d felt a “tinge” of a “sick, perverted thing” when, he claimed, one very young girl had pulled his hand to her vagina before he realized what was happening.
“I’m a lustful man, sure,” he said, but he denied he touched girls on purpose. “Strike me dead right now if I’m lying to you. I was not trying to touch her sexually.”
“I call bullshit on that,” Kleffman said.
Massie told Kleffman and McTavish that Bruckelmyer had spoken to him “at least” three times about inappropriate behavior with children. The investigators asked how many more girls might come forward with stories about him touching or kissing them.
“I mean, there could be hundreds,” Massie said.
Five days later, Bruckelmyer walked into the same interview room with Raisanen, another preacher at the church.
Bruckelmyer, now 68, is described as a kind but domineering force in the church, a father of at least 12 who worked in construction.
Unlike in other branches of Christianity, OALC preachers like Bruckelmyer do not attend traditional seminaries or receive formal training before assuming their leadership roles. Instead, according to a church spokesperson, they are selected by the congregation.
Their advice is seen as coming directly from God, according to several former church members.
In a video recording of the police interview, Bruckelmyer and Raisanen joked quietly with one another before Kleffman and Sgt. Eric Sathers, another investigator, entered the room.
“Do you know what the mandated reporting laws are in the state of Minnesota?” Kleffman asked.
“We have looked at them some, but it’s hard for us to interpret everything,” Bruckelmyer replied.
“Have you ever been told about them?” the officer asked.
“No,” Bruckelmyer said.
Kleffman said he knew that wasn’t true and brought up the 2020 call with LaBore. “I just listened to the audio recording, and it was line-for-line. You said you understood what they were,” Kleffman said.
“We felt, unless it’s changed, that as a part of the church that we keep silent,” Bruckelmyer said.

Kleffman and Sathers explained that if someone like Massie confessed to Bruckelmyer one-on-one, that would constitute a protected conversation with clergy. But hearing directly from the victims, from parents of victims or about abuse allegations in a group setting was another matter entirely.
Bruckelmyer and Raisanen claimed ignorance of the legal distinction and thanked the officers for the “clarification.” Bruckelmyer asked what became of the 2017 investigation into Massie. “I mean, it should have been taken care of then, you know?” the preacher said. “It’s like, what happened?”
Kleffman reminded him that a decade before that, the girl’s parents had come forward to Bruckelmyer and was told to forgive Massie.
“Nothing was done by you,” Kleffman said. “So in that meantime, she is not being protected while Clint is still scot-free doing what he’s been doing for 15 years.”
“I see,” Bruckelmyer said quietly.
“You’re just keeping a pedophile in your church,” Kleffman said.
Both Bruckelmyer and Raisanen confirmed they’d known about the girl from the 2017 report, and Bruckelmyer said he knew of two others as well. He expressed his eagerness to cooperate with law enforcement moving forward but denied knowledge of any other victims beyond the three.
Bruckelmyer and Raisanen left the St. Louis County Sheriff’s Department office without facing any consequences. John Hiivala, a spokesperson for the Woodland Park Old Apostolic Lutheran Church, said that the church “has fully complied with the law in the referenced case, and it’s a matter of legal record.” Hiivala declined to comment further.
By the time prosecutors brought the case against Massie, the three-year statute of limitations had run out on charging Bruckelmyer with failure to report.

Reckoning
On the day of Massie’s sentencing in March 2025, Kleffman walked Kyla Chamberlin to the front row of the high-ceilinged courtroom. The opposite side of the courtroom quickly filled with at least a dozen Massie supporters, including his wife, Sarah.
Chamberlin had flown in from North Dakota alone. Of the nine alleged victims prosecutors identified from the case, she was the only one to attend the sentencing in person. As she waited, she was shaking. She didn’t want to look back, particularly at Sarah Massie, whom she’d adored as a child. She said she could feel the eyes of her former church community on her, people she’d once trusted and loved.
A former EMT and mother of three, Chamberlin had grown up in the Black Hills of South Dakota in the 1990s. Clint and Sarah Massie lived nearby and opened their home to Chamberlin and her four siblings. Her parents sometimes asked Clint, starting in his late teens, to babysit.
The sexual abuse began around the time Chamberlin was 7 years old, she told police. In interviews with Kleffman, she described a remarkably similar pattern of abuse as the two Duluth victims.
After the Massies moved to Duluth in the early 2000s, Chamberlin’s parents say she went from meek and sweet to being filled with an inexplicable anger. She rebelled, she drank. The close-knit family began to fray. She and one of her older sisters, Kristi Bertolotto, stopped speaking to each other.
“I’ve lost a lot of friendships, a lot of relationships, divorces, anger management — didn’t understand why I was so mad,” Chamberlin said.

She stopped attending church in 2010 and, in response, her parents made it clear that she was no longer welcome at family and holiday functions, a painful and common experience described by several former church members.
“It’s like you don’t even think for yourself,” Janie Williamson, Chamberlin’s mother, said in an interview. “To turn against your own children because of some of those things is — it’s awful.”
After St. Louis County announced charges against Massie, Kleffman began receiving calls from alleged victims all over the country. One of those was from Chamberlin. Months later, Kleffman realized that one of the other victims he interviewed was Chamberlin’s older sister, Bertolotto.
Neither of them knew what had happened to the other. Neither knew the other sister had come forward. Both women agreed to be named in this story.
Court filings listed nine alleged victims, but only three of the cases resulted in charges of felony sexual conduct with a victim under the age of 13. The statute of limitations under South Dakota law had run out for Bertolotto and Chamberlin. And the girl who’d been pressured to forgive Massie in Bruckelmyer’s office hadn’t had her case charged either; under Minnesota law, too much time had passed between her initial report in 2017 and the prosecution.
Nevertheless, six of the alleged victims whose cases didn’t result in charges were still part of the case, and some of the women traveled to Duluth in December 2024 to testify at Massie’s trial. Just after jury selection, Massie agreed to plead guilty to four felony counts. One charge was dropped.
Four months later, at his sentencing, Massie looked pale and paunchy in an orange jumpsuit, his hands and feet shackled. His attorney, citing Massie’s lack of a criminal record, asked that he receive no prison time and be allowed to seek treatment and receive probation that he could serve at home. Massie apologized to his victims and their families.
“I beg for their forgiveness, for the damage and hurt that I’ve caused them over the years,” he said in a quavering voice. “I feel responsible for the horrible acts to these children.”
But Judge Eric Hylden noted that since Massie had pleaded guilty, he’d never tried to enroll in sex-offender treatment or written apology letters to his victims. Hylden also quoted aloud from one of 17 letters of support for Massie, many from OALC members, which he said demonstrated that some in Massie’s community still did not believe he’d done anything wrong: “I wish you find ones that have actually done these things and get them put away rather than putting your energy into lying and seeking evil where there is none to be found.”
The judge sentenced Massie to 7 1/2 years in prison.
Afterward, in the witness room a floor higher in the courthouse, Chamberlin met Ryan, the assistant district attorney, and Kleffman — the two men she credited with putting Massie in prison 30 years after he’d abused her. The three exchanged hugs.
“I feel a sense of justice for the first time in 30 years,” Chamberlin said.

At the same time, none of them felt completely satisfied that the problem began and ended with Massie — that church leaders had not been held accountable.
Ryan said that he’d struggled as he prepared to go to trial with keeping several of the women from succumbing to what he called “a constant effort” by members of the church to “try to get these girls to either tone down their position on it or just to not cooperate.” One alleged victim, he said, had dropped out weeks before trial.
Chamberlin and her sister have retained the same lawyer who represented some of the victims in the Jeffrey Epstein case. He has filed lawsuits on their behalf against Massie, their church in South Dakota and the Old Apostolic Lutheran Church of America.
In a letter written from prison that was filed in court, Massie denied both sisters’ allegations. The OALC, in a motion to dismiss both lawsuits, wrote that “while OALC-America is mindful and sympathetic to Plaintiff for the abuse Plaintiff alleges occurred by Massie, such empathy does not take away from the plain fact that this Court does not have personal jurisdiction over OALC-America.”
Chamberlin and Bertolotto’s family has left the church. They are now navigating a delicate reconciliation, which Chamberlin credits to the abuse finally coming to light.
Chamberlin said she hoped to have a role encouraging other victims to come forward before the secrecy consumes their lives the way it had consumed hers.
“There’s a lot more to be done,” she said. “There’s a lot of Clints out there.”

(Photo: J. Holly McCall/Tennessee Lookout)Former Lipscomb University professor Lauren Pinkston, who has spent her career researching human trafficking prevention and community development, will run for governor as an independent candidate. 
A first-time candidate, Pinkston, of Columbia, said she first considered running for the state legislature before eyeing the governor’s race.
“Knowing who is on the ballot on the Republican side, there are some really polarizing figures that people are not excited about,” she said. “There are a lot of Republicans who were raised like I was with a core set of values that they just don’t feel represented by their party anymore.”
Pinkston cited 2024 data from Gallup Poll showing 43% of Americans considered themselves as independent voters, affiliated with neither the Democratic Party nor the Republican Party. 
U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, U.S. Rep. John Rose and state Rep. Monty Fritts are vying for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, while Memphis City Councilperson Jerri Green is the most prominent of four Democrats running. Of the remaining Democrats, only one, Carnita Atwater,  has electoral experience, having run for Memphis mayor in 2023 and for governor in 2022. 
According to Ballotpedia, two other independent candidates are planning to run for governor in 2026. 
Independent candidates typically have not fared well in Tennessee’s gubernatorial races: In 2014, the late John Jay Hooker, an attorney from a prominent Nashville family, entrepreneur and one-time ally of Robert F. Kennedy, earned 2.3% of the vote in the general election. 
Pinkston acknowledged skepticism about her candidacy exists.
“A lot of independents are even more fringe than the extremes that we have, but there are a good number of us who are interested in breaking apart from the extremism we have and offering a solid path back to the middle ground,” she said.
Her campaign will focus on agriculture — one of the state’s largest industries — and education. 
“We live in a modern society, and so while we can have Tennessee first and America first policies, we don’t make those policies in a vacuum,” Pinkston said, addressing a crisis with Tennessee soybean farmers hit hard by the Trump administration’s tariffs. “I’m interested in talking to farmers about how we can brand products and sell products within our state to relieve the pressure of federal policies.”
Pinkston has a bachelor’s degree from Freed-Hardeman University and a Ph.D. from Clemson University. She taught in the Lipscomb University College of Business and has worked with the Freedom Business Alliance, an organization that works to end human trafficking through economic empowerment. 
She believes her message will resonate with Tennesseans.
“People are looking for a choice that they can vote for, rather than against,” Pinkston said. “Over the last decade or so people have felt so disenfranchised and feel unenthused with other options on the ballot, and this just feels like the right year to give people the choice they have been looking for.”
Pinkston will launch her campaign Saturday in three stops across the state, in Selmer, where she grew up, Columbia, and Chattanooga.

Screenshot. “We remember and honor the memory of those transgender, nonbinary and gender non-conforming people who lost their lives to anti-trans violence,” Rev. Dr. Lawrence T. Richardson said in a virtual church service celebrating Transgender Day of Remembrance on Thursday evening. 
“What we need is for the terrorism to stop, because until all of us are free, none of us are free, so we advocate, educate and prioritize visibility,” Richardson, a transgender man himself, said.
The associate conference minister for church vitality and transitions in the Michigan Conference United Church of Christ, he preached to the crowd that just this year, over a thousand anti-trans pieces of legislation have been introduced nationwide. 
“Trans folks are real, and we exist, no matter what policies attempt to legislate us out of existence,” he said. “I can’t explain away anti-trans violence or why some of us make it and some of us don’t, but what I do know is this, those of us still alive, still surviving, still thriving, we have been preserved for such a time as this. This is the time to show up. This is the time to speak up. This is the time to declare your sovereignty. This is the time to show them who we are. This is the time to let the world see our beauty, richness and diversity.”

The names of 38 trans, nonbinary and gender non-conforming people were read by ministers and clergy members, while those in attendance online shared the names of transgender loved ones in the chat of the call. 
“We are here because lies have been lost. We are here because violence tried to silence our siblings,” Rev. Elder Carmarion D. Anderson said, explaining why the names are read each year. “We are here because the world grows comfortable with forgetting, but we refuse to forget.”
“We say their names because silence is a grave that tries to bury the truth,” Anderson, a minister in Alabama and Black trans woman, added. “We say their names because every life deserves honor, dignity and breath.”
“Let this resilience hold those who grieve, lift those who are afraid and surround our trans siblings with protection, affirmation and fierce, unshakable love,” Rev. Derek Terry, a pastor from Ohio, said in an opening prayer. “May resilience move us from remembrance into action, to create communities where trans lives are safe, celebrated and cherished without condition.”

(Photo courtesy of the West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey)This week, reporter Steven Allen Adams of Ogden newspapers confirmed what many had been hearing in recent days: Gov. Patrick Morrisey inexplicably wants to call the Legislature into a special session mere weeks before the regular session to muscle through a deeply regressive tax and budget plan. The tradeoff, reportedly, is even deeper cuts to a state budget already hemorrhaging from years of disinvestment and underfunding, in many ways fueling the affordability crisis many West Virginians are now facing. 
More cuts are unthinkable after years of state budget austerity have already resulted in unprecedented public school closures and program cuts, the failure to make new investments in affordable child care, crumbling water and road infrastructure in rural communities, and low pay and skyrocketing insurance costs for state and local workers.
Morrisey’s proposal is reportedly to move West Virginia from a progressive, graduated income tax (in line with the majority of states) to a flat tax of 3.88%. To be clear, this proposal would not lead to lower taxes for everyone. In fact, it would raise income tax rates for at least one-third of West Virginia households (the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy is crunching the numbers and will have more specific details soon). The biggest beneficiaries by far would be high-income households, who have already seen significant state and federal tax cuts in recent years and, as a result, already pay less in state and local taxes as a share of their incomes than low- and middle-income households in West Virginia. A flat tax would make our already upside-down tax system even more regressive, with Morrisey’s plan requiring low-income households to pay more to give yet another tax break to higher-income earners.
But that isn’t the only cost. Adams also reported that Morrisey has instructed state agencies to plan for budget cuts in the upcoming year. Instead of talking about another flat budget (which by definition, is shrinking by failing to keep up with inflation), we are looking at an even smaller budget next year, meaning low- and moderate- income households will be asked to pay more and get less back in public services.
Since 2019, the state’s budget has shrunk by nearly $500 million (or about 8%t) after adjusting for inflation. The state is spending less than it did just a few years ago on school aid funding to local districts, Medicaid, child care assistance and the Public Employees Insurance Agency. The only areas of the budget that have seen state funding increases are jails and prisons, foster care and adoption, and the Hope Scholarship. 
The budget cuts agencies are reportedly being asked to make would slash programs further and mean no much-needed investments in modernizing our school funding formula to help neighborhood schools stay afloat and districts hire and retain well-qualified teachers; no new investments in child care affordability; no clearing of the Intellectual/Developmental Disabilities waiver wait list; no solution for PEIA; and nothing for rural community infrastructure or economic development.
One major question that remains unanswered is whether Morrisey would allow the Hope Scholarship’s expansion to move ahead, meaning the program’s budget would increase by more than 100% while every other program in the state is forced to make cuts. This is yet another area where leaders are prioritizing higher earning households over low- and middle-income ones. 
Treasurer Larry Pack, whose agency administers the Hope Scholarship, has already said 85-90% of current Hope Scholarship enrollees are families who would have used private schools without the voucher program, and 100%  of those who would benefit from the program’s expansion are already in private schools — meaning they are already able to afford it. Can policymakers seriously consider giving shrinking public taxpayer dollars to families who can already afford private school while refusing to invest in an outdated public school funding plan, or worse, making public school funding cuts?
Let me be perfectly clear: The only winners in Morrisey’s tax plan are high-income households who’ve already received windfalls in state and federal tax cuts and the Hope Scholarship over the last several years. It is everyday West Virginians who would bear the consequences of the “tough choices” that Morrisey promised as tradeoffs — many seeing their taxes increase and most harmed by more budget cuts to pay for another round of tax cuts that help the wealthy pay less. For West Virginia lawmakers to contemplate giving our richest even more — paid for by outright cuts to our public schools, our rural communities, and our children’s futures — is unconscionable.

(Photo provided by UK College of Medicine)Kentucky scientists have successfully edited genes in living mice, switching a gene associated with high risk of Alzheimer’s disease to its counterpart, a protective gene.  
This new research, which came out of a 22-person team from the University of Kentucky and beyond, has the potential to someday prevent millions of cases of Alzheimer’s in humans, said Lance Johnson, an associate professor in the UK College of Medicine’s Department of Physiology. 
The study, published this month in Nature Neuroscience, found that editing a specific gene known to increase risk of Alzheimer’s with its counterpart, a gene associated with lower risk, in mice resulted in “fewer Alzheimer’s-related brain changes such as amyloid plaque buildup and inflammation, and stronger performance on memory tests.” 
Lesley Golden, the lead author, said in a statement that “this model allows us to test what happens when we go from risk to resilience. Remarkably, even switching the gene later in life improved multiple aspects of Alzheimer’s pathology at once.” 
Everyone has the apolipoprotein E, or APOE gene, Johnson explained, though some people have variants —  “the same gene that just differs by only one or two base pairs” — APO E2, E3 and E4. Most people inherited E3 from both parents, Johnson said. Some will inherit a mixture of variants. 
People who got an E4 variant from both parents — about a quarter of the population, Johnson said — are about 15 times more likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease. 
“The good news there is: Some people, I like to say, have won the genetic lottery in that they’ve inherited the E2 variant of the gene,” Johnson said. “And so those that have inherited E2 are equally as protected as the people who inherited E4 are at risk. So it’s an incredibly protective variant of this gene.” 
He and his team wanted to answer this question: “Why don’t we just change the gene itself? if you got an E4 from mom and dad, and you’re facing an almost certain chance of getting this disease at some point, if it was possible, wouldn’t you want to have the E2 variant?”

Researchers gave living mice the risk variant “designed a mouse’s DNA so that it had the (protective gene) behind” the risk variant. Then, researchers injected a drug into the mice that directed the DNA to change from making the risk gene to making the protective gene. 
The change took a few days in mice, but would likely take longer in a human body. (Mice have a lifespan of around 1.5 years). Mice also do not get Alzheimer’s disease, Johnson said, meaning the team had to “use a genetic model that makes lots of the amyloid plaque that features that disease.” 
At best, making an effective gene switch in humans is years away, and there are many hurdles to clear before efficient and specific editing is an available treatment. But the research offers some hope to many Kentuckians who live with Alzheimer’s and the loved ones who take care of them. 
The 2025 Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures Report, released by the Alzheimer’s Association in May, reported that 80,000 Kentuckians aged 65 and older are living with an Alzheimer’s diagnosis. Additionally, around 160,000 Kentucky residents provide unpaid care for a loved one with Alzheimer’s, an incurable but treatable disorder characterized by memory loss. 
“To us, it was an exciting proof-of-concept study to show that, okay, perhaps one day this would work in a human if we can figure out a safe way to deliver gene editing technology; if we can figure out a way to do that with the correct timing,” Johnson said.  
Report shows effects of Alzheimer’s in KY, the disease ‘you can’t see’ 

Johnson hopes to continue his research in the coming years, “assuming we can continue to get (National Institutes of Health) funding for this.”
This research is not an end-all, fix-all to effectively treating Alzheimer’s. The gene that is protective against Alzheimer’s can raise a person’s risk of other conditions, Johnson explained, including age related macular degeneration and cardiovascular disease.  
“It would be too good to be true if inheriting E2 was good for everything,” Johnson said. “The last thing you’d want to do is protect someone from Alzheimer’s disease, but put them at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease, right?” 
The scientists studying this gene will need to keep that front of mind, Johnson said, and ensure that any treatments don’t put patients at risk of other diseases. He believes this will happen and is “as hopeful as I have been for this field and for tackling this disease.” 
“My hope and my belief is that one day — and hopefully it’s sooner rather than later — we’re at a point where we have tools that can edit DNA efficiently and safely, and we could target something like APOE,” Johnson said. “In theory, we could prevent millions of Alzheimer’s disease cases from ever happening in the first place.”

Bobby Scott, D-Newport News, fifth from left, hold a ceremonial groundbreaking of the Cuffee Aquatics Center in Chesapeake, the city's first public pool, on Friday, Nov. 14. (Photo by Roger Chesley/Virginia Mercury) Local, state and federal leaders recently broke ground on Chesapeake’s first-ever public pool, an event more than a half-century in the making. The $27 million Cuffee Aquatics Center, set to open in late 2027, will be an expansion of the existing community center at the site, and the 28,628-square-foot indoor complex will include 25-yard lanes for competitive swimming, diving boards, and a therapeutic pool.
Public pools provide opportunities for people of all races and income levels to learn how to swim, prevent drowning, and acquire a skill that will last a lifetime. That the commonwealth’s second-largest city (population 253,000 today) resisted this practical amenity for so long has been stupefying.
To say the natatorium is long overdue woefully understates the history of this issue. City Council members have displayed obstinance, inertia and absurd tight-fistedness since at least 1973. That’s when Chesapeake residents began urging officials to build a public swimming pool in the huge city of 353 square miles.
Council members refused to relent, even though Chesapeake often has been the top locality in household income compared to the other major cities in South Hampton Roads (along with Norfolk, Portsmouth, Virginia Beach and Suffolk). 
“You can’t be a city of our size and wealth and not have public pools,” Mayor Rick West told me a few days before the Nov. 14 groundbreaking. “It’s a major step forward.”
“The mentality (has been) we don’t need a public pool,” longtime council member Ella Ward told me at the groundbreaking. That stance has hurt poor people and families without nearby access to aquatic facilities. “Our tax dollars should be used here,” she added.
In 2022, as the current plan was being hashed out, West had told me it was “embarrassing” the city lacked such a public facility. That’s putting it mildly.
The delay also reminds African-Americans of the ugly violence and slights that accompanied attempts to integrate pools in the South decades ago. Author Jeff Wiltse documented those incidents in his book, “Contested Waters: A Social History of Swimming Pools in America.”
Meanwhile, the American Red Cross notes that today 64% of African-American children, 45% of Latino children, and 40% of white children have few or no swimming skills. And 79% of children in households with incomes less than $50,000 have few or no swimming skills.
Private clubs and places like the YMCA are available in Chesapeake. But if families can’t afford membership fees, they miss out. Parents also hesitate to frolic at coastal beaches if they and their children don’t know how to swim.

In 2015, I wrote a series of columns in The Virginian-Pilot urging the city of Chesapeake to take the plunge. I’m surprised a decade has already passed.
At that time, Chesapeake was one of just two cities among the nation’s largest 100 without a public pool. (Fremont, California, was the other.) Then and now, Chesapeake clocked in as the 92nd-largest city in the United States. I even suggested alternatives – such as starting public-private partnerships – to increase options if Chesapeake didn’t want to pay the whole freight itself.
That’s despite the fact the city is far from destitute.
Median household income in 2015 was nearly $70,000; the city says it’s nearly $93,000 today, a few thousand more than the state level.
Chesapeake waded into the current pool project after garnering $9 million in state appropriations and $3 million from the feds. Other cities across the country receive similar help, sure, but Chesapeake could’ve dived in by itself.
What gives?
I’ve called Chesapeake home for 28 years now, and I wrote dozens of editorials about the city when I was on The Pilot’s editorial board from 2000 to 2010. So I’ve gleaned some things about my adopted hometown.
Chesapeake has been fiscally conservative – sometimes ridiculously so – despite enjoying a strong real estate tax base, hosting major company headquarters like Dollar Tree, and being the home of several military installations. All three major ratings agencies place the city’s bonds at AAA, the highest.
Yet, Chesapeake moves at a snail’s pace on initiating some city services.
For example, it didn’t start curbside recycling with large, rolling bins until 2009 – years after neighboring cities did so. Chesapeake then ended the program in 2022. City officials that year told me the move by China to bar imports of recyclable materials was a big reason for the change, but it was a disappointing decision for the 70,000 households that used the service.  
Much of this backstory – though not all – was in the rearview window last week as City Council members, state legislators and U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Newport News, took part in the groundbreaking. Roughly 100 people were on hand on that brisk, sunny morning, including several people from the Campostella community where the pool will be located.
Particularly poignant were the comments by Del. Cliff Hayes, D-Chesapeake, who grew up in the immediate area. The former city councilman has spoken before about nearly drowning as a child when ill-equipped to be in the water, and not having public pools in Chesapeake where he could learn how to swim. He also mentioned a childhood friend who had drowned.
“Today is a fulfillment of a promise – a promise decades in the making, rooted in the soil of this community, and watered by generations of hope, struggle and determination,” he said.
I hope it doesn’t take several more decades before Chesapeake builds a second public pool.

(Photo by Imaginima/Getty Images)The largest initial business investment in Caroline County’s history has been awarded to a tech company that will soon break ground on three major data centers, state and local leaders announced Thursday.
The CleanArc Data Centers project, on the site of a former shopping center along I-95, will build three hyperscale data centers at 490,000 square feet each, using 600 MW of power – totalling over $3-billion for construction and generating 50 jobs.
The project was approved by-right by the county’s Board of Supervisors in August, a process that didn’t require public hearings like those needed when project developers seek a conditional use permit. The leaders said the area was already zoned for industrial use and the project was grandfathered into county requirements since they had already made significant investments in the project, according to a release from the county. 
The approved application also left things open ended, and the company could add two additional sites with the approval of the board of supervisors.
The amount and source of water being used to cycle through data centers is a frequent concern for localities, especially rural ones like Caroline, where many homeowners depend on well water. Per the agreement, the county won’t provide the CleanArc with potable water for cooling of the machines inside. The county will provide water for flushing and washing at the facilities, according to the county’s statement.
CleanArc said the initial amount of water needed would be brought in from off site and will be circulated from then on – using only the amount of water necessary for an average office building.
The locality’s leaders said the project will abide by rules so residents’ quality of life isn’t degraded.
“The Board is proud that it has led the Commonwealth in setting exacting standards for data centers in the form of regulatory guidelines,” said county supervisor Nancy Long. “These regulations include setbacks to enhance buffering from communities, noise abatement provisions, screening requirements, and the prohibition of the use of potable water for industrial cooling.”
Caroline County used incentives to draw the company to the area. Every year 25% of the increased tax revenue generated at the parcel, which is estimated at $13 million annually, will be given back to CleanArc as part of the grant incentive program. The grant will be paid out over the course of 15 years.
“With this campus, CleanArc is ensuring every data center built in Virginia is better than the last,” Secretary of Commerce and Trade Juan Pablo Segura said in a release. “This enormous investment in Caroline County is a sign of Virginia’s growing dominance in the global tech industry.”
The company  — which has offices in Reston, Dallas and Las Vegas — has already placed the campus in the queue with Dominion to receive power, which encouraged the county to approve the agreement, since it seemed likely the project would come to fruition. 
The three campuses are expected to create 50 jobs which are significantly higher median salaries than average in Caroline County.
“By listening to Virginians and collaborating with industry leaders, CleanArc is ensuring this campus brings great jobs and revenue to this community and the Commonwealth while ensuring the high quality of life Virginia is known for,” Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in an announcement about the company’s planned entrance to Caroline on Thursday. 
The first 300MW of power is expected to be energized no later than 2027 with additional power coming online over the next 3-5 years after.

Old Dominion University announced in October it was partnering with Google Cloud to launch an incubator for artificial intelligence research and applications.
Through the new incubator, students, faculty, staff, local cities and small businesses can access Google’s advanced AI tools they wouldn’t otherwise have access to.
ODU professor Chrysoula Malogianni described the incubator, called the MonarchSphere, as an “ecosystem” that will help both those within the university and the broader community.
“At the same time, (they) tap into access to ODU expertise, and that expertise, obviously, is research expertise,” she said.
Internally, ODU is using the incubator to develop AI advisors to help those who advise students. Researchers can test ideas and practical applications of AI in areas like coastal resilience, defense, cybersecurity and healthcare in an environment where they won’t have to commit to buying costly licenses to Google’s products.
Already, the incubator has 30 researchers working on projects, Malogianni said. The researchers come from a variety of backgrounds, including computer science, data science, quantum computing and philosophy.
Professor George McLeod is the director of ODU’s geospatial research center. He and his team are replicating a project that estimates the economic impact of a hurricane striking Hampton Roads. Flood and hurricane modeling require an enormous amount of data, which can be time consuming to process, he said.
He said using the incubator’s advanced AI tools may be able to speed up processing time, lead to more accurate results and discover new research questions.
“There’s a lot of natural concern about whether AI is giving us the truth,” he said. “Is AI giving us accurate results? Our role as a partner with Google in the MonarchSphere is to help develop these tools.”
ODU electrical and computer engineering professor Khan Iftekharuddin has been developing computer models for glioblastoma, an aggressive type of brain cancer, for several years. The models use MRI images to predict how tumors will grow and how quickly, which can help doctors determine if treatment is possible.
Without the advanced Google AI tools, the process takes nearly 2 hours per patient, multiplied by thousands of patients, Iftekharuddin said. With Google’s advanced tools, that time is cut to just 44 minutes per patient.
“Human health is, I think, one of the most important areas where AI and this kind of computation is going to make a difference, and it is making a difference,” Iftekharuddin said.
The collaboration between Google and ODU also includes certificate opportunities for students, such as Google Career Certificates, into degree and continuing education programs.
“Students not only learn about AI,” Malogianni said. “AI becomes the content, the context and the tool.”
The incubator will be open to people outside of ODU, too, Malogianni said. Small businesses or organizations may have a problem they’d like to solve with AI, but don’t have the tools or know-how to make it happen.
The university eventually will establish an intake process, Malogianni said.

(Courtesy of Lovewell Farms)I co-founded Lovewell Farms, Rhode Island’s only USDA-certified organic hemp farm in 2018. Since 2019, we’ve been growing legal hemp outdoors, using natural ethanol extraction, and creating safe, full-spectrum CBD products like tinctures, salves, and gummies, all lab-tested, adult use only, and compliant with some of the strictest regulations and THC limits in the country. Our mission is simple: to make non-intoxicating, plant-based wellness options accessible. We’re not trying to get people high, we’re trying to help them feel better.
But last week, Congress quietly passed H.R. 5371, a government funding bill that redefines hemp so narrowly it could effectively ban most full-spectrum CBD products, even those that are non-intoxicating, naturally extracted, and legally sold under state law. The bill criminalizes any product with a “quantifiable” amount of THC or THCA, and even targets products extracted “outside the plant,” including widely used, safe methods like ethanol distillation.
What this definition ignores is botanical reality: It is virtually impossible to grow a CBD-rich hemp plant with absolutely zero THC. All cannabis plants, including federally legal hemp, naturally produce trace amounts of THC, it’s part of the plant’s chemistry. These trace levels are not enough to cause intoxication, especially when balanced by a dominant cannabinoid like CBD. Full-spectrum products rely on these naturally occurring compounds to work effectively and safely, not to get anyone high.
So, what’s the result? Tens of thousands of compliant hemp businesses, including ours, could be shut down. Not for breaking the rules, but for following them. This isn’t science-based regulation. It’s 21st-century reefer madness.
According to Reuters, the U.S. was already losing over 11,000 jobs per week as of October. Now, an additional 300,000 hemp industry jobs, from farmers to retailers to manufacturers, could disappear by 2027, threatening a $28 billion market.
Even more frustrating: while the bill includes a one-year delay on enforcement and mandates a federal study by the FDA and USDA it still amounts to a “ban now, ask questions later” approach. Unlike here in Rhode Island, where regulators kept regulations the same while a state-led study is underway, the federal law already rewrites the definition of hemp, locking in penalties before the study is even complete. 
For farmers like us, a year isn’t enough time. We make seed purchases in March, plant in April, and harvest in October. If the ban takes effect in November 2026, we could be forced to destroy our entire crop at the end of next season, despite following all the rules. That’s not a transition plan, it’s a trap. At minimum, Congress should delay enforcement by 720 days to accommodate real-world timelines of agriculture.
Rhode Island’s current rules already require lab testing, child-resistant packaging, adult-only sales and labeling that mirrors the state’s medical program. Yet our Attorney General, Peter Neronha, signed a letter to congressional leaders describing the entire industry as “unregulated” and “marketed to children.” That’s simply not true, is deeply misleading to the public and harms compliant, state-licensed family farms like ours. In Rhode Island, the state requires customers to prove they are 21 -years old, and meet the same exact testing, packaging, and label requirements as the regulated adult-use and medical cannabis programs.










We make seed purchases in March, plant in April, and harvest in October. If the ban takes effect in November 2026, we could be forced to destroy our entire crop at the end of next season, despite following all the rules.


The letter goes even further to claim that hemp-derived THC products “kill children.” In reality, only two isolated independent case reports exist linking child deaths to cannabis ingestion, and both involved illicit, unregulated products, infants, and in one case, additional substances such as fentanyl and ketamine. These tragedies are not connected to regulated hemp products. 
A broad ban wouldn’t prevent harm, it would push the market underground, where unregulated products are more likely to pose real risks. Responsible regulation is what keeps children and consumers safe. That’s what we already have in Rhode Island, and it works. To date, there is no record of a single cannabis-related death, of a child, infant, or adult, in the state.
The letter Neronha and 38 other attorneys general signed also makes the claim that hemp-derived gummies and beverages are “designed to appeal to young children.” By that logic, the same could be said of alcoholic drinks like hard seltzers, which are often sweetened, fruit-flavored, and brightly packaged. Yet alcohol wasn’t banned, likely because that industry is larger, older, and has more powerful lobbyists. We didn’t ban potatoes just because someone turned them into moonshine. We regulate alcohol. We should do the same with hemp.
Despite calls from farmers and small business owners across the state, both of Rhode Island’s U.S. senators, Democrats Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, voted to keep the ban language in the bill, citing Neronha’s falsehood-ridden letter as justification. Thankfully, Rhode Island’s Democratic Reps. Seth Magaziner and Gabe Amo, both voted no on the corresponding House bill, though it still ultimately passed. 
We still have time to fix this, but only if the public speaks up. The bill allows for a year before implementation. That’s one year for advocacy, education, and science to lead the way. Congress should be going after bad actors, not punishing compliant small farmers who follow the law, protect public health, and provide plant-based wellness alternatives to pharmaceuticals.
This isn’t a partisan issue. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, from progressive Democrats to conservative Republicans, have expressed concern about the impact of this hemp ban. That’s because it affects real people in every state: farmers, veterans, small business owners, and families looking for natural relief. We need smart, bipartisan solutions, not rushed overreach that punishes the compliant.
We don’t need another war on cannabis. We need honest, evidence-based legislation.

House Bill 1873 explicitly states that it’s okay to permit kids to venture out alone under circumstances including babysitting, playing outdoors and traveling between destinations such as school, stores and recreation sites. 
It also would clarify under Pennsylvania’s legal definitions of child abuse and neglect that parents or guardians must have recklessly or willfully discounted foreseeable danger.

Advocates previously testified about clients suffering severe ramifications from investigations prompted by relatively routine scenarios.

The proposal now awaits consideration by the full chamber following a 25-1 vote by the House Children & Youth Committee. 
Rep. Brenda Pugh (R-Luzerne) cast the lone vote against the measure. She supports the intent, but thinks the language should be tweaked. 
“My concern is for the child that is not in the responsible home,” Pugh said. 
“With my background and my past, I have a history of dealing with those that are not responsible.”

The Trump administration is making it easier for farmers to employ guest workers from other countries. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)In a tacit admission that U.S. food production requires foreign labor, the Trump administration is making it easier for farmers to employ guest workers from other countries.
At the same time, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in recent months appears to be refraining from conducting agricultural workplace raids, even as it scours Democratic-led cities for immigrants who are in the country illegally.
“We really haven’t seen agriculture targeted with worksite enforcement efforts, and early this year we did,” said Julia Gelatt, associate director of U.S. immigration policy at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.
The shifts come as many Americans are concerned about the rising cost of food, creating political problems for a president who campaigned on lowering them. Last week, the administration also announced it would lift tariffs on some foreign food products, including bananas, beef, coffee and tomatoes.
Trump migrant deportations could threaten states’ agricultural economies

To ease labor shortages on farms and ranches, the administration last month made changes to the federal H-2A visa program, which allows employers to hire foreign workers for temporary agricultural jobs when there aren’t enough U.S.-born workers available. Under the new rule, the Department of Homeland Security will approve H-2A visas more quickly.
“Our immigration system has been broken for decades, and we finally have a President who is enforcing the law and prioritizing fixing programs farmers and ranchers rely on to produce the safest and most productive food supply in the world,” the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in an email to Stateline.
But the move to increase the supply of foreign agricultural workers conflicts with a July statement by Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins that “the promise to America, to ensure that we have a 100% American workforce, stands.”
Rollins also said the administration was committed to the mass deportation of immigrants who are here illegally, but that it would be “strategic so as not to compromise our food supply.” Ultimately, she said, the solution would be increased automation of agricultural jobs.
The government has issued about 420,000 H-2A visas for agricultural workers every year since 2023, which amounts to about half of the 812,000 agricultural worker jobs. They are concentrated in states that grow fruits and vegetables as opposed to grains, which are increasingly planted and harvested using machines. The government expects an additional 119,000 visas to be issued under the new rule.
Almost half the H-2A visas in the 2025 fiscal year were in Florida (60,000), Georgia (44,000), California (37,000), Washington state (36,000) and North Carolina (28,000).
Lower wages
The new H-2A rule also includes new hourly wage guidelines that vary by state but are lower than previous wages, and allows employers to charge workers for housing that used to be free. In North Carolina, for instance, the new rate is $11.09 for unskilled workers compared with $16.16 last year. In California, the rate is $13.45 for unskilled workers compared with $19.97 last year, though minimum wage laws in California and some other states would apply to those jobs, according to a Cornell University analysis.
ICE has a new courthouse tactic: Get immigrants’ cases tossed, then arrest them outside

In North Carolina, farmers are looking forward to lower labor costs, said Lee Wicker, deputy director of the North Carolina Growers Association, a trade association that brought 11,000 guest workers to the state through the H-2A guest worker program last year.
“If you think farmers are making more money in these conditions, you’re wrong. They’re going broke,” Wicker said. Workers will take a pay cut under new guidelines and will have to pay for housing, but that may help farmers stave off bankruptcy, he said.
“I’m not saying the workers are going to be happy about this, but I think they’ll come back. Wages have gone down before and they kept coming,” he added.
Jeffrey Dorfman, an agricultural and resource economics professor at North Carolina State University, said the changes will be a boon to the state’s farmers.
“The move to lower the H-2A wages by the Trump administration will be very well received by growers in North Carolina and will save farmers tens of millions of dollars statewide,” Dorfman said. “For many farmers, it will turn money-losing crops into money-making crops, if prices stay about where they are now.”
Unionized California farmworkers are opposed to the pay cuts and loss of free housing in the new guest worker visa plan, said Antonio De Loera-Brust, a spokesperson for the United Farm Workers, which represents about 10,000 workers in California.










First came the raids, which hurt workers, and now in order to appease business interests, they make all these concessions on wages and the guest workers program.


– Antonio De Loera-Brust, United Farm Workers


The union sued the administration over ICE raids in the fields earlier this year, but recently “it’s been pretty quiet,” he said.
“For us it’s been really a one-two punch,” De Loera-Brust said. “First came the raids, which hurt workers, and now in order to appease business interests, they make all these concessions on wages and the guest workers program.”
Fewer raids
The administration quickly walked back a June directive to avoid raids on the agriculture and hospitality industries. Nevertheless, ICE raids on those employers have been more infrequent in the months since.
In June, ICE raided a dairy farm in New Mexico and a meatpacking plant in Nebraska. Since then, the agency has raided only a handful of food and agriculture employers, such as a July raid on a California marijuana grower and an Arizona restaurant chain, and a September raid to arrest Wisconsin dairy workers.
For-profit immigration detention expands as Trump accelerates his deportation plans

Earlier this month, ICE agents descended on an onion farm in Northern California, arresting four immigrants on charges of illegally selling farmworker visas.
Even as ICE ramps up its activity in North Carolina cities such as Charlotte and Raleigh, Wicker, of the growers trade group, said farms in the state have not been targeted.
Gelatt, of the Migration Policy Institute, said that’s been true of farms and ranches in many states since June.
“In past administrations we’ve seen a very quiet de-emphasis of immigration enforcement at farms. You don’t need to make an announcement. You don’t need to fight in the courts,” Gelatt said. “It is possible just to direct enforcement activities away from farms. It’ll be hard to know if that’s happened now, but I would not be surprised.”
While farmworkers in California are seeing some relief from raids, life is still uneasy for them, De Loera-Brust said.
“Overall, they have clearly slowed down [raids] in ag areas, but that’s not policy. They could resume at any time. People are living with uncertainty,” he said.

Here, a polling station at Nashua High School South on Nov. 5, 2024. (Photo by Will Steinfeld/New Hampshire Bulletin)Soon after Joshua Bogden attempted to register to vote on the day of Portsmouth’s municipal elections Nov. 11, he faced a tough decision.
Bogden had not brought along a passport or birth certificate to prove his citizenship. And though he had previously been registered and voted in Wilton, poll workers told Bogden he needed to leave and return with one of those physical documents.
Bogden could either drive to city hall and request a same-day copy of his birth certificate, or rush home and find his own copy. But he had only hours until the polls closed, and only minutes before Portsmouth stopped its birth certificate service at 4:30.
In the end, Bogden decided to drive home and chance that he could find the certificate, he said during a press conference Thursday. He did find it and was able to vote. But the hassle he faced is at the center of arguments by some that recent changes to New Hampshire’s voter registration laws are too strict and will result in frustrated voters choosing not to vote.
“Luckily, I lived nearby,” he said. “But if there had been any more sort of traffic or anything in my personal life — going home to pick up the kids, trying to do this after work — there’s no way I would have been able to come back and vote successfully.” 
Since a new law took effect November 2024, New Hampshire voters are required to produce hard copies of citizenship documents the first time they register to vote in the state. The law eliminated the previous option for voters registering on Election Day to sign a “qualified voter affidavit” that allowed them to vote without proving citizenship by testifying on penalty of perjury that they were a U.S. citizen. 
Republican supporters of the law, House Bill 1569, say the new requirements are reasonable and necessary to close loopholes that could allow non-citizens to vote, and that voters should prepare by obtaining their citizenship documents in advance 
Lawmakers also passed a follow-up law in 2025, House Bill 464, that allows local election officials to access the Statewide Voter Registration System, New Hampshire Vital Records, and Division of Motor Vehicle databases in order to attempt to corroborate a resident’s citizenship. 
But a number of voting rights groups are suing in federal court to block the law, arguing it creates an unconstitutional burden and that it will disenfranchise eligible voters, especially those for whom obtaining a passport or birth certificate could be difficult. 
In the meantime, the October and November municipal elections have offered a fresh look into how the new law might affect voting in practice. 
According to a tally by the New Hampshire Campaign for Voting Rights, 123 voters were turned away from the polls due to a lack of documents. Combined with the 121 residents the group reported were turned away for the same reason during town meetings in spring, at least 244 people were turned away in 2025, the group says. 
Voting rights advocates and Democrats argue those tallies are a cautionary tale for the state ahead of the September 2026 state primaries and the November 2026 midterm federal election. Many more people are likely to vote in those elections, and many more who don’t bring along their citizenship documentation could be turned away, advocates warn. 
They hope U.S. District Court Judge Samantha Elliott, who is presiding over the lawsuit, will issue an injunction ahead of the midterms. A full evidentiary trial in that case is expected in February. 
At Thursday’s press conference, advocates attempted to show the difficulty posed by the new documentary requirements, which election law experts have called the strictest in the country. 
In addition to Bogden, Brayden Rumsey, a Dover voter, said he had to drive home to retrieve his passport in order to vote Nov. 11. Rumsey was not aware of the new citizenship documentation requirements; he had assumed that showing a REAL ID driver’s license would suffice, since to obtain it he had been required to show his passport. 
“I have my own car. I have my own way of getting there. I don’t have any kids to take care of. I have access to a passport and access to my birth certificate that I could easily get,” he said. “I know a lot of people don’t have that privilege like I do.”
And Michael Blanchette, who recently moved from Concord to Manchester, said he had called the city ahead of the Nov. 11 election to get confirmation of his citizenship using his previous registration and presence on the voter database. But despite that confirmation, Blanchette said he was still asked for citizenship documentation at the Manchester Ward 7 polls, and had to wait an hour for multiple election workers and city officials to clear him to vote. 
“(I knew) if I went back home and took my pain meds, I was not coming back out,” he said. “And it was now or never. So I stuck through it. I didn’t realize it would just drag on.”
Linnea Hartsuyker, a supervisor of the checklist in Dover’s Ward 5, said she had seen at least one prospective voter leave and not return once learning of the requirements. 
Hartsuyker said the 2025 law providing election workers access to the state voter file proved helpful, allowing her to verify at least those voters who had already registered. That remedy would not have worked for new voters who moved from out of state, she said.
“Last year at the general (election) I and my team registered 50 people per hour for 12 hours,” she said. “That’s almost one person per minute with the old system, and I am quite worried about being able to do that in the coming election, at the midterms.” 
Access to those state databases might vary from polling place to polling place depending on internet availability and the amount of time and manpower available during a rush of voters, critics say. Rumsey and Blanchette said workers at their polling places did not appear to have direct access to those databases, necessitating calls to city hall officials. 
It is not clear how the apparent tallies of voters turned away from voting might affect the trial in next year’s lawsuit. 
In a July 29 ruling, Elliott ruled that some of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, filed in 2024, lacked standing because their experiences did not directly demonstrate a potential unconstitutional barrier to voting. But she granted standing to other plaintiffs, such as the Coalition for Open Democracy, the League of Women Voters of New Hampshire, the Forward Foundation, and three plaintiffs who were minors but planned to register to vote when they turned 18 and said the need to procure documentation was a burden. 
The Attorney General’s Office has defended the law and said the constitutional challenges are not substantiated. In a Nov. 7 memorandum asking Elliott to dismiss the case, Assistant Attorney General Michael DeGrandis argued that the law struck a balance between allowing every eligible person to vote and safeguarding the process from fraud.
“New Hampshire pairs that open access with commonsense eligibility checks so only the votes of eligible voters are counted,” DeGrandis wrote. “Striking this balance is essential to guarantee an election system that is both welcoming and vigilant in protecting the integrity of the ballot.”
And he wrote that the law does not impede the organizations suing, and that the individual plaintiffs “have not offered competent evidence of cognizable injuries.”
“It is Plaintiffs’ burden to come forward with definite, competent evidence of injury, causation, and redressability, but they have not,” DeGrandis wrote.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/nashelection-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-21 05:56:52.455465
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-21 10:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,State officials never shared email warning of McCrory conflict,Andrew Brown and Dave Altimari,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/21/doug-mccrory-ct-decd-email/,The DECD was alerted in 2023 of an alleged conflict of interest involving McCrory. But staff never shared it with anyone outside the agency.,"When the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development was alerted in 2023 that Sen. Douglas McCrory allegedly had a conflict of interest with a woman whose businesses received state grant funding, the agency’s staff privately discussed how to handle the potentially damaging information. 
But they never shared the allegations about the Democratic senator with anyone outside their agency.
Gov. Ned Lamont and his staff said they were not informed until recently about the 2023 email in which the director of a Hartford nonprofit complained about a “potential conflict of interest concerning the relationship” between McCrory and Sonserae Cicero, the owner of a company called SHEBA. 
DECD officials also said they never alerted the Office of State Ethics, which could have investigated the matter further. 
And the agency said it didn’t ask McCrory or Cicero about the nature of their relationship because they didn’t have reason or authority to do so. 
Jim Watson, a spokesman for DECD, said the alleged relationship between the state senator and Cicero was considered an “unfounded rumor” in 2023. 
The FBI and a federal grand jury are now investigating whether the allegations are true, however. 
In August, federal investigators subpoenaed DECD for any records that mentioned a “personal or non-professional relationship” between McCrory and Cicero. 
And the 2023 email from Sabrina Tucker Barrett, the nonprofit director, was turned over to federal authorities as part of that process. 
The Connecticut Mirror reported earlier this month that Tucker-Barrett, the founder of Girls For Technology, told DECD officials that she was persuaded to split a $5 million grant with Cicero “based on false representation.”
“We have recently discovered a potential conflict of interest concerning the relationship between Sonsorae [sic] Cicero of SHEBA and Sen. McCrory. The nature and timing of this discovery have raised concerns, and I must admit I feel a degree of political coercion in proceeding with matters I do not fully agree with,” Tucker-Barrett wrote. 
Watson confirmed that DECD officials never forwarded Tucker-Barrett’s email to anyone, but he said agency staff held “internal discussions” about the matter. He declined to identify the people who were involved in those conversations. 
Alexandra Daum, who served as Lamont’s DECD commissioner from late 2022 to 2024, declined to discuss how the agency handled the complaint about McCrory. 
DECD also would not say whether any current or former employees at the agency have been questioned by the FBI or testified in front of the federal grand jury. 
Watson said the agency had no reason to ask McCrory or Cicero whether the two were in a relationship, even though the agency oversaw funding that McCrory helped direct to Cicero through his position as a member of the Minority Business Initiative Advisory Council, a board within DECD. 
Agency leaders also confirmed they never shared the information about McCrory’s alleged “conflict of interest” with the Office of State Ethics, despite a law requiring such disclosure if there’s “reasonable cause” to believe there was an ethics violation. 
Watson said the state ethics law doesn’t cover conflicts of interest for public officials outside their spouses, children or associated businesses and, as a result, the agency didn’t have cause to question McCrory or forward the email to state ethics officials. 
“We will note that the State Code of Ethics does not address alleged personal relationships between public officials and unrelated persons and thus, absent other evidence indicating impropriety, which was not apparent at the time, it would not be appropriate for DECD to probe into the claimed romantic relationships of a legislator nor does DECD have any authority to do so,” Watson said. 
“That said, the fact of the investigation indicates that there may have been an issue, that while not necessarily an ethics violation, is concerning and thus we are reviewing our response so that we can best carry out our obligations to diligently manage the public funds that pass through DECD going forward,” Watson added. 
Peter Lewandowski, the director of the Office of State Ethics, agreed that the sections of the state ethics law dealing with conflicts of interest covers specific relationships like spouses, children and fiancées. 
But he noted that other portions of the law broadly prohibit state officials from using their “public office or position” to “obtain financial gain” for themselves. 
There is no evidence in records reviewed by the CT Mirror that McCrory profited personally from the grants awarded to Cicero’s companies. The federal investigation is ongoing.  
After receiving the 2023 email, Watson said DECD staff spoke with Cicero and Tucker-Barrett and encouraged the two nonprofit leaders to “engage in constructive dialogue to resolve their differences.”
Watson said DECD could not provide any additional details about how the agency responded to the allegations directed at McCrory because of the ongoing criminal investigation. 
“DECD will refrain from speculating now as to the degree which individuals interpreted the email at the time to be aggressive leveraging by one partner towards another, whether there was any factual basis for the allegation, or how the two partnered organizations who had submitted the RFP together resolved their issues and moved forward,” Watson said. “Obviously, these issues are under investigation, and it would not be responsible to speculate about the outcome of the ongoing investigation or make premature conclusions.”
Federal investigators asked DECD this year to turn over records related to McCrory and a number of nonprofits serving Hartford’s north end, and they issued several grand jury subpoenas to other local non-profits with which McCrory interacted. 
Records obtained by CT Mirror and other news outlets in recent months show McCrory helped set up meetings for Cicero, including a face-to-face with U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, and he advocated on her behalf for funding, including grants that flowed through the state Department of Education.  
Lamont, who announced his campaign for a third term last week, declined through his spokesman to answer questions about whether he believes anyone at DECD should be fired or disciplined for failing to report the allegations involving McCrory. 
Meanwhile, the governor’s staff argued it is too early to determine if DECD officials should have shared the email about McCrory with the state ethics office. 
“The governor won’t speculate as to how individuals at DECD interpreted these allegations at the time, the factual basis for them or how the parties resolved them factually and moved forward,” Rob Blanchard, the governor’s spokesperson, said. “It would not be prudent to predetermine the outcome of the ongoing investigation or make premature conclusions.” 
Lewandowski, the state ethics director, confirmed that commissioners and deputy commissioners in Connecticut are considered “mandatory reporters” under the state’s ethics laws and said his staff reminds state employees of those reporting requirements during every training they hold. 
Lewandowski wouldn’t comment on the specific allegations against McCrory or DECD’s decision not to share the email with his office. But he said his staff reviews every complaint it receives so it can determine if further investigation is necessary. 
“Information received by this office, in whatever format, is reviewed in order to determine whether it is suggestive of a potential ethics violation and whether more information should be gathered,” Lewandowski said. 
Sen. Stephen Harding, the Republican minority leader, argued that DECD’s failure to disclose the allegations against McCrory was a misstep on the part of the Lamont administration. And he said the legislature needs to determine why that information was not shared with the proper authorities. 
“I think it is incumbent upon us to provide some oversight on the legislative side,” Harding said.
The Democratic Party holds a supermajority in both chambers of the Connecticut General Assembly, but Harding argued that lawmakers should serve as a check on state agencies and officials that are responsible for distributing millions of dollars in taxpayer money. 
“There needs to be repercussions and regulations surrounding that,” Harding said this week. 
Watson, DECD’s spokesman, said attorneys who are representing the state instructed agency officials not to talk about how they responded to the allegations directed at McCrory. 
“We do not know what the federal investigators would consider relevant, and in order to preserve the integrity of the investigation, we should not identify potential witnesses until such time as the government has had a chance to review the voluminous documents produced and identify whom it considers relevant witnesses,” Watson said. 
Records obtained by the CT Mirror show McCrory continued to push for funding for Cicero and her businesses after 2023. 
Lamont’s office said that DECD and other agencies were put in a tough position in recent years of managing millions of dollars in grant funding, while dealing with state lawmakers who were pushing for state and federal money to go to specific causes and organizations that they supported. 
Blanchard said DECD officials had to decide how to handle questions from McCrory, who was “passionately” advocating for a particular recipient in his district.
“The bottom line is that DECD was put in a difficult spot managing legislators,” Blanchard said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MCCRORYHVAC1107-SR-1-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-21 05:56:52.455465

Ohio utility regulators handed down a quarter billion-dollar penalty Wednesday against FirstEnergy for its part in the Ohio House Bill 6 political bribery and utility bailout scandal.
The Public Utility Commission of Ohio decision comes more than five years after former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder was indicted, and the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel sought a review of FirstEnergy’s conduct.
Ohio House Bill 6
The tainted legislation tacked charges onto Ohioans’ electric bills to bail out aging coal plants.
According to a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice, the company admitted to funneling almost $60 million to Householder to pass the bill and neuter a referendum effort.
“These funds represent an unnerving shadow over our regulatory role in this State and have harmed each and every consumer whose interests we aim to protect in proceedings before us,” the PUCO’s order said.

The bulk of the PUCO’s penalty gets chalked up a provision in Ohio law requiring triple damages when a regulated utility violates state law.
That turned the $60 million slush fund into $180 million in customer restitution. The commission ordered FirstEnergy to refund customers with a bill credit over three billing cycles.
Still, even with triple damages, that amount falls far short of the complete refund many challengers were seeking.
Under H.B. 6, FirstEnergy collected about $460 million from customers through surcharges on their monthly bills to fund grid modernization.
Challengers like the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel argued the company should pay it all back with interest.
But commissioners determined, “the more appropriate amount of restitution to be the very amounts paid in furtherance of the H.B. 6 activities.”
The former chairman
The commission also ordered the company to pay a little more than $40 million in penalties related to bribes it paid to former PUCO chairman Sam Randazzo.
The payments began in 2013, well before Randazzo joined the commission.
In its order, the PUCO found that consulting agreement with a Randazzo controlled company amounted to a corporate separation violation.
Former FirstEnergy executive sheds light on Ohio HB 6 machinations, denies culpability

FirstEnergy, the distribution company, is a regulated monopoly. But it’s affiliate, FirstEnergy Solutions, operated in the unregulated energy generation market.
The problem is Randazzo’s work was meant to benefit FirstEnergy Solutions, but it got billed to FirstEnergy, effectively charging everyday Ohio ratepayers for Randazzo’s services.
In its order, the commission wrote, “the severity of the violation involved and pattern developed over the course of a number of years requires the maximum forfeiture to be assessed.”
The penalty amounted to $21.78 million, or $25,000 a day for the roughly two years that agreement was in place before it was amended with a ‘side deal’ in 2015.
The commission also assessed a $10,000 a day penalty for the more than five years between inking the 2015 side deal and publicly disclosing it in a federal financial filing in 2021. That fine amounted to $18.93 million.
In a separate order, the PUCO levied an additional $23.36 million penalty for corporate separation violations unrelated to H.B. 6.
Reactions
Alongside its order, the PUCO issued statements from the commissioners.
PUCO Chair Jenifer French insisted they “have followed the facts wherever they may lead.”
“These proceedings were the first, and we trust the last, of their kind,” she said. “It is our responsibility and duty to impose appropriate remedies so as to ensure that they are.”
The Ohio Manufacturers’ Association welcomed the decision but insisted the “PUCO’s job isn’t done yet.”
The organization warned regulators are still too willing to accept the utilities’ word when it comes to future projections.
The association is currently appealing a PUCO decision on data centers in the Ohio Supreme Court.
The group argues, in part, that utilities haven’t backed up their forecasts about future power demand.
“Ohio manufacturers won’t tolerate anything less than a fair, transparent energy market,” Ohio Manufacturers Association President Ryan Augsburger said.
“When corruption is ignored, ratepayers get fleeced. Today’s long-overdue action makes clear that accountability isn’t optional and Ohio’s job creators won’t be the ones footing the bill.”
Karin Nordstrom, a clean energy attorney with the Ohio Environmental Council, said the ruling sent a clear message that corruption won’t be tolerated.
“At a time when Ohioans’ electric bills are skyrocketing, the Commission has finally acted to hold FirstEnergy accountable for H.B. 6, forcing FirstEnergy to repay its customers for money it unduly collected,” she said.
Ohio Consumers’ Counsel Maureen Willis said, “Ohioans should never be made to pay for corporate misconduct.”
“Ohioans expect and deserve fair utility bills and utility companies that follow the law,” Willis said.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)A Republican Ohio Senator wants to regulate natural kratom products and ban the synthetic version, while Gov. Mike DeWine wants to ban all kratom products. 
Ohio Senate Bill 299 would require those who sell, distribute and make kratom to register with the Ohio Department of Agriculture. 
The bill would also prohibit synthetic 7-hydroxymitragynine, known as 7-OH, limiting it to no more than one milligram in products. 
Kratom products would only be sold to adults 18 and older under the bill.

Ohio Sen. Bill Blessing, R-Colerain Township, introduced the bill which had sponsor testimony Tuesday during the Ohio Senate General Government Committee meeting. 
“This legislation seeks to establish kratom product standards, labeling requirements, age restrictions, and rulemaking so consumers can make more informed decisions and so we can protect young Ohioans from the risks associated with this substance,” he said. 
Kratom is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and its leaves can be crushed and smoked, brewed or placed in gel capsules. Consuming it at low doses can lead to stimulant effects while high doses can lead to sedative effects. People often take kratom to treat chronic pain, opioid dependence, anxiety and depression. 
The 2023 National Survey on Drug Use & Health estimates there are 1.6 million annual kratom users in the United States. Reported side effects of kratom include high blood pressure, confusion, seizures, weight loss, vomiting, dizziness, and drowsiness. 
Kratom is not controlled under the Controlled Substances Act and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warns against using kratom because of adverse risk effects such as liver toxicity, seizures and substance use disorder. 
The synthetic version of kratom, concentrated with 7-OH, is an opioid-like substance and over the summer the FDA recommended scheduling 7-OH products under the Controlled Substances Act. The FDA clarified they are not focused on natural kratom leaf products. 
Poison control centers in the United States received than 3,400 reports about kratom use — including death — from 2014 to 2019, according to the Mayo Clinic. Kratom was the cause of death in more than 200 unintentional overdoses deaths in Ohio from 2019 to 2024, according to preliminary data from the Ohio Department of Health. 
However, most deaths from kratom also involved other drugs or substances, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. 
During his testimony, Blessing talked about an Ohio man who took his own life this fall after his family said he became addicted to synthetic kratom and experienced severe withdrawal symptoms. 
“The goal of this legislation is to prevent tragedies like this one from occurring by creating common-sense regulations that ensure product safety and protect consumers,” he said. “By treating kratom in the same manner as other botanical products, Ohio can prioritize public health while promoting consumer choice and supporting responsible commerce.”
DeWine called on the Ohio Board of Pharmacy to designate all natural and synthetic kratom compounds as illegal drugs at the end of August, but paused his call for a kratom ban after talking with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 
“These modified kratom products, sold online and in stores, are essentially legal, over-the-counter opiates that anyone – including kids – can buy with just a few bucks,” DeWine said in an Aug. 25 statement. 
It is illegal to buy, use or possess kratom in Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin. Kratom is illegal in some countries including Australia, Denmark, Israel, and Japan, among others. 
Similar kratom bills have passed in Utah, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada, Blessing said.

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)Six months ago, I wrote a piece arguing against the inclusion of a 10-year moratorium on state artificial intelligence regulation in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
The 10-year moratorium aimed to prevent states and political subdivisions from enacting their own regulations on AI development and deployment. This would have made it impossible for school boards, town councils, or any other local government organization to regulate AI.
Fortunately, enough members of Congress heard my plea and the plea of the American public and decided against its inclusion in the bill. However, everything in politics gets a return. 
What was once a near miss has now been revived by President Trump and could become a full-blown AI policy disaster.
Moratorium on state AI policies: part deux  
Shortly after his working lunch with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, President Trump posted twice on Truth Social about national AI policy. Both messages appeared within a span of just 40 minutes and stated: 
“Investment in AI is helping to make the U.S. Economy the ‘HOTTEST’ in the World — But overregulation by the States is threatening to undermine this Growth Engine. Some States are even trying to embed DEI ideology into AI models, producing ‘Woke AI’ (Remember Black George Washington?). We MUST have one Federal Standard instead of a patchwork of 50 State Regulatory Regimes. We can do this in a way that protects children AND prevents censorship!”
“Investment in AI is helping to make the U.S. Economy the ‘HOTTEST’ in the World, but overregulation by the States is threatening to undermine this Major Growth ‘Engine.’ Some States are even trying to embed DEI ideology into AI models, producing ‘Woke AI’ (Remember Black George Washington?). We MUST have one Federal Standard instead of a patchwork of 50 State Regulatory Regimes. If we don’t, then China will easily catch us in the AI race. Put it in the NDAA, or pass a separate Bill, and nobody will ever be able to compete with America.”
Take his comments about diversity, equity, and inclusion as you will. The germane part of these posts is his use of the word “[i]nvestment.” The Saudi royal family has invested billions of dollars into AI development and has a keen interest in influencing American policies to secure this investment. 
Given the rapid-fire nature of his posts, President Trump appears eager to secure more investment from the royal family by supplanting state regulations with a single federal AI policy. While he suggests that this policy could be crafted into its own bill, there is early word out of D.C. that he might try to move more expeditiously with an Executive Order, a constitutionally and legally tenuous approach at best. 
President Trump’s comment about adding a federal AI policy to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) echoes recent comments made by House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who has suggested the same approach. 
Majority Leader Scalise has even said that he is willing to “tuck in” the original language of the 10-year moratorium between NDAA’s pages. Lauded by the think tank R Street, that language reads:
“…no state or political subdivision may enforce, during the 10-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this act, any law or regulation limiting, restricting, or otherwise regulating artificial intelligence models, artificial intelligence systems, or automated decision systems entered into interstate commerce.”
This time around, the language may see more revisions to get through Congress. After all, it was reduced to five years before ultimately being removed from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
Regardless, the fact that this idea is being reintroduced underscores its intent: elimination of state-level regulations to maximize investment in, and accelerate the development of, AI.
A policy of this kind could lead to a litany of economic outcomes. A bigger AI bubble. More AI-related layoffs. Larger amounts of foreign investment. Advancements in chip development. Creation of AI-focused jobs. It could even lead to the onset of superintelligence. 
Whatever the economic outcome, we must consider the impact that such a moratorium could have on young, developing minds. These minds could be set adrift in a world of AI information consumption where the only regulating incentive is profit at all costs.
A federal issue, but local voices must be heard
AI regulation squarely falls under the Interstate Commerce Clause of the Constitution in the same way the internet does. 
My objection to a federal AI moratorium is not rooted in a states’ rights argument. Rather, it stems from a desire to reduce harm to young minds — an argument I’ve made ad nauseam.
If a moratorium lands on the Resolute Desk with language that restricts state and political subdivisions from crafting their own supplemental AI policies, we will end up in a situation where the people who know young minds best have no legal input into how AI influences their lives. 
State governments, school boards, administrators, local governments, and regulatory bodies would be left powerless to mitigate the harms and enhance the benefits from AI that they witness firsthand. 
AI is one of the most significant inventions in human history, and its potential benefits and harms are equally profound. We must adopt a layered approach to its regulation, one that looks beyond a federal-only, economically driven framework. 
When social media and smartphones emerged in the early 2000s, we failed to recognize and regulate their effects on young minds. We now face a similar moment with AI. It has the power to elevate an entire generation of young minds, or to harm them in unprecedented ways. It is essential that we not lose the ability at the local level to help manage this complex and consequential moment.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/trumpsaudi-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-21 04:56:24.224424

Across the country, many communities are seeing an increased presence of federal immigration agents. Chicago, Los Angeles and New York City have seen aggressive and sometimes violent tactics from ICE officers trying to apprehend people from the street and from their homes.

 Show Notes



In Episode 2 of our new Stories from the States podcast, you’ll meet Ayman Soliman, a former Cincinnati Children’s Hospital chaplain. He was detained by ICE for 73 days, and now shares his experience.
Soliman has been in the U.S. since 2014 fleeing persecution from the Egyptian government, where Ayman was detained and tortured for his work as a journalist. In 2018 he was granted asylum in the U.S.
However, his asylum was revoked in June and he was asked to meet with ICE officials on July 9. At the check-in, Ayman was detained by ICE and sent to Butler County Jail in Hamilton, Ohio.
Although the Trump administration contends that ICE is focused on detaining and deporting hardened criminals, Ayman disagrees.
ICE releases Ohio hospital chaplain. Case for detention unclear

“I don’t think these are the worst of the worst. This is just a statement that they made to convince the American public that these people deserve to be deported and to cover their racist reasons behind the deportation.”
With increased ICE raids, many U.S. citizens also have been swept up and detained. You’ll hear from Washington, D.C., Bureau reporter Ariana Figueroa, who has reported about this development.
Finally, Evening Wrap newsletter author Danielle Gaines shares the top stories she’s watching out for.

(Photo by Grant Baldwin/Getty Images)Lately, a weird thing has been happening in national political discussions. Things have gotten down-right conventional. The hum-drum of Washington seems to have returned.
And when things in Washington shift, that signals something new in Kansas politics, too.
Need evidence of the change?
First of all, Democratic politicians are focusing on affordability, of all things, as a tactic to destabilize President Donald Trump, who promised inflation-busting sorcery upon returning to the presidency. Affordability, however, seems down right boring compared to recent national political debates.
Also, the national government shutdown consumed politics during the last month, which gave me Newt Gingerich-era vibes from the 1990s. A central effect of this year’s shutdown was assistance to low-income families, in this case through Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits. That debate reminded me most of even older debates: the misleading 1980s ‘welfare queen’ rhetoric of the Reagan administration when fiscal matters took center stage. 
Politics seemed certain to return to conventional turf when Democrats were forced to return to the bargaining table by nothing juicy: just airports and canceled flights.
And what is more typically Washingtonian than a Beltway sex scandal? The Epstein files scandal has members of Congress battling over who knew what and when. How vintage.
The change in national politics seems familiar, if not downright wholesome. The headlines are more predictable and politically anodyne after 10 years of political pandemonium powered by President Donald Trump.
We spent these years marinating in this MAGA slop: tawdry, inflammatory, corrupt and violent headlines. And many of us swore that one breaking news headline or another — or perhaps the weight of them all — would bring Trump down.
I certainly did. More than three years ago, I predicted the FBI’s raid on Mar-a-Lago would force Republicans to saunter away from Trump. Another extraordinary event on the Trump timeline, the raid and the top secret, yet unsecured, files at his resort would have been the salacious and defining news about most former presidents.
In reaction, I wrote, “The president (that Republicans) once enabled might be doomed — not just legally, but also politically. And it might need to be enough for them to ignore him and to look away.”
Hearing this, his voters, we now know, shrugged.
Count the other past scandals that threatened him. The Access Hollywood tapes. The Stormy Daniels payoff. The Ukrainian phone call. The riot at the Capitol. The campaign rally at the White House.
In this age of climate change, so-called 100-year storms threaten us more often than the past. Similarly, the Trump presidency barraged us with a new scandal — “unprecedented!” — while we are still bailing our cognitive basements from the last one.
A decade living with this political dynamic makes the recent conventional politics seem alien. When Republicans refused this week to bend to Trump’s Epstein files demands, he relented. His iron grip on the GOP slipped, if for the first time. Many presidents have their tenures defined by these divisions within their party.
In opposing Trump, especially in his first term, Democrats appealed to high-minded American ideals: the future of democracy, the rule of law, eliminating corruption and respecting women. It turns out the basic retail politics might have been better strategies all along.
Stressing the rising cost of living, candidates earlier this month won races in New York City for mayor and Virginia for governor. Targeting the billionaire Trump on affordability is effective, because it’s simple.
Up until now, Trump’s scandals and flagrant actions have understandably distracted liberal groups. Talking about inflation when migrant children are being separated from their children would have seemed callous.
But it also might have been ruthlessly effective.
Overstating this moment as a watershed is tempting. This week’s headlines: “7 signs Trump is losing his groove,” from Politico. “Trump Approval Rating Hits Low Point Amid Epstein Controversy—Latest Sign Of GOP Discontent,” from Forbes. “The Day Republicans Beat Trump,” from New York Magazine.
Suddenly news organizations find it easy to find shadowy, brooding photos of Trump, seemingly mulling his demise.
Some of this optimism about siphoning off some of Trump’s power has nothing to do with political tactics. His term limit may be draining some of the jet fuel from his typical political leverage. Democrats shouldn’t get any credit for that.
Here’s another caveat. While the tactics of winning races and damaging Trump may have returned to the political status quo, the acts of this administration have not.
Yes, affordability is the Democratic message. Meanwhile, the White House flatters a crown prince accused of ordering the murder of a journalist, orders immigration raids to continue and flails at prosecuting Trump’s enemies. Similarly, Trump’s values will likely remain central in conservative politics even once his direct power fades.
For all of those reasons, we should wonder how this back-to-the-future moment will test Kansas politicians, from U.S. senators down to school board candidates. Will they be able to ride the enthusiasm within their party for Trump? Or will his declining popularity force them to distance themselves?
Is affordability enough to sway Kansas voters toward Democrats?
These startlingly conventional political questions are back, it seems. And the answers will define the next decade of our civic and cultural life as Kansans.

(Getty Images)Whenever Ohio’s gerrymandered Republican supermajorities in the Statehouse concoct new “culture war” bills to codify book bans, dictate lesson plans in school, mandate bathroom rules, erase marginalized youth, or outlaw diversity, equity and inclusion as the downfall of society, lawmakers always bray about the need to protect the vulnerable young from terrible MAGA imaginings. 
Yet these same disingenuous actors just passed an outrageous child exploitation measure last week as a cheap labor gift to businesses desperate to find workers. 
Ohio Senate Bill 50 is a sweet deal for companies looking to hire for less and work low-cost employees longer hours. 
Republican legislators want to put kids to work as young as 14 and 15 years old on night shifts for cheaper pay than adults. Let them work later at fast food restaurants after a full day of school, they say. Builds character, they say. Imparts valuable skills (over a hot fryer), they say. Helps them be successful, they say. 
Forget about protecting children from greedy corporations looking to maximize profits on the backs of middle schoolers. 
Senate Bill 50 is focused on relieving the burdens of employers battling labor shortages — not learning lapses from sleep-deprived child laborers who fall behind in school and life.
Key industries in the state can’t fill job openings with an ever-shrinking pool of available hires, exacerbated, in part, by the nearly sevenfold increase in ICE deportations of immigrant workers in Ohio this year. 
Exhibit A is Springfield, Ohio, ground zero for JD Vance’s hateful, dehumanizing campaign to eradicate a legal Haitian community welcomed as a revitalizing engine in the region. 
It devastated employers in the area who lost hard-working, reliable employees they can’t replace.
One exploitive solution Ohio and other red states have embraced is to supply companies with child laborers who can temporarily fill employment gaps (and company coffers) during the school year for practically nothing. 
Ohio Senate Bill 50 would allow employers to pay 14- and 15-year-old employees the federal $7.25 minimum wage to work late on school nights — instead of Ohio’s entry level wage of $10.70 per hour.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Ohio Republicans did their business pals and campaign donors a solid. 
They voted to use minors — who should be focused on school and being a kid — to mitigate a depleted labor base (as workers leave Ohio for opportunities or detention camps) and boost company earnings with bargain rate teenage hires.
Picture eighth and ninth graders on the payroll until 9 p.m., with their parents’ permission, as corporate net incomes balloon from revenue generated by sub-minimum wage middle schoolers who can’t even drive yet. 
These are kiddos in school before the sun comes up, off the bus in the afternoon, with friends or buried in homework in the interval and catching a ride to bus tables or man drive-through windows until closing time. 
Does it matter to anyone that Ohio’s youngest workers could get home and in bed by maybe 10:30-11:00 on a school night just to wake up early and do it all again? 
Apparently not in the General Assembly’s Republican caucus that overwhelmingly drove Ohio Senate Bill 50 to passage. 
The legislation clearly regards 14- and 15-year-olds as commodities in service to bottom-line business growth, not as developing children in vital school years who need protection from economic predators. 
The GOP measure was crafted to remedy a scarcity of labor problem, especially in the restaurant and hospitality sectors. 
It weakens century-old child labor protections with extended work schedules for the under 16 workforce that stretch beyond the 7 p.m. restriction stipulated in the federal child labor law.  
The prospect of exhausted teens sleepwalking through school to meet labor demands doesn’t raise eyebrows in Ohio’s ruling party. 
The teen labor bill is emblematic of how little state Republicans value public education as a paramount investment in future generations of Ohioans.
 So what if kids nod off in class, fall behind academically and never catch up if Chick-fil-A can save on hiring costs and plug job vacancies on closing shifts?
Of course, Ohio businesses who take advantage of the GOP’s largesse in Ohio Senate Bill 50, with low-paid, underage workers historically exploited and abused by employers, still risk federal child labor law violations. 
Unfortunately, enforcement of youth labor laws by the Department of Labor hasn’t been great and the number of minors employed in jobs that violate child labor laws is rising precipitously.
But the Ohio lawmakers who bray about protecting the very young from invented MAGA crises are the same ones putting them most in harm with a return to the bad old days of 1938 when Big Business notoriously pounced at the chance to exploit children working long hours for little pay in unsafe conditions without educational opportunities.  
We’re forfeiting the promising futures of school-age Ohio kids to accommodate employers who can’t get enough employees. 
That’s not character-building. That’s a crime.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The state’s school voucher program has exhibited “a myriad of accountability problems” and caused a funding shortfall for public schools, a state audit released this week shows.
The audit, encompassing the 2024-2025 school year, was presented this week to lawmakers, who are spending the weeks leading up to the legislative session learning the woes of the universal school voucher system in which, contrary to how it was marketed, “funding did not follow the child.”
Matthew Tracy, deputy auditor general for the state, presented the 22-page audit to each legislative education budget committee Thursday. Tracy’s team recommended the Legislature change the timing of scholarship application windows and provide more financial support to avoid funding shortfalls.
Sen. Don Gaetz, R-Crestview, said that at any given moment the state does not know where 30,000 students are in terms of school categories — traditional public or voucher-supported private or home schools — together worth $270 million in education support.
Sen. Don Gaetz (Photo/Florida Senate)
Gaetz spearheaded an unsuccessful bill last year, SB 7030, to change various parts of the voucher system. 
In 2024-2025, the department paid $655 million to middleman scholarship funding organizations, as statutes prescribe, before school started. That’s part of the questioned accounting practices. 
“Any improper payments, any ineligible amounts, you’re paying and chasing those amounts, because the dollar’s already gone out the door,” Tracy said. 
Last month, the House held committee meetings during which members asked scholarship funding organizations and the department about miscalculations and processes. Those meetings provided initial numbers of how many students were double-counted or lost in fuzzy accounting. For example, the state’s largest scholarship funding organization sent at least $7 million to families before verifying whether their students were attending a private school or homeschooling.
School daze: Rapid expansion of voucher program leaves public, private schools underpaid

Earlier this month, legislators approved a $47 million budget amendment to make up for traditional public schools shortchanged by the accounting inaccuracies at the end of the previous fiscal year, even after tapping into $118 million from the education stabilization fund, through which the Legislature can cover voucher-related budget overruns. In the meantime, some districts were caught off guard after education funding from the state ran dry. 
Foreseeable for some
Sen. Jennifer Bradley, R-Fleming Island, said the audit showed “a lot of concerning information.” 
“I wouldn’t say wholly unforeseeable, given the rapid expansion of the program in the last couple years — which has been a point of concern that I’ve had for many years here — is how are we going to make sure that we track students, have budget accountability, have budget predictability,” Bradley said. 
In the past four years, the voucher program has grown rapidly, serving about 500,000 students during the past school year. In 2021-2022, the program had served about 200,000 students. In 2024-2025, the program dished out $3.17 billion in Family Empowerment Scholarship vouchers and recorded another $804.5 million in scholarship programs funded through corporate tax credits, totaling nearly $4 billion dollars.  
In some respects, the state went “beyond” state law, but also missed “various opportunities … to further accountability over the use of State education funds and timelier and more effectively identify and halt duplicate payments and recoup ineligible amounts.”
“I’m disgusted; this is another, in eight years I’ve been here, ‘I told you so,’ and they’re just getting more and more expensive,” Sen. Jason Pizzo, NPA-Sunny Isles Beach, said. 
The audit found that as of June 30, the end of the last fiscal year, $36 million sat in scholarship accounts unspent as did more than $367 million in scholarship accounts for students with disabilities.
At the end of the 2024-25 school year, nearly 300 accounts for students with disabilities held “excess balances,” or more than $50,000 each in unspent money. The sum of the excess alone was $2.3 million. 










A family can’t run their family budget this way. They wouldn’t survive, they’d be in the street


– Sen. Jason Pizzo, NPA, Sunny Isles Beach


Pizzo focused on “float,” the lost value of interest that could be collected on money that is not in state hands when it could or should be. 
“Certainly, you could never close out books for a company or an organization the way this is,” Pizzo said, adding that “a bunch of [Department of Education] bureaucrats just don’t understand finance. This is so bad.”
Tracy said it “was not evident that the department had sufficient staff resources to perform its critical duties.”
“I think that this is a cautionary tale to what can happen if you don’t phase things in and you don’t take the appropriate and adequate amount of time with something as transformational as this program truly was,” Senate Appropriations Committee on Pre-K-12 Education Chair Sen. Danny Burgess, R-Zephyrhills, said.
The Department of Education said it has addressed concerns raised in the audit that directly implicate the department.
“We’re trusted with these dollars, and we kept using, ‘Does the department have the authority, the authority, the authority.’ I’m left myself asking, ‘Does the department have the ability to actually reconcile these issues?’” Pizzo said.

Corey Simon, R-Tallahassee, would separate the school choice scholarships from the Florida Education Finance Program (FEPF), the mechanism that funds traditional public schools, and would expand the education stabilization fund.
The auditor’s report recommended separating scholarship payments from the FEFP, making it a separate “silo” in the budget.
“The auditor general said in his meeting with the chair and myself that whatever can go wrong with this system has gone wrong,” Gaetz said. 
The bill would establish monthly payments to families and schools and provide student IDs to private school students, too, a focus of House committee hearings last month. 
“We do not have a perfect bill to introduce, but we have a bill which fixes these issues, which, left unaddressed, will continue to worsen and threaten to disrupt and imperil school choice in Florida,” Gaetz said. 
There seems to already be a difference in House and Senate approaches.
House PreK-12 Budget Subcommittee Chair Rep. Jenna Persons-Mulicka, R-Fort Myers, said moving scholarship funding outside of the FEFP “would be a huge mistake and that would end universal school choice in the state of Florida.”

Persons-Mulicka said the problem is not the funding model, but instead the implementation of the program. 
“If you change the funding model, create a new funding model, who’s to say there still won’t be implementation problems?” Persons-Mulicka said. 
Included in the audit is the Department of Education’s response, which agreed with separating the the school choice programs from the FEFP.
“The Department acknowledges that, while the popularity and growth of the scholarship programs evidence their value and need, the administrative systems supporting these programs must keep pace with their implementation,” Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas wrote.
Gaetz said the program must be “partially reengineered.”
“We can’t just rearrange the deck chairs, we have to make sure that we change course in the ways that the auditor general has recommended,” Gaetz said.

That declaration states, in part, that all men are created equal and that they were endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights; among these being life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
We’ve been struggling, very largely unsuccessfully, with that mandate ever since.
In the context of its Black population, for instance, even some of the signers of the Declaration were slaveholders with no intentions of changing their own lifestyles by freeing them. Arguments between succeeding generations of slaveholders and Northern abolitionists became uglier over the next 85 years, and, as we painfully know, we fought a Civil War that killed in the neighborhood of 750,000 young Americans. 
It was also the prime cause of the assassination of perhaps our greatest president. For about 12 years, from 1865 until 1877, a period known as our Reconstruction Era, a number of national laws were adopted that were intended to correct many inequities in our culture. The 13th Constitutional Amendment, for instance, prohibited slavery almost entirely. The 14th Amendment granted full citizenship to all native- born and naturalized Americans as well as assuring them of due process and equal protection under established laws. The 15th Amendment provided full voting rights for all male citizens and enjoined all States from abridging these rights on the basis of race, color, or previous servitude. 
Most regrettably, however, between 1875 and 1894 a combination of Supreme Court rulings and Congressional enactments repealed most of the enforcement provisions of these laws. The result of those relaxations gave rise to an explosion of Southern laws and practices, referred to broadly as Jim Crow rules and regulations. These restraints segregated Black people from whites in schools, public accommodations, and economic opportunities. Those inequalities prevailed as legally unchallenged hardships for more than half a century. 
Finally, the Congress passed the Civil Rights Act in 1964 under enormous pressures from a civil rights movement that had gained political clout from the leadership of a number of Black citizens, especially from Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. 
The Civil Rights Act banned segregation in education, employment, and voting rights. The last of these was reinforced in 1965 with the passage of the Voting Rights Act, which banned racial discrimination in election processes in every state by ruling against things like literacy tests, language proficiency, or skin color standards. In the meantime, starting in the mid-1800’s, the issue of women’s rights had been pursued by several female activists like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and a female suffrage amendment was first considered by the Congress in 1878. Unbelievably enough, It took a full four decades for the 19th Amendment to get ratified.
Two kinds of inequalities
With all of that history, then, where have we arrived in terms of people equality in the 21st Century? Sociologists advise us that despite considerable legal restraints, our practices and our culture are rife with two pervasive kinds of inequalities; the structural racist sort and the more foundational systemic category. 
The former is rooted in many historical injustices, like segregation and broad discrimination in a variety of forms. It is manifest in any number of ways. For instance, the quality of available educational opportunities is impacted in many communities by biased taxation policies that assess white-owned properties at higher rates than Black or recent immigrant sites. This results in more funds being allocated to the former school districts than the latter. This, in turn, means better facilities and better teaching. 
Another source of inequalities is vested in health care systems that are based fundamentally on abilities to pay. Less affluent members of our society can and do have less access to top notch care than their more monied peers. Statistics have demonstrated that there are serious national financial implications of socially differentiated health care. 
It is estimated that nationally we lose about $175 billion annually from our potential GDP because of shortened working life spans.   Systemic racism is rooted in our belief systems and various inappropriate ideologies. We notice it when we observe talk and initiatives such as the white Christian nationalism cult, which totally ignores the reality that America is a nation of immigrants and hypocritically talks about their commitment to core Christian values while violating them in their demeaning behavior. 
We also suffer from ethnic and racial stereotyping which is displayed in everyday biased activities like law enforcement where minorities are much too often treated more harshly than others for similar conduct.
Addressing these cultural inequalities effectively will require vastly different leadership than what we have elected to national, state, and local offices recently. 
Our current national government is continuously installing divisive measures that tear at the foundations of our United States. It is startling to see masked ICE troops, President Trump’s private police force, roaming the streets, homes and offices of America and forcibly detaining people without grounds or due legal process.
These outrages mirror the same sort of atrocities carried out by Mussolini’s Italian Blackshirts and Hitler’s German Brownshirts in the 1930’s. But then, when you have someone behaving like a narcissistic megalomaniac in charge of our government, one who openly admires the style of dictators, why should we be surprised?  
Astonishing levels of inequality
Economically, we have astonishing  levels of inequality between the compensation of policy-level office holders and their employees. Recent analysis has revealed that on average, CEOs are compensated 285 times the pay of their workforces. In some extreme cases, typically reflecting the discriminations applied to racial minorities and immigrants, the multipliers are above 600. 
Companies such as Starbucks have been glaring examples of that kind of inequality, but such dubious distinctions are clearly shared by many other organizations in areas like household services and healthcare. Responsible analyses of relative real values added by the respective levels of employment would surely demonstrate the unfairness of these gaps. 
In a different category, although some positive improvement has been realized very recently, women across the nation are still being paid an average of 17% less than their male counterparts for similar responsibilities at work. In the tax and legislative area, something referred to as a “Big Beautiful Bill” by its Republican sponsors was passed into law by Congress under severe pressure from the White House. This measure, besides adding close to $4 trillion dollars to what is now an unsustainable national debt, severely cut back funding for Medicaid, effectively blocking access to prime medical support for huge numbers of America’s low-income cohort. It also provided major tax breaks for the wealthiest less than 1% of our country while raising the cost of living for most of the rest of us, as the impacts of the current outrageous and internationally divisive tariff/tax instruments kick in.
 Voter apathy let this happen
So how did this inequality calamity come about? How has America developed more children and seniors living in poverty than any other nation in the developed world?
That is a complicated question, but widespread disaffection with government, which is shared by every age group of our current and recent electorate, is a significant part of the answer. Additionally, the 50% or so of eligible voters, who even bother to exercise their voting franchise, typically re-elect about 90% of incumbent Congressional officeholders without meaningful concern for their performances in office. 
This pervasive lack of accountability has allowed a self-privileged political class to settle into the instruments of national governance. Based on their recent fear of being primaried, Republicans doing the servile work of bowing to Trump’s specious whims have given us all the evidence we need to conclude that keeping their jobs is their dominant motivation; public interests be damned. 
Name-calling, retributive investigations and indictments, pay-for-play transactions, ignorance and disregard for laws and precedents dominate the current legislative and executive scenes. Crackpot theories, contempt for proven science, astonishing levels of corruption, and implementing the democracy-debilitating Project 2025 doctrine’s provisions have left no intent or room for dealing with climate change, gun violence, or other existential issues. 
As this was being written, millions of unhappy Americans assembled across all of America to express their dismay and anger toward our current government in “No Kings” protests. That is a strong message for our government to get back to working on what is best for our people. It is an important way to keep pressure on Congress and the Administration. regrettably, however, real positive change can only be affected at the ballot box.
The hour is already late for developing a game-changing number of truly honest and conflict-ready candidates for national office in 2026 mid-term elections. The Democrats, to borrow a phrase from David Corn’s Mother Jones newsletter, need to quit bringing policy papers to a gunfight. 
Serious but peaceful activism for the people’s benefit needs to be stimulated among ALL OF THE ELECTORATE in every local precinct, neighborhood, town, city and state. Our schools, societies and professional associations can add important muscle to the arguments for full and truthful expressions of our history as well as for the honest and reasonably regulated conduct of our diverse businesses. Our churches of every denomination can address the entire issue of inequality, especially where ugly immorality is so often present.
Nothing less than our fundamental freedoms are at stake.

Peter Auster, chief scientist
My first experience visiting this vast wonder was in 1978, when conducting marine mammal surveys.  Every single time I went out to the shelf edge, I knew I was entering an unfamiliar world. The color of the water changed. The scent of the air was different. I encountered marine wildlife I had never seen before. In 1984, I first experienced what is now the Monument from the underwater side in a research submersible. It really is like visiting a part of the planet that few have witnessed firsthand before. It’s the twilight zone and the deep ocean. It’s a true marine wilderness.
Each visit after that reinforced the idea that we need to protect these animals and their habitats from long-term harm.
In 2001, my colleagues and I led the first leg of the first expedition for National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) new ocean exploration program. I had the privilege to dive into the deep-sea gorges that run deeper than the Grand Canyon and discover the beauty underneath the surface. It was like something out of a Dr. Suess book. Large and colorful sea creatures like deep-sea corals and fish with strange appendages wandered by the viewports. The beauty and wonder of it all ran from the sky to the seafloor.
The Northeast Canyons and Seamounts were officially designated a marine national monument in 2016, after years of advocacy for the creatures and habitats that reside there.  But over the last decade, presidential administrations have played tug-of-war with the monument’s vital protections.  


During the first Trump administration, the monument’s protections were rolled back, making the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts vulnerable to disturbances from commercial-scale fishing. During the Biden Administration, these protections were reinstated.  Now, in a second Trump administration, we find the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts to be threatened again under the guise of freeing the fishing industry from regulation and increasing seafood market competitiveness.
Opening the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts, or any marine national monument, to commercial-scale fishing has serious consequences for these protected areas, which serve as places of refuge for marine wildlife and the habitats in which they live. Commercial fishing removes and displaces wildlife, impacts biodiversity, and alters ecosystems. We need these protected places to understand the impacts of our activities elsewhere in the sea. But monuments don’t only exist to serve scientists. Most important, the existence of monuments further humanity’s goals of preserving the planet we live on and our collective natural heritage. Monuments serve as a contribution to, and an example for, global conservation efforts.
Much of my career has focused on exploring how ocean ecosystems work, human impacts in the sea, and how we balance human needs and the obligation to protect sensitive and vulnerable places for which we are stewards. The Northeast Canyons and Seamounts are under threat of being harmed in ways from which they may never recover.  The area is 1.5% of US waters in the Atlantic region and 0.11% of waters under US jurisdiction in all oceans.  Why is this such a problem? Opening this monument to commercial scale fishing will do nothing substantial to improve catch or markets for the industry.
It is more important than ever to stand up for ocean wildlife, ocean places, and our marine monuments and sanctuaries that draw us to the sea. Our future, and our natural heritage, depend on it.

Carl Jackson (D-Baltimore County) and Del. Ryan Nawrocki (R-Baltimore County) discuss a bill that would bring the county's schools under the gaze of the county inspector general. (Photo by Steve Crane/Maryland Matters)Baltimore County lawmakers said Thursday that they will introduce bills that could give the county’s Office of Inspector General oversight over the Baltimore County Public Schools.
The bills, introduced by Sen. Carl Jackson (D-Baltimore County) and Del. Ryan Nawrocki (R-Baltimore County, come in response to an August resolution by the county council, asking the General Assembly for the authority to bring the county board of education under the inspector general. If passed, it would be up to the council to make the change, which would likely not come before 2027.
At a news conference in Annapolis to announce the bills, Jackson and Nawrocki were joined by Baltimore County Council Chair Mike Ertel and County Councilman David Marks. All four said the proposal was not a response to any single incident at the school system but was solely an attempt to increase accountability and transparency for parents and taxpayers, what one referred to as “just good government stuff.”
“This is not to cast aspersions,” but to be as transparent and accountable as possible, Nawrocki said. Jackson and others noted that the school systems in Montgomery and Prince George’s counties are both subject to independent oversight, and that it only makes sense for Baltimore County schools to be subject to external review as well — more than just audits, but investigations if necessary.

The county council resolution, which passed 6-1, only cited the “very public controversy this year over the County School System’s budget,” which makes now “the appropriate time to advance more transparency and accountability in the County Board of Education.”
“We have a great school system,” said Ertel, before noting that it accounts for about half the county’s budget in a given year. “There is not necessarily anything nefarious or criminal. This just puts another set of eyes on the system.”
When asked for comment on the legislation, a school system spokesperson noted that Superintendent Myriam Rogers “was asked at a previous press conference and shared that BCPS is committed to working closely with all partners,” and that the system would have no further comment.
Ertel said the inspector general’s office would likely need additional staff to take on the county school system. It’s not unrealistic to think that the office might have to double its staff of six, given the fact that adding the school system would be doubling the size of the government it reviews, but he said there have been no talks on when or how an expansion might occur.
“It’s not a big line item for the taxpayer,” given the potential savings that could come from inspector general review, Ertel said. The potential for savings was echoed by others.
The legislature tried unsuccessfully to pass similar legislation in 2021, including a bill by then-Sen. Kathy Klausmeier (D), who was sworn in as county executive earlier this year to replace Johnny Olszewski Jr. after he was elected to Congress.
Jackson and Nawrocki said they know there will be some opposition to their bills in the county delegation, but that the overall response among their colleagues has been positive and they are optimistic about the legislation’s chances. The fact that a Democratic senator and a Republican delegate could come together to push the legislation shows it’s broadly supported and augurs well for its chances, they said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1944-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-21 09:57:54.237209

He foresees a $63 million sports complex in Douglas County bumping up tourism, spurring new commercial development and helping to stop the slow bleed of young people from the state. 
But the proposed 181,000-square-foot complex that could involve the Omaha Supernovas won’t happen, he told a state board on Thursday, without a public incentive available through the Sports Arena Facility Financing Assistance Act (SAFFAA).
A sticking point for that project — as well as eight others that in the past year have requested the incentive —  is that under the Nebraska law, Gov. Jim Pillen’s vote of approval must be among the board’s majority before the project moves on to other necessary hurdles, such as local votes of the people. 
Pillen missed the last two board meetings. The state’s lieutenant governor filled in for him Thursday and also at an October meeting. Pillen attended the board meeting prior to that, last December, but no action was taken on any application.
Thursday, following a public meeting that stretched nearly five hours, the board did not vote on any of the four projects presented. A Pillen spokesperson later told the Nebraska Examiner that the governor would not vote on any of the proposals until June 2026 at the earliest.
 Loopholes, carveouts

Spokesperson Laura Strimple referred to the incentive as a “government handout” and said any of the applicants could move forward by opting for private funding.
“Governor Pillen will not be a party to further erosion of Nebraska’s sales tax base with new loopholes and carveouts when there is still not a reliable indication from the Legislature that existing sales tax loopholes and imbalances can be closed and corrected to achieve lasting and transformative property tax relief,” she said in a statement.

Pillen has tried for years to get lawmakers to broaden the state sales tax base by eliminating exemptions so he can use the money to offset local property taxes.
Strimple said that by June, the Legislature would have had a chance “to remedy our Swiss cheese sales tax code and create a healthy tax environment for some of these projects to succeed.”
As it stands now, nine proposed projects by applicants from Omaha to Valentine await the board’s action. 
Here’s how the financing incentive generally works: For bigger cities, up to 70% of new state sales taxes generated within 600 yards of the sports facility goes to help pay off bonds for construction. The “new” tax revenue generated refers to sales on tickets or at retailers that sprout in the designated area after the project is announced. In most cases, city voters must approve the use of such bonds. For smaller cities, the state assistance, or turnback, is up to 25% of the new state sales taxes generated. 
 Applicants left waiting 

Four applicants on Thursday presented their case for the state assistance: 

Douglas County is a co-applicant with Nebraska Elite Volleyball. The sports complex would rise near 180th Street and West Maple Road and contain 12 full-sized volleyball courts, six full-sized indoor basketball courts, two full-sized indoor sand volleyball courts and more than 10,000 square feet of multipurpose space for events and viewing. 
City of Gretna with co-applicant Wolf Pack Sports Foundation. Project: $28.5 million sports complex featuring cheer athletics (six full-sized spring floors, two full-sized dead floors, tumbling tunnel, dance space and training areas) and five full-sized basketball courts convertible for volleyball courts.
City of West Point. Project: $8.1 million recreation center including two multi-purpose courts that can be partitioned off to make four smaller courts for an array of youth and adult sports such as basketball, baseball, pickleball and a walking track.
City of La Vista. Project: $48.31 million parking facility to serve The Astro, a privately-owned concert venue at the City Centre development.  

Brett Lindstrom, who, as a former state lawmaker, championed amendments to the turnback tax law that were adopted in 2021, told the board and an overflowing hearing room that he did not see a loss to the state. The law was modified even more later. Lindstrom argues that the facilities will draw tourism-related dollars as facilities host tournaments and events.

Lindstrom and others talked about how states beyond Nebraska are capitalizing on the youth sports industry. He said new facilities would help “level the playing field” for the state. 
Craig Wolf, who is driving the application for the Gretna cheer facility, said he was disappointed the governor was not present to hear testimony from youths, employers and supporters.
“Every single one of these should be approved, not because it’s a money grab. We are so far behind,” he said. “This project is not just an investment in the building. It is an investment in people and the future of our state.”
 Filling hotels

Robert Sabin, general manager of Hilton Omaha, spoke of hotel occupancy spikes due to tournaments such as the ASICS Presidents Day extravaganza hosted in February by Elite Volleyball. Tourism officials describe it as a four-day, $10 million annual event based at the organization’s current Elkhorn home, the Union Bank and Trust facility.
“This tournament delivers like no other,” Sabin said.
He said the proposed facility could nearly double that tournament activity — “and fill hotels from Columbus to Lincoln.”
Tyler Toline, president and CEO of Franciscan Care Services in West Point, said his hospital is contributing to the cost of the proposed sports facility in West Point. Other project applicants say they have funding sources beyond the incentive as well. Toline sees the project in his city as a way to attract workers, saying that medical and health care recruits commonly ask: What is there to do for my family?
“The biggest thing they want is amenities for their kids,” said Toline, a former Husker football player. 
Deb Carlson, president and CEO of Nebraska Methodist College, sees a connection between Wolf’s cheer athletic facility and the labor force. She explained how Wolf introduced himself to her at a state workforce summit, adding that she knew nothing then about the competitive cheer scene.

Wolf wanted to create a pathway for his athletes, who currently train at a smaller La Vista gym, Carlson said. The first four students who came to see her exhibited traits Carlson called critical to caring for people, including discipline, teamwork and resiliency. She offered them scholarships on the spot.
“Having those qualities in our students is what we’re all looking for,” Carlson said. “Cheer athletes know what it means to fall and get back up.”
 Brain drain plug

La Vista Mayor Doug Kindig said the state assistance will help fund parking facilities related to The Astro concert venue, which draws world-class entertainment to the City Centre campus. 
While not the typical application, La Vista officials said SAFFAA was written to also promote construction of publicly owned parking facilities near a privately owned concert venue like The Astro.
Kindig said the parking structure would further two critical goals: attracting tourism and retaining young people who want to be in a vibrant community. He said the city already has seen an increase in young visitors to the City Centre development and knows parking is key.
“The city also shares the goal of attracting visitors to spend their disposable income in La Vista as  it will boost sales tax revenues and reduce our property tax burden,” he said in a letter to state officials.
Five other SAFFA applications were pending prior to Thursday:

City of Norfolk with co-applicant Northeast Nebraska Youth Sports Association. Project: $31.57 million two-phase sports complex.


City of  Valley with co-applicant Elkhorn Athletic Association. Project: $11.1 for the second phase of the First Interstate SportsPlex, whose total price tag was $24.8 million. Four additional baseball/softball fields, new concession and restroom building, maintenance building and paved parking lot for 1,800 vehicles.


City of Valentine. Project: $9.38 million enclosed, city-owned multi-venue wellness center and competitive sports complex that includes two multipurpose sports courts, a fitness center, walking track, coaching classrooms and parking. 


City of Lincoln and co-applicant N4VB (Nebraska for Volleyball). Project: $17.2 million youth sports complex with minimum of eight indoor volleyball courts with capacity to expand to 12 courts and associated uses such as performance training and concessions areas.


City of Omaha with co-applicant Omaha Performing Arts. Project: Promote arts and culture through education and engagement activities in the new downtown Omaha Tenaska Center and across the state. Funds would come from state sales tax generated from Steelhouse Omaha, estimated at $2 million a year. 

 Former Husker players

Former Nebraska Heisman Trophy winning quarterback Eric Crouch made an appeal to Pillen in a letter regarding the Valley project. Crouch is a co-founder of EAA, which is seeking the incentive.
“I can only imagine how many lives this will change and dreams that will come true,” he said. “I see this area being a destination for many athletes, fans, families and sports enthusiasts for years to come.”

The applicants expect ancillary development of about $28 million, including restaurants, a hotel and retail space. By year five, they foresee nearly 19,000 hotel room night stays and $31 million in annual economic impact from operations and off-site spending.
Visit Omaha’s former executive director Deborah Ward said in a letter that the first phase of the Valley project, in just the first six months of 2024, welcomed more than 9,000 out of town visitors from cities such as Chicago, Minneapolis, Denver and Los Angeles.  
EAA says it currently serves more than 8,000 kids annually in 10 sports from over 75 zip codes. Proposed enhancements, additional fields will attract even larger events and boost visitor numbers and economic impact, supporters said. EAA foresees nearly one million local and regional visitors to the complex annually upon completion.
“The facility has become a new destination for regional and national tournaments and its continued success helps sustain Omaha’s reputation as a premier sports destination,” Ward said. 
 Sports, a ‘powerful tool’

Andrew Wehrli, volleyball coach at Omaha Westside High School, during the Thursday hearing echoed sentiments of many who spoke about the value sports have to youth, in developing mentally tough young people.
He spoke of how he was raised by an abusive dad who had him believing he was “worthless” until coaches stepped in.
“Sports are a powerful tool that changed the trajectory of my life,” he said. “My story is just one of many.”

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)State officials and anti-homelessness organizations  said they fear a shift in federal funding priorities could result in thousands of Marylanders who now benefit from permanent housing assistance, instead facing homelessness once again.
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development last week announced policy changes that cut funding from permanent housing solutions for people experiencing homelessness, opting for an emphasis on temporary housing supports.
HUD Secretary Scott Turner said in a statement that the change “restores accountability to homelessness programs and promotes self-sufficiency among vulnerable Americans.”
“It redirects the majority of funding to transitional housing and supportive services, ending the status quo that perpetuated homelessness through a self-sustaining slush fun,” his statement said.
But Maryland Housing Secretary Jake Day says the funding change would cut $42 million from Maryland programs that help provide permanent housing options to people struggling with homelessness.

“The Trump Administration’s decision will directly result in a 25 percent spike in homelessness across Maryland. It will reverse decades of progress to reduce unsheltered homelessness,” Day said in a statement Thursday.
“It will force domestic violence survivors to return to abusive households and unaccompanied youth to couchsurf with strangers,” Day said. “And it will increase burdens on hospital emergency departments, fire, police, EMS, and shelters.”
Concerns from advocates primarily revolve around funding changes for a program called Continuum of Care. A recent Notice of Funding Opportunity for the program raised alarm bells for housing advocates.
The National Low Income Housing Coalition says the policy changes “will quickly upend homelessness response systems throughout the country and increase homelessness.”
“The new policy … slashes support for permanent housing programs by more than half, putting as many as 170,000 people who rely on CoC assistance for stable, affordable housing at risk of returning to homelessness,” the coalition said.
The coalition said that about 87% of the $3.5 billion typically allocated for Continuum of Care goes to permanent housing solutions for people facing homelessness. The recent funding notice would reduce the amount allocated for permanent housing down to 30%, or little more than $1 billion, with a preference for temporary housing options.
Groups like the National Low Income Housing Coalition say the temporary options — such as high-barrier transitional housing or emergency shelters — can be less effective and cost more in the long run.
People facing chronic homelessness often struggle with mental health needs and drug addiction. Advocates say that permanent housing programs may address those challenges by pairing with connections to mental health services and other resources.

“Funding goes to communities for a range of homelessness assistance,” said Kevin Lindamood, president and CEO for Health Care for the Homeless in Maryland, during a virtual roundtable discussion Thursday with Maryland agency leaders. “But over the last 20 years, in a very bipartisan way, HUD funding has been moving much toward helping people find housing and keeping it.”
Housing advocates say that moving away from the permanent housing solutions will undo progress made in recent years to reduce the number of homeless people across the United States, including in Maryland.
Day said that “Housing First” policies have been effective over the last decade.
“Utilizing Housing First practices, we have cut unsheltered homelessness by 42% and overall homelessness by 28% since 2015,” he said. “The experts and bipartisan officials agree: permanent supportive housing is the evidence-based practice that most effectively and most affordably solves homelessness.
“$46 million in cuts to Maryland’s funding allocation will result in more than 2,400 Maryland households – including 4,300 people and 1,900 children – losing their homes,” Day said. “With no available vouchers, no surplus of affordable units, and no alternatives to absorb this massive displacement, the vast majority will be forced straight back into homelessness.”

Dominguez detailed plans for a  potential new power generation facility in Harford County. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)There’s a slight hitch in Constellation Energy’s plan to construct a new natural-gas fired power plant in Maryland: The potentially prohibitive cost of delivering natural gas to the proposed Harford County site.
“We will need some help on that,” Constellation CEO Joe Dominguez told a room full of policymakers, businesspeople and lobbyists Thursday. “I was told that the gas interconnection — the extension of the gas to the site to enable these things — is something like $800 million.”
His comments came in a speech at the Maryland Chamber of Commerce’s 2025 Policy Forum at the University of Maryland, College Park. Dominguez laid out Constellation’s plans for more energy generation, challenged state lawmakers to help — both financially and in terms of policy — and railed against the idea that electric utilities, such as Exelon, would be allowed to get back in the business of power generation, in competition with Constellation.
The remarks also came as Constellation is hoping to get fast-track approval for new power generation, one of a number of measures approved this year under the Next Generation Act, as lawmakers responded to high energy bills enraging consumers.
Constellation submitted three projects to Next Generation Act approval: a larger natural gas generating facility and a smaller version, as well as a proposal for 800 megawatts of battery storage, which could contribute power onto the grid during times of peak demand.

Dominguez, for the first time, identified Constellation property near the Perryman Generating Station in Aberdeen, as the site for all three projects.
The Perryman site already hosts oil- and gas-fired generating units, but Dominguez said transporting additional natural gas to the site would still come at a steep cost, according to the company’s internal estimates. Constellation could turn to the General Assembly for help, he said.
He noted that some states, for instance, have used bonds to finance desired energy projects, Dominguez said. But, whereas regulated utilities, like those in Maryland, usually receive a guaranteed return on their investment of 10%, the state requires utilities to build the infrastructure at cost.
“They say to the utilities: ‘Look, we’ll raise, in a bond, the money and give it to you. But you don’t add 10% to the bill,’” Dominguez said in an interview.
As for the cost of connecting the Perryman plan to natural gas lines, Baltimore Gas & Electric spokesman Nick Alexopulos said in a statement that his company “has not provided Constellation Energy or any other merchant generator an estimate for work related to proposals submitted under the Next Generation Energy Act.”
“BGE is committed to working with merchant generators and other partners to solve the state of Maryland’s energy security challenges,” Alexopulos said. BGE is an Exelon company.
Dominguez said Constellation also wants assurance from Maryland policymakers that they actually want new gas generation to respond to ever-increasing power demand projections, largely from data centers. Otherwise, Constellation won’t build it, he said.
Just a few years ago, Maryland lawmakers passed the Climate Solutions Now Act, which requires the state to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 60% from 2006 levels by 2031. Gov. Wes Moore (D) has backed a goal to meet the state’s electricity needs with 100% clean energy by 2035.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
That shifted with soaring utility bills that paved the way for the Next Generation Act, but the idea of new gas-fired power plants has unsurprisingly attracted ire from climate groups.
“You shouldn’t say: ‘I’m really upset no one is building natural gas fired generation, and simultaneously have a policy that says anybody who builds merchant gas-fired generation has got to be out of business by 2035,” Dominguez told the crowd on Thursday.
The Next Generation Energy Act created a new regulatory fast-track through the Maryland Public Service Commission for certain energy projects. Policymakers did not explicitly call for new natural gas. Instead, they said zero-emissions projects should outnumber emissions-generating ones, and they required that any new gas plant have the potential to transition to hydrogen fuel.
Besides Constellation, only two other companies put in
Only two other companies put in applications for the fast-tracked project  by the Oct. 31 deadline — one for an upgrade at an existing gas plant in Prince George’s County and another entirely confidential proposal. The PSC has until late December, 60 days after the deadline, to decide which proposals will receive the expedited consideration
The PSC also opened a procurement for the state to buy battery energy storage technology, which attracted proposals from BGE and Potomac Edison, among others.
Exelon wants to build a power plant in Maryland, reversing decades of deregulation policy

If electric utilities like Exelon were to reenter the power generation business, it would reverse a Maryland policy that has stood for more than a quarter-century. It would also mean that ratepayers would foot the bill.
Constellation had been part of Exelon, but it was spun off.
“It is curious to us, as you can imagine,” Dominguez said. “Constellation was launched a little bit over 40 months ago. It was launched by Exelon because Exelon decided it did not think it was prudent to put its owner’s money into the generation business.”
“Every bit of expertise, including operating all the land, all the equipment, came with us to Constellation,” Dominguez added.
In response, Alexopulos from BGE said it’s clear that Exelon’s campaign has “struck a nerve.”
“The generation needed in Maryland won’t build itself. Instead of focusing on who shouldn’t build, we are focused on who will,” Alexopulos wrote. “Private energy generation corporations have not offered meaningful solutions sufficient to solve the supply crisis at the heart of rising energy costs, as the most recent bids for energy development in Maryland show once again.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC09165-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-20 21:57:07.926803

Mike Dunleavy.  The update on Tuesday from Maj. Gen. Torrence Saxe, Adjutant General of the Alaska National Guard and Commissioner […]","U.S. Army National Guard UH-60L Black Hawk aviators, assigned to the 207th Aviation Troop Command, transport supplies to Napakiak, Alaska, Nov. 19, 2025, while supporting Operation Halong Response efforts. (U.S. Air National Guard photo by Tech. Sgt. Daniel Robles) Officials with the Alaska National Guard said they are preparing and training a response force of 100 service members to deploy to Washington D.C. and support civil authorities, as directed by the Pentagon and Gov. Mike Dunleavy. 
The update on Tuesday from Maj. Gen. Torrence Saxe, Adjutant General of the Alaska National Guard and Commissioner of the Alaska Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, was in response to a letter from state legislators on the Alaska Joint Armed Services Committee. The lawmakers raised concerns around the implications of a Pentagon’s directive to Alaska to prepare 350 National Guard personnel for rapid deployment for “civil disturbance operations.”
In his letter, Saxe said Gov. Mike Dunleavy requested that the force be deployed to Washington D.C. to join a joint federal task force in March of 2026. 
A spokesperson with the governor’s office confirmed Thursday the request came from the U.S. Secretary of the Army and Dunleavy approved it. 
“Governor Dunleavy approved the request because he wants to help the Trump Administration restore public trust and improve the quality of life in the nation’s capital,” said Jeff Turner, the governor’s director of communications, by email. 
But the request may turn out to be moot, after a federal judge temporarily blocked the deployments to Washington D.C. on Thursday, declaring the use of troops is likely unlawful. There is a pause on the order until Dec. 11, which gives the Trump administration time to appeal.
Turner declined to comment on the federal ruling. 
Saxe said in the letter that 100 Alaska service members are being trained to align with “national level requirements.” 
“The team will consist of Alaska Army and Air National Guard personnel trained in mission sets that may include site security, roadblocks and checkpoints, civil disturbance control, critical infrastructure protection, and personnel security,” Saxe wrote. “All training activities are integrated into existing unit schedules and do not alter the organization’s operational commitments.”
The Alaska National Guard is currently active in the disaster relief effort after Typhoon Halong devastated communities of Western Alaska, with an estimated 200 service members deployed there, officials said.

Saxe repeated that the development of this “quick response force” is not new for the National Guard, and it will be  structured to “respond quickly to protect lives, property, and critical infrastructure.” 
“At the request of Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy, members of the Alaska NGRF (National Guard Response Force) will activate to Washington, D.C., in March 2026 to support Joint Task Force–District of Columbia, a federally coordinated effort that brings together National Guard elements, civic leaders, and partner agencies to enhance safety, stewardship, and community engagement,” he wrote.  
Officials with the National Guard declined interview requests on Wednesday and Thursday. 
In August, officials with the governor’s office said there were “no plans” to deploy the Alaska National Guard to Washington D.C., as reported by the Anchorage Daily News. 
The Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard troops to primarily Democratic-led cities has been challenged and repeatedly blocked as illegal in federal courts. On Monday, a Tennessee judge barred the National Guard deployment to Memphis, and said it was only allowable if there was a rebellion or invasion. On Thursday, a federal judge temporarily ordered an end to the monthslong deployment of National Guard to Washington D.C. to tackle crime, declaring the use of troops as likely unlawful. 
Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage and co-chair of the Alaska Joint Armed Services Committee, said he was grateful for the commissioner’s response and additional information on the specialized force, but remains concerned about the capacity and purpose of such a mission.

“It’s important to note that the American taxpayer will be paying their salary while they’re on this mission. They’ll be paying for their room and board,” he said. “So when the National Guard does a mission like this, we just don’t have unlimited money. So we are redirecting money away from training and work here in Alaska.”
Gray said while the Trump administration may have the authority to call the National Guard to Washington, a federal district, he remains concerned at military service members being deployed against civilians and used for police or immigration enforcement.
“Are these police departments saying that they’re overrun, that they’re unable to perform their law enforcement mission, that they need to have their force doubled, tripled, quadrupled in numbers?” he said. “Because that’s what’s happening.”
There are currently 2,866 National Guard service members enlisted in the state, with 1,676 in the Alaska Air National Guard and 1,190 in the Alaska Army National Guard.
Gray, a veteran of the Alaska National Guard who deployed to Kosovo in 2019, said he also worries about the erosion of trust and regard for the military doing these kinds of missions, and deploying against civilians. 
“I love the U.S. military. I am proud of my service in the Alaska Army National Guard,” he said. “I think this is going to hurt the military’s standing in the public’s mind. I think that this is going to cause folks to lose some of the admiration that has been so foundational in our country for the military. Our country has long admired, respected and praised its military, and the moves that we are seeing, directed by Secretary Pete Hegseth and the President of the United States are going to lose our military’s standing, not only internationally, but domestically as well.” 
Gray said he has requested a meeting with Saxe, and is asking for continued public communication and transparency as the quick response force is developed.

Lack of space, resources is limiting enrollment",Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/20/ct-department-of-correction-higher-education-pell-grants/,"About 320 incarcerated people were enrolled in higher education as of Oct. 2024. That's a fraction of the estimated 3,000 people eligible.","Thousands of incarcerated people in Connecticut want to enroll in higher education — and financial aid is available — but limited space and resources in the state’s prison system have prevented the programs from expanding to meet the demand. 
About 320 incarcerated people were enrolled in higher education programs as of October 2024. That’s a fraction of the estimated 3,000 people who are eligible. 
State leaders, correction officials and educators say a shortage of classrooms and a lack of internet access are key barriers.
“With the classroom space we are currently allotted, we are really only able to admit maybe 12 to 15 students per year out of hundreds who express interest annually,” Zelda Roland, founding director of the Yale Prison Education Initiative, said during a meeting of the Criminal Justice Policy Advisory Committee last month. The Yale initiative offers college courses at MacDougall-Walker Correctional Institution in Suffield, and is one of several programs run by Connecticut colleges and universities in the state’s prison system. 
Funding to expand the programs is available — in the form of individual tuition stipends, known as Pell Grants — but without the space and equipment to field a larger number of students, the programs can’t grow. The maximum Pell Grant amount for 2025-26 is about $7,400 per student.
“The scale of this unmet need is astounding,” said Daniel Karpowitz, undersecretary of criminal justice policy and planning at the state’s Office of Policy and Management, during the meeting last month. 
“If we measure it simply in the failure to draw down the millions of dollars that the federal government is offering us and our higher ed partners to do this, it’s staggering,” Karpowitz said.
In March, the Office of Policy and Management released a report underscoring the changes needed in the state prison system in order for more people to access post-secondary studies while incarcerated. Some of the biggest barriers included a lack of designated space and availability of technology and internet access, as well as the need for increased administrative and academic support for students and a clear pathway to graduation if they are released from prison before they finish their degrees. 
Roland said students in the Yale Prison Education Initiative don’t have internet access — nor do their professors. And all the teaching material that comes into the facility has to be approved by Department of Correction officials. 
That creates extra barriers for students doing something as routine as writing a research paper, Roland said. “It is an extremely onerous and lengthy process to be able to access that research that on campus takes a student a matter of seconds to locate and have access to.”
Teresa Foley, who oversees CT State Community College programs for incarcerated students, said many students don’t have access to laptop computers. Even if those computers aren’t connected to the internet, she said, they still offer opportunities to learn how to use word processing and presentation software like Microsoft Word and PowerPoint — skills that will be necessary once students have returned to their regular lives.
“When they get out, they have this great digital divide to try to cross, to try to readapt to society where technology has just advanced and they haven’t had the opportunity to participate in that,” Foley said. 
Pell opportunity
It’s only recently that Pell Grant aid once again became widely available to eligible students in Connecticut prisons. 
In 1994, the U.S. Congress barred incarcerated people from receiving Pell Grant funding, and the availability of post-secondary education for incarcerated people across the country declined.
In the first decade of the 2000s, several Connecticut schools began teaching college courses in correctional institutions. Wesleyan University started offering classes at Cheshire Correctional Institution through its Center for Prison Education, later expanding to York Correctional Institution. Trinity College and Quinnipiac University also began offering classes at different facilities.
In 2015, the Obama administration created the Second Chance Pell Program, a pilot that gave colleges the opportunity to apply to use Pell funding toward higher education in prison. Four of Connecticut’s community colleges were approved and began offering courses to incarcerated men and women. Wesleyan and Yale also received funding. 
In 2016, Yale University formed the Yale Prison Education Initiative and began offering classes at MacDougall-Walker.  
And in 2020, the Trump administration restored Pell eligibility to all incarcerated people, beginning in the year 2023.

The various universities and colleges now offer a variety of degree programs within the state’s Department of Correction. They often share classrooms that are used for USD #1, the school district housed within the department. 
OPM’s Karpowitz called the Pell Grant change as the “largest federal intervention into the condition of confinement in American prisons in our lifetime.” 
It’s not the only source of funding aimed at expanding higher education in Connecticut prisons.
In recent years, the state Department of Correction received $3 million in coronavirus relief funds to expand high-speed broadband access in an effort to improve higher education in the facilities. Andrius Banevicius, spokesperson for the department, said the funding was slated for updates to telecommunication infrastructure at Brooklyn, MacDougall-Walker, Osborn, Carl Robinson and York correctional institutions. 
Banevicius said that since the vast majority of incarcerated men and women return to their communities after serving their sentence, “it is in everybody’s best interest to give these individuals as many opportunities as possible to enhance the likelihood of successful reentry.”
He said studies have shown that education during incarceration reduces the risk that someone will end up back in prison. Even for individuals who don’t return to their communities, Banevicius said opportunities for learning “promote a sense of accomplishment, self-worth and prosocial behavior, in turn, creating a safer prison environment for all.”
Foley, of CT State, said professors learn to adapt creatively to the restrictions — and some actually enjoy teaching in the program more than they do on campus. “ [The students] are engaged with the materials in a very active manner, so that they’re always coming to class with all kinds of questions and examples and just exploring topics that the instructors are not necessarily getting from students on campus,” Foley said. 
Leaders of prison higher education programs say their graduates have gone on to start businesses and work at organizations that help people who are incarcerated. And Karpowitz said that when people who are incarcerated begin studying for a college degree, the high school graduation rates in their families also increase. 
“This is an intergenerational priority. And we are missing the boat, currently,” Karpowitz said.
‘A one-room schoolhouse’
While the programs provide opportunities, they remain frustratingly limited. 
Tess Wheelwright, director of Wesleyan’s Center for Prison Education, said her program rotates between two classrooms at Cheshire — where they offer seven classes per semester to between 50 and 60 students — and one classroom at York, where they offer four classes to 20-30 students. 
“ Imagine a one-room schoolhouse that is sometimes being used for other programs,” Wheelwright said. 
Professors have access to whiteboards and a projector they can use to show PowerPoint presentations. Everything has to be approved by the Department of Correction before it can be shown in class. This, plus the lack of internet, makes it hard to present anything spontaneously, Wheelwright said. 
“ Faculty in 2025 are so accustomed to googling a TED talk or pulling down a video of the geological phenomenon they’re trying teaching about, and that’s not possible there,” she said.
And classes are only one component of what it means to be a college student. Wheelwright said Wesleyan’s program brings in writing tutors to the prison during study hall. But she said that connecting students with student services like peer tutoring, the writing center and office hours has been difficult. 
If the prisons had internet access, she said, “I think the first thing we would use it for [are] some of these appointments with campus offices there to support student success.”
Roland, at Yale, also said she’d like to have laptops available so incarcerated students can attend office hours with professors on Zoom or Microsoft Teams. 
Karpowitz said the state is looking at how to integrate internet into correctional facilities and has already identified 1 million square feet across those campuses for the installation of high-speed broadband. 
The Institute for Municipal and Regional Policy at the University of Connecticut has also developed a series of modules designed to teach people who are incarcerated or formerly incarcerated how to use the internet for things like telehealth, applying for jobs and education. The institute is also looking to partner with libraries to improve services for people who are incarcerated and on community supervision.
Wheelwright and Roland both said Pell Grants wouldn’t fully cover the cost of their programs, including laptops, paying faculty and additional student services. The colleges make up the difference using private grants and donations. 
There are other challenges to the success of the programs. Within DOC, it’s fairly common for incarcerated people to be moved from one facility to another. For someone participating in a higher education program, a transfer can effectively halt their educational progress.
Roland and Wheelwright said facility lockdowns — which are also fairly common — impede professors’ abilities to finish all of their course material and it reduces study time for students.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/HIGHERED-INDOC-1114-02-1024x607.jpg,,,2025-11-20 21:57:07.926803

(Julie O'Donoghue/Louisiana Illuminator)Starting next year, hundreds of Louisiana officials will be able to sue private citizens, businesses and government entities for not removing their basic biographical information from the internet. 
Gov. Jeff Landry and state lawmakers approved a new law earlier this year allowing a wide swath of public officials to bring lawsuits against those who don’t take down online posts with officials’ personal-identifying information when they request it. 
Anyone who doesn’t take the information off social media or websites could also face criminal penalties under the new law, including up to 90 days in prison and a fine of up to $1,000 per violation. 
States across the country have approved similar laws in recent years after a handful of high-profile attacks on judges and other politicians. By shielding their personal information from the public, government officials hope to reduce their risk to political violence. 
But Louisiana’s version is more sweeping than almost all other states’ laws. It will entitle a wider range of elected officials to sue over internet posts for more reasons, according to a review of dozens of states’ privacy laws. 
Government transparency advocates said Louisiana’s law will infringe on citizens’ First Amendment rights and lead to frivolous lawsuits. Attorney Scott Sternberg described the new law as “wildly unconstitutional” in a memo he wrote on behalf of the Louisiana Press Association earlier this year. 
“Effectively, the Louisiana Legislature has decided to criminalize the publication of a church birthday calendar, the mortgage documents required by federal law, birth announcements, engagement party RSVP websites and traffic tickets,” he wrote.
“This law will undoubtedly lead to more litigation, higher costs for public and private entities, and a chilling effect on speech,” Sternberg said. 

New limits on social media, news articles, political commentary
In Louisiana, the ability to bring a lawsuit or criminal charges over internet posts is already in effect for active and retired judges and family members who live with them. Starting in February, it will be available to many more government officials and their relatives. 
At that point, it will extend to current statewide elected officials, state legislators and public service commissioners, current or retired district attorneys, current or retired assistant district attorneys, and current or retired district attorney investigators. Spouses, children and other dependents who live with these officials will also be covered. 

Among items that officials and their relatives can demand come down off the internet are their home addresses, telephone numbers, personal email addresses, marital records, birth dates, schools and daycares of their children, places of worship and employment locations of spouses, children and dependents. 
Governments will have 15 days after receiving a request from one of these officials to take their personal information off the internet or provide a reason why they can’t.

Individuals and private businesses will have 72 hours to remove the protected information before they become vulnerable to a lawsuit or criminal charges. 
This new restriction will apply to any type of internet post, including news stories, the state’s political campaign contributor database, private websites and social media posts from constituents. 
The breadth of Louisiana’s law is what sets it apart from 38 other states with similar statutes, which were identified by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. In other states, the provisions apply to far fewer people, often only judges, prosecutors and law enforcement. 

The scope of what can be taken off the internet is also narrower in other states. It sometimes includes just home addresses, telephone numbers and email accounts, and it almost never applies to someone’s place of worship. 
Texas, for example, enacted a law in September that allows judges and their families to sue over internet posts with personal information, but its doesn’t apply to other types of elected officials. It also doesn’t apply to content that involves “reporting, news gathering, speaking, or engaging in other activities intended to inform the public on matters of public interest or public concern.” 
Judges fear violence 
Judges have been pushing states to adopt these new security measures for themselves in response to violent attacks on the judiciary. 
They started pursuing the state laws after U.S. District Court Judge Esther Sales’ son was murdered at her home in New Jersey in 2020. The man who ambushed her family had appeared before her in court. 
The assault on Salas’ home led to a new federal law that allows federal judges and their families to demand the removal of internet posts with their personal information, but the federal statute is less restrictive than the Louisiana version. 

Unlike Louisiana, the federal law does not permit judges to require the removal of such information from news stories, political commentary and “other speech on a matter of public concern.” Federal judges also don’t have a right to sue private citizens or businesses for damages under the federal law. 

Louisiana judges have experienced threats of violence that made the state law necessary, said Judge Tiffany Chase, who serves on the state’s 4th Circuit Court of Appeal, during a legislative hearing in 2024. 
Orleans Parish Criminal Court Judge Kimya Holmes was stalked by a family member of one of the teenagers she sent to prison for the killing of 73 year-old Linda Frickey during a botched 2022 carjacking. Chase also had a person who appeared before her in court show up at her house, she said. 

“We are in a more precarious situation,” Chase said last year. 
Louisiana drafted its law to look like a Maryland judicial security statute, which passed after a district court judge there was murdered in his driveway. 
Yet the Maryland law is not as sweeping as Louisiana’s. It does not allow for lawsuits or criminal charges to be brought over personal information included in a news story, political commentary or “any other speech on matters of public concern,” as the Louisiana law does.  
The Maryland law also applies solely to judges and hasn’t been expanded to allow other elected officials to bring lawsuits. 
State lawmakers worry about violence too 
Judges aren’t the only ones fearing for their personal safety. 

California and Florida passed laws limiting access to elected officials’ home addresses after Minnesota House Democratic Caucus leader Melissa Hortmann and her husband were murdered in a political attack carried out at their home. The same gunman also shot and injured  Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife. 

In California, state lawmakers closed off access to elected officials’ home addresses included on their voter registration forms, which used to be given out on a limited basis to journalists. 
In Florida, legislators approved a new law restricting access to elected officials’ addresses on publicly-available government documents to just their home city and ZIP code.
But Louisiana legislators passed their law a few days before the Minnesota ambushes took place, and its protections go well beyond what California and Florida have done. 

Neither California nor Florida allow elected officials to sue private citizens or businesses for posting their home address – or other personal information – on the internet. Free speech advocates have said that is likely because such a law impinges on people’s constitutional rights. 

“This kind of behavior isn’t going to hold up to constitutional scrutiny,” said David Cuillier, director of the Freedom of Information Project at the University of Florida. 

California used to have a similar law in place prohibiting people from posting state lawmakers’ telephone numbers and home addresses on the internet if the lawmakers’ feared for their safety. It was repealed in 2017 after a federal judge ruled the statute unconstitutional.
At the time, gun rights activists had posted online the home addresses and telephone numbers of 40 California state lawmakers who voted for a law that required the state to collect personal information about gun buyers. When lawmakers received threats and the state demanded that activists remove the posts, the activists sued California in federal court and won. 
In Louisiana, free speech advocates weren’t given the chance to raise concerns about the expansion of the law that allows elected officials to sue over internet content. 
The legislation, sponsored by state Rep. Marcus Bryant, D-New Iberia, initially only expanded the right for lawsuits from judges to district attorneys, their staff and their retirees. Lawmakers changed it to apply to other elected officials – such as the governor, attorney general and themselves – very late in the legislative process after public hearings and the opportunity to provide testimony on the bill had closed. 
Louisiana lawmakers also didn’t debate the amendment to expand the protections to themselves and other elected officials before voting. With no discussion, they approved the bill unanimously in both chambers.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200623_085452-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-20 20:58:26.787583

Updated policy seen by the service as way to strengthen reporting, investigation and prosecution.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Coast Guard is poised to change some of its language and policies surrounding the display of hate symbols like swastikas and nooses as well as how personnel report hate incidents.
The service stressed, however, that the symbols will remain prohibited. The updated policy is seen by the Coast Guard as a way to strengthen its ability to report, investigate and prosecute violators.
“Any display, use or promotion of such symbols, as always, will be thoroughly investigated and severely punished,” Admiral Kevin Lunday, acting commandant of the Coast Guard, said in a statement.
A Coast Guard message in 2020 from then-Commandant Karl Schultz said symbols like swastikas and nooses were “widely identified with oppression or hatred” and called their display “a potential hate incident.” The Coast Guard policy dated this month calls those same symbols “potentially divisive,” adversely affecting morale, discipline, unit cohesion and mission effectiveness.
The new policy maintains a yearslong prohibition on publicly displaying the Confederate flag outside of a handful of situations, such as educational or historical settings. However, it does not outright ban the symbols, saying the policy does not apply to private spaces outside of public view, such as family housing.
The new Coast Guard policy, which is set to take effect on Dec. 15 and was first reported by The Washington Post, is facing pushback.
Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada said that “this updated policy rolls back important protections against bigotry and could allow for horrifically hateful symbols like swastikas and nooses to be inexplicably permitted to be displayed.”
“At a time when antisemitism is rising in the United States and around the world, relaxing policies aimed at fighting hate crimes not only sends the wrong message to the men and women of our Coast Guard, but it puts their safety at risk,” she added.
Lunday said the policy does not roll back any prohibitions, calling it “categorically false” to claim otherwise.
“These symbols have been and remain prohibited in the Coast Guard per policy,” Lunday said in a statement, adding that “any display, use or promotion of such symbols, as always, will be thoroughly investigated and severely punished.”
Lunday’s predecessor, Admiral Linda Fagan, was fired on President Donald Trump’s first day in office. Trump officials later said she fired in part for putting an “excessive focus” on diversity and inclusion efforts that diverted “resources and attention from operational imperatives.”
The new policy explicitly says that “the terminology ‘hate incident’ is no longer present in policy” and conduct that would have previously been handled as a potential hate incident will now be treated as “a report of harassment in cases with an identified aggrieved individual.”
Commanders, in consultation with lawyers, may order or direct the removal of “potentially divisive” symbols or flags if they are found to be affecting the unit’s morale or discipline, according to the policy.
The Coast Guard is under the Department of Homeland Security, but it is still considered a part of America’s armed forces and the new policy was updated in part to be consistent with similar Pentagon directives, according to a Coast Guard message announcing the changes.
It also has historically modeled many of its human resources policies on other military services.
The policy change comes less than two months after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered a review of all the hazing, bullying and harassment definitions across the military, arguing that the policies were “overly broad” and they were “jeopardizing combat readiness, mission accomplishment, and trust in the organization.”
The Pentagon could not offer any details about what the review was specifically looking at, if it could lead to similar changes as seen in the Coast Guard policy or when the review would be complete.
Menachem Rosensaft, a law professor at Cornell University and a Jewish community leader, said in a statement that “the swastika is the ultimate symbol of virulent hate and bigotry, and even a consideration by the Coast Guard to no longer classify it as such would be equivalent to dismissing the Ku Klux Klan’s burning crosses and hoods as merely ‘potentially divisive.’”
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called the move “disgusting, and it’s more encouragement from the Republicans of extremism.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Coast-Guard-cutter.jpg,,,2025-11-20 21:57:07.926803

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)If a slot machine gives skillful players the ability to win every time, is it illegal under Pennsylvania’s Crimes Code and Gaming Law?
That was the question the state Supreme Court set out to answer Thursday in a pair of appeals by the commonwealth’s attorney general’s office and Department of Revenue. 
“This court has been very clear,” Senior Deputy Attorney General Susan Affronti told the justices. “Gambling is the hope of gaining something beyond the amount played, and that’s what creates the dangers associated with gambling.”
The court has said in the past that a single feature, such as the memory game included in leading maker Pace-O-Matic’s Pennsylvania Skill games, can’t change the fundamental nature of a gambling device, Affronti, who argued for the attorney general’s office, added. 
Rather, a game’s maker must show that skill is a predominant aspect of the game, and in Pennsylvania Skill Games, the skill element is difficult, tedious and completely optional. Many players, Affronti claimed, skip it to continue betting in hopes of winning a jackpot.
But how people play the game isn’t a workable way to determine whether it’s illegal, attorney Matthew Haverstick argued. He represented Capital Vending Co., that was charged after a 2019 state police raid on Champion Sports Bar in Highspire, Dauphin County, where it had provided skill games.

Haverstick said both his clients and the commonwealth agree the correct standard, established by the court more than 40 years ago, is whether skill is the predominant factor in whether a player wins or loses. 
And Pace-O-Matic’s games allow players who lose the slot machine-style bet to win back their money plus 5%, Haverstick said. They just have to be good enough at remembering and repeating an increasingly complicated pattern of colors that one attorney involved in the case compared to the 1980s electronic game Simon.
Haverstick also argued Pace-O-Matic’s games fall outside of the definition of slot machines set by the state Gaming Control Board.
“When you look at the regs the Gaming Control Board sets what a slot machine … has to pay out,” he said, noting that the requirement is a return of between 85% and 100%. Pennsylvania Skill games allow players to win back up to 105%. “It can never be a game or slot machine rather, as defined under that statute.” 
The state agencies are challenging lower court rulings that neither the Gaming Law or the Criminal Code apply to skill games. The devices, which look like casino video slot machines, have become fixtures in corner stores, gas stations and social clubs in a billion dollar industry that developed since a Beaver County judge first ruled they’re not illegal in 2014.
The commonwealth never appealed that decision and every court that has examined Pace-O-Matic’s devices, has determined they are legally games of skill, according to the Georgia-based company.
In recent years, however, state lawmakers have undertaken efforts to pass legislation that would regulate and tax the skill game industry or ban the machines completely. Proposals during budget negotiations this year devolved into infighting among state Senate Republicans over the rate. Proposals ranged from Gov. Josh Shapiro’s call for 52%, which is the rate casinos pay, to 16%, favored by Sen. Gene Yaw (R-Lycoming), whose district is home to the company that builds Pennsylvania Skill machines.
Jason Levine, who represents a majority of the state’s 17 casinos in a brief to the Supreme Court, said the skill game question is important to casino owners, who say they lose business because of the devices. But he said it’s a crucially important question for the commonwealth and Pennsylvanians who benefit from the taxes casinos pay on slot machine revenue. 
Under the Gaming Law, in addition to supporting the horse racing industry and the state property tax relief fund, gambling revenue goes toward state government and local governments through economic and community development grants.
“The stakes could not be higher for the commonwealth and casinos as well as the mom and pop shops facing a loss of revenue,” Levine said.  “I think the thing that all of the parties can agree to is that clarity is needed from the Supreme Court.”
The justices on Thursday questioned how often players use the skill element to attempt to recoup their money. Affronti said the machines deliver a win 8% of the time and the rest of the time players have the ability to go on to the skill section, but only if they touch a button marked “follow me.”
“It’s not explained,” Affronti said. “It’s not telling you ‘press this button to use skill.’ … There’s no suggestion that’s a way to win your money back. The only way you discover that is if you, for some reason, touch there and then, and only then is the skill game explained.”
Justice Christine Donohue asked Affronti whether it’s legal to give people the opportunity to gamble.
“They can walk into an establishment and never intend to play ‘follow me.’ Just continue to put money into the machine and pull it and pull it and pull it … with the hope that their gamble will pay off and they will get the jackpot,” Donohue said.
Affronti agreed, adding that is why the court must identify the predominant aspect of the game. 
“What is the game really about?” Affronti asked “This isn’t a game of Whac-a-Mole. This isn’t a game of Skee-Ball. This is a slot machine.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/skill-games-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-20 19:56:49.723632

(Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)With tension ongoing between Utah’s Legislature and judiciary, the Utah Senate confirmed Judge John Nielsen as the state’s newest Supreme Court justice in a party-line vote.
Following this week’s 19-6 vote, Gov. Spencer Cox’s nominee thanked state leaders and his family for entrusting him with the role.
“We live in a contentious time, but it’s my hope to be a voice of reason and respect. I deeply love this state, my lifelong home. I love the law and I love the court, and I will do my utmost to ensure a legacy of trust. I pledge my best efforts and gratefully accept this weighty responsibility,” Nielsen said in his brief remarks.

Nielsen, who described his judicial philosophy as “textualist” and “originalist” at the news conference announcing his nomination, was well received by Republicans who have been quick to accuse judges of “judicial activism” in rulings they disagree with.
Democrats, meanwhile, flagged his role in some of the state’s most heated political lawsuits, including over abortion and transgender student sports participation.
Sen. Stephanie Pitcher, D-Salt Lake City, a member of the Senate Judicial Committee, highlighted Republican lawmakers’ criticism of the judiciary and said she would prefer a candidate who could be a check on the Legislature and an unbiased arbiter.
While Pitcher praised Nielsen’s legal experience, she said his appointment “feels like we are injecting politics into the appointment process, and that is not our role.”
“I find him to be incredibly intelligent, but his background does not inspire much confidence with litigants or the public that we are selecting someone who will be fair, neutral and unbiased,” Pitcher said.

Sen. Brady Brammer, R-Pleasant Grove, pushed back on those criticisms, saying that in the years they have known each other since attending law school together at Brigham Young University and throughout Nielsen’s “stellar legal career,” there have been no claims that Nielsen has done anything improper or that he lacks experience.
The criticism is “not pointing to his impartiality as a judge, which has not been questioned. It’s not going to any of his qualifications. It is solely on the basis of partisanship without regard to whether or not he can be an impartial justice,” Brammer said. “Are we ready to say that ‘because you represented a client that I disfavor, you are no longer allowed to be on the bench?’” 
When Nielsen was nominated, Utah Supreme Court Chief Justice Matthew Durrant praised Nielsen’s selection and his abilities in the courtroom, which he said he has witnessed numerous times in the past 25 years.
“And in those 25 years, I have never seen a better oral and written advocate. His writing has always been impeccable, honest, to the point,” Durrant said.
The governor appointed Nielsen to the 3rd District Court in September 2024 after his work in different private ventures — including a joint firm with former Utah Associate Chief Justice Thomas Lee, Sen. Mike Lee’s brother. Nielsen also worked 11 years as solicitor general in the Utah Attorney General’s Office, and years as an adjunct associate professor at the University of Utah.
He replaces outgoing Associate Chief Justice John Pearce, who is retiring Dec. 1.

(Courtesy The Center for Land Use Interpretation)A coalition of environment and health organizations requested the New Mexico Environment Department take immediate action Thursday toward air monitoring and developing community health guidance following an explosion at an oil refinery in Artesia.
HF Sinclair’s Navajo Refinery, located in southeast New Mexico and the Permian Basin, experienced an explosion and fires on Oct. 31, which injured three and caused thick smoke to waft over the city. 
Members of the Permian Basin Climate Justice Coalition, which represents more than 20 organizations devoted to environment, health and community advocacy, sent a letter Thursday to New Mexico Environment Department Secretary James Kenney asking for the department to take action to protect southeastern New Mexicans. 
They specifically called for the department to install a permanent air monitor in Artesia; provide real-time air-quality data to the public; develop health guidance for the public in cases of industrial emergencies; hold a public meeting in Artesia within a month to let the public know the plans for air safety and monitoring; and establish a mobile air monitoring unit in the Permian Basin.
NMED stated in January 2025 that the department had secured funding for such a mobile unit through a $500,000 settlement between WildEarth Guardians and OXY USA, Inc., an oil and gas producer in the region. 
“Our coalition has documented countless spills, leaks, and releases across the Permian. When something like this [explosion] happens, people deserve truth and transparency,” Melissa Troutman, climate and health advocate for WildEarth Guardians, said in a statement. “Numerous studies now document the health impacts experienced by people living in the oilfields. Air monitoring shouldn’t be optional in communities surrounded by refineries and fracking sites.”
NMED Director of Communications Drew Goretzka told Source in a written statement Thursday that the department has not had a chance to thoroughly review the coalition’s letter yet. 
“Sec. Kenney and the Department are open to all community monitoring actions that can better protect New Mexican’s air quality in the wake of the HF Sinclair Navajo Refinery explosion,” Goretzka wrote.
The coalition pointed out that the NMED operates two air monitors in the Permian Basin in Carlsbad and Hobbs, but these monitors do not track air pollution around Artesia.
“The Artesia refinery has operated for more than a century, making this not a new problem but a long-ignored one,” the coalition’s letter states. “An independent air monitor in this community is beyond long overdue. No parent should have to wonder whether it’s safe for their children to trick-or-treat outside, breathe the evening air, or go to school the next morning.”
Mariel Nanasi, executive director of New Energy Economy, said in a statement that air pollutants are a known cause of asthma, mortality and other ailments, and residents in the Permian Basin “deserve” to be protected from such harms. 
“Action cannot be taken until the state acts to collect data and provide families with real-time information so they can protect themselves, their children and the elderly when ozone precursors, [Volatile Organic Compounds] and particulates rise to dangerous levels,” Nanasi said. “The state cannot continue to depend on the EPA to take action to protect its own residents. They are depending on NMED to take action.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/sinclair-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-11-20 19:56:49.723632

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)An Idaho legislative task force aimed at improving government efficiency and cutting costs on Wednesday moved forward proposals to eliminate or merge six state entities with an estimated savings of just over $300,000 a year. 
Some of the proposals considered at Wednesday’s meeting at the Capitol in Boise either had no estimated savings or staff had not yet been able to analyze how much could be saved. 
The Idaho DOGE Task Force, named for the federal Department of Government Efficiency previously helmed by billionaire Elon Musk, held four additional proposed mergers or eliminations for further consideration.  
The ideas lawmakers advanced were: 

Eliminate the Bingo-Raffle Advisory Board and place its duties under the Lottery Commission.
Merge the Soil and Water Commission with the Department of Water Resources  
Move the STEM Action Center into the Workforce Development Council 
Eliminate the regional committees for the state Infant and Toddler Program Early Intervention Services 
Eliminate the Idaho Honey Commission 
Integrate the animal health duties of the Sheep and Goat Board into the Department of Agriculture 

The task force cannot pass legislation but will bring forward recommendations to the rest of the Legislature when it convenes for the 2026 session, which begins Jan. 12. 
Most of the decisions were unanimously approved by task force members, except for the vote to propose elimination of the Idaho Honey Commission. Sen. Carrie Semmelroth, D-Boise, and Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard, voted no, with Semmelroth noting that the department staff did not consult the Honey Commission before making the recommendation.

Task Force co-chair Sen. Todd Lakey, R-Nampa, said he would vote to move forward the recommendation for consideration, but he thought it was “important that (the Honey Commission) weigh in, and have an opportunity to weigh in, which they will on legislation.” 
The task force held for further review the following proposals: 

Consolidate the Lottery Commission and State Liquor Division 
Merge the Office of Energy and Mineral Resources and Office of Species Conservation 
Eliminate community college Dormitory Housing Commissions 
Integrate the State Brand Board into the Department of Agriculture

 Proposals had varied results for saving state money 

Agency heads brought the proposals to the committee in response to an executive order by Gov. Brad Little issued in August. Some agency staff began looking into the merger or elimination proposals earlier, including Workforce Development Council Executive Director Wendi Secrist. 
Secrist in August 2024 also became director of the STEM Action Center, which is meant to facilitate educational opportunities in science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM. 
She began evaluating the merger last summer, and her proposal indicated that the state general fund would see savings of around $300,000 a year by eliminating two staff positions.

Rep. Josh Tanner, R-Eagle, questioned how the effectiveness of STEM Action Center activities are measured and its $6 million a year total cost. 
“How can you guys as Workforce Development Council actually bring evaluational processes to this, to actually make these where they’re actually worthwhile for the state?” Tanner asked Secrist.
Lakey echoed Tanner’s questions. 
Secrist said staff is in the process of creating new ways to evaluate the effectiveness of the programs that are less focused on outputs, such as how many events were attended or how many students attended them. 
The other proposal with a cost-savings estimate came from Cally Younger, administrator of the Office of Energy and Mineral Resources. 
Younger said the idea to merge the energy office with the species conservation office existed from the time when she worked for former Gov. Butch Otter. 
In doing so, she estimated about four full-time positions could be eliminated with a savings of about $360,000 a year.
“It makes a lot of sense, because our offices serve very similar functions,” Younger said. “We both serve as liaisons to the federal government on our offices’ issues.” 
Scott asked why the species conservation office wouldn’t move to Idaho Fish and Game, and Tanner suggested eliminating the Office of Energy and Mineral Resources and instead having Younger work on those issues as a staff member in the governor’s office. 
Younger responded with concerns to both of those ideas, including that the Fish and Game’s mission was very different in dealing with hunting and fishing regulation rather than protecting endangered species, and that eliminating her office would not result in much savings because it is federally funded. 
Scott made a motion to hold the proposal in committee to consider other avenues. Tanner agreed with the motion, and said he still saw benefits of eliminating the Energy and Mineral Resources office. 
The proposal to integrate the animal health duties of the Sheep and Goat Board into the Department of Agriculture was a “revenue wash,” according to Lloyd Knight, deputy director of the Idaho State Agriculture Department. 
Other proposals mentioned Wednesday did not include cost-saving estimates. 
 Task force will continue looking into other proposals 

The task force plans to continue looking into many of the proposals, including the ones that did not move forward. 
Some of those proposals come with complications. For instance, the merger of the lottery and liquor entities may require constitutional changes, according to Andrew Arulanandam, state director of lottery and liquor. He said while the two programs share a director, they “serve fundamentally different missions.” 
The Dormitory Housing Commissions are a largely obsolete method by which Idaho community colleges may finance on-campus housing and student facilities. However, North Idaho College has a $7.2 million bond for a recreation center owned by its Dormitory Housing Commission, said Jennifer White, executive director of the Idaho State Board of Education. The bond will be active until 2046, she said. 
Co-chair Rep. Jeff Ehlers, R-Meridian, said he hopes to plan one more meeting in December. He told the Sun the members would continue to look at agency staffing and other proposals, as well as other ideas from task force members. 
He said other issues will have to be addressed in future legislative sessions, and on Wednesday said the task force’s work is a “multi-year project.”

The Joint Revenue Committee voted Wednesday to sponsor a bill to eliminate residential property taxes, another to raise sales taxes to replace the resulting revenue loss.
The post Lawmakers advance plan to revamp Wyoming’s tax structure appeared first on WyoFile .","The Wyoming Legislature’s Joint Revenue Committee voted Wednesday to sponsor a pair of bills to eliminate residential property taxes and to raise sales taxes to replace the resulting revenue loss.
The meeting in Cheyenne marked the last of the committee’s off-season work that prioritized property tax reforms and relief for homeowners. The topic has been a focal point for the Legislature since at least 2022. 
Lawmakers have already, in recent years, expanded the state’s refund program, amended the constitution with the support of voters to separate residential property into a separate tax class and capped annual increases. 
The Legislature has also added several property tax exemptions to state law — creating a complicated web in the process — but no enacted measure has been so sweeping as abolishing residential property taxes altogether. 
Meanwhile, raising or creating new taxes has historically been a non-starter for Wyoming’s Republican-dominated statehouse. But lawmakers find themselves in new territory, with some arguing that the state’s tax system needs a thorough overhaul. 
The committee also voted to sponsor several other property tax bills, including one to repeal a sunset date on an exemption for long-term homeowners, another to amend the Wyoming Constitution to allow for an acquisition-value tax system similar to California. 
How we got here 
Casper Republican Sen. Bob Ide proposed abolishing all property taxes during a Revenue Committee meeting in June. 
“We need to shift to a new system,” Ide said at the June meeting, before bringing a motion to draft a bill repealing most of Article 15 of the Wyoming Constitution. 
Sen. Bob Ide (R-Casper) speaks during the Wyoming Legislature’s 2024 budget session. (Ashton Hacke,/WyoFile)
That version, if passed by the Legislature and approved by voters, would have eliminated all property taxes — residential, commercial, industrial and personal — which brought in $2 billion in the 2024 tax year. 
The committee instead approved a narrowed version of that proposal Thursday that would only eliminate residential property taxes. Lawmakers voted 9-1, with four excused, to sponsor the bill. 
Sen. Cale Case, R-Lander, was the sole dissenting vote, while Sens. Stephan Pappas, R-Cheyenne, Dan Dockstader, R-Afton, and Reps. Liz Storer, D-Jackson, and Bob Wharff, R-Evanston, were excused. 
Because the bill amends the Wyoming Constitution, it requires voter approval. Meanwhile, legislation to raise sales taxes would only go into effect if the constitutional amendment passes. 
The state sales tax rate is 4%. The bill would increase it to 6%, which would be in addition to the local county sales taxes. All but one county — Sublette — have an additional 1% to 3% sales, according to Department of Revenue data. 
The bill is estimated to bring in approximately $475 million, which would then be transferred to local governments to fund local services. 
The committee voted 8-4, with two excused, to sponsor the bill. The dissenting votes included Sen. Case and Reps. Jayme Lien, R-Casper; J.R. Riggins, R-Casper; and Clarence Styvar, R-Cheyenne. Storer and Pappas were excused. 
Discussion 
“I think what we’re trying to do here is protect our citizens. That’s all we’re trying to do,” Ide said. “And a sales tax, a consumption tax is probably the best avenue to protect those citizens from what’s going on back in Washington with deficit spending and stimulus and all of those things.”
Ide also said no member of the committee had reported hearing from their constituents, “we wish you wouldn’t have lowered our property taxes.”
The committee, however, heard nearly that very thing when it met in Ide’s district in August, when about two dozen local homeowners urged lawmakers to skip further property tax cuts. 
“Don’t defund and destroy our institutions,” Lisa Jamieson, a Casper homeowner, told the committee in August, echoing others at the meeting. “I think what’s important to people like me is, I would like for our communities to remain nice places to live, and I’m willing to pay taxes to keep that going.”
Recent property tax cuts have had an asymmetrical impact on counties, as a recent WyoFile collaboration detailed. While some haven’t experienced much belt tightening, others are eyeing cuts to various public services, like road maintenance and election administration.

“Listening to all of this, it makes my stomach hurt in the sense that you are cutting off the legs of our communities and pulling the blanket out from under them,” said Beth Blackwell, the city of Newcastle’s grant and loan specialist.
Blackwell previously worked as the grant loan manager for the Office of State Lands and Investments, where she said she saw firsthand how local governments, including special districts, rely on property taxes. Moving to sales taxes — a more volatile revenue source — will make it difficult for local officials to effectively budget, Blackwell said. 
Sen. Case, an economist, reiterated that point. 
“Sales tax, they’re the most erratic of your tax forms. We already have a problem with erratic revenue streams from our minerals,” Case said. 
For others, eliminating property taxes was the type of solution lawmakers have long sought. 
“I frankly see this is the best thing I’ve heard, is doing away with the property tax,” Rep. Wharff said. “Let people actually own their homes and do away with this perpetual tax that we have to pay on our property.”
The slate of bills will now go to the full Legislature for consideration. The 2026 budget session begins Feb. 9.

Davidson County Chancellor Patricia Head Moskal issued a temporary injunction Monday blocking Lee’s deployment of the national guard, agreeing with the plaintiffs that it likely violated the “terms and conditions of Tennessee’s Military Code.” But she told the state that if they appealed her ruling, which they did, she would lift the injunction during the appeal process. 
Moskal formally lifted her injunction on Wednesday.
Lee assigned members of the national guard to patrol the streets of Memphis starting in October as part of a task force created by President Donald Trump a month earlier. 
Tennessee governor to appeal ruling against Guard in Memphis

The Memphis Safe Task Force is made up of hundreds of state and federal law enforcement officers working in conjunction with local law enforcement. This case does not impact its work in Memphis. 
It’s unclear how many national guard personnel are stationed in Memphis. The Memphis police said there are about 200, but recent court filings indicate more than 700 are currently there.
Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris and several other local and state lawmakers filed the lawsuit to block the guard’s deployment, arguing that the Tennessee Constitution only allows it to be used in “circumstances amounting to a rebellion or invasion,” and “even then, the legislature must declare, by law, that the public safety requires it.”
Attorneys representing Lee and the state contend that deploying the national guard falls within the governor’s authority and that the judiciary has no oversight on the executive decision.
Moskal noted in her Monday ruling that Lee never issued an official order, putting out a press release about the deployment after Trump signed a memo creating the task force. The Tennessee legislature also never voted to send Guard personnel to Memphis, as required by law, and Shelby County leaders didn’t request the deployment.

(Courtesy The Conservation Fund)A swath of land within the Tobacco Root Mountains that was privately owned is now part of the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest after nonprofit organization The Conservation Fund facilitated a land sale this fall. 
The 600-acre inholding parcel covered the upper reaches of Dry Boulder Lakes Road including sections of trail that are the gateway to Lower and Upper Boulder Lakes. The area is now fully open and accessible to the public. 
“Connecting Montana’s patchwork of public and private lands is the kind of problem the Land and Water Conservation Fund was created to solve,” Gary Sullivan, Montana state director for The Conservation Fund, said in a statement. 
According to The Conservation Fund, the trail to reach the lakes winds through roughly four miles of alpine forest and granite basins, and provides access to high-elevation lakes with native trout populations as well as late-season hunting opportunities in the rugged backcountry of the Tobacco Roots.  
Prior landowners allowed road access to Boulder Lakes across their property through an informal agreement, and Sullivan said the owners, who preferred to remain unnamed, saw public access and conservation as a priority. 
When the landowners decided to sell the property, The Conservation Fund bought the property in 2024 as the first step to transferring the inholding to the federal government. 
Sullivan said he sees the nonprofit organization as a “bridge financier” for conservation land deals, that has worked on more than 9 million acres of land acquisitions across all 50 states.
A screenshot from Montana Cadastral showing the parcel added to the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest outlined in blue.
The organization partners with government agencies — federal, state, municipal, or county — or occasionally other nonprofits such as land trusts, to provide funding and swift action on real estate transactions. 
“In many cases, like Boulder Lakes, we’re painfully aware of how slowly government moves,” Sullivan told the Daily Montanan, adding that federal funding cycles are often years ahead of property sales. “There’s a lot of ‘Gary, we don’t have the money right now, and Congress can’t appropriate the funds for a few years.’”
“We’re nimble, we’re small, we have real estate expertise, and we can swoop in and do what we do,” Sullivan said. 
In the case of the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest, Sullivan said the landowners were eager to put the land into public hands, but didn’t want to wait for the wheels of federal government to come around on funding and the due diligence process required. 
Sullivan said that when The Conservation Fund steps in to make a conservation purchase like this, the organization makes sure the partner agency, in this case the Forest Service, has the property in their sights as a priority funding project. He said the average hold time for properties before they are sold to the partner agencies is roughly 12-18 months. 
The Boulder Lakes property was purchased by the organization in October, 2024 and sold to the Forest Service in September. 
“There’s always some risk we take on and always the chance of delays in every project, but we make sure we acquire properties by meeting all the due diligence standards required by our partners,” Sullivan said.
He said that another priority is land that’s considered biologically important to the greater ecosystem. 
Many of the parcels The Conservation Fund works with are similar to the Boulder Lakes property — inholdings held by private owners but surrounded by federal, state or locally-managed public land. 
In 2022 The Conservation Fund acquired another nearly 600-acre inholding just a few miles across the Beaverhead-DeerLodge Forest, selling it to the Forest Service in 2024.
Sullivan said the potential impact of private property adjacent to public lands goes far beyond the potential of development. 
“Inholdings have a much greater overall impact to the public land base than the actual acreage,” he said. “Habitat fragmentation is a problem for animals, and it’s in our interest to preserve the ecological integrity of these huge blocks of public land. 
He added that completing blocks of public land can cut down on management costs as well — arguments he uses with congressional staffers when working on securing the funding needed for an agency to purchase land. 
“If we can prevent these from being developed, it saves taxpayer money,” Sullivan said. “If there’s an access road the public is using, but the landowner isn’t spraying for weeds, that can carry noxious weeds into public land. If there’s a wildfire, the Forest Service has to defend the private property. There’s real tangible benefits to trying to acquire these properties, and that includes real cost-saving measures.”
The Forest Service acquisition of the property was done with funds allocated by the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which was permanently funded in 2020 by the Great American Outdoors Act, a bill championed by Montana’s senior U.S. Sen. Steve Daines. 
“As a lifelong sportsman, protecting and promoting access to Montana’s beautiful public lands has always been one of my top priorities,” Daines said in a statement. “I was proud to pass the Great American Outdoors Act in 2020 which permanently reauthorized the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and I’m thrilled to see that access to the Boulder Lakes will be provided.  I commend the Conservation Fund for their work on this project, so that Montana’s great outdoors are accessible for all to enjoy.”
Earlier this month, the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest announced it had acquired another 396-acre on the northwest side of the Tobacco Roots along Point of Rocks Road. 
That acquisition was facilitated by the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation and also utilized LWCF funds. 
Sullivan applauded the work of the congressional delegation in supporting the project and making sure LWCF funds were made available. 
“Montanans love our public lands, and The Conservation Fund recognizes that we all have a role to play in protecting them for future generations,” he added.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/View-from-Boulder-Lakes-Property-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-20 18:57:55.396017

Larry Rhoden pushed back Thursday on a lawmaker’s suggestion that the agricultural industry should be more tightly regulated to improve water quality.
“Rest assured,” Rhoden told town hall attendees, “he’s going to be set straight on a few of his issues in a very kind, civil way. But I will have conversations.”
Senate President Pro Tempore Chris Karr, R-Sioux Falls, said during a legislative committee meeting Wednesday that it might be time to “get serious” about new regulations on agriculture to address the state’s polluted rivers and lakes.
With so much polluted water, SD lawmaker says state can no longer ‘dance around’ ag regulations

“And that’s pretty scary for folks, especially for those that are in the community that starts with the letter ‘A’ and ends with ‘G,’” Karr said during the meeting. “We can sit here and talk about it, and dance around it all day. I think you can have some incentives, but we’re going to have to look at some restrictions as well, and regulate.”
Karr’s comments came after Legislative Research Council staff shared a report that over three-quarters of monitored river and stream miles in the state fail to fully support at least one of their intended uses — such as swimming, fishing or boating — with similar problems in many lakes.
Rhoden, a rancher, said during his Thursday town hall at the Canopy by Hilton hotel in Sioux Falls that Karr’s comments were “misinformation,” saying they were “made out of ignorance.” He added that “nobody on the planet has a bigger, more vested interest in protecting our environment and natural resources” than farmers and ranchers.
Rhoden told the media after the event that making a “carte blanche statement that we need more regulations is unhelpful, to say the least.”
Lawmakers agree water quality is an issue in Iowa

In an interview later Thursday with South Dakota Searchlight, Karr said Rhoden reached out to him to talk about the comments. Karr said he hopes the discussion and the controversy around his comments will lead to a larger conversation surrounding South Dakota’s surface water quality.
He added that he “didn’t mean to pick on ag in particular,” but that the state will “have to look at restrictions and runoff” in rural and urban settings to improve surface water quality. The agricultural community has already risen up in defense, Karr said, as he predicted in his Wednesday comments.
“There’s been a pretty strong reaction,” Karr said, “but I’m hoping it’ll bring folks to the table to say that 75% failure in our rivers and streams is something we can’t live with.”
South Dakota has “proactive” programs in place to address water quality in the state, Rhoden said, including grants to reduce livestock waste runoff into waterways. Karr said he’s been speaking with water districts for years to learn about the state’s surface water quality problems, and he played a role in the $3 million infusion into a Big Sioux River grant program with 2021 legislation.
A recent final report on that program said it resulted in 67 buffer projects spanning 83 linear miles under 10-year contracts. The buffers prevent an estimated 1,500 pounds of phosphorus, 6,500 pounds of nitrogen and 1,000 tons of sediment from entering the Big Sioux River watershed each year.
Rep. Drew Peterson, R-Salem, a farmer, told South Dakota Searchlight that farmers and ranchers in his district are “highly regulated,” conservation-minded and “pay taxes to the watershed districts to improve water quality.”

“For someone to imply we are lax, unregulated and don’t care — that’s not fair to every producer and ag taxpayer working hard on this issue, and simply not true,” Peterson said.
Glenn Muller, executive director of the South Dakota Pork Producers Council, brought up the issue at the town hall, asking for Rhoden’s response.
Muller told South Dakota Searchlight that he would prefer the state further study the issue, to identify how different sectors of agriculture and other industries affect water quality. That would help create more targeted solutions, he said.
In response to Karr’s comments, Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen said that “top-down mandates” can be more expensive without being more effective.
“You can go too far the other way,” Venhuizen said, “and create a lot of new burdens that don’t really get you much in terms of value.”

Johnston and Girod say they're receptive to changes in faculty workload and post-tenure review procedures at the state's six public universities. (Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Board of Regents is preparing to vote on faculty tenure policy recommendations that set academic workload expectations and require rigorous post-tenure reviews of professors at the state’s six public universities.
The initiative would establish common points of reference in evaluating the work of hundreds of tenured faculty at the University of Kansas, Kansas State University, Wichita State University, Emporia State University, Fort Hays State University and Pittsburg State University. The policy package would require one-year remediation programs for faculty falling short of expectations. It would set the stage for dismissal of people with substandard evaluations in back-to-back years.
Under the draft plan circulated to Board of Regents members and university personnel, administration leaders on each campus would retain jurisdiction over details of evaluations of tenured faculty and the provisions of self-improvement programs for anyone with recognized deficiencies. The core obligations of state university faculty would continue to revolve around teaching, research and service, but instruction of students would be the biggest factor in assessments.
“We’re looking for sort of an umbrella policy that stills shows accountability, but obviously is flexible enough that the institutions will be able to utilize it,” said Board of Regents member Alysia Johnston, who has more than 35 years of experience in community college education.
She said Wednesday during a Board of Regents meeting in Hays the new approach would answer questions about whether tenured faculty continued to find success at a level commensurate with someone of their academic rank.
The workload policy would link faculty performance evaluations to tenure status.
“This seems like a really good potential product,” said Kathy Wolfe Moore, appointed to the Board of Regents last year by Gov. Laura Kelly after serving a dozen years in the Kansas House.
Rusty Monhollon, vice president of academic affairs for the Board of Regents, said overhauling post-tenure and workload systems would make it easier for the public universities to identify on an annual basis the faculty who excelled. It would provide administrators a roadmap for addressing faculty not adhering to high expectations, he said.
Monhollon said campus evaluations of tenured faculty would “become less subjective” through reliance on tangible evidence related to teaching, research and service.
He said policy changes were intended to reinforce the values of faculty tenure, support student academic success and enhance accountability at taxpayer-supported universities. The changes weren’t designed to thwart faculty development or scholarly innovation, he said.
In addition, he said, the framework resulted from collaboration with university administrators and faculty, and drew from established practices found elsewhere in U.S. higher education.
Policy recommendations would direct state universities to produce annual reports on the process of awarding tenure, including data on awards, denials and departures among faculty. It wouldn’t alter current policy limiting tenure-track faculty probationary periods to seven years. Tenure also would continue to be awarded based on meritorious performance rather than longevity of service.
In terms of post-tenure review, each faculty member would operate with work plans adjusted annually to outline expectations. Committee of at least five people would conduct full-scale reviews of each tenured faculty member every five years.
Tenured professors receiving an unsatisfactory evaluation would be required to take part in a one-year improvement plan. A second year with an unsatisfactory rating “may lead to dismissal or reassignment,” the policy proposal said.
Each university would provide an annual report to the Board of Regents on the number of tenured faculty assessed and improvement plans initiated. It would document the number of faculty departures or dismissals.
Under proposed changes to workload policy applicable to tenured professors, each would be assigned a teaching load. Exceptions could be granted to faculty holding extension, clinical or research positions that didn’t include instructional responsibilities. Otherwise, the three large doctoral universities in Kansas would set teaching loads ranging from 40% to 55% of a faculty member’s work schedule. The three regional universities would set teaching loads ranging from 60% to 75%.
Research expectations for tenured professors would be specific to each discipline, with consideration given to involvement in development of grants, publications, graduate supervision and dissemination of scholarship. Work linked to service duties must coincide with “institutional goals,” and could include administrative responsibilities.
Biennial reports prepared by the six universities would document faculty metrics on credit hour production, graduation rates, publications and research funding.
The Board of Regents could take a preliminary vote on post-tenure and workload policies in December. If advanced, the final vote would likely be in January.
KU chancellor Doug Girod said if the Board of Regents implemented post-tenure and workforce reforms it would constitute “one of the most robust processes in the country.”
“Most of what you’re seeing in state legislatures around the country are trying to accomplish where we are today,” Girod said.
Richard Linton, president of K-State, said the university’s faculty senate would provide feedback on the plan.
“From a 50,000-foot viewpoint,” Linton said, “I think it’s headed in a very good direction.”

,DC,2025-11-20 23:42:07+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,The Trump administration wants everyone to reapply for food stamps. What does that mean?,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-wants-everyone-reapply-food-stamps-what-does-mean,,"U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins’ call for a close reexamination of the 42 million people who receive federal food aid has befuddled advocates and lawmakers, coming mere days after recipients began to see benefits that had been stalled during the government shutdown.Details remain scant a week after Rollins during an interview on the right-wing Newsmax network first publicly broached the startling idea that every beneficiary would have to reapply for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, often called food stamps.The U.S. Department of Agriculture, asked for an explanation, referenced existing requirements and suggested more changes in SNAP rules could be in store.“Secretary Rollins wants to ensure the fraud, waste, and incessant abuse of SNAP ends,” a USDA spokesperson wrote Wednesday. “Rates of fraud were only previously assumed, and President Trump is doing something about it. Using standard recertification processes for households is a part of that work. As well as ongoing analysis of state data, further regulatory work, and improved collaboration with states.”The 2008 law governing SNAP leaves states responsible for administration. Part of that role includes periodically making sure that the low-income people in the program meet the qualifications for inclusion, but the law allows states to determine how often that occurs.“It's not clear what she would be proposing that is different from what is already happening,” said Katie Bergh, a senior policy analyst for food assistance at the left-leaning think tank Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.One interpretation of Rollins’ comments is that she would remove all 42 million individuals from SNAP’s rolls and ask them to resubmit applications. Bergh said that would lead to people losing money they need for groceries. About 40% of those enrolled in SNAP are children.“If she's suggesting that they're going to somehow redo that process for more than 40 million people who already demonstrated their eligibility and who already have to periodically recertify their eligibility, that would be pretty duplicative and would likely create pretty significant paperwork backlogs that would cause people who are eligible to lose the food assistance that they need,” Bergh said.Administration critics have suggested that, while the comments are unlikely to lead to policy changes, they introduce even more confusion for a program that was used as a political token during the record government shutdown that ended this month. Making people reapply would underscore the Trump administration’s opposition to the nearly $100 billion program, which accounts for 70% of federal nutrition assistance. USDA says the average SNAP household in fiscal 2023 received a monthly benefit of $332, or $177 a person based on the average SNAP household size of 1.9 people.“Secretary Rollins and the Trump administration have cut food assistance for 42 million Americans multiple times this year,” U.S. House Agriculture ranking member Angie Craig said in a Wednesday statement to States Newsroom. “Now, they've once again shown that they do not understand the program.”What did Rollins say?In the Nov. 13 interview on Newsmax, Rollins said SNAP was beset by widespread fraud, citing data that 29 mostly Republican-run states submitted to the department. Acquiring data from the 21 other states would give the department a way to wholly remake the program, she said.“Can you imagine when we get our hands on the blue state data, what we're going to find?” she said. “It's going to give us a platform and a trajectory to fundamentally rebuild this program, have everyone reapply for their benefit, make sure that everyone that's taking a taxpayer-funded benefit through SNAP or food stamps that they literally are vulnerable, and they can't survive without it. And that's the next step here.”In an interview Monday on Fox News, host Maria Bartiromo asked Rollins about the move to have recipients “reapply.”“Business as usual is over,” Rollins answered in part. “The status quo is no more. We know that the SNAP program is rife with fraud.”She added that guarding against fraud would help those the program is meant to serve.The comments touched off widespread confusion about what specifically Rollins meant. Asked about the initiative during a Thursday press conference, Craig, a Minnesota Democrat, said she was unclear about how it would work and predicted that Rollins would take credit in the future for the existing low rate of fraud.""We're hearing off the record that, you know, maybe people don't know what the hell they're talking about,” she said. “In fact, I think they're trying to take credit for the already very strict standards and the actual low fraud rate in the SNAP program ... So we can find no real plan there. Not even sure there's concepts of a plan there.”In response to a States Newsroom request this week for details about the initiative, USDA provided the statement that did not answer how the department would proceed or under what authority, but said Rollins was seeking to reduce fraud in the program.Spokespeople did not respond to follow-up questions, or a request to respond to Craig’s remarks Thursday.Low fraud rateProgram experts say fraud is not a widespread problem for SNAP.An April report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service found that retailers illegally trafficked about 1.6% of SNAP benefits from fiscal 2015 to 2017.Fraud by households applying for SNAP, which appear to be the main target of Rollins’ proposal, is even lower. According to a USDA report, about 26,000 applications were referred for an administrative review or prosecution on suspicion of fraud. That number accounts for about 0.1% of the 22.7 million households enrolled in the program, according to the Pew Research Center.“Long-standing data sources indicate that intentional fraud by participants is rare,” Bergh said.At Thursday's press conference, Craig called Rollins’ comments “bullsh*t” and “propaganda.”“Secretary Rollins goes on TV and talks about all the fraud,” she said. “This most effective anti-hunger program in our history has a fraud rate of 1.6%. It's actually one of the most effective, well-run programs in the country … The bullsh*t this administration is peddling is egregious.”More targeted reformsEven experts who advocate for reforms to SNAP say eligibility fraud is not a major issue.Romina Boccia, director of budget and entitlement policy at the libertarian Cato Institute, said high-net-worth individuals can receive SNAP benefits, but aren’t committing fraud by doing so.“Some of the issues with SNAP … aren't because of fraud or abuse, but they are because of bad program rules,” said Boccia.Boccia also cited an “incentive misalignment” inherent in the state-federal program. States have little incentive to control payments because the federal government funds the program, she said.Forcing all beneficiaries to reapply would likely reduce the cost of the program by reducing the number of its beneficiaries, including by forcing out higher earners who may not consider the benefits they don’t actually need to be worth the onerous reapplication process, Boccia said. But it would also result in a percentage of low earners dropping off the program, as well as many who would be affected by the administrative backlog that would come with processing tens of millions of new applications, she said. Shutdown, the big beautiful bill, and confusionBergh said Rollins’ comments “add insult to injury” because they come after congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump signed a major tax cuts and spending law that is expected to shrink federal SNAP spending by $187 billion over 10 years. The law added work requirements for many SNAP recipients and shifted some costs to states.That was followed by the six-week shutdown that saw a dizzying back-and-forth over whether November SNAP benefits would be paid.“There has been huge amounts of chaos and confusion and disruption for both states and participants in recent weeks, largely due to the shutdown, but also because simultaneously, the administration has required states to implement many of the reconciliation bill’s SNAP cuts,” Bergh said.Craig, in her statement, also said Rollins’ comments would hurt the people who need the program.“I am astounded by the secretary's careless disregard for the hungry seniors and children who can afford to eat because of this program,” she said.Sara Naomi Bleich, a public health policy professor at Harvard University, said in a phone interview the confusion from Rollins’ comments compounded hardships produced by the Republican reconciliation law, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.“Big picture with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is that there's basically this tidal wave coming to families that have low income,” Bleich, who worked at USDA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said. “They're going to lose Medicaid. They're going to lose SNAP. There could be collateral impacts on the school meals. This is going to be a really hard time for families to navigate.”",,,,2025-11-20 18:57:55.396017

“What people want is actual, real results, and they’re not getting it from the partisan structure,” Bennett told the 50 or so attendees.
“I’m running for governor as an independent because I want to govern as an independent, and that is different,” he added. For example, serving as an independent governor would allow him the flexibility to choose the best suited members of his cabinet, he said, as opposed to having to select exclusively Republicans or Democrats.
At the event, which was held at the Cumberland Club, Bennett was endorsed by the centrist Forward Party, formed in 2020 by Todd Whitman, known as a centrist Republican, and former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang. The group supports independent candidates across the country at the local, state and national level that reflect its values from all parties. In 2024, the group endorsed Rep. Amy Roeder, a Democrat from Bangor.
“We want to support those that represent our values, as Rick does, and we want to find those candidates in the state and local offices,” Todd Whitman said.
Bennett is among a crowded field of contenders vying to replace Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, who will be termed out. The Oxford senator’s long track record in state government drew a mix of Democrats, Republicans and independents to the event who told Maine Morning Star they support his ideas and appreciate his commitment to work across the aisle.
Voters tired of two-part system
Many people in attendance were undecided on who they will be voting for next November, and many plan to vote in Democratic or Republican party primaries in June. But many said they think highly of Bennett, and agree with his denouncement of increasingly partisan politics.  
Phil Steele and his wife Francesca Galluccio-Steele are both registered Democrats, but attended because they agreed with Bennett’s push for transparency in campaign finance. Bennett introduced multiple bills last session aiming to expand clean elections to the local level and chaired the committee behind the successful 2023 referendum banning foreign entities from spending money on referendum campaigns. 
“I’m fed up with both parties, we have to get out of the two party system,” Phil Steele said. “I don’t agree with him on a lot of issues, but I agree on getting dark money out of politics.”
Anne Butterfield, who works for Our Power Maine, the campaign to establish a public utility system in the state, said she agrees with Bennett’s ideas about energy reform and reducing utility costs for Mainers. Butterfield, also a registered Democrat, said she’s “still looking at the playing field, but the trust is really high with him.”
Ted O’Meara, another former chair of the Maine Republican Party, said he left the party several years ago and is aligned with Bennett on many issues. Bennett has demonstrated leadership through his work across the aisle, he said, such as with former U.S. Rep. Mike Michaud when the two co-led the Maine Senate, and that makes him the “kind of candidate that people are looking for this year.”
“He has demonstrated throughout his political career that he’s willing to work with anybody to find a solution,” O’Meara added. “And people are really fed up with the partisanship and fighting. They really just want solutions.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1288-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-20 18:57:55.396017

It’s a private parcel, with a gravel airstrip and four or five buildings that make up a small worker camp. But there are no towns in sight. Known as the Johnson Tract, the property is fully surrounded by the vast Lake Clark National Park—millions of wild acres marked by the broad white peaks of a volcano, sprawling glaciers and a muddy ocean coastline patrolled by brown bears.
Beneath the Johnson Tract lies a potential fortune. For decades, geologists have eyed gold, copper and zinc deposits thought to be worth billions of dollars. But they’ve never been tapped.
Now, amid surging gold prices and rising demand for metals like copper, the prospect is generating new excitement—and concern.
A prominent Alaska mining company is leasing the Johnson Tract from its Indigenous owners, and the property, some 125 miles southwest of Anchorage, has emerged as one of the most promising mining prospects in Southcentral Alaska.
But conservationists, commercial salmon fishermen and local lodge owners fear a mine, encircled by the federal protected area, could disrupt harvests and harm wildlife, including an endangered population of beluga whales.
Getting the Johnson Tract’s minerals to buyers will require trucking ore through a now-roadless corner of the national park to a future port.
Critics point out that the bay where the mining company, Contango Ore, Inc., wants to build a shipping terminal is an important winter habitat for the endangered belugas. Concern for the whales, among other objections, led mine opponents to sue federal regulators earlier this year over a permit that Contango received to build a short access road and expand an airstrip at the site.

Still, the project is advancing.
The land is owned by Anchorage-based Cook Inlet Region, Inc., or CIRI, one of 12 Indigenous-owned regional corporations created by Congress as part of a wider land claims settlement with Alaska’s Native people in 1971.
Contango, based in Fairbanks, started leasing the land from CIRI last year. With gold prices surpassing a record high of $4,000 per troy ounce this year, the mining company is already planning new roads and a tunnel to allow underground drilling on the Johnson Tract.
If a mine gets built, both Contango and CIRI’s nearly 10,000 Indigenous shareholders are poised to profit.
“The stars might be aligned right now,” said Margie Brown, a former CIRI president who also worked for the corporation’s lands department in the 1970s, when the company acquired the prospect.
The conflict reflects a deeper tension between two competing visions for Alaska—one of environmental preservation, the other of industrial development. Both visions extend back to a time when Congress set aside large tracts of the state’s wilderness for protection but also carved out areas for resource extraction, often intended to benefit Alaska’s Indigenous-owned corporations. Rooted in a series of landmark bills in the 1970s and 1980s, the Johnson Tract saga echoes some of the state’s other, higher-profile environmental battles, including over a mining road and oil development in the Arctic.
As Contango forges ahead, CIRI is asserting its right to profit from lands long intended for development, while opponents say that mining imperils a still-wild slice of Alaska.

Among critics of the mining project is Dustin Solberg, a commercial fisherman and environmental advocate who spends summers with his family setting nets for salmon along the beaches of Tuxedni Bay, about 10 miles northeast of the Johnson Tract. Contango could one day load ore onto ships from the same shore where Solberg and other fishermen haul fish out of the bay.
Standing on a quiet Tuxedni beach one day this summer with dramatic cliffs looming overhead, Solberg imagined mining trucks rumbling down a road nearby.
“I think it would irreversibly change this place,” he said.

 A pivotal deal

The Johnson Tract fight is rooted in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.
Intended to resolve disputes over Indigenous land claims in Alaska, the federal legislation in 1971 established 12 for-profit Alaska Native corporations, each owned by Indigenous shareholders with ties to a region in the state. More than 200 other Indigenous companies tied to Native villages also formed.
The act promised to compensate the corporations with nearly a billion dollars and millions of acres of land, to be chosen by the companies’ elected leaders.
Those leaders quickly moved to obtain traditional hunting and fishing grounds and areas with cultural value, but they also sought land thought to be rich in minerals and other resources that they could convert into profits for shareholders.


In the Arctic, Native corporations acquired land with oil deposits. In Southeast Alaska, they logged vast stands of cedar and spruce.
But in CIRI’s region, around Anchorage and neighboring Cook Inlet, the pickings were sparse. The southcentral region is the state’s most populous, and by the time of the settlement, military bases and wildlife refuges had been set aside by the federal government, prime real estate was in the hands of private developers and other parcels had been snatched up by the state.
“You just had so much pressure for lands within the Cook Inlet region,” said Brown, who now serves on CIRI’s board.
The corporation’s leaders argued that they were largely left with glaciers and mountain ridges — dim prospects for shareholders.

Two years after Congress approved the settlement, CIRI sued the U.S. interior secretary, arguing that his agency had not made adequate property available for CIRI to develop. Tense negotiations ensued, producing a sprawling agreement between CIRI and the state and federal governments: the Cook Inlet Land Exchange.
The deal called for CIRI to give up half the property around Cook Inlet that the corporation was entitled to under the original settlement, Brown said. Some of that foregone land would be folded into Lake Clark National Park and Preserve when Congress created it a few years later.
In return, CIRI would be able to acquire land elsewhere in Alaska, and even outside the state.

The deal also allowed CIRI to pick up some key assets around Cook Inlet, including the Johnson Tract, which the corporation chose specifically for its mineral potential. CIRI’s early leaders viewed the land swap as a hard-fought compromise, and Brown called the Johnson Tract “key to the bargain.”
“The ability to use the land in the way Congress intended is something that needs to be preserved,” she said. “It’s unfortunate that as we move further and further from congressional intent, it’s harder and harder for people to remember that.”
The Johnson Tract is really two adjacent parcels, totaling about 33 square miles. CIRI—now a huge business, with nearly $1 billion in assets—owns the minerals beneath both parcels, and the surface of the south tract, where the main deposit sits. The federal government retained surface ownership of the north tract.
Citing a provision in the land exchange, the Department of Interior earlier this year granted CIRI the rights to transport ore through the park, with certain restrictions to limit environmental impacts. CIRI and Contango have not formally proposed building a haul road and port, which would require additional permits.
 An ‘Awesome’ Deposit

Soon after CIRI acquired the Johnson Tract, the corporation began scouring it for more minerals, seeking enough to justify building a mine.
In the early 1980s, CIRI partnered with Anaconda Minerals, a subsidiary of the global oil giant ARCO, to evaluate the prospect.
Anaconda found promising amounts of gold, zinc and copper and at one point—given the area’s prolific amount of snow—envisioned an underground tunnel or aerial tram to move ore the dozen miles from a mine to a port on the coast. But Anaconda went out of business. And aside from another unsuccessful effort to develop the Johnson Tract in the 1990s, the land sat largely dormant until 2019.
That year, CIRI signed a lease with a Vancouver-based mineral exploration company, which quickly handed over the operations to a spinoff firm, HighGold Mining Inc. HighGold spent tens of millions of dollars on exploration and drilled more than 150 core samples before Contango bought the company last year in a deal worth some $35 million.
The Johnson Tract appealed to Contango’s chief executive, Rick Van Nieuwenhuyse, because it seemed to be a good fit for the company’s unconventional development model, which involves shipping raw ore to a processing plant off site, rather than crushing and processing ore next to the deposit, as most mines do.
The approach avoids some of the more expensive and hard-to-permit components of a typical mine, like a mill and a big waste pond. In theory, it keeps construction costs low and makes permitting easier, Van Nieuwenhuyse said. But shipping unprocessed ore also risks higher transportation costs, so Johnson Tract’s close proximity to the ocean and shipping routes made it attractive.
“It’s an awesome deposit,” Van Nieuwenhuyse said, citing the prospect’s high ratio of valuable minerals to rock and its thickness, which he expects will make the mining process more efficient.
Van Nieuwenhuyse is a veteran of Alaska’s mining industry, having worked over the past four decades on some of the state’s most prominent early-stage projects.
He played major roles in advancing Western Alaska’s Donlin project — the state’s biggest proposed gold mine — and high-profile prospects in Northwest Alaska at the end of the controversial proposed Ambler Road. He also led development of the Rock Creek gold mine near Nome, which closed in 2008 soon after opening amid a slew of challenges.
At Contango, where Van Nieuwenhuyse was named chief executive in 2020, he partnered with the multinational Kinross Gold Corp. to spearhead the construction of Alaska’s first large mine in more than a decade, a project in the Interior called Manh Choh.
Unlike that open-pit mine, Johnson Tract would be an underground operation. Several years of exploratory drilling, permitting and engineering are expected before a final decision on building a mine, Van Nieuwenhuyse said.

The mine, according to Contango’s preliminary plans, would operate for seven years and would be small compared to other major Alaska mines. Contango would share royalties on mineral sales with CIRI, which has an option to buy as much as a 25 percent stake in the mine.
CIRI declined interview requests about the Johnson Tract, and the corporation’s executives have made few public statements about it.
The project “presents an opportunity to responsibly develop mineral resources to benefit our shareholders while respecting the environment and preserving the land,” CIRI said in a brief update last year. “The Johnson Tract project reflects decades of hard work to build a foundation of self-determination and financial stability.”
 ‘We’re Here Because it’s Beautiful’

Dustin Solberg, the fisherman and mine opponent, was motoring to a net he’d set on the west side of Tuxedni Channel one afternoon last summer when he spotted a brown bear on a rocky beach ahead.
“I think it smells the fish, Dad,” 12-year-old son and deckhand Leif Solberg called out.
Neither father nor son seemed particularly concerned. The area has so many beach-loving bears that it draws tourists from around the world for viewing and photography.
Far more worrisome to the elder Solberg is the future of the beach where the bear was roving—near a site that Contango is studying as a port.
Solberg, his family and others who fish in the channel each summer have growing concerns about Contango’s vision. They fear that a new road and industrial dock, and the traffic and noise from trucks and ships, would mar the wild character of the bay and the park around it.

As Solberg looked across the channel, it was remarkably quiet, aside from a few fishing skiffs and an occasional float plane that landed at a bear-viewing lodge on Chisik Island. Other than the lodge and a few fishing cabins, Chisik is a federally designated wilderness area, home to a prolific seabird colony.
A dozen or so crews fish commercially for salmon in the bay. Two or three times a week, from June through August, they set, pick and pull nets along pebbly beaches on either side of Tuxedni Channel, with fishing periods that can last 12 hours or more.
It’s hard labor, Solberg said, but the season moves at a slower pace than Alaska’s bigger-volume salmon fisheries, like Bristol Bay, where boats sometimes work 24-hour shifts.
“If you wanted to make money, you would fish somewhere else,” said Ann Harding, Solberg’s wife. “We’re here because it’s beautiful.”
The area has “phenomenal” mountains and a striking density of birds and bears, added Harding, a seabird biologist who sometimes fishes alongside Solberg.
The family uses a cabin a mile or two down the shoreline from where the bear had been walking. It’s a small plywood structure beneath an A-frame roof, surrounded by an electric fence to keep away curious ursine visitors. The cabin is about a hundred feet back from the water and set fully within Lake Clark National Park.
Solberg and Harding bought the structure several years ago. They don’t have title to the land beneath it or a formal permit from the park service. But the cabin existed before the park was established, and past owners had an informal arrangement with federal officials to keep using it, Solberg said.

The cabin now sits in an easement that the Department of Interior earlier this year granted CIRI for a mining port. Solberg doesn’t think his small business will amount to much of an obstacle.
“This is just a little shack that doesn’t really compete with the value of an operation like that,” he said, referring to the mining plans. “So, I don’t expect this to get in the way of anything.”

CIRI and Contango have not made a final decision about where to put the port, and a CIRI environmental document said last year that there is “considerable uncertainty” about future construction.
Van Nieuwenhuyse, the Contango mining executive, said his company recognizes the rights of the setnetters, and he believes a mine can co-exist with the fishery.
“I would ask that everybody recognize CIRI’s rights as well,” he added.
 Where Belugas ‘Hang Out’

As it gathers pace, Contango is facing opposition not just from the commercial fishermen but also from conservation groups and some tribal governments in the region.
A national group, the Center for Biological Diversity, along with the Homer-based nonprofit Cook Inletkeeper and the Chickaloon Village Traditional Council, a tribal government, are suing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for issuing a key permit to Contango.
Several tribal leaders also have raised concerns about the project and have asked the Trump administration to suspend the permit.
A core concern among those opponents is that a mining operation could threaten Cook Inlet’s beluga whales, which are treasured by many Anchorage residents and local wildlife viewers.
The inlet’s belugas—which are genetically distinct from other beluga populations—once numbered around 1,300 animals, but their numbers sharply declined in the 1990s. They were listed as endangered in 2008 and still have not significantly recovered. The population now stands at some 330 whales.
During the summer, the belugas are commonly spotted feasting on fish at the mouths of salmon-bearing streams near Anchorage. Where they go in winter has been a mystery.
But last year federal scientists announced a big discovery in a study that analyzed underwater sound recordings.
The researchers, affiliated with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, identified Tuxedni Bay as the only known foraging ground for the whales between late fall and late spring. They warned that human-caused noise is a “key threat” to the belugas, which use sound to navigate and communicate, and that industrial activity could affect the quality of the whales’ habitat.
NOAA Fisheries, which led the study, declined interview requests. One of its scientists, in a press release announcing the study, said that “maintaining the status quo” may be all that’s needed to help the beluga population recover.
As Contango studies sites for a port, it’s now funding a new beluga survey by biologists working for the state of Alaska, which has often been more friendly to the mining industry than the federal government.
The survey is focused on the narrow channel where Contango is considering shipping ore, while the NOAA-led study looked more broadly at the 10-mile-long Tuxedni Bay.
“We want to know where the belugas like to hang out,” Van Nieuwenhuyse said.
One of the loudest voices advocating for the belugas and against development at the Johnston Tract is Cooper Freeman, a Homer resident and the Alaska director at the Center for Biological Diversity. The center is a 35-year-old nonprofit that aims to protect wildlife and ecosystems across the country, and it’s a participant in nearly a dozen active lawsuits in Alaska’s federal court.
In an interview, Freeman acknowledged CIRI’s right to the minerals at the Johnson Tract. But he noted that federal environmental laws still apply and argued that CIRI does not have an “absolute right” to build a mine.
In his view, the area is too ecologically rich—with its important beluga habitat and high density of brown bears, seabirds and shorebirds—to risk.
“It’s just an incredibly, biologically, intensively rich and completely intact area—one of the only remaining places like it in all of Cook Inlet,” he said. “I don’t think there’s any amount of money that’s worth destroying this place.”

There are no towns within 40 miles of the Johnson Tract—just roadless mountains, glaciers, forests and streams.
Aside from seasonal fishermen, CIRI and Contango’s neighbors include Silver Salmon Creek Lodge, a bear-viewing and sport-fishing business that’s near the mouth of the Johnson River, a dozen or so miles downstream of the mineral deposit.
Longtime lodge owners David Coray and Joanne Edney have kept loose tabs on the prospect for decades and have grown more concerned as Contango’s project advances.
In a recent interview, Coray and Edney said they’re worried that a mine could pollute the Johnson River and disrupt bear habitat.
“We understand their interest, and we understand their rights,” Edney said of CIRI and Contango. But a mining operation could come into “direct conflict” with her family’s business, she said.
CIRI declined to respond to questions about opposition to the project, and about how it’s gauging the views of its shareholders, some of whom have spoken out against it.
Van Nieuwenhuyse said Contango is committed to protecting wildlife.
“We’ll develop this deposit with minimal impacts to the environment, which we recognize as pristine,” Van Nieuwenhuyse said. “We’re all from Alaska. We enjoy the outdoors. That’s why we all became geologists.”
For Solberg, the fisherman, the convergence of competing interests in the area is “endlessly fascinating—and really complicated and really unfortunate.”
In a conversation after the fishing season, Solberg acknowledged a tension between CIRI’s rights to the Johnson Tract’s minerals and the spectre of a mine transforming the landscape and bay that his family has come to know and love.
Solberg said he feels “really torn” about the issue and that he respects CIRI’s land claims. But as one of the few Alaskans who spends long stretches of time in Tuxedni Bay, he feels obligated to speak in defense of its wildness and beauty.
“I just want decisionmakers to have their eyes wide open,” he said. “And to realize what’s at stake.”

EPA can charge up to $68,445 per day of Clean Water Act violations, but the agency lowered the charge on the basis that the feedlot had “a limited ability to pay a civil penalty.” 
In addition to the fee, Wynja Feedlot Inc., a 999-head capacity cattle feedlot, is required to apply for an National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, or NPDES, permit, construct a lined containment basin and sample discharges from the surrounding tile for possible pollutants.

EPA discovered in March 2021 that the confined animal feeding operation had been discharging wastewater through a drainage pipe that led to a “relatively permanent” tributary of the West Branch of the Floyd River. 
According to EPA, the wastewater contained high levels of bacteria, ammonia, chlorides, and unprocessed organic matter, all of which can contribute to impaired water quality. 
The feedlot did not have an NPDES permit for the drainage pipe, and according to EPA, the facility admitted the observed discharge had occurred for three consecutive days. 
According to EPA and the Iowa Department of Natural Resource fish kill database, the West Branch Floyd River has been subject to multiple fish kills in the past two decades, some of which were attributable to animal waste.
EPA concluded the facility also had “limited wastewater containment” that meant further “unauthorized discharges” likely occurred during storms. 
The consent decree was filed Nov. 17, but the facility was tasked with meeting compliance deadlines over the summer to begin the process of building runoff control structures and sampling process plans. 
According to EPA, the facility has already applied for an NPDES permit and received a construction permit to build the lined containment basin. 
EPA estimates the facility’s compliance will prevent an estimated 4.5 million gallons of wastewater each year from entering the river. The agency estimates that amount of wastewater is equal to 137,000 pounds of pollutants, consisting of total suspended solids, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and oxygen demand.

(Photo by Peter Dazeley/Getty Images)An Iowa lawyer accused of elder abuse is now suing the Henry County District Court, the county attorney and the Mt. Pleasant chief of police over a search warrant related to his financial records.
Attorney Beau Bergmann and the Bergmann Law Firm are suing Henry County, Henry County District Court, Henry County Attorney Darin Stater, and Mt. Pleasant Chief of Police Lyle Murray in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
The lawsuit claims Bergmann and his law firm maintained a lawyer trust account for depositing client funds at Wayland State Bank in Mt. Pleasant. According to the lawsuit, in August 2023, Murray and Stater  initiated a search warrant application for account information at Wayland State Bank. The warrant application allegedly sought access to financial statements for accounts controlled by Bergmann or the law firm.
As part of the warrant application, Murray allegedly provided the court with an affidavit stating that Bergmann had illegally taken $20,000 from a mentally incapacitated person and would not return the money. Additional references were made to $9,500 paid to Bergmann by a different client.
Murray’s affidavit, according to the lawsuit, alleged that “Bergmann either stole or fraudulently obtained money from the two victims.” The affidavit allegedly cites “two suspicious checking accounts,” without offering any explanation as to why the accounts were deemed suspicious.
Despite the fact that funds held in such accounts are not the property of the attorney who maintains the account, but are instead the property of the clients, Stater and Murray sought access to financial statements pertaining to the account, according to the lawsuit.
Based upon Murray’s affidavit, District Associate Judge Jonathan Stensvaag then approved the warrant application and signed a search warrant in the case, the lawsuit alleges.
Bergmann now claims the court was aware, or should have been aware, there was probable cause that a criminal offense had been committed.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for alleged civil rights violations related to the improper issuance of search warrants and invasion of privacy.
The defendants in the case have yet to file a response to the lawsuit.
Lawsuit follows case alleging elder abuse
Civil court records indicate the search warrant pertaining to the mentally incapacitated individual are tied to a dispute that arose in May 2023, when attorney Steven E. Ort filed a court petition against Bergmann seeking relief from elder abuse.
In that case, Ort, who was representing the incapacitated individual’s conservator and guardian, alleged Bergmann had accepted $20,000 from the individual after that person’s financial matters were placed in the hands of the conservator, and that Bergmann then refused to return the money to the conservator.
“This is not an ordinary commercial transaction between a lawyer and a potential client,” Ort alleged in court filings, adding that the incapacitated individual “was subject to a pending guardianship and conservatorship when he first met with Mr. Bergmann (and) a conservator had been appointed by the time the check was dated and was cashed.”
Ort’s court filings also alleged Bergmann’s license to practice law had been suspended beginning on Feb. 24, 2023, and so Bergmann could not legally represent the individual at a court hearing that took place in March 2023.
“Bergmann cannot escape liability for elder abuse by asserting that his privilege to practice law somehow immunizes him,” Ort argued to the court.
In June 2023, Ort filed a motion to dismiss the case, although the available court records don’t indicate the reason for the motion.
Court records show that in December 2022, Bergmann consented to the suspension of his law license, admitting the Iowa Supreme Court Attorney Disciplinary Board had fielded “complaints containing allegations that I had violated ethical rules in my representation of multiple clients.”
In consenting to the suspension, Bergmann acknowledged the following previous sanctions:
April 2015: He was privately admonished for neglecting a client’s appeal.
July 2018: He was privately admonished on for lack of diligence in pursuing a client’s case and failing to keep his client informed.
September 2018: He was privately admonished due to unearned fees not being placed in a client trust account.
January 2020: The Iowa Supreme Court publicly reprimanded Bergmann for missing a hearing in a marriage-dissolution case and not attending a mediation session.
Court records show Bergmann’s Iowa law license is currently active.

“Not only do these exemptions provide immediate relief to our hardworking farmers and ranchers, but they also help bolster Arkansas’ number one industry,” Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a news release.
Commodity crop farmers are facing one of their worst periods in decades as a result of skyrocketing production costs and stagnant demand. Agriculture industry leaders told lawmakers in September that 25% to 40% of farmers are likely to leave the industry after this season unless they receive aid.
State lawmakers petitioned the federal government for emergency financial aid to farmers last month.
Neither Sanders’ news release nor a letter from the state Department of Finance and Administration to the state Department of Agriculture makes it clear whether Arkansas farmers have received or are about to receive the requested aid. A spokesperson for the Arkansas Department of Agriculture did not respond to a request for comment.
In the letter dated Wednesday, Finance and Administration Secretary Jim Hudson confirmed to Agriculture Secretary Wes Ward that farmers will not have to pay income taxes as of Jan. 1 of this year if they received aid from the U.S. Department of Agriculture under the American Relief Act of 2025. This complies with Act 696 of 2025, sponsored by longtime farmer and Senate Majority Leader Blake Johnson, R-Corning.

Arkansas lawmakers urge feds to help farmers stay afloat in struggling industry


A provision of the American Relief Act is the Emergency Livestock Relief Program, which set aside $2 billion for livestock producers “suffering losses due to drought, wildfires, or flooding in calendar years 2023 and 2024,” according to the USDA website.
“Arkansas farmers and ranchers are the backbone of our state’s economy, and they continue to demonstrate incredible resilience in the face of extreme weather and market challenges,” Ward said in the news release. “These tax exemptions ensure that federal relief dollars go directly to helping producers recover, reinvest, and remain strong heading into the next growing season.”
Federal lawmakers are responsible for renewing a sweeping agriculture bill every five years to set both policy and funding levels for the industry. Arkansas Republican U.S. Sen. John Boozman chairs the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, one of the committees responsible for drafting the farm bill.
Congress has repeatedly extended the 2018 farm bill a year at a time, but it expired Sept. 30 of this year, the day before a 43-day government shutdown began. The spending package that reopened the government last week included three years of funding for the USDA.
The federal government faces the possibility of another shutdown in January without consensus on addressing rising health insurance costs.

(Rebecca S. Gratz for the Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A group of voting advocates filed a ballot measure to make it harder for Nebraska lawmakers to override or alter voter-passed laws or measures tweaked by referendum. 
The group, Respect Nebraska Voters, announced its push to gather signatures on Thursday. The initiative is a state constitutional amendment that would require bigger majorities to repeal or change any law passed by voters.
The measure also would require larger majorities to make changes to the requirements or processes for a citizen-led initiative to reach the ballot.  
Currently the Legislature needs two-thirds of lawmakers, or 33 senators, to vote to make those kinds of changes. The ballot measure would increase the required vote to four-fifths, or 40 senators.
Dawn Essink, a sponsor of the new ballot measure, said what prompted the proposed constitutional amendment is seeing the “anger from a lot of Nebraskans who had worked very hard on that paid sick leave initiative, among other initiatives.”
The new push comes after this year’s legislative session, in which the officially nonpartisan but Republican-led Nebraska Legislature, often with gubernatorial support and the support of at least one Democrat, prodded for changes that would have weakened or reversed some ballot measures.

Essink said the ballot initiative process was designed so that the voice of Nebraska voters is heard, but lawmakers are disrespecting voters. 
“The Legislature is taking that vote and watering it down … diluting it … call it whatever you want, but they’re changing it to their will, not the will of the people,” Essink said.

For example, advocates said, the state is currently slowrolling two voter-approved laws legalizing and regulating medical cannabis. Nebraska’s GOP lawmakers and Democratic State Sen. Jane Raybold of Lincoln successfully pushed to weaken the voter-approved law’s blanket requirements for paid sick leave by adding new restrictions and exceptions. Legislative majorities tried — and failed for now — to slow down voter-approved minimum wage increases. That proposal is already scheduled to be reconsidered in the upcoming session.
Some conservative lawmakers have considered making the petition process harder because of the recent passage of more progressive measures have been passed in recent years.  
Jo Giles, executive director of the Women’s Fund of Omaha and a ballot measure sponsor, said the group wants to add “protections for the ballot initiative” and hopes Gov. Jim Pillen and conservative lawmakers support it. 
The ballot initiative process “is direct democracy,” she said. “It is letting Nebraskans vote for issues that come up, and we want them to respect the will of the people,” Giles said. 
The group organizing the new petition drive would need to gather the signatures of 10 percent of the state’s registered voters since the initiative seeks to change the state constitution. 
Respect Nebraska Voters has until July to get on the November 2026 ballot.

(Photo by Thomas Barwick/Getty Images)Pennsylvania is hoping to secure its own slice of a $50 billion rural health fund in the face of federal Medicaid cuts, with a focus on bolstering a beleaguered workforce and expanding health access for more than two million people. 
The Rural Health Transformation Fund was a last-minute addition to President Donald Trump’s summer budget bill that imposed Medicaid work requirements and cut upwards of $51 billion in funding to the commonwealth over the next decade. That new fund is worth roughly 37% of the estimated lost Medicaid funding in rural areas. 
“Pennsylvania is home to the third-largest rural population in the country, and our rural communities face unique challenges when it comes to public health and access to health care. A strong, accessible, affordable health care system is the foundation of any healthy community, and health care is essential to the economic growth, population revitalization, and stabilization of our rural communities,” said Val Arkoosh, the state’s secretary of the Department of Human Services, in a release.
The 67-page application — released Thursday, which was also National Rural Health Day — requests up to $200 million in annual funding over the next five years, totalling $1 billion. Its six focuses include: technology and infrastructure; workforce; maternal health services; behavioral health services; aging and access; and emergency medical services and transportation. 
The U.S. Department of Human Services is expected to award funding by the end of the year.

Key objective targets are: 

Access to care: More than 85% of Pennsylvanians can get a routine primary care appointment within four weeks and urgent care appointments within one week.
Digital connectivity and telehealth: More than 85% of rural hospitals and clinics will have broadband and telehealth functionality. More than 50% of rural hospitals and clinics connected via Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources. 
Workforce adequacy: Reduce rural hospital vacancy rates by 10% for key direct care roles. Add three new rural training programs. 
System sustainability: More than 60% of systems partnered with rural Community Health Centers for specialty care. 
Health outcomes: Reduce the number of pregnant women living in rural areas with inadequate prenatal care by 20%.


“The state did sort of have their hands tied on the different areas that they could apply for because of the way that (the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) set up that funding,” said Helen Hawkey, the board president of the Pennsylvania Rural Health Association. 
She also serves as the director of the Pennsylvania Coalition for Oral Health and added that she would have liked to see more funding for dental access. But the overall investment in workforce development — a need across health care sectors — will attempt to fill in gaps across the spectrum alongside a separate state Rural Health Plan. 
“You have to have providers to have access. You cannot access health care if you have no one to provide it,” said Hawkey. “The incentives that are included in the plan — like scholarships, stipends, housing — all of those things are going to be really, really important to try to increase providers in rural areas.”
 Shoring up workforce, technology improvements

Though nearly 20% of the state’s population is rural, only 10% of the state’s physicians and hospital beds are in rural counties. 
Dentists number even fewer, with just 6% of the state’s practitioners in rural areas. 
Additionally, one-third of the state’s rural hospitals are at-risk of closing, according to The Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania. HAP told the Capital-Star in a statement that the anticipated funds wouldn’t be sufficient to make up for lost Medicaid funding.

Areas shaded in gray are rural areas, as defined by the federal Health Resources and Services Administration. (Map from PA’s Rural Health Transformation Fund application)
“Fewer than half of the commonwealth’s rural hospitals are operating with margins necessary for long-term stability because they have been chronically underfunded for the care they provide. Medicaid is among the largest payors for many rural hospitals, yet, in Pennsylvania, reimburses only 71 cents per dollar spent providing care,” said Nicole Stallings, the organization’s president and CEO.
“This is already unsustainable but upcoming federal cuts will reduce reimbursement even more — to 64 (cents) per dollar — resulting in a nearly $1 billion direct payment cut to Pennsylvania’s rural hospitals over the next decade on top of a sharp rise in uncompensated care due to coverage losses.”
The state hopes to use the federal dollars to bolster the workforce of rural hospitals and update technology, both aspects praised by HAP and included in the organization’s September recommendations. 
The scholarships, rotations and residencies for future health care practitioners come with a five-year service commitment, prioritizing students from rural backgrounds
The state requested $239.2 million in workforce investments.
The application also pitches telehealth and virtual provider visits as ways to relieve burnout and increase access to specialists, with new technology assistance managed by a central hub. It specifically named artificial intelligence as an opportunity.

Examples include conversational AI, digital check-in tools and chronic disease prevention or management services. The Guthrie Clinic’s Pulse Center in Pennsylvania is highlighted for its use of AI in centralized digital monitoring and improved care coordination, which “ease staff workload and achieve reductions in nurse turnover and hospital costs.”
Even as practitioners report fewer hours devoted to paperwork because of AI, state lawmakers have recently sought to control the growth of AI in health care settings, citing transparency concerns.
 A focus on maternal and elder health

Mothers and mothers-to-be have inadequate prenatal care in rural areas, and nearly one-third of rural women live more than 30 minutes away from the closest labor and delivery unit. Three rural hospitals in the state closed their labor and delivery units last year, exacerbating the problem. 
The state proposes regional rural Maternal Health Hubs, places where pregnant Pennsylvanians can get comprehensive, coordinated care. The hubs will also facilitate — through face-to-face contact or telehealth — mental, oral and behavioral health care alongside substance use disorder services. 
 
Rural Pennsylvanians experience higher rates of mental illness and substance use disorder, compounded by the lack of qualified providers. The nation’s new suicide hotline, 988, continues to be underutilized in the commonwealth, with rural areas having disproportionately higher suicide rates. 
If you or someone you know is considering suicide, please call or text 988 to be connected to a crisis counselor free of charge 24/7.


“The hub model is invaluable in rural areas, where patients often face long travel distances, workforce shortages and fragmented care systems,” read the application. “The hub will augment the capacity of existing providers by centralizing key activities and expanding services where gaps exist.” 
Investments from the federal government could additionally fund: an app for new moms that connects them to local providers, telehealth and community resources; remote psychiatric and substance use consultations; and remote patient monitoring for high-risk pregnancies or postpartum complications. 
For these services, the state is requesting $187.4 million.
Expanding paramedicine services, where specially trained paramedics check on newly discharged patients, could improve recovery times for seniors and reduce readmissions. The providers can assess homes for fall risks — one of the leading causes of hospitalizations for older Americans — and assist with chronic disease management or wellness checks.
Additional dollars could be used to improve nursing home quality and staffing, which fell following the COVID-19 pandemic. In total, the state seeks $77.6 million for aging-related services. 
And while the public can expect annual state reports, staff at the University of Pittsburgh Medicaid Research Center will also provide independent evaluations, including “secret shopper” surveys to measure the impacts of rural health investments on appointment availability and wait times.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/hospital-room-1024x6831762391450-1.jpg,,,2025-11-20 18:57:55.396017

The citizen nonprofit group filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of using eminent domain for carbon capture and sequestration projects. (Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)A group of Louisiana residents is suing Gov. Jeff Landry’s administration over state laws that allow the acquisition of private property against landowners’ wishes for pipelines transporting carbon dioxide. 
Save My Louisiana, composed mostly of resident and elected officials from Allen, Beauregard, Livingston, Rapides and Vernon parishes, is the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit against the state Thursday morning in the 19th Judicial District Court in Baton Rouge. Group president Gray Musgrove joined six other local citizens in the case against the governor and state Department of Conservation and Energy Secretary Dustin Davidson.
The governor’s office did not respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit. A Conservation and Energy spokesman declined to comment, citing department policy on pending litigation. 
The lawsuit argues statutes on the use of eminent domain for carbon capture and storage in Louisiana law are unconstitutional. The laws “provide special privileges and immunities to private Corporations,” deny citizens their right to own property and cede judicial authority to the executive branch of state government.
There are currently 31 carbon capture and sequestration projects awaiting state approval, according to the Department of Conservation and Energy. The 101 total storage wells from these projects would cover 18 different parishes, mostly centered in Central and South Louisiana.

Only one well, operated by Hackberry Carbon Sequestration in Cameron Parish, has received approval so far, with its permit okayed on Sept. 5. The 101 total storage wells from these projects would cover 18 different parishes, mostly centered in Central and South Louisiana. 
Various state laws on the use of eminent domain for carbon transport and storage are listed in the lawsuit. Developers and government agencies that have successfully argued in court for the use of eminent domain to obtain property lean on the argument that the acquisition is for a greater good that outweighs the interests of the property owner. In the case of CO2 pipelines, the reasoning is that removing the greenhouse gas from the atmosphere and storing it underground is in the interest of public health by mitigating the effects of climate change. 
Supporters of the plaintiffs disagree. They include Louisiana Treasurer John Fleming, a U.S. Senate candidate who joined the plaintiffs outside the courthouse for a news conference and shared his opposition to forced land acquisitions for carbon capture projects.
“Eminent domain is designed for the public good … This is not for the public benefit,” Fleming said. “This is for the benefit of a very, very small group of people who will end up making lots of money from this.”
The issue of carbon capture has divided a Republican Party in Louisiana that typically backs the fossil fuel industry, a sector that’s shown the greatest interest in developing the technology. Some GOP state lawmakers with projects proposed in their districts have called for more restrictions on carbon capture and local approval for such projects. Gov. Jeff Landry has said he would like to see Louisiana lead the way in putting the technology to use.
“Believe me, we all support the oil and gas industry in general,” said Fleming, a Republican. “But there’s a segment that wants to make even additional money by putting burden on the citizens, and that’s where we draw the line. This is not good for Louisiana.”
Mike Slocum, co-founder of Save My Louisiana and one of the plaintiffs, said that while his group staunchly backs fossil fuels, there’s a lack of transparency between the industry and state and residents of parishes where carbon capture projects are planned.
“As we started to have [Save My Louisiana] meetings, we found that the community didn’t really know what it was,” Slocum said. “We don’t think the whole state really realizes what’s happening.”
Opponents of carbon capture and CO2 transport have concerns over safety and environmental impacts. Most hold up the example of a ruptured CO2 pipeline in 2020 that forced the evacuation of the small town of Satartia, Mississippi, that resulted in 45 people being hospitalized. Other worries include possible groundwater contamination and the potential for leaks. 
Beauregard Parish resident Mona DeFries, who owns land in Calcasieu Parish near a planned CO2 pipeline, said she feels the use of eminent domain for carbon capture is “a slap in the face” for property owners like her. Although she’s not a party in the lawsuit and hasn’t yet lost land to a project, DeFries said she supports its objectives and is concerned over environmental impacts and risk factors. 
“The safety issues haven’t been expressed clear enough for us,” she said.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4037-scaled-e1763674981951-1024x818.jpg,,,2025-11-20 18:57:55.396017

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout).A group of 10 Tennessee parents and taxpayers filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging the constitutionality of the state’s new “universal” private-school voucher program.
Filed in Davidson County Chancery Court against Gov. Bill Lee, Education Commissioner Lizzette Reynolds and Tennessee Board of Education members, the lawsuit says the Tennessee Education Freedom Scholarship Act violates the state constitution by shifting public funds to unaccountable private schools that “openly discriminate” against students.
The program provides vouchers worth nearly $7,300 to 20,000 students in its first year at a cost of $144 million. The state’s top lawmakers want to double the program to 40,000 in its second year. 
The program has two categories of students, 10,000 set aside for those whose family incomes hit 300% of the federal subsidized lunch program, up to $180,000, and 10,000 for students with no family income requirement.
“I’ve raised nine children in Memphis, and all of them have attended Shelby County Schools,” said Apryle Young, a plaintiff in the lawsuit. “I’ve seen what our teachers can do when they have resources, and what happens when those resources disappear. We need to invest in our public schools, not abandon them.”
The plaintiffs contend the law violates the education clause of the state constitution by diverting state money from underfunded schools and preventing an adequate education for students by funding schools outside the state’s system of free public schools.
The lawsuit says the voucher program is unconstitutional because participating private schools don’t have to meet the same academic standards, accountability measures such as tests and civil rights protections as public schools.
Debate over private-school voucher expansion looms in Tennessee

Private schools can discriminate against students with disabilities, LGBTQ students and those of certain religions, all of which would be illegal for public schools, the plaintiffs say. Nor are private schools required to follow the state’s curriculum  or special education services guaranteed for state and federal law, a release says.
In addition, teachers at participating private schools don’t have to follow state certification requirements or give the state’s main standardized test, which is used to determine student proficiency and teacher and school effectiveness, the release says.
“They call this ‘school choice,’ but the choice isn’t yours, it’s the private schools,” said one of 10 plaintiffs, Crystal Boehm, a Hamilton County parent and preschool teacher. “They can reject your child for a disability, for your family’s religion, for any reason at all. Meanwhile, public schools that educate everyone are losing the funding they need.”
The plaintiffs are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee, Education Law Center and Southern Poverty Law Center, in addition to the Southern Education Foundation and Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd law firm.
Lawmakers passed Lee’s private-school voucher program in a January special session after postponing it in 2024 for lack of support.
The Department of Education released important dates Thursday for families wanting to apply for the money for the 2026-27 school year.
“In its first year of implementation, the Education Freedom Scholarship Program has been a remarkable success, and I look forward to continuing to deliver families with quality educational choices to best serve their students’ unique needs,” Education Commissioner Reynolds said in a statement.
Lee has said his only regret about the program is that it can’t be available to all students, though he is planning to try to expand it next year. 
The state estimated 66% of the students who receive the funds would be returning private-school students. The Lee administration refused to show how many of the 20,000 students receiving the vouchers attended private schools last year.

Idaho State Department of Agriculture officials said in a new release that there have been confirmed reports of Equine Herpesvirus Type 1, or EHV-1, linked to the events in Texas and Oklahoma. 
Idaho does not have any confirmed cases of the disease at this time, but state officials warned the virus is very contagious among horses and can lead to respiratory disease, abortions in pregnant mares, neurological disease and potentially the death of horses.

“Idaho has no confirmed cases of EHV-1 at this time,” Idaho State Department of Agriculture officials wrote in a news release issued Thursday. “Due to the highly contagious nature of the virus, the Idaho state veterinarian urges horse owners, trainers and event organizers to take immediate biosecurity precautions and temporarily stop any transporting or hauling of equine to protect Idaho horses.”
Although the virus is highly contagious among horses and can be spread through respiratory particles or contaminated equipment or clothing, state officials said the virus cannot infect humans. 
As a result of the confirmed cases of EHV-1, Idaho state officials urge horse owners, trainers and event organizers who may have participated in the events in Texas and Oklahoma to contact their veterinarian or the Idaho State Department of Agriculture’s Division of Animal Industries immediately. The phone number for the Boise off of the Division of Animal Industries is (208) 332-8540.
Symptoms of EHV-1 may include fever, nasal discharge or coughing, lethargy or depression, abortions on pregnant mares or neurological changes such as stumbling, incoordination, head tilt or hind leg weakness, state officials said. 
Infected horses may take up to 21 days to show symptoms, officials said.
Additional information about EHV-1 and biosecurity recommendations is available online.

The union representing Vermont state employees is turning to two legal venues to challenge Gov. Phil Scott’s order that many of its members return to the office in person.
On Nov. 10, the Vermont State Employees’ Association filed a charge with the state’s Labor Relations Board alleging the Scott administration skirted a union demand to enter formal bargaining over the return-to-work plan, in violation of labor protection laws. The plan will require many employees to come into the office at least three days a week. 
The union also filed a separate grievance with the Labor Relations Board arguing that parts of the plan violated the collective bargaining agreement it has in place with the state.

Then, on Nov. 12, the union filed a lawsuit in Washington County Superior civil court asking a judge to bar the Scott administration from implementing its workplace plan — set to take effect Dec. 1 — until the labor board adjudicates the union’s complaints. 
The union wrote in its lawsuit that “neither the unfair labor practice charge nor the grievance is capable of being decided” by the labor board before Dec. 1. The suit seeks a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction that allows state employees to continue working remotely.
Steve Howard, the union’s executive director, said in an interview Wednesday that he hoped the suit would at least slow the implementation of the governor’s directive. He said he thought a hearing could be held on the lawsuit as soon as next week. 
The legal challenges mark a significant escalation in the monthslong fight between the union and the administration over the plan to have state workers, with some exceptions, return to the office. The union contends that the hybrid work mandate will cause experienced employees to quit, decreasing the quality of state departments’ work. 
At the same time, administration officials say that the order will improve government services by boosting collaboration and helping to preserve institutional knowledge. They’ve argued Vermonters want government workers to be present in-person.
In a statement Thursday, Amanda Wheeler, a spokesperson for the governor’s office, said the union’s legal challenges had no impact on Scott’s support for the plan. 
“The Administration’s decision to implement this standard is well within our authority,” Wheeler wrote. “The Governor’s position on returning to a hybrid work standard has not changed, he continues to believe human connection is an important part of employee engagement, as well as team building and learning from each other.” 
According to court filings, after the administration formally announced its return-to-work plans in late August, it wrote to the union in September requesting a meeting to discuss the plans and hear the union’s concerns. In that letter, which is attached to the lawsuit, John Berard, the state’s director of labor relations, said the plan did not need to be the subject of formal bargaining. That’s because the planned hybrid work requirement was permissible under an existing teleworking policy for state employees, he said.

But the union doesn’t see it that way. In court filings, the union contends state leaders agreed to remote working arrangements for their employees, starting at the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic, that did not fall under the stipulations of the teleworking policy. Those arrangements “have become an established condition of employment which the State is not free to change” without entering formal bargaining, the union wrote in an Oct. 24 letter to the state. It demanded, in that letter, that bargaining take place. 
Berard then wrote the union back Nov. 10 saying the state’s position had remained unchanged, according to court filings. That’s the same day the union filed its challenges with the state Labor Relations Board.
The legal challenges are set to play out as the state has expanded its workspace ahead of the planned return to office for many employees. On Monday, it signed leases for three new office spaces in the privately owned Pilgrim Park complex in Waterbury, which records show would be used by workers at the state Agency of Human Services.
That agency has been facing a shortage of office space at the nearby Waterbury State Office Complex, where much of its operations are based. The shortage could delay the restart of in-person work for some employees past Dec. 1, officials said previously.
The state is set to pay about $2.3 million to lease the new office space over the next five years, according to the leases.

House Bill 1622 looks to require government employers to bargain with unions over the use of the technology if it affects wages or worker performance evaluations. 
This past session, the bill passed the House mostly along party lines, with Democratic support, before stalling in the Senate.
Opponents, including business groups and city officials, argued the measure would skew the balance of power between employees and managers too far toward workers. They also said the mandate could delay workplace innovation.
With hopes of getting it over the finish line in 2026, the bill’s lead sponsor, Rep. Lisa Parshley, D-Olympia, brought the idea to the state’s artificial intelligence task force on Thursday. The Legislature created the task force in 2024.
“Public sector bargaining covers wages, hours and working conditions and agencies are already required to bargain any change that touches those areas, but without legislation, that bargaining happens after implementation,” said Washington State Labor Council President April Sims. “With legislation like House Bill 1622, it would happen before.”
A state law passed in 2002 prohibits bargaining over technology for classified employees of state agencies and higher education institutions. 
“The biggest technology decisions made by management was, what kind of desktop, what kind of fax, what kind of phone,” Parshley said of the era when that law took effect. “Is that fair when we have a technology that now will actually impact our workers in ways that we have not even begun to realize?”
A separate statute governing workers at cities, counties and other agencies, on the other hand, requires bargaining over technology if it affects issues like wages, hours or working conditions.
Many workers are concerned about what the rapid rise of artificial intelligence means for their job security. 
A Pew Research Center survey conducted late last year reported over half of workers are worried about the future impact of AI on the workplace and about one-third think it will lead to fewer jobs. About one-in-six workers said AI was already doing some of their work.
Maryland, for example, is partnering with AI company Anthropic to help residents apply for food aid, Medicaid and other social welfare programs.
In early 2024, then-Gov. Jay Inslee issued an executive order outlining a future for state government’s use of generative artificial intelligence. It noted that the state “seeks to harness the potential of generative AI in an ethical and equitable way for the benefit of the state government workforce.”
In line with that guidance, a September directive from the state’s Office of Financial Management requires giving union-represented state employees six months’ notice of any use of generative AI if it “will result in a consequential change in employee wages, hours, or working conditions.” Under the memo, unions can file a demand to bargain over using the technology.
“Including workers at the beginning is not a courtesy. It is a practical necessity,” Sims said. “It identifies risk. It ensures human oversight where it is needed, and it builds trust among staff, who will ultimately have to operate, troubleshoot and rely on these systems.”
The memo also mandates human review for such systems when they’re used for employment-related decisions.
Parshley called the directive an “excellent first step.” But she says her proposed law “would allow future administrations to be held accountable” by codifying the order in law.
Meanwhile, President Donald Trump is reportedly considering an executive order directing U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to sue states that pass regulations on AI. But it’s unclear if that would cover potential laws like this one, since it doesn’t directly regulate the technology itself.
It’s the latest salvo in the debate over a federal versus state approach to guardrails on the technology. In the debate over Trump’s signature tax cut and spending law over the summer, Congress considered putting a moratorium on state-level artificial intelligence regulations. U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., led the charge to axe that provision from the final law.

One potential measure requested by state Attorney General Nick Brown could put Washington in the Trump administration’s crosshairs. 
Senate Bill 5708 looks to protect children from artificial intelligence-fed social media applications. This year, the legislation passed the Senate before stalling in the House. It can come back in 2026.
Parshley noted she is part of a new workgroup in the Legislature focused on AI “so that we can participate in this great debate.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ChatGPT-screen.png,,,2025-11-20 18:57:55.396017

Santiago/Getty Images)A Northern Kentucky Republican is working on a bill that would require all Kentucky police agencies to enter agreements for immigration enforcement under a program that has rapidly expanded under the Trump administration. 
Rep. TJ Roberts, of Burlington, presented the proposal during a Thursday meeting of the Interim Joint Committee on Local Government. He argued that entering such agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would provide Kentucky police agencies with new federal resources and dollars. 
However, Democrats on the committee voiced apprehension about requiring local agencies to partner with ICE. 
“I think this really gets down to being a local control issue for me,” said Rep. Rachel Roarx, D-Louisville. “Our law enforcement agencies, I think they know their jurisdictions best. They know where their resources need to be allocated.”
Roberts later said that his bill would be “a way to ensure greater senses of community policing, of allowing it to be done and administered by the local level.” 
Kentucky’s Republican-controlled General Assembly could consider the bill during the 2026 legislative session, which starts in January. 
Roberts called the agreements an “incredible opportunity to provide more resources to our law enforcement community, to promote public safety and to align us with the priorities of the federal government.” He added that local police officers would be “deputized for limited immigration enforcement,” such as during traffic stops when they have “reasonable suspicion” to further investigate the driver’s or passengers’ citizenship or immigration status. 
Roberts acknowledged that while some Kentucky law enforcement agencies have entered ICE agreements, he believes “we do not have that in the areas that we need it at.” 
According to ICE’s website, 22 law enforcement agencies within Kentucky have an active 287(g) program to date. The agencies include mostly county sheriffs’ departments but also some local jails and a local police department. All of the agreements were signed this year. 
Roarx questioned what Roberts meant by not having the agreements “in the areas that need it most.” Roberts said his home region of Northern Kentucky, which has major highways, should have such agreements. He added that “it’s needed everywhere in Kentucky” and not just in the counties with current programs. 
“Once they complete that 40 hours of training that is all online, that is paid for by the federal government, these officers are deputized by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement,” Roberts said. “And they can only engage in this limited enforcement while under the supervision of the federal authorities in order to ensure that there is oversight, that there is accountability.” 
If approved, Roberts’ proposal would direct the Kentucky State Police and local law enforcement agencies to have a written agreement with ICE under Section 287(g) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. The program is often referred to as the 287(g) Program. 
Under such agreements, ICE can delegate “the authority to perform specified immigration officer functions” to state and law enforcement officers, the federal agency’s website says. 
ICE expanded the number of agreements by 641% after Republican President Donald Trump took office earlier this year. However, immigrants and their advocates have argued that these agreements can lead to racial profiling and lack oversight. 
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) previously announced that law enforcement agencies participating in the 287(g) Program would be eligible for significant reimbursements starting in October. An example of that is that ICE may reimburse an agency for “the annual salary and benefits of each eligible trained 287(g) officer, including overtime coverage up to 25% of the officer’s annual salary.” 
Roberts argued the agreements would bring in significant dollars to Kentucky law enforcement agencies. He added that he had been working with legislative liaisons for DHS and ICE on the legislation and it was “one of their top priorities.” 
Committee co-chair Rep. Patrick Flannery, R-Olive Hill, emphasized that he viewed the agreements as “an opportunity to potentially utilize resources from the federal government to implement those into our local communities that we serve.” 
Democratic lawmakers took issue with the proposal. Rep. Sarah Stalker, of Louisville, said she had “a lot of concern” about deputizing officers for a new jurisdiction, particularly when news reports across the country have highlighted what many see as cruelty and abuse during arrests and mass raids. 
“I feel like this would simply exacerbate an issue that is already on its own out of control,” Stalker said. 
Before the meeting, advocacy group Kentucky Citizens for Democracy expressed concerns about Roberts’ proposal and encouraged lawmakers to reject the legislation. 
“This proposal, which strips local governments of the ability to decide their own level of cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, is fundamentally unacceptable,” the group said in a statement. “Our cities and counties know their communities best. Forcing them into mandatory cooperation with ICE, given its long history of egregious and cruel actions, violence, and overly aggressive tactics, will deepen fear, break trust, and push our immigrant neighbors further into the shadows.”

“I want to state clearly the way our AML (anti-money laundering) program operated in this instance was unacceptable,” Caesars Entertainment Chairman of the Board Gary Carano told the commission. 
“We never sacrifice compliance for revenue,” Caesars CEO Tom Reeg said. “There is no customer that’s worth illegitimate profits. We didn’t catch Boyer and we should have. Full stop.”
The $7.8 million is three times the amount that Bowyer lost gambling at Caesars. 
“So any notion or concern that Caesars will somehow benefit net of a fine amount is absolutely not the case,” said Michael Somps of the Nevada Attorney General’s office. “They are paying three times more than they won over the period.”
Bowyer, an associate, and illegal bookie Damien LeForbes, lost just under $24 million at Resorts World Las Vegas, which paid a $10.5 million fine for allowing them to gamble, leaving the casino with close to $14 million in net profit, and rendering the sanction little more than the cost of doing business. 
Bowyer is currently serving a 12-month sentence for bookmaking and money laundering. LeForbes is awaiting sentencing on the same charges.
“You had an AML officer who was a senior vice president,” Commissioner Rosa Solis-Rainey said to Caesars Palace executives. “The fact that this gentleman was a bookie was brought to his attention in 2019, so that is six years before he was banned by the property.” 
Only Solis-Rainey declined to support the stipulated fine, which she said should be higher, given what she deemed to be more egregious violations by Caesars than MGM Grand. That resort paid an $8.5 million fine for allowing another bookie, Wayne Nix, to pay gambling debts with a large amount of cash. 
Scott Sibella, president of MGM at the time, lost his gaming license for failing to file an anti-money laundering (AML) report for the transaction, and entered a plea deal in federal court for the same infraction.  
On Thursday, Solis-Rainey and Commissioner Brian Krolicki conflated Bowyer and Nix, holding Bowyer solely responsible for a series of high-profile AML violations adjudicated by regulators this year. 
MGM, Solis-Rainey, had “all of the steps in place years before Bowyer infiltrated their system, and that was done through the help of a third party internally that chose to make unilateral decisions, to not follow the program,” she said, referring to Sibella and confusing Bowyer with Nix. “He (Sibella) was as much a bad actor as Bowyer.” 
Krolicki also erroneously attempted to lay all of the Strip’s money laundering sanctions this year at Bowyer’s feet. 
“This AML wrecking ball by the name of Mathew Boyer continues to wreak havoc on compliance plans down the street,” he said. ”I’m as livid today as I was during the first case. …It’s almost numbing that we continue to have this conversation, particularly because of the acts of one individual.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-10-1024x576.png,,,2025-11-20 17:57:52.707512

(Patrick Lohmann / Source New Mexico)New Mexico’s Superintendent of Insurance said Thursday she hopes the Legislature will continue its support of a $10 million wildfire mitigation program for homes at extremely high wildfire risk, a program she said is becoming a national model to address rising homeowners’ insurance rates and cancellations.
The Legislature gave $10 million to the Office of the Superintendent of Insurance during the session in January for grants to homeowners who live in increasingly wildfire-prone areas. The grants help owners who have “Fair Access to Insurance Requirements” plans, or FAIR plans, pay for wildfire mitigation measures.
The state’s FAIR plan increasingly provides the only option for homeowners in wildfire-prone areas. Known as the “insurer of last resort,” the plans only become available to home and property owners if they’ve been denied coverage in the private market. 
Lawmakers approved the $10 million in grants this year to help FAIR plan recipients avoid losing their homes to wildfire, but the funding expires June 30, according to the state budget. 
NM GOP and Democrats say state needs to fix home insurance, as disasters upend private market

Insurance Superintendent Alice Kane told the Legislative Finance Committee on Thursday that she is asking the Legislature to re-authorize and extend the funding, because the program shows promise and could become a national model with more time. She also said the program ranks as the largest of its kind in terms of the amount of financial support available.
“We think the whole country is looking at us as being a leader in this wildfire mitigation program,” she said. 
As of Thursday, she said 28 Otero County homeowners with the FAIR Plan were slated to receive $7,000 grants from the fund as part of a “pilot program” to fire-proof their roofs in line with the highest standards of the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety, a nonprofit research and testing organization that seeks to reduce property damage from natural disasters.
Kane said she hopes those roofs will all be completed by spring, and then the office will have tested a grant program that could benefit as many as 1,400 FAIR plan holders. 
“We’re hoping that the pilot program will be not just operational, but done by the first quarter this year, so we can show the Legislature that the money is being used,” she said.
Across the state, homeowner and other property insurance premiums have sharply increased, and insurers have refused to renew or even canceled policies in some areas, particularly the burn scars of the recent South Fork, Salt and Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon fires.
In the private market, New Mexico’s 10 biggest insurers have increased premiums on average 50% to 60% since 2022, the chief OSI actuary has said. 
The mitigation program is just one of several big changes to the FAIR plan in 2025. During the session, the OSI approved increasing the plan’s coverage from $350,000 to $750,000. And in October, the office announced that an increase in commercial coverage limits, as well, from $1 million to $2 million. 
In October, about 7,200 residents were in the FAIR plan statewide, including 280 businesses, according to the news release.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMG_0116-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-20 17:57:52.707512

The state’s third major political party, the Vermont Progressive Party, voted in an almost entirely new bench of statewide leaders at its biennial convention earlier this month.
Among them is a new party chair: Bill Hunsinger of Ripton, who serves as one of two Progressive-endorsed members of that Addison County town’s selectboard. He is the party’s first new chair in close to a decade. Anthony Pollina, a longtime state senator from Middlesex, stepped down this month from the job, which he had held since 2017.
The Progs also elected Cindy Weed, a former state representative from Enosburgh, as vice chair, along with a slate of other officials who oversee the party’s finances and direct its electoral strategy. Ahead of the convention, the party also hired a new executive director: Heather Thomas. Josh Wronski, the party’s former director, left the job in July after nine years.
In all, just four members of the party’s 17-person leadership committee are returning to their posts after the party’s convention, held Nov. 9 at the Old Labor Hall in Barre. A press release called the changes “a new era for the Vermont Progressive Party.”

Hunsinger said he wants that new era to include a stronger party presence at the most local levels of government. That means giving more candidates for selectboard and school board races a Progressive Party endorsement, he said in an interview, even though few of those seats, anywhere in the state, are filled in party-based elections. 
In Burlington — where candidates for city office do run under a party label — Progs control the mayor’s office and have a slim minority of five of 12 seats on the City Council. 
According to the party’s website, there are also Prog-backed officials in nonpartisan selectboard seats in Ripton, Brattleboro and Dummerston, as well as in nonpartisan school board seats in Burlington and the Windham Southeast Supervisory Union.
“We’re not trying to make these races partisan,” Hunsinger said Wednesday. “Just, you know — there are Progressives. We’re here. We’re reducing speed limits, and helping organize food drives and clothing drives. It’s that sort of a mentality.”
At the state level, there are three members of the Vermont House and one state senator who primarily identify with the party’s label. A number of other members of both chambers, and State Auditor Doug Hoffer, identify as Democrat/Progressives. The party often caucuses with Democrats and its platform aligns with Democrats on many issues.
However, the Progressive caucus disagreed with many Democrats, who control both chambers of the Legislature, on this year’s marquee legislation — Act 73. That’s the law that lays out sweeping changes to how Vermont’s schools are funded and governed. To be sure, Republican Gov. Phil Scott had also insisted legislators advance the law in a form he was amenable to.
Hunsinger said he wants Progs to continue taking a stand against Act 73 in the upcoming legislative session, which starts in early January. Burlington Rep. Kate Logan, the House Progressive leader, agreed in an interview Thursday that would be a priority for her caucus next year.
At its recent convention, the Progs passed a resolution “to petition the VT Legislature to rescind Act 73, and instead explore options to make the education portion of the Property Tax more fair and equitable in order to ensure that every owner of property in Vermont is contributing proportionally to funding Vermont Schools,” the party’s release said.
Hunsinger described his opposition to the education reform plan, which seeks to consolidate the state’s 119 school districts, as a desire to preserve local control. He charged that the Legislature has been making “broad, almost power-grabby decisions.”
“Our party is going to keep fighting for making sure that our schools are kept in our communities — and our communities are given autonomy over their own schools,” he said.
The party also passed two resolutions at its convention this month focused on major national issues. The party does not run candidates for federal offices, though it counts Vermont’s independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders among its ranks.
One of those measures “condemns the apartheid and ethnic cleansing by the Israeli State” against people in Gaza and calls for an immediate end to all U.S. government funding for the Israeli military, according to the press release. It also states “that Israeli settlers in the West Bank be expelled and the land returned to Palestinians.”
Sanders has been among the most vocal critics of the Israeli government in the U.S. Senate and, along with the other two members of Vermont’s congressional delegation, has called the country’s military campaign in Gaza a “genocide.”
Another resolution “recognizes the critical need for public resistance to and non-compliance with unlawful and unconstitutional actions” by President Donald Trump’s administration.
Hunsinger said he hopes the party can be a home for Democrats who feel that their party, at the national level, isn’t doing enough to resist Trump’s many controversial actions over the first year of his second term.
“The Vermont Progressive Party endorses all facets of resistance, including political action, protests, strikes, boycotts and other acts of non-compliance,” the resolution states, per the release. “We will work in every capacity afforded to us.”

The summit “is a way to coalesce in our movement of resistance against authoritarianism, oligarchy and oppression,” said Big Hartman, Human Rights Commission general counsel and executive director.

This story by Maryellen Apelquist was first published in The Herald on Nov. 20, 2025
Human rights concerns and calls to action spanned a sweeping summit of the same name last weekend in Randolph Center, as advocates from across the state gathered to call out inequity and mistreatment, in areas from housing to policing, with an eye toward pushing Vermonters to continue to effect change.
The state Human Rights Commission hosted the three-day event, the first of its kind, largely in response to federal actions over the last several months.
“The idea for this conference really hit me like a bolt of lightning during one of many sleepless nights where my mind could not rest amidst the horror of what is happening at the national and global level,” said Big Hartman, HRC general counsel and executive director, in their opening remarks to a few dozen community members who turned out to Vermont State University’s Judd Hall on Nov. 14. At least twice that number tuned in online.
The summit “is a way to coalesce in our movement of resistance against authoritarianism, oligarchy and oppression,” said Hartman. “To strategize for solutions to the civil rights crisis that is upon us. We are not here to complain and commiserate about the Trump administration’s horrendous policies and actions, although of course a little of that is bound to happen.”
In the spirit of boosting spirits and strengthening participants’ resolve in working toward justice, the summit began by celebrating Vermont’s human rights wins over the years, such as its leadership in marriage rights for same-sex couples, gender identity non-discrimination, expansion of protections against harassment and access to housing.
José Ignacio De La Cruz of Migrant Justice spoke of his personal experiences with discrimination in Vermont that led to his and others’ advocacy work. That work resulted in a recently enacted Vermont law that expressly prohibits discrimination against immigrants in housing and in places of public accommodation, based on their citizenship or immigration status. Specifically, the new law requires landlords to accept an original or copy of an unexpired government-issued ID, an individual tax identification number or a Social Security number.
Before the law was passed, De La Cruz said, immigrants often faced discrimination because they did not have a Social Security number. He also pointed to other acts of discrimination, particularly as he and other community members in recent years began seeking employment, and subsequently housing, in areas outside of dairy farming where housing was included as a condition of employment.
For example, “when workers were leaving farms to work on sawmills or with some construction subcontractors,” they were assured there would be housing, but ultimately would find untenable conditions — such as four workers being charged $500 each to share a single bedroom, or, in the case of De La Cruz’s family member, who belongs to a queer community, being told: “You can’t have visitors at home because I don’t want the house to fill up with people like you.”
Other key voices throughout the weekend came from those who, like De La Cruz, shared their lived experience. Among them were Mohsen Mahdawi, a legal U.S. resident and Palestinian activist who last April was taken away by masked federal agents after his naturalization appointment in Colchester. During a session on Saturday, Mahdawi and one of his attorneys, Monica Allard of the American Civil Liberties Union of Vermont, spoke of his experience.
“After 16 days in a Vermont prison, a judge ordered Mohsen to be released, allowing him to return to his communities, his studies, and his advocacy,” Allard said. “But this legal battle is not over, and the [federal] government was in court just weeks ago arguing again that it has the authority to lock Mohsen back up.”
For his part, Mahdawi, who grew up in a refugee camp in the West Bank, spoke poetically of his community of Vermonters “being as sweet as the maple syrup that we get from the maple trees,” and as connected in protecting each other. A stark contrast from life in the camp, he said, where “as a child … I never felt safe.”
He also spoke of Vermont being a place in the United States where civil rights and the constitution are protected. “Democracy and human rights are aligned,” he said, and noted that what we are seeing now are “very chilling” attacks on free speech. Mahdawi contemplated what the “future could look like for humanity” if Project 2025 — a political blueprint aimed at reshaping government in line with far-right policies — is successful.
“If they succeed in orchestrating it, and demolishing and destroying human rights here in this country, silencing people, punishing people for their speech, they will be able to do it on a much larger level,” on an international level, given the influence of the United States.
A discussion about policing
José Ignacio De La Cruz also participated in a panel centered on fair and impartial policing in Vermont, a session that frequently turned to the presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the state, as well as the role of law enforcement as communities struggle to respond to mental health crises.
Among the other panelists were Vermont State Police Sgt. Daniel F. Bennett, a senior drill instructor who also serves as co-director of the Fair and Impartial Policing Committee; Lisa Ryan, community inclusion director with the Vermont Criminal Justice Council and Vermont Police Academy; and Tabitha-Ann J. Moore, an equity strategist and consultant who works with law enforcement and communities. Moore is also the founding president of the Rutland-area NAACP.
Again the topic was personal for De La Cruz, who last June, with his stepdaughter, was detained by U.S. Border Patrol while delivering food to a farm. They were held for weeks before being released following a public campaign.
He spoke of the migrant community’s fight for access to driver’s licenses years ago, but how once they had them, and were on the roads, they would get pulled over by police and end up getting turned over to Border Patrol. “Because of all the work over the past decade, I can say now that really we have changed those practices and that we’re not seeing that form of collaboration” between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities, he said.
On what it means to be a leader in fair and impartial policing, Bennett noted that VSP has long been forward-thinking. “It’s an important distinction that Vermont State Police began this [work and have taken] it seriously, prior to all the attention and the focus on this,” the sergeant said. “We’re doing a lot of cooperation with a lot of different organizational communities.”
Ryan, the VCJC community inclusion director said that Vermont is a national leader “because we walk the walk at the top, right? We are doing and acting in what we’re saying we’re gonna do. … We have a great system of community policing in the state, people getting to know their neighbors. So I think being a small state and building those relationships between law enforcement, communities, and the different agencies that law enforcement represents is so important.”
Still, the panelists addressed instances where actions on the ground do not align with policies. De La Cruz referred to instances where Border Patrol has been called on the pretext of law enforcement needing help translating from Spanish to English. “At the end of the day, the result was that the person was being detained by immigration authorities. … These pretexts [are] put in place to try to avoid compliance with policy.”

(Getty Images)A Florida Bar complaint alleging defamation was filed Thursday against a Miami Beach City Commission candidate who had long-celebrated her father — a serial killer who inspired ‘Dexter’ executed by the state in 2012 — on social media.
The complaint by South Florida filmmaker Billy Corben alleges that Monique Pardo Pope, an attorney and commission hopeful, defamed him to the Miami New Times by falsely claiming — somewhat ironically — that Corben had previously lost a defamation case.
Pardo Pope is preparing for a run-off election for the seat on Dec. 9.
Her comment came after the Times asked her about a discovery Corben had made:
Pardo Pope’s father was a pro-Nazi, anti-Black serial killer executed in 2012 for murdering nine people in South Florida. Years after his execution, Pardo Pope called Manuel Pardo her “guiding light” on social media, promising Floridians that she planned to bring the “kind of leadership” she learned from her family to City Hall.
“Ms. Pardo Pope is certainly free to view her father as an angelic, heroic figure and she unquestionably has the right to criticize my reporting; however, she is not entitled to defame me, nor should she be allowed to ignore her professional obligations as a member of the Bar,” Corben wrote in his five-page complaint, rife with Eminem quotes and sardonic hits at the Bar for not disciplining other embattled attorneys.
“Moreover, as my reporting rightfully notes, if Ms. Pardo Pope intends to use her family history as the slightest basis for her candidacy, she should be candid with voters about the sins of her serial killer father and explain how she reconciles that history with her glowing statements about him,” he added.
Later, talking to the Phoenix, Corben stressed that his complaint is “not about the sins of the father, but about the lies of the daughter.”
What happened?
On Sep. 25, Corben, an avid critic of local Miami politics and founder of the BecauseMiami podcast, first reported that the Miami Beach candidate was related to Manuel Pardo, a fired Sweetwater police officer who dealt cocaine and systematically murdered both drug dealers and bystanders alike in the 1980s.
Pardo Pope was 4 years old when the crimes occurred.
When searching the Pardos’ Hialeah apartment, Corben said officers found a family dog named “Satan,” tattooed with a Swastika, Polaroid photos of Pardo’s victims, and a slew of anti-Black and anti-Jewish memorabilia. Pardo was executed via lethal injection after then-Gov. Rick Scott signed his death warrant in 2012.
Years after his execution, Pardo Pope offered adulation of her father on social media. He was her “guardian angel,” she wrote.
“Happiest of Birthdays to this little girl’s first true love — her Daddy. You would’ve been 59 years young today. Missing you each and everyday, mi papi bello….my guiding light in the sky, my eternal best friend,” she wrote, including a photo of him holding her as a baby.
She signed it off with his final words on the execution table, “Airborne forever, love your Michi girl.”
The Miami New Times quickly picked up Corben’s reporting, reaching out to Pardo Pope for comment (she did not immediately respond to the Phoenix’s request for comment). She told them that “Billy Corben has made a career of slinging mud, which has even resulted in losing a defamation case.”
Corben had not lost the defamation case. The case against his movie-making firm was dismissed, and Corben’s company instead filed an anti-SLAPP suit and was awarded more $180k. The law disfavors lawsuits found to infringe participation in public affairs.

They said the department’s approach and the decisions violate the Montana Constitution.
In a lawsuit filed Tuesday in Lewis and Clark County District Court, Bull Mountain Land Alliance and the Northern Plains Resource Council both say that vague rules or, in some cases, no rules allow department officials to modify mining plans constantly without any public notice, input and scrutiny. If the court found that to be the case, it would not only violate the Montana Constitution’s provisions guaranteeing the right-to-know and right to participate in government, but also run afoul of the environmental protections enshrined in the state’s document as well.
The state’s constitution says that residents must be provided the information about governmental plans, often described as “right to know.” That includes some residents and groups being notified when changes are proposed. Another section of the constitution says that residents have the right to participate or give input at the decision making process. However, the new lawsuit said that DEQ officials are making thousands of decisions without any public notice or chance to comment. Moreover, the suit alleges that DEQ officials have created a regulatory scheme that is vague and poorly defined so that it can essentially hide information from the public until after the action is completed. Montana’s Constitutional also requires a “clean and healthful” environment for current and future generations.
Officials with the DEQ did not respond to requests for comment as of publication.
  Major vs. minor decisions 

Part of the case turns on how the state’s DEQ, which has supervisory and regulatory power over mining operations in Montana, classifies decisions, either as major or minor. Major decisions are subject to public notice and input, whereas the state appears not to apply the same processes to actions it deems “minor.”
For example, ranchers, farmers and landowners near the Bull Mountain Mine, which is operated by Signal Peak Energy, say that the mine’s operations affect their springs, livestock wells and groundwater. However, they are often unaware of actions that are being taken by the company and approved by state DEQ regulators because they are considered minor revisions to the mine’s permit.
“(DEQ’s) regulations authorizing revisions to permits with no notice or opportunity to be heard are unlawful under Montana’s public participation statutes and infringe on fundamental constitutional rights by depriving plaintiffs and their members of adequate notice of permit revision applications, agency deliberations and any meaningful opportunity to examine documents or participate in decisions of significant interest to them and to the broader public,” the suit said.
The DEQ currently defines “major revisions” or actions as those which result in:


A significant change in the post mining drainage plan;
A change in the post mining land use;
A significant change in the bonding level within the permitted area; or
A change that may affect the reclaimability of an area or the hydrologic balance on or off the permitted area.

 
Major changes must be published in a newspaper for four consecutive weeks, with the last triggering a 30-day public comment period. The DEQ also has a list of five things it does if a major permit revision is complete, and that includes public notice of the action, where documents can be inspected, and that comments can be submitted formally or informally.
However, the suit points out: “There is no public process required or prescribed by law for the proposed permit revisions that DEQ considers to be ‘minor.’”
That alone, the lawsuit contends, is problematic because it appears to be at odds with the state’s Constitution.
  Hundreds of minor changes 

The conservation groups say during the life of the Bull Mountain mine permit, the DEQ has approved hundreds of permit revisions to it without “any public notice or process by classifying the revisions as ‘minor.’” Attorneys for the groups say in the past decade alone, they’ve tracked approximately 100 which have skirted a public review process.
Even with these small changes, the DEQ prepares an environmental assessment for the minor revisions, but those don’t get posted publicly and there is no public feedback mechanism, according to the lawsuit.
“Many of the revisions approved by DEQ for the Bull Mountains Mine permit with no public process have concerned modifications to surface water control plans, mitigation plans associated with springs and livestock wells, and the monitoring and quality assurance plan — all of which are incorporated into the permit — without any notice or any opportunity to comment by either the public at large or the landowners whose water resources are the subject of the minor permit revision,” the lawsuit said.
The lawsuit said that there’s no chance for the public to participate or even know about the revisions, one of the bedrock principles of Montana’s open records laws: That residents must be given a meaningful way to be notified and participate.
The lawsuit noted that even Rep. Gary W. Parry, a Republican lawmaker and advocate for coal mining from Colstrip, warned in 2023 that the policy was vague.
“The current definition (in Montana DEQ rules) for a ‘minor revision’ is, essentially, anything that isn’t a major revision,” Parry said on Nov. 22, 2023. “That kind of ambiguity sets the stage for uncertainty for our mining industry, and an open door for litigation against the state when the department exercises its discretion in applying this broad definition.”
  DEQ responses 

Both the Bull Mountains Land Alliance and the Northern Plains Resource Council contend in the lawsuit that they have “repeatedly raised concerns” about this policy, but have not had much feedback.
“DEQ has failed to respond meaningfully by to plaintiffs’ concerns,” it said.
Moreover, the vague approach to minor versus major changes are not backed up by other resources.
“DEQ has no publicly available guidance document, manual, policy or other written criteria governing how it determines whether a proposed revision is a major or minor,” the lawsuit said. “The vague and ambiguous regulator definitions of ‘major revision’ and ‘minor revision’ coupled with the absence of any public process for minor revisions has created a regulatory loophole that DEQ has exploited to approve hundreds of coal mine permit modifications without public oversight.”
The lawsuit claims that violations of state constitutional law require Judge Mike McMahon to apply strict scrutiny to the case, which means that the DEQ will have to show that its approach to permitting mines serves a beneficial public purpose and that it has done it in the least restrictive way.
The groups, represented by Barbara Chillcott, Melissa Hornbein, and Meridian Wappett of the Western Environmental Law Center in Helena, are asking for the court to rule the policies violate state law, and force the DEQ to provide public notice and afford the public the right to participate or comment on the process. The groups are also asking for the court to award it attorneys’ fees for vindicating constitutional rights, if they’re successful.
“By delegating to itself unfettered discretion to process permit revisions behind closed doors, DEQ violates our fundamental constitutional rights to know and participate in the operations of our government,” said Bull Mountains resident Pat Thiele, who is also a member of the Landowners Alliance. “This practice not only threatens our livelihoods here in the Bull Mountains, but erodes the rights of Montanans across our state.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG-4639-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-20 17:57:52.707512

A battery storage site proposed in Emmons County would store energy produced by an adjacent wind farm. (Photo by Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)Emmons County residents had mixed but mostly positive opinions Thursday about a project that would be North Dakota’s first-ever battery storage site.
NextEra, the company overseeing the project, is looking to build an estimated $181 million to $191 million Battery Energy Storage System project that would use massive batteries to harbor wind energy when it’s produced in excess — on days when wind harnessed by turbines exceed demand for electricity. Utility regulators will decide whether to give the proposal the final green light.
The batteries would be stored on 24 acres of an existing wind farm operated by NextEra. Storage sites are typically empty fields peppered with rows of massive, highly-secure battery units similar in size to shipping containers.
Similar projects have been popping up across the country as a way to smooth out grid congestion tied to energy sources variable generation. The technology receives production tax incentives from the federal government.
North Dakota utility regulators to consider state’s first-ever battery storage sites 

During a Public Service Commission hearing in Emmons County on Thursday, NextEra told utility regulators the storage site would have minimal adverse impacts on the area. Approximately two dozen people were in the audience. 
Michael Bettis, a fire safety engineer for NextEra, said the major potential safety threats when it comes to Battery Energy Storage Systems are called “thermal runaway events.”
Such events occur when a small portion of a battery unit fails and captures more heat than it can dissipate, Bettis said. Sometimes this occurs when water leaks into a unit; other times it’s caused by general internal system failure.
Thermal events can result in fire, but they begin by expelling hydrogen, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide into the atmosphere, according to Bettis. Part of the safety response plan involves training local firefighters to let a fire burn within the storage site area because it consumes the hydrogen and the carbon compounds. 
Bettis said of NextEra’s 50 battery storage sites in the United States, there have been few thermal runaway events — none of which resulted in environmental contamination.
He also pointed to the project application, which outlines the constant on-site monitoring and procedures in place if a thermal event were to occur. NextEra later told the commission it’s been in contact with local first responders to establish a safety plan. 
The company also vowed to craft a plan for decommissioning the batteries and to provide associated financial insurance. 
North Dakota coal industry prepares to seize opportunity for growth

Public Service Commission Chair Randy Christmann previously raised concerns about the site using batteries made in “adversarial” countries, like China. But NextEra told commissioners Thursday the company has since decided to use lithium-ion batteries sourced in the United States. 
NextEra Environmental Specialist Dustin Wernicke said further impacts to the environment, such as air, water, soil and noise pollution, are minimal. He also said the company has consulted with some tribal representatives about possible discovery of cultural resources during construction.   
Around 150 construction and one to three permanent jobs would be tied to the project, the company estimates, and the county is estimated to reel in $7.2 million in property taxes over its 25-year lifespan. 
After more than three hours of discussion with NextEra, commissioners heard testimony from a handful of area residents who had varying opinions on the project. 
Sen. Jeff Magrum, R-Hazelton, asked the commission to hold off on issuing a permit until the Legislature has time to design guardrails and a specified tax structure for the new technology.  Magrum’s district is in Emmons county. 
He said the Legislature was “left out” of the process, and too much responsibility was placed on the county during the outset.  
Pete Silbernagel, a former state lawmaker who owns a cabin near the proposed site, disagreed with Magrum’s idea of bringing the Legislature into the approval process and said the benefits to securing the grid outweigh the potential safety risks.
“You’re all well aware of the growing, increasing demand of electricity in this nation,” he said. “I really appreciate the fact that North Dakota has an all-of-the-above approach. I think this project can significantly help provide the energy that we’re going to need in the future.” 
North Dakota Transmission Authority Director Claire Vigesaa told the Monitor he supports the new technology and its ability to stabilize the grid, a sentiment shared by other residents as well as the Dakota Resource Council, an environmental advocacy group. 
“If executed in a manner that does not infringe on the rights and safety of the local community while bringing meaningful benefits to that community, this and future projects should be a good addition to the regional grid,” Mike Graalum of the Dakota Resource Council said in a statement. 
Emmons County has already approved the permits necessary to start construction. The project now awaits approval from the Public Service Commission.
According to Director of Utilities for the Public Service Commission Victor Schock, the decision will likely come in the next month or two, depending on how long it takes the company to provide information requested by the commission.  
If approved, construction is slated to begin May 2026 and be completed by December that year. 
NextEra is proposing a similar battery storage project on the other side of the state, in Burke County. The hearing for that project is scheduled for 10 a.m. Dec. 19 at the Bowbells Memorial City Hall.

There was no coherent roadmap, no shared strategy, and certainly nothing resembling a statewide plan.","WHEN I LAID OUT my concerns in advance of last week’s annual hearings on cost trends held by the state Health Policy Commission, I suspected many across our health care ecosystem shared them. The hearings confirmed that. 
Speaker after speaker voiced anxiety about the same issues: the harmful impact of Trump administration policy changes combined with passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act; the growing affordability pressures facing families, employers, and state government; the likelihood of increases in both the uninsured and underinsured; the return of double-digit premium hikes; and the precarious financial position of many hospitals, community health centers, and nonprofit insurers. 
My hope then—and still—is that we not only sound the alarm on the dire state of things, but can begin to collectively chart a course of action that lays out a plan for what to do about it all. But anyone listening last week for a clear sense of direction would have been disappointed. While there was general consensus at the hearing that it can’t be business as usual, the ideas offered up for what to do about it were piecemeal. There was no coherent roadmap, no shared strategy, and certainly nothing resembling a statewide plan. 
The day opened with Attorney General Andrea Campbell, the lone elected official to speak. She noted the legal battles that her office is involved in with other state attorneys general, fighting against the Trump administration. She enumerated a series of conflicts: efforts to restrict immigrant rights, threats to universities’ federal research funding, actions designed to limit or eliminate access to gender-affirming care, and the battles to continue SNAP benefits during the shutdown. 
Her message was energetic, forceful, and morally clear. But like most presenters that day, despite expressing deep worry about health care affordability, she did not offer concrete solutions.  
What she did offer, though, in a positive note of encouragement about our collective strength and resilience, was an unexpected reference to Muhammad Ali—praising him as someone who consistently punched above his weight, just as Massachusetts has tried to do in health policy and other areas.  As an Ali enthusiast since childhood, that comment caught my attention. So let’s consider the rest of what unfolded at the hearing through the lens of some of The Greatest’s more memorable lines. 
“Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.” 
This year marked the first time pharmaceutical companies and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) were required to submit written testimony and for a select group to answer questions from Health Policy Commission members. A senior executive from Eli Lilly and a vice president from Optum took the hot seat. 
Pharma companies and PBMs often glide through policy discussions with a polished narrative. Pharma emphasizes innovation, miracle drugs, and breakthroughs. PBMs describe themselves as indispensable negotiators, creating savings for employers and consumers. Their public personas “float” lightly above the messy realities of pricing, profit margins, and opaque contracting. But history reminds us that these companies can sting hard. Whether through monopoly pricing, strategic patent games, or non-transparent rebates and fees that warp incentives, both industries have figured out how to extract tremendous profits from a system they claim to be helping. 
Consider Lilly. Their representative highlighted the company’s new oral GLP-1 weight loss drug, recently approved by the FDA, which will be priced around $150 per month—dramatically less than the current injectable versions costing thousands per month. He clearly hoped for praise. What he did not highlight was that this accelerated approval came after the company struck a deal with the Trump administration involving tariff relief and expedited FDA review for this drug — likely leading to a 2026 launch date.  
Optum’s witness spoke earnestly about negotiating lower prices for certain brand-name drugs, but carefully sidestepped questions about rebate transparency. She showed no interest in discussing how PBM practices contribute to inflated list prices designed to accommodate the rebates PBMs demand. Nor did she acknowledge the well-documented steering of patients to PBM-owned pharmacies, often at the expense of independent community pharmacies.  
“Don’t count the days, make the days count.” 
The day’s standout voice belonged to Michael Levine, director of the state’s Medicaid program, MassHealth. His presentation was a refreshing blend of candor and practicality. Levine described the central challenge ahead: navigating the implementation of new work requirements and administrative hurdles created by the sweeping bill passed this summer, dubbed by Trump the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. These changes threaten to push eligible residents off the Medicaid rolls not because they fail eligibility tests, but often because they cannot easily show that they are exempt from work requirements or meet other paperwork demands. 
Levine outlined two major strategies to prevent unnecessary loss of coverage. First, the state will maximize auto-renewals, drawing on an array of state data sources to verify eligibility without requiring beneficiaries to submit new paperwork. Second, the administration plans to again partner with Health Care For All, replicating their 2023 outreach initiative to help residents complete required documentation.  
His message was clear: The period between now and January 1, 2027—the date when new rules take full effect—must be used to protect as many eligible people as possible. Levine embodied Ali’s dictum about making each day matter. 
“He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life.” 
The final panel of the day surfaced the boldest ideas—though none yet sufficiently developed, let alone agreed upon. Still, the willingness to imagine some new affordability-promoting ideas was notable. 
Manny Lopes, CEO of Fallon Health, reminded the audience of the long-running success of the state’s program for frail, community-based elders who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. For roughly 25 years, this model—built on comprehensive care, integration of medical and social services, and a predictable per-member fee—has succeeded in improving health outcomes while reducing nursing home use. Lopes argued that a broader move toward such a system of total capitation could be an innovative path toward restraining spending growth and improving care coordination statewide. 
Doug Howgate of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation floated a more budget-focused concept: creating a hard spending cap for Medicaid and then redesigning payment arrangements beneath that cap to cover as many people as possible. 
Kevin Tabb, CEO of Beth Israel Lahey Health, spoke about the need to “rationalize” care across the state—implying that Massachusetts may need to close low volume health facilities,  and less duplication of certain services.   He implied that there is no ‘free lunch’: if the state wants to reduce overall health care spending it will have consequences for the care delivery system and patient access. 
Blue Cross CEO Sarah Iselin pushed for making the state’s total per capita cost growth benchmark a firm, enforceable number for the total growth of health care spending—rather than only a guiding target.  Right now there is really only a weak performance improvement process (PIP)  that can be applied to a provider whose measured revenue growth per person is above the benchmark—currently at 3.6 percent. 
In recent years, there has been little fear of any meaningful consequence for exceeding the benchmark growth rate—something that Iselin wants to change. She called for a benchmark accountability process with “real teeth and consequences” — presumably one that could even demand that monies be clawed back from market participants whose per capita revenue growth is above the benchmark. She even raised the possibility of exploring global hospital budgets—a payment model used in Maryland—if Massachusetts wants to genuinely restrain hospital spending growth. 
“A man who views the world at 50 the same as he did at 20 has wasted 30 years of his life.” 
As the day closed, members of the commission each offered brief reflections. What united them was a recognition that the system cannot continue functioning under the assumptions of 2012, when the last major health care cost law was enacted. There was a shared sense of urgency that Massachusetts needs a more comprehensive, coherent approach to achieving better health care affordability—one capable of maintaining access while reining in costs. 
Ali could afford to wait out his opponents, leaning against the ropes, conserving energy, and striking when the moment was right. For Massachusetts health care, time is not our ally. 
The problems are accelerating faster than our solutions. The Legislature needs to recognize the urgency of the moment and that now is the time to come off the ropes and engage with purpose to stop the unchecked affordability challenges facing us all.

(Photo courtesy of Crossroads Rhode Island)The state’s housing leaders and homeless care providers are raising the alarm over a new Trump administration directive they say could put over 1,000 formerly unhoused Rhode Islanders back out on the street.
That estimate represents two-thirds of the 1,500 Rhode Islanders now living in what is known as permanent supportive housing — or housing units that provide a subsidized, stable residence for formerly homeless people, often those who have experienced mental illness or spent years on the streets. 
Permanent supportive housing is a cornerstone of the “Housing First” model, which prioritizes providing immediate housing without preconditions, such as sobriety or treatment programs, to stabilize lives of residents.
But on Nov. 13, the same day the federal government reopened, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced a policy change to redirect the majority of its $3.9 billion Continuum of Care funding from permanent supportive housing to transitional housing with work requirements. HUD’s new policy — it aligns with President Donald Trump’s July 24 Executive Order titled “Ending Crime and Disorder on America’s Streets” — also attacks diversity and inclusion efforts, support of transgender clients and use of “harm reduction” strategies that seek to reduce overdose deaths by helping people in active addiction use drugs more safely.
“Unfortunately, we had some warning this was the direction they were going in, but you try not to believe it until it’s real,” Crossroads Rhode Island CEO Michelle Wilcox said in an interview Thursday. “Now it’s real.”
Wilcox, who leads the state’s largest provider of housing and homeless services, fears that HUD’s changes could mean 14 residents would no longer live at the Harold Lewis House managed by Crossroads. Opened in 2006, the 14-unit building in West Warwick houses formerly homeless people ages 50 and up who have mental health issues or have been unhoused for years — with preference given to veterans.
“We’re serving high needs folks,” Wilcox said. “It’s a really great community for folks where they can have privacy and dignity.”
Wilcox will join other housing leaders outside the Harold Lewis House on Providence Street at 10:30 a.m. Friday to call more attention to the impact the cuts will have on the populations their organizations serve.
HUD has framed the policy change as a way to promote “self-sufficiency among vulnerable Americans.”
“Our philosophy for addressing the homelessness crisis will now define success not by dollars spent or housing units filled, but by how many people achieve long-term self-sufficiency and recovery,” HUD Secretary Scott Turner said in a Nov. 13 statement. “We are stopping the Biden-era slush fund that fueled the homelessness crisis, shut out faith-based providers simply because of their values, and incentivized never-ending government dependency.”
A HUD spokesperson did not immediately respond to request for comment Thursday.
Organizations that don’t rely on federal Continuum of Care grants could end up seeing fewer places to direct Rhode Island’s unhoused population if the state loses permanent housing options.
“The goal that we’ve all been working so hard together on across the state seems like it will come to an end,” said Nick Horton, co-executive director of OpenDoors, a Providence nonprofit that helps formerly incarcerated people, those struggling with addiction and other unhoused people. “This just seems like it’s destroying one of the only resources that we have to help people out of homelessness.”
A 30% cap on permanent housing spending
Rhode Island last year received over $9 million in HUD grants toward permanent supportive housing. HUD’s latest Notice of Funding Opportunity for continuum of care grants is open though Jan. 14, 2026.
Grant awards are expected to be made May 1, according to the funding notice issued Nov. 13. The funding notice limits how much Continuum of Care funding communities can spend on permanent housing to 30%. The National Alliance to End Homelessness has warned that cap will force communities and organizations to reallocate funds from permanent housing programs to less effective programs.
Based on that math, Wilcox said an estimated 1,020 of the roughly 1,500 Rhode Islanders in federally-funded permanent supportive housing could be out on the street. 
But Brenda Clement, director of housing policy research group HousingWorks RI, said she’s hopeful that drastic scenario can be avoided as the state’s own Continuum of Care board crafts its request for proposals for providers
“We’re hoping to be able to craft things so that we can continue to meet the requirements of the new restrictions,” Clement, who serves on the Continuum of Care’s Finance Committee, said. “The last outcome that anyone wants is to see more people on the street.”
Still, Clement said her preference is that the federal government stick to the “Housing First” model adopted in the 1990s.
“It helps people get into recovery, it helps people get into a better economic situation,” Clement said. “But for whatever reason, this administration does not share this philosophy.”

,DC,2025-11-20 22:00:27+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Top ICE official elaborates on plan to send Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Liberia,"Ariana Figueroa, William J. Ford",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/top-ice-official-elaborates-plan-send-kilmar-abrego-garcia-liberia,,"GREENBELT, Md. — U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials detailed to a federal judge Thursday plans for the Trump administration to again remove the wrongly deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, this time to the West African country of Liberia.U.S. District of Maryland Judge Paula Xinis is considering whether to lift her order that barred Abrego Garcia, a longtime Maryland resident, from being removed from the United States. The case and its months of wrangling in courts in two states has generated huge publicity, both in Maryland and nationally, and has brought attention to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.Separately, as the Trump administration tries to deport Abrego Garcia, the Justice Department is moving forward with criminal charges against him of human trafficking in Tennessee.Xinis specially requested the Trump administration provide John Cantú to testify because he is a top official at ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations and previously submitted a declaration to the court regarding the State Department’s deliberation with Costa Rica’s government about accepting Abrego Garcia as a refugee. Abrego Garcia, whose deportation due to an “administrative error” cast a spotlight on President Donald Trump’s aggressive immigration crackdown, is challenging his detention on the grounds that the Trump administration is using his imprisonment as punishment rather than for the purpose of removal. He is currently detained at an ICE facility in Pennsylvania.Abrego Garcia has agreed to be removed to Costa Rica, but the Trump administration last month argued before Xinis to allow him to be removed to Liberia. In August, Costa Rica’s government stated it would accept him as a refugee. As he challenges his removal to any country other than Costa Rica, Abrego Garcia has also pleaded not guilty to the criminal case in Nashville, which accuses him of the human trafficking of immigrants in an incident stemming from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee. Rally outsideSimilar to previous hearings at the Greenbelt courthouse, the immigrant advocacy group CASA led a rally in support of Abrego Garcia. The event included a singing group called the Rapid Response Choir.George Escobar, who will become CASA’s new executive director on Jan. 1, said it’s important for people to stand up against a “corrupt government” that seeks to take away immigrant rights, especially as the Trump administration tries to ship Abrego Garcia to various third countries.“We want to make sure that we stand here united. We want to make sure that Kilmar (and) his family understands that we are by his side,” Escobar said. “We will not let this go silently into the night.”

Maryland Del. Gabriel Acevero, a Montgomery County Democrat who’s from Trinidad and Tobago, and who has a family background in Venezuela, said his state colleagues will be working on legislation to improve immigrant rights, such as ending the 287(g) program in the state.Currently, about eight local enforcement agencies in the state have agreements with ICE that delegate certain immigration enforcement abilities to local police. But Acevero’s colleague, Del. Nicole Williams, a Prince George’s County Democrat, plans to reintroduce legislation to terminate all ICE agreements. Law enforcement agencies would have a year to do so.After the rally ended, CASA leaders handed out green postcards for participants to write down words of support for Abrego Garcia.Jacki Gilbert of Baltimore wrote on her postcard: “Dear Kilmar, We stand with you and your family. You are both a friend and a neighbor.”“This impacts my community. My culture in Baltimore City. My economy there. You got to stand with your friends and neighbors. Respect them,” Gilbert said as she choked up and shed a tear.

Abrego Garcia has deportation protections that should have prevented his deportation to his home country of El Salvador, but earlier this year he was still removed to a brutal Salvadoran prison. Because of those protections granted by an immigration judge in 2019, the Trump administration must find a third country that is willing to accept Abrego Garcia and a country where he believes he will not face harm or persecution. The Trump administration so far has floated sending him to Liberia as well as one of three other nations in Africa — Ghana, Eswatini and Uganda.Worries about return to El SalvadorAbrego Garcia’s lawyers have raised concerns that if he is sent to a third country, that country will then send him back to El Salvador. Cantú said that the government of Liberia has given the State Department assurance that Abrego Garcia will not face torture, persecution, and will not be sent back to El Salvador. The assurances from Costa Rica’s government accepting Abrego Garcia were “nonbinding,” Cantú said. The State Department informed him that Abrego Garcia’s removal to Costa Rica is “not an option at the moment,” he said.Cantú was pressed by one of Abrego Garcia’s attorney’s, Sascha Rand, about communications with the State Department and Costa Rica regarding Abrego Garcia.  Cantú said he had a five-minute virtual meeting with an attorney from the State Department, during which he was given a statement that Costa Rica was no longer an option for Abrego Garcia. But he could not give the judge any additional information on further communications between the State Department and Costa Rica’s government since August.“This witness has zero information about the content of the (Costa Rica) declaration,” Xinis said. “No shade on you, Mr. Cantú, you’ve been very candid with the court. The point has been made.”Rand pointed to how the assurance from Costa Rica granted Abrego Garcia refugee status and citizenship, and he asked if Liberia made those same assurances. Cantú said he did not recall. Rand asked Cantú if in his career at the Department of Homeland Security, which dates to 1997, if he has had any experience of removing someone from Latin America to Africa. Cantú said he has in the past six months under the Trump administration. Rand asked about any scenarios prior to that time.“I cannot recall,” Cantú said.Rand said that Abrego Garcia has “no objection to him being removed to Costa Rica.” He argued that the Trump administration, and its witness, have not proved that Abrego Garcia cannot be removed to Costa Rica. Order of removalAbrego Garcia’s attorneys also requested that DOJ provide the order of removal for Abrego Garcia. Cantú said he had not seen such a document.“If there is no order for removal, then there is no basis for detention,” said Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, another attorney for Abrego Garcia, who specializes in immigration law. DOJ attorney Drew Ensign said he does “believe there is a final order of removal.”Xinis rejected that, because no document was provided to her and the document Ensign produced for her only mentioned that Abrego Garcia’s 2019 asylum claim was rejected.“I am just interested in finding the order of removal,” she said. Ensign argued that because Abrego Garcia has a withholding of removal, meaning he cannot be removed back to his home country of El Salvador, that should be treated as a final order of removal. Ensign added that it’s odd that Abrego Garcia would agree to be removed to Costa Rica if he didn’t believe there was a final order of removal.“No, it’s not,” Xinis said. “It’s a concession because he's been to CECOT and back.”While at the notorious mega-prison known as CECOT, Abrego Garcia detailed how he was psychologically and physically tortured by Salvadoran officials. Abrego Garcia tried to make another application for asylum, after he was brought back to the U.S. this summer, but an immigration judge denied it. He has appealed the decision.

The case before Xinis is a habeas petition, which is how immigrants challenge their detention. Immigrants cannot be held longer for six months in detention if the federal government is not actively making efforts to remove them, a precedent set by the Supreme Court. Xinis pressed Ensign about why the “government (is) standing in the way” of allowing Abrego Garcia to be removed to Costa Rica. “It’s so odd and that’s me being really polite,” Xinis said, adding that “there is no evidence that Costa Rica is withholding their prior” stance to accept Abrego Garcia.  Xinis said Thursday would be the last hearing before she makes her decision. She said she will first decide Abrego Garcia’s habeas petition and then address the injunction that bars his removal from the U.S.“It’s not going to be a quick decision,” Xinis said. “These are weighty issues.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-11-20 17:57:52.707512

Bob Wilson, a member of the Howell Township Board of Trustees, confirmed with Michigan Advance on Thursday that Meta was pushing the project. But Wilson said he and members of the board have known about the development for months now. 
Messages seeking comment from Meta’s public affairs and press office were not returned at the time of publication.
In September, Wilson took to Facebook, ironically, to say that he was one of several people in the Howell area who took a bus to New Albany, Ohio, to tour the community, which has become a hotspot for data centers, the Livingston Post reported. 
Meta has a data center in New Albany, Ohio.
Wilson said then that he believed a Meta data center could possibly land at the facility when completed with a $9 billion investment. It was his estimation that the center, if approved, would take up at least 20% of the 1,000-acre space with the remaining space for the data center.
On Wednesday, the Livingston County Planning Commission heard from locals about a decision to rezone the farm land to build the data center. The commission ultimately rejected the project and recommended that the Howell Township Board of Trustees reject the project, as well.
It’s unclear if the township board has the votes to push it forward. The board meets Thursday evening to discuss the project and is expecting a large crowd. Some have called for a six-month moratorium so the community can draft ordinances related to the project. That moratorium will be before the board this evening.
MLive also reported Thursday that Wilson confirmed Meta was behind the project. The publication also noted that the data center investment was likely $1 billion, as opposed to the $9 billion reported by the Livingston Post. Wilson further told MLive that he met with a Meta “land crew” both in person and over a Zoom call, and that they didn’t hide the ball that they worked for Meta.

In an interview with the Advance, that it was possible that the developer on the project would build the center and then sell it to a third-party, like Meta or others exploring AI, much like Google. He did say, however, that it was his understanding that Meta builds its own projects and doesn’t usually play the middle man.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/558199098_25184650887794802_5733019724495903299_n-1-1024x1024.jpg,,,2025-11-20 17:57:52.707512

President Donald Trump has taken his most decisive step yet toward dismantling the Department of Education, a move that will have widespread ramifications for vulnerable students and has raised concerns among education leaders and lawmakers who contend that it will create chaos and confusion for families instead of giving them the help they actually need.
His administration announced on Tuesday that it will transfer core agency functions to four other federal offices — news met with fierce criticism by education advocates who questioned its legality and said it is an abandonment of the nation’s students.
“Donald Trump and his administration chose American Education Week, a time when our nation is celebrating students, public schools, and educators, to announce their illegal plan to further abandon students by dismantling the Department of Education,” said National Education Association (NEA) President Becky Pringle in a statement. “It’s cruel. It’s shameful. And our students deserve so much better.”
The Trump administration will reassign the department’s key programs involving K-12 education, higher education, Indian education and international studies through so-called interagency agreements with the departments of Labor, Interior, Health and Human Services and State.
The reorganization marks one of the most significant overhauls to the department since its establishment during former President Jimmy Carter’s administration in 1979. Only Congress can create a federal agency and has the sole authority to approve its restructuring or elimination.
The move to restructure the agency, Trump officials argue, will lead to more efficiency by reducing administrative burdens and making it easier to pursue objectives like aligning education with workforce readiness.
Vulnerable students stand to be uniquely affected by the reorganization with the shift of K-12 programs to the Department of Labor raising major concerns about the wellbeing of economically disadvantaged students. The Labor Department will manage programs such as Title I, which provides additional resources to K-12 schools serving such students. Labor will also administer postsecondary education grant programs authorized under the Higher Education Act with the goal of ending an estimated labor shortage of over 700,000 skilled jobs nationally.
“Moving Title I, the largest federal funding stream providing important resources to the schools serving the lowest-income students in America, to the Department of Labor makes no sense,” said Denise Forte, president and CEO of The Education Trust, a nonprofit that advocates for equity in the nation’s schools.
“The Trump administration began the process of selling off the Department of Education for parts,” Forte said in a statement. “Further diminishing these offices… and sending them off to be run by agencies that work on public health and short-term training, which lack the skills, expertise, or capacity in education, isn’t about improving student outcomes. It’s about implementing a business model that transforms students into widgets instead of human beings who need support.”
Leaders of the nation’s two largest teacher unions, the NEA and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), characterized the restructuring as a betrayal of students and families.
“This move is neither streamlining nor reform — it’s an abdication and abandonment of America’s future,” AFT President Randi Weingarten said in a statement. “Rather than show leadership in helping all students seize their potential, it walks away from that responsibility.”
Similarly, Weingarten pushed back against the idea that the restructuring was about efficiency.
“What’s happening now isn’t about slashing red tape,” she said. “If that were the goal, teachers could help them do it …Instead, spreading services across multiple departments will create more confusion, more mistakes and more barriers for people who are just trying to access the support they need.”
Other changes affect groups of students who have traditionally needed extra support: The Department of the Interior will be the primary administrator for Indian Education programs, functioning as the point of contact for tribes and students. The Department of Health and Human Services will manage a program for student-parents in college called Child Care Access Means Parents in School (CCAMPIS) and another related to foreign medical school accreditation standards. Finally, the Department of State will administer the Fulbright-Hays Program which awards grants to students, teachers, administrators and institutions.
It’s unclear how Native American students will fare with Indian Education programs moved to the Interior Department, an agency that manages natural resources and not the education of children. The future of the thousands of student-parents in college who rely on campus-based childcare grants is also uncertain, since moving the Child Care Access Means Parents in Schools program to the Health and Human Services Department could lead to disruptions in support for them that sidetrack their journey to a degree. Transferring responsibilities from the Department of Education to the Department of Labor undermines public education’s purpose, according to National Parents Union President Keri Rodrigues.
“At a time when the public demands transparency regarding the Epstein files, the Administration has instead launched a chaotic assault on education,” she said in a statement. “Families see this clearly: a political diversion, not a vision for better schools. Public education has never been about turning children into factory workers, it has always been about preparing creators, innovators, and dreamers who will shape the future of our nation.”
Democratic Sen. Patty Murray, who serves as vice chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, questioned the constitutionality of the interagency agreements.
“Donald Trump and Linda McMahon are lawlessly trying to fulfill Project 2025’s goal to abolish the Department of Education and pull the rug out from students in every part of the country,” stated the Washington lawmaker, a former preschool teacher.
Democratic Rep. Summer Lee, who serves on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the Committee on Education and Workforce, called the shakeup “a direct assault on the students, families, and educators who depend on its essential protections.”
In her statement, the Pennsylvania lawmaker emphasized that even the education secretary has acknowledged that only Congress has the authority to eliminate the department.
“Our children deserve better than political stunts that jeopardize their futures,” she said. “And let’s be clear: an uneducated electorate isn’t a by-product of authoritarianism — it’s a prerequisite for it. We will fight back.”
Critics of the department’s makeover also said they feared that its Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services would be the next to be reassigned to other federal agencies. The Trump administration has diminished their power and effectiveness through staff cuts and — in the case of OCR in particular — regional office closures that have led to civil rights cases not being investigated.
“Transferring OCR’s authority to another department that is ill-equipped to carry out its critical functions would all but guarantee that civil rights complaints will continue to be dismissed en masse without resolution,” Forte said. Such a development would disproportionately affect students of color, students with disabilities and English learners.
Education leaders, including the AFT, and lawmakers are already preparing to challenge the reorganization in court.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_2920-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-20 17:57:52.707512
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-20 21:57:57+00:00,CT Mirror,Lamont taps Jeffrey Beckham to become Superior Court judge,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/20/lamont-taps-jeffrey-beckham-to-become-superior-court-judge/,"Gov. Ned Lamont announced he will nominate his departing budget director, Jeffrey Beckham of Tolland, to become a CT Superior Court judge.","Gov. Ned Lamont announced Thursday he will nominate his departing budget director, Jeffrey Beckham of Tolland, to become a Connecticut Superior Court judge.
Lamont, who praised Beckham for restoring confidence to the Office of Policy and Management following a corruption scandal, said his outgoing director also played a crucial role over the past three-and-a-half years in the state government’s fiscal resurgence.
The governor also predicted Beckham’s successor, Joshua Wojcik, a key health policy leader in the comptroller’s office, would continue that fiscal progress while helping Connecticut safeguard its most vulnerable residents as federal funding for human service programs shrinks.
“Jeff took over during a time of some change at OPM. I want to tell you what an extraordinary secretary he has been,” Lamont said during a midafternoon press conference at the Capitol.
“And by the way, in case you’re wondering,” Lamont added, “he looks like a judge to me. I’m just saying.” 
The General Assembly is expected to consider that nomination during the regular 2026 session, which begins Feb. 4.
Beckham, who holds a bachelor’s degree in political science and a law degree from Florida State University, would not be the first state budget director elevated to a judgeship.
Norwalk Republican Robert Genuario, a former state senator, served as Rell’s budget director from 2005 through 2010 until she appointed him to the Connecticut Superior Court.
Beckham become OPM secretary in March 2022 following the resignation of Melissa McCaw, Lamont’s first budget chief, who left to become East Hartford’s financial director, Meanwhile, her deputy, Konstantinos Diamantis, had become embroiled in a scandal involving state construction funds that ultimately led a federal jury last month to convict him on 21 counts of bribery, extortion, conspiracy and lying to federal investigators.
He earned praise not just from Lamont for his handling of OPM, the state’s chief fiscal and policy planning agency, in the wake of that scandal.
“He restored confidence and became a measured, principled voice on fiscal matters within the governor’s administration,” House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, and Rep. Tammy Nuccio of Tolland, ranking House Republican on the Appropriations Committee, wrote in a joint statement.
Beckham, who had been OPM’s liaison to the General Assembly prior to becoming Lamont’s budget director — and who has more than three decades of experience in state agencies across all three branches of government — credited his relationships with helping to stabilize the budget office.
“I knew most of the team. I’d come up with a lot of them,” he said, adding his familiarity with the General Assembly also played an important role. “I know its culture very well. I think I was pretty well positioned. I think we were fortuitous in that. And so, I think I was a reassuring presence for the staff.”
Lamont also praised Beckham, a fiscal conservative, for his dedication to the budget caps that helped Connecticut to replace a nearly depleted rainy day fund with a record-setting $4.3 billion reserve in just eight years, and to simultaneously dedicate about $10 billion in surpluses to shrink pension debt.
“I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart,” Lamont said. “You’ve been standing there every day protecting an honestly balanced budget. No more of this buy-now-pay-later stuff.”
Lamont also showed confidence in Wojcik, 43 who will succeed Beckham next month.
A veteran of the comptroller’s office, Wojcik has managed the Health Policy and Benefits Services Division since 2022, overseeing a $2 billion program budget and benefits for more than 270,000 public sector workers, retirees, dependents and other individuals.

Wojcik, who lives in Brooklyn, also served as a budget and policy analyst for the state Senate’s Democratic Caucus before his time in the comptroller’s office.
Lamont noted that his new budget director, like his outgoing one, was very familiar with the challenges Connecticut faced during the last recession, from late 2007 to early 2010 — a crisis that triggered many of the budget deficits and tax hikes of the 2010s.
“You know, in ’08, ‘09, when we lost billions of dollars in just a matter of a few months,” Lamont said to Wojcik. “You understand how important it is that not only we have an honestly balanced budget but also that we have a rainy day fund that protects our people, protects our communities.”
Sean Scanlon, Connecticut’s comptroller since 2022, called Wojcik “one of the smartest public policy minds that I’ve ever met. He has been an invaluable advisor to me and to my predecessors in the comptroller’s office. The work he has done as a leader in our agency and state include designing transformational health care policy that saves lives and saves taxpayer money and budgetary policy that led to Connecticut’s fiscal comeback. So, while I am certainly sad to see him leave our team, Gov. Lamont has made an excellent choice.”
Wojcik said he is committed to helping Lamont continue the financial success that state government has enjoyed under his administration. One of the new budget director’s toughest challenges involves negotiating with a Democratic-controlled General Assembly that tends to be more fiscally liberal than the Democratic governor.
“I’ve worked with many of them on many significant issues, particularly surrounding health care, in recent years,” Wojcik said, “and I absolutely want to be a thought-partner with the governor and [help in] trying to identify opportunities where we have general agreement.”
Wojcik, who holds a bachelor’s degree in international relations and a master’s of public administration from the University of Connecticut, added that when it comes to working with lawmakers, “We’re not always going to agree, of course, but you know, having that good and positive relationship that OPM has historically had, I plan to continue that.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_2385-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-20 17:57:52.707512

Those vehicles — part of a 252-car replacement fleet — are running years behind schedule.","THE MBTA’S long-running effort to replace its Red and Orange Line fleets faced renewed schedule pressures this fall, with transit officials highlighting a recent shift toward more consistent Red Line production as the Orange Line order nears its finish line.
Shipments of Chinese-manufactured train shells have slowed in recent months — in part because of ongoing federal forced-labor reviews — contributing to delays that pushed the builder past a September delivery deadline for the Orange Line.
Although the federal reviews have introduced uncertainty into the supply chain, MBTA leaders said the broader fleet-replacement program continues to move forward, supported by a production strategy that now places greater emphasis on keeping Red Line deliveries on track.
The manufacturer of new MBTA Red and Orange Line fleets missed the September deadline to complete all 152 Orange Line cars, after US Customs officials detained multiple shipments of train shells and components under a federal forced-labor law. Transit officials say the builder, China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation MA (CRRC), remains on pace to finish the Orange Line order by year’s end.
The MBTA expects to receive another pair of Orange Line cars on Thursday, bringing the total to 150. The final two cars are scheduled to arrive next month, closing out the 152-car order required under the contract. 
The new Orange Line fleet, which began entering service in September 2022, has been large enough to support reliable operations, officials said, allowing the T earlier this year to direct CRRC to prioritize Red Line production instead.
So far, the T has received 58 new Red Line cars, with two more expected in December. Those vehicles — part of a 252-car replacement fleet — are running years behind schedule. 
The project originated under Gov. Deval Patrick’s administration in 2014, has been buffeted by repeated manufacturing setbacks, and underwent a major contract “reset” last year that waived some penalties, lifted the contract’s value above $1 billion and set a new completion deadline of late 2027.
A new wrinkle emerged in May, when US Customs and Border Protection began holding newly shipped car shells in American ports as authorities review whether CRRC’s supply chain complies with the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. The 2021 law bars imports linked to forced labor in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and places a high burden of proof on importers to document that their goods were made with an ethical supply chain.
CRRC ships partially assembled shells from China to the US, where final assembly is performed at its Springfield facility by a workforce of more than 400. Components from 32 states feed into US assembly, according to General Manager Phil Eng.
US Customs’ review has required multiple rounds of documentation from CRRC. In July, Eng said the company was “in the midst of answering the last round of questions,” adding he was “very confident” the parties would navigate the review.
CRRC spokesperson Lydia Rivera told WBUR the company has maintained “rigorous compliance reviews” and that “no entity involved in these shipments is linked to any violation” of the law.
Erik Olson, executive director of the Rail Security Alliance, encouraged the federal reviews, saying, “We are grateful for US Custom’s attention to CRRC train shells and components and the materials within the full supply chain, ‘requiring full traceability of certain raw materials—down to the level of ore extraction and smelting.'”
Despite the detainments, both CRRC and the MBTA say the Springfield line continues to operate. 
Eng said this summer that enough shells were in Massachusetts to “keep the workforce working through the end of the year.” 
MBTA spokesperson Joe Pesaturo said this month the agency “continues to work closely with CRRC MA to keep the production line moving at the Springfield plant” and “ensure that each shipment of car shells is accompanied by the necessary documentation required by US Customs officials.”
The MBTA’s October bondholder statement acknowledged the detainments and said CRRC is “working to rectify the situation.” 
The document reiterates that the full vehicle program includes 404 heavy-rail cars — 152 for the Orange Line and 252 for the Red Line — each equipped with wider doors, ADA-dedicated spaces, LCD passenger information systems, LED lighting, redundant train-control and HVAC systems and upgraded monitoring and communication technology. The vehicle investments accompany systemwide upgrades to maintenance facilities, track and signaling.
The T is approaching the long-sought milestone of completing the Orange Line replacement, more than a decade after state officials first awarded the contract. But the beleaguered Red Line program, still not half delivered, remains vulnerable to external shocks from the federal inquiry.
For now, the last two Orange Line cars are slated for December delivery, and the Red Line has a two-car delivery schedule for next month as well, as its multi-year push toward full fleet replacement continues.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Transportation_MBTA_Red-Line_Ashmont-edited-1.png?fit=1024%2C767&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-20 16:57:24.917358

RJ May, who pleaded guilty in September to sending videos of children being sexually abused, faces new charges of failing to pay his income taxes.
The 39-year-old West Columbia Republican owes the state $14,637 for three years of income taxes he failed to file, according to arrest warrants the South Carolina Department of Revenue served May with Thursday. May remains in the Edgefield County Detention Center, awaiting sentencing on the federal child sexual abuse material charges.
May could face up to one year in state prison, a $10,000 fine or both for each of the three tax charges if convicted. That’s on top of the 25 to 100 years he could collectively face for all five charges of sending videos of children being sexually abused. Those five charges to which May pleaded guilty could also carry hefty penalties of up to $250,000 each.
May, a founding member of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus, owned and operated Ivory Tusk Consulting, which ran campaigns for likeminded candidates. From 2022 to 2024, May earned $323,000, according to a news release. He was first elected to the House in November 2020.
Ex-Rep. RJ May failed to pay income taxes for years, SC House Ethics investigation finds

A House Ethics Committee investigation first turned up questions about May’s tax filings. The committee began its investigation in July, several weeks after police arrested May on the sexual abuse charges.
An investigation is usually the first step in expelling a House member, but May resigned his House seat in August, while the committee’s hired lawyers were still looking into his conduct. In requesting the ethics investigation, House Majority Leader Davey Hiott, R-Pickens, asked for a closer look into May’s financials, prompting a search of his state income tax filings.
That search came up empty, lawyers said last month when presenting their findings to the committee. The committee referred any potential criminal charges to the appropriate state agency, without clarifying the agencies involved.
Whether May filed federal income taxes remains unclear. Investigators did not attempt to get those records because the federal government did not have the same obligation to participate in a state-level investigation, committee attorneys said.
Also unclear is how much money May had when a judge assigned him a federal public defender. At the time, he claimed he had no assets but his truck, and in messages from jail, he weighed selling the truck to fund his defense.
May claimed from his jail cell that clients owed him thousands of dollars he could have used to hire a lawyer to defend him in federal court. The ethics committee’s lawyers questioned whether he disclosed this to the federal judge.
May ultimately fired his attorneys and opted to represent himself. He rehired his defense team for his sentencing trial, which is scheduled to take place Jan. 14.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/RJ-May-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-20 16:57:24.917358

Mike Braun on Thursday recognized five Hoosier women with 2025 Torchbearer Awards during a private ceremony held in his office.
“The Torchbearer Awards recognize Hoosier women for their exceptional achievements in their community, our state, and our nation,” he said in a statement. “These Hoosier women are outstanding leaders in their fields. Today I was proud to recognize each of them for their trailblazing accomplishments and the examples they’ve set for future generations.”
This year, four women were named Torchbearers and one woman was honored with a lifetime achievement award.
Betsy Wiley received the lifetime achievement award for her public service to Indiana’s students in many areas, including school choice. She has worked to support parents’ rights to lead their own children’s education, and advocated to improve schools and outcomes for all Hoosier children, the governor’s news release said.
Monica Kelsey was named a Torchbearer for her efforts to save babies’ lives through Safe Haven Baby Boxes. Braun’s office said her work has made Indiana the national leader in preventing child abandonment.
Grace Estabrook was a member of the swimming and diving team for Penn State, and she spoke against transgender women competing in women’s sports. The news release said her voice on the issue was an important part of the national conversation and yielded significant policy changes to support fairness.
Kristian Stricklen became President of the Madame Walker Legacy Center in 2021. She was honored for her leadership of the Walker Center into a new era of financial sustainability and cultural impact.
Erin Houchin serves Hoosiers in Congress as the representative for Indiana’s 9th district. She was honored for her leadership for Hoosiers on the national stage. Representative Houchin was elected to House Republican leadership in 2024, serving as the House Republican Conference Secretary for the 119th Congress, making her the second-highest-ranking woman in the Republican House majority.
Braun presented the awards on behalf of the Indiana Commission for Women, which created the Torchbearer Awards in 2004 to celebrate extraordinary contributions made by Hoosier women.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)TAMPA — Saying Floridians need property tax relief now, former Florida House Speaker and 2026 Republican gubernatorial candidate Paul Renner is calling for the Legislature to reduce the ad valorem taxes levied by local governments immediately by rolling them back to the previous year’s levels, plus a reduction based on how much the county’s spending had increased since 2020.
The Legislature should cap future taxes to ensure local government cannot grow faster than Floridians’ incomes, he added, and require a 2/3 supermajority vote of local government for any new or increased tax or fee subject to a subsequent referendum, for voters to approve or reject.
“We don’t have to wait two years for an amendment to go on the ballot in November 2026,” he said while addressing reporters in Tampa on Thursday. “We can give people relief right this minute and that’s what I’m calling for today in the form of a rollback.”
Renner said his proposal isn’t complicated and that it’s simply reproducing what happened during a 2007 special legislative session. That’s when then Gov. Charlie Crist and House Speaker Marco Rubio agreed to reduce ad valorem taxes collected by local governments in FY 2007-08 to a specified percentage of the rolled back rate for 2006‐07.
Renner’s comments came while a select House committee in Tallahassee debated several proposed constitutional amendments to substantially reduce or outright eliminate property taxes for homestead properties that would potentially go on the November 2026 ballot. The idea has been aggressively pursued by Gov. Ron DeSantis as he heads into his final year leading Florida.
Renner said that the percentage of what would be returned to taxpayers in his proposal would depend on how much that local government has spent.
“If your county has been fiscally conservative and they’ve given some of that money back to taxpayers — as they should — then they have a smaller rollback,” he said. “If your county is one that has taken every single penny — and this has happened in many counties — you have a larger rollback. That’s up to the Legislature to look at the numbers and make a decision on what that rollback amount would look like.”
Gov. DeSantis has dismissed the multiple proposed measures that members of the Florida House debated Thursday, saying only a single constitutional amendment should go on the ballot. Renner said he mostly agreed with that idea.
“I think you need one plan that’s straightforward,” he said. “That people can look at and say, ‘Does this make my life better?'”
The 58-year-old Renner, a military veteran and former state prosecutor, concluded a nine-year stint in the House in 2024, spending the last two years as speaker. He entered the GOP contest for governor in early September, joining southwest U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds in the contest to succeed a term-limited DeSantis next year.
Although there have been rumors of other candidates entering the race, Donalds and Renner remain the top contenders going into next August’s GOP primary. “I think I am the viable alternative,” he said when asked if he considered himself the top challenger to Donalds, who has the imprimatur of Donald Trump as well as $30 million raised in his campaign coffers.
“We’re the undisputed leader as well on having a plan,” Renner added, referring to the affordability plan he released last week that includes specific proposals to reduce insurance costs, ensure that tuition isn’t increased in Florida universities, and boost healthcare (he is calling on Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act and return control to the states as well as promoting “high-quality healthcare options that put patients in control”). He also wants to end H-IB visa hires for state employees.
Renner spoke about what he deemed the legislative successes that he worked on with DeSantis and the Legislature during his term as speaker, which included his sponsorship of an expansive and controversial voucher law to provide public money for children to attend parochial, secular, and other private schools across the state, regardless of family income. That program has now expanded to 500,000 students statewide.
A recently released audit for the 2024-2025 school year found a “myriad of accountability challenges” with the school choice program, with millions of dollars in overspending as well as lack of oversight and delays in scholarship payments.
“I think you don’t want to throw the baby out with the bathwater,” Renner responded. “This is a great program, but if out of that half-a-million there are 50 or 500 that are not complying in the right way, kick them off the program. That’s enforcement. Don’t use any problems along the way to eliminate the program or redo the program.”
Despite the fact that he considers himself the main challenger to Donalds in the Republican primary, Renner says his campaign is centered on the needs of the electorate.
“I’m not running a campaign against him, I’m running a campaign for the people of Florida,” he said. “I’m putting Florida first. I have leadership that the other candidates frankly don’t have. I’ve delivered results. And again, I’m focused on people’s needs. It’s a ‘we’ campaign, it’s not a ‘me’ campaign.”

A focus of the Republican citrus farmer from Wauchula, a similar version of the bill was a casualty of late-session negotiations last year. Approaching the second and final session of his presidency, Albritton is gearing up to push his priority. 
“As we prepare to embark on a nationwide celebration of America’s 250th Anniversary, there is no better time to celebrate and renew our focus on heritage farming communities across our state and nation. The hard work and patriotism of small family farm communities not only helped win our independence but also created and maintained a robust agricultural supply chain vital to our national security,” Albritton said in a news release.
Last year, SB 110, the previous Rural Renaissance bill, passed the Senate unanimously but the House declined to pass the Senate version, killing the bill. 
“We’ve seen tremendous economic growth in urban Florida over the years, and it’s rural Florida’s turn now to grow the way we see fit,” Albritton said in a video message to a Rural Health Association event in Lake City.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture is working with Albritton to make his proposal a national model





Additionally, some of the health care proposals included in the 2024 proposed Rural Renaissance were included in the Agency for Health Care Administration’s Nov. 3 application for $200 million in federal rural health funding.
Last year, Albritton said the bill would not impose a mandate for rural areas but instead a “buffet” of opportunities for communities to “be able to grow the way they want to” and that it’s meant to be a “hand up, not a handout,” calling it “quintessential” in what government is meant to do.





Sen. Corey Simon, a Republican from Tallahassee who represents 12 rural counties, again is sponsoring the bill. 
“Quality of life in rural areas can be impacted by access to job opportunities, education, and health care. Rural Renaissance combines enhancements to the traditional infrastructure for schools and hospitals with innovations that drastically expand opportunities for education, commerce, and health care in rural Florida,” Simon said.

The bill would increase the threshold for what a “fiscally constrained county” is from $5 million in property tax revenue per 1 mil to $10 million per 1 mil.
Fiscally constrained status is used in statute to qualify certain counties for extra support. 
The bill, like last year’s, would create the Office of Rural Prosperity within the Department of Commerce. The office would facilitate planning and connect local governments to state and federal resources. 
SB 250 would include a $1 million block grant for counties with declining populations. The grants would target population growth and be available annually until a county achieves three consecutive years of growth. 
Rural teachers would be eligible for a student loan repayment program worth $15,000 per individual over five years. 
Hospitals would be able to receive funding for mobile units for primary care, behavioral health, obstetric, and gynecological services. The bill would increase from $10 million to $35 million the Rural Hospital Grant Program.

The bill President Donald Trump signed July 4 cuts $187 billion from SNAP over the next decade, including $68 billion by 2029, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates. It does so primarily by imposing additional work requirements on SNAP recipients and additional costs on states. 
Luján, a Democrat who leads a Senate subcommittee on nutrition and represents the state with the highest nationwide percentage of SNAP recipients, called the cuts cruel and unprecedented. 
“For half a century, our nation has upheld a bipartisan promise to ensure that no child, no senior, no veteran, no working family should go hungry in the United States of America,” he said. “Republicans broke that promise, and today, congressional Democrats are fighting to restore this program.”
The Food Depot’s busiest New Mexico distribution just got busier

The two-page bill Luján introduced, which 46 other senators co-sponsored, seeks simply to repeal all the provisions in the Republican bill imposing the SNAP cuts. It’s called the “Restoring Food Security for American Families and Farmers Act of 2025.”
He and other Democrats who spoke at a news conference Thursday in Washington D.C. pointed to the Trump administration’s efforts to withhold November SNAP benefits during the government shutdown, despite court rulings and a contingency plan the federal Agriculture Department had in place to keep benefits flowing during a shutdown. 
Withholding the benefits caused upheaval in the food assistance program, which 42 million Americans rely on, including about 460,000 New Mexicans. Food banks in New Mexico saw sharp increases in demand, and the Legislature stepped in to approve nearly $200 million in state funds to pay for benefits throughout January.
Now that the government has reopened, New Mexico’s Legislative Finance Committee director on Monday told state lawmakers the state was receiving all its expected federal SNAP funding. But the cuts are still in effect under the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” provisions, Luján noted, which he and Democrats are hoping to stop.
“These are people across the country who you probably stand in line with when you’re checking out at a grocery store every day. Folks right now, they face the real possibility of going hungry because of the choices made by President Trump and congressional Republicans,” he said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screen-Shot-2025-11-20-at-1.33.12-PM.png,,,2025-11-20 16:57:24.917358

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A board governing the Mental Health Department on Thursday agreed to purchase properties in southwest Oklahoma City to replace the Griffin Memorial Hospital in Norman. 
The cost of purchasing and renovating the three properties totals about $60 million in American Rescue Plan Act funds that the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services are required to spend by the end of 2026, an agency spokesperson said. 
When renovations are completed, the new inpatient mental health hospital complex has a potential capacity of 197 beds, a spokesperson said, which is an increase from the 120 beds at Griffin Memorial. 
The largest of the purchases is a former Sisters of Saint Mary Health hospital campus at 2129 SW 59th St., which includes a main complex, annex and warehouse, totalling over 190,000 square feet. 
A second building, at 5835 S. Pennsylvania Ave., is a vacant medical office. The agency intends to use this building as an office site for the project manager.
Chad Carden, the agency’s chief of operations, said this keeps funding within the project and allows the Mental Health Department to keep the money invested in property rather than renting temporary job site trailers. 
The third property is 1.6 acres of vacant land at 2149 SW 59th St., which Carden said is ready to build on and has the potential to be a future site at the new hospital campus. 
During the first phase of construction, the agency will prioritize opening 32 beds in an annex building by the end of 2025. 
A timeline was not yet determined for the full project to be completed. 
The Mental Health Department’s goal is to relocate all services offered at Griffin Memorial to the new campus. The hospital serves adults with severe mental illness. 
A previous effort to build the Donahue Behavioral Health Campus in Oklahoma City became too expensive and went over budget. 
Interim Commissioner Gregory Slavonic said the Donahue project would have cost $187 million to complete, and this new campus will save taxpayer dollars. 
While the Mental Health Department’s governing board approved the purchases, the transaction is still being finalized.

(Map made by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix via DataWrapper)Hundreds of millions in federal funding will be pumped into Florida’s rural health care delivery system in the coming months, a top health care official in Gov. Ron DeSantis’s administration promised Thursday during a recognition of National Rural Health Day.
Agency for Health Care Administration Secretary Shevaun Harris said the state intends to make rural health care grant applications available in January or February, after it hears back from the Trump administration on its Nov. 3 request for $200 million in Rural Health Transformation Program funds. Harris said the federal government is supposed to notify the state by Dec. 31.
“Our hope is to get, again, maximum funding,” said Harris, appearing during an event in Lake City hosted by the Florida Rural Health Association, the Suwannee River Area Health Education Center, the WellFlorida Council, and Florida Voices for Health. 
“We’ll have to get budget authority through the Legislature to be able to tap into any funding that we’re awarded, but we’ll put out those requests for applications,” she added.
The funds are available under the One Big Beautiful Bill. Harris said the state’s application includes funding opportunities for 15 policy initiatives that address three broad areas: workforce; technology and innovation; and improving health and health access.

While she welcomed the funding opportunities, Doctors’ Memorial Hospital CEO Lauren Faison-Clark asked Harris whether the state intends to keep the money in the hands of the rural providers or award statewide grants to large outside companies.
“Many of us in the trenches are nervous sometimes when these well-intended monies come out that big vendors nationwide, vendors will come in and try to get a statewide contract for things where really what we want to do is grow the infrastructure that already exists in rural communities,” said Faison-Clark, whose hospital in Taylor County was hit by thee hurricanes between the 2023 and 2024 Atlantic hurricane seasons.
She added: “Will there be a focus on local solutions?” 
Harris acknowledged AHCA could award statewide contracts but “that’s not our preference.”
“That’s like a plan C or D,” she said adding, “So, when we’re reviewing applications that come in through the RFA [request for application] process, we’re really going to be spending a lot of time on the sustainability option.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
AHCA worked with the Florida Department of Health on the application and also solicited input from stakeholders, including issuing a formal request for information. Harris said the agency met with “many of the associations.”
The agency also looked to the Florida Legislature for insight.
Harris acknowledged that the state’s application includes ideas borrowed from the rural renaissance legislation that did not pass earlier this year. Senate President Ben Albritton championed the  effort to invest hundreds of millions in state funds to help bolster spending in rural Florida. (The Senate announced Thursday the legislation has been refiled for the 2026 session.)
Sen. Ben Albritton via Florida Senate
“We did look at the key healthcare components of it and, wherever possible, tried to pull forward those pieces,” she said.
To that end, AHCA’s application includes a $5 million request to provide start-up funding for physicians and “physician extenders” to establish practices in rural areas and commit to staying there for five years.
There’s an $18 million request to expand the use of EMS providers in rural areas. 
Harris called it a “community paramedicine” approach and said the goal is to increase use of EMS providers to help reduce hospital readmission rates and to avoid unnecessary emergency department visits. The idea is to pair EMS providers with nurses who could check in on patients who have been discharged from the hospital.
“So, that would get a collaboration with the hospital system and local paramedics to ensure that we’re able to have the impact there,” she said.
There are  67 counties in Florida. Thirty one of them are considered “rural” under Florida law. The 2020 Census put Florida’s rural population at 1,183,017 people.
Harris wasn’t the only Florida official  acknowledging National Rural Health Day. DeSantis issued a proclamation extending “greetings and best wishes to all observing” the day.
In Tallahassee for committee meetings, Senate President Albritton sent a pre-recorded video message in which he reaffirmed his commitment to investing in rural Florida.
“We’ve seen tremendous economic growth in urban Florida over the years, and it’s rural Florida’s turn now to grow the way we see fit. That’s why, during my last year as Senate president, I’m laser focused on Florida’s Rural Renaissance, a comprehensive plan to improve infrastructure and expand access to education and, yes, healthcare across rural Florida,” he said.

This story by Lukas Dunford was first published in the Valley News on Nov. 19, 2025.
MONTPELIER — Roslyn Fortin, a fifth-grader from Highgate Elementary, has been named Vermont’s first Kid Governor. More than 1,000 fifth graders across 47 Vermont schools voted this month to elect Roslyn from among the seven finalists, two of which were from the Upper Valley.
Each candidate developed a platform around a single issue, creating three-point plans to address their issues with help from the Secretary of State’s Office.
Roslyn focused on addressing homelessness.
The other six fifth-graders who were on the ballot will serve on the Kid Governor’s cabinet, helping Roslyn address homelessness, according to a Wednesday release from the Secretary of State’s Office.
They also will support each other in advancing their own platforms, which ranged from health care to anti-bullying.
The two Upper Valley fifth-graders on the final ballot, Gaelen McNaughton, 10, representing the Weathersfield School, and Westyn Danforth, 11, of Bradford Elementary School, are now on the cabinet that will have monthly meetings with the Secretary of State’s Office.


In January, the Kid Governor and her cabinet will take their oaths of office during a ceremony at the State House in Montpelier.
In a race that included no Upper Valley candidates, New Hampshire fifth graders elected Liv Crete-Sayer of Boscawen Elementary School to be their state’s Kid Governor. Liv’s platform focused on the dangers of smoking, vaping and drug use, according to a Wednesday news release from New Hampshire Civics, a Concord-based nonprofit that leads the state’s Kid Governor program.
The Kid Governor program, free to participating schools, was created by the nonprofit Connecticut Democracy Center in 2015 to teach kids about state government and civic engagement.

Jason Crow X)President Donald Trump threatened U.S. Rep. Jason Crow and other Democratic members of Congress with arrest and execution for a video in which they say members of the military and intelligence community should refuse illegal orders from the Trump administration. 
In posts on Truth Social, Trump said “Their words cannot be allowed to stand,” and it is “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” 
Crow, an Aurora Democrat who is a former Army Ranger, and other members of Congress with experience in the military or intelligence said service members and intelligence community members have the right to refuse illegal orders under the U.S. Constitution and the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

“Our laws are clear. You can refuse illegal orders,” U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, said in the video.
The video is titled, “Don’t give up the ship,” a military motto that dates to the War of 1812.
Trump accuses 6 Democratic lawmakers of ‘seditious behavior, punishable by death’

A spokesperson for Crow said his office has seen an uptick in threats following the video and Trump’s posts. 
“It’s very telling that President Trump and those around him think it’s criminal simply for asking people to follow the law,” Crow said in his own video released Thursday. “This moment requires moral clarity. Every American, regardless of your background, should unite and reject his calls for political violence.”
Democrats in the video include Crow, Kelly, U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, U.S. Rep. Chris DeLuzio of Pennsylvania, U.S. Rep. Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, and U.S. Rep. Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania. 
“Our servicemembers should know that we have their backs as they fulfill their oath to the Constitution and obligation to follow only lawful orders. It is not only the right thing to do, but also our duty,” the group said in a joint statement. “But this isn’t about any one of us. This isn’t about politics. This is about who we are as Americans. Every American must unite and condemn the President’s calls for our murder and political violence.”
In an interview with Fox News, Crow said Trump “has made a series of very disturbing comments and suggestions that would violate U.S. law and put our military in terrible positions.” He said the “Don’t give up the ship” video serves as a reminder to troops of their obligation to decline unlawful orders before they happen, “because then it’ll be too late.” That includes sending troops to U.S. cities “to go to war with those cities” and polling stations. He referred to “illegal military strikes” in a post on X. 
A Bronze Star recipient who achieved the rank of captain, Crow served in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Colorado Democratic Party Chair Shad Murib said Trump’s threats to members of Congress are “dangerous, unhinged and unworthy of the office of the President of the United States.” 
“We commend Congressman Crow for continuing to show unimpeachable and honorable courage, integrity and leadership in the face of such radical behavior from the president,” Murib said in a statement. “As a veteran and a public servant, he knows more than most the meaning of pledging an oath of duty to their country — certainly more than a five-time draft dodger that our president is.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Republican and Democratic legislators agreed Thursday that water quality is a pressing issue in the state along with property taxes and public health – all of which will be necessary to balance as the Legislature returns in January. 
Water quality, cancer and conservation efforts in Iowa were a key topic on day two of the Iowa Nature Summit at Drake University as a panel of Iowa lawmakers discussed potential 2026 policies. 
Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, said water quality, especially after a lawn watering ban was issued in central Iowa over the summer due to elevated nitrate levels in the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers, is an issue she now hears about all the time. 
“There’s more folks who are paying attention,” she said. “For the people who have been doing this for a very long time, it’s an opportunity to engage those new people and those new voices in advocacy, because we can’t address big challenges unless we’re working together across broad coalitions of folks.”

Funding the trust 
The Natural Resources and Outdoor Recreation Trust Fund was established in the state constitution in 2010, with more than 60% approval from Iowa voters, to fund parks, trails, water resources, conservation efforts and natural areas in the state. 
Despite its 15 years on the books, the trust has not accumulated any funds, because the Legislature has not levied the necessary increase on sales taxes, of which the fund would receive three-eighths of a percent. 
Nature and environmental groups have urged the Legislature to fund the trust in past years. 
Rep. David Jacoby, D-Coralville, said it “may happen” in 2026.
“I think it’s time we initiate,” Jacoby said. “… but we have to be mindful that that three-eighths was supposed to supplement what we’re doing, not replace what we’re doing.” 
Trone Garriott said constituents have asked lawmakers to do something about water quality issues in the state and funding the trust is the “number one opportunity.” 
At the same time, however, Trone Garriott said property taxes will be the “biggest issue” at the Statehouse this year. 
“Within our municipalities, our counties, there are water quality efforts that happen, and those are funded through property tax revenues,” Trone Garriott said. “Any changes to our property tax structure needs to keep in mind that there’s some really important efforts that are happening on a more local level that could be damaged if we make restrictive changes.” 
She said many local municipalities and counties are also facing the end of life of their wastewater treatment plants. There are expensive infrastructure projects that can lead to increased contaminants, like E.coli, in waterways if they fail. 
Some of these issues, such as funding the trust and creating funding for the water quality monitoring networks, can be done at the state level, but Trone Garriott said water quality work is also going to take federal-level funding via an updated Farm Bill. 
Rep. Devon Wood, R-New Market, the newly appointed chair of the House Natural Resources Committee, said it will take “overwhelming feedback” from constituents in favor of the tax in order for it to pass. 
“They’re already crying out, saying that we are hurting on tax situations in other ways, even with recent tax cuts,” Wood said. “So that’s a balance we have to weigh.” 
Anna Gray, the public policy director and counsel for Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation and moderator for the Thursday panel, said Wood’s response sounded like a “challenge for all of us to up the noise and continue to grow our networks and advocacy.”

Water quality and cancer 
Jacoby said cancer is the “biggest issue” coming up for the legislative session.
He raised, and read aloud, a sign with large black text that read “It’s the water.” 
Reports list Iowa as the state with the second-highest rate of new cancer incidents and one of just two states in the nation with increasing rates of new cancers. 
“We need an honest overview of what’s causing the cancer rates,” Jacoby said. 
He advocated to fund the trust, water quality monitoring, watershed work and cancer research. 
Public health professionals and cancer researchers said at the Iowa Nature Summit on Wednesday that while there are many factors contributing to Iowa’s cancer rates, there is enough evidence linking water quality and agricultural chemicals to cancers for lawmakers to craft policies that address those issues. 
Sen. Ken Rozenboom, R-Pella, said he can’t “get out of his living room” without talking about cancer because it has touched the lives of so many Iowans. 
He said it’s a “deep concern” in the Legislature, but not one he has personally dealt with at a committee level. He said if the “finger is pointed” at agricultural pollution, it doesn’t make sense why states like Illinois are not similarly saddled with high cancer rates. 
“Once we have apparent solutions or answers, then we can start changing policy or making policy,” Rozenboom said. “But I think most of us more have more questions than answers yet.” 
During his 13 years at the Capitol, Rozenboom said water quality has been the “one common denominator” in the issues he has prioritized.
Rozenboom was part of a group of lawmakers who helped to pass long-term funding for the Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy — a plan for voluntary practice adoption to reduce the amount of nutrients that enter Iowa waterways and eventually contribute to the Gulf of Mexico hypoxia. He said he recognizes the “ongoing and continuing tension between agricultural production and environmental concerns.” 
He said while most Iowans know their state leads the nation in corn, pork, eggs and biofuels production, the state also leads in “water quality weapons” like bioreactors, buffers strips, grass waterways, pollinator habitat, conservation tillage and terraces. 
“That’s part of dealing with the tension between the environment and agricultural production,” Rozenboom said. 
He said he has “always acknowledged” that more work needs to be done to improve water quality in the state. 
Wood, who raises cattle and farms with her family, said there are lots of ways the Legislature can work to “modernize” conservation efforts in budgets that already exist. 
“It’s not flashy to say that we need to keep doing what we’re doing,” Wood said. “We need to do new things too, but we need to make sure that we advocate … in those boring budget line items about infrastructure, because Iowa has previously and continues to recognize water quality as an infrastructure investment.”

(Photo by Getty Images)Little Rock psychologist Krameelah Banks appeared before a federal magistrate judge on Thursday after a grand jury indicted her on 34 counts of wire fraud and making false statements this month.
Banks, 48,  is accused of defrauding Medicare and Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield of more than $500,000, according to the indictment filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas.
Banks concealed her fraud by creating fictitious records and making false statements related to health care, according to a press release from Jonathan Ross, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas.
Banks faces 23 counts of wire fraud, seven counts of making false statements in connection with health care, one count of lying to the FBI and one count of aggravated identity theft.
Banks owned Arkansas Behavioral Center (ABC), according to the indictment, and although she treated some regular patients, most of her patients were referrals who were seen just once for pre-surgical psychological evaluations.
The indictment alleges that from 2021 through 2023, Banks billed thousands of hours for psychological services that never occurred and routinely charged Medicare and Blue Cross in the names of patients she’d seen only once. Some of those billings included services that took place while she was vacationing in Florida and Mexico, according to the indictment.
The indictment also alleges Banks billed the federal insurance program and the insurance company for services to several deceased patients.
Banks responded to questions about disputed claims by creating fictitious records and providing nearly identical records to Medicare and Blue Cross and later misled the FBI by blaming over-billing on her calendaring software, the indictment alleges.
Banks was appointed a federal public defender at Thursday’s appearance, court records show.

Andy Beshear announced Thursday. (Screenshot)Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear says he will appoint a longtime Kentucky Lottery Corp. executive to lead the organization as the current president retires next year. 
Beshear during a Thursday press conference said Chief Revenue Officer Maggie Garrison would be the new president of the corporation that manages the state lottery, saying she had his “full confidence” along with that of the outgoing president Mary Harville and the corporation’s board of directors.
Garrison, who has worked in various roles with the corporation since 2011, thanked Harville for her leadership which she said led to “record sales” and “record funding for the state.” 
“We will continue to embrace new opportunities and adapt to a changing environment, one that has changed because of new technology and new player preferences,” Garrison said. “Each and every accomplishment we achieve at the Kentucky lottery directly impacts educational support for Kentucky students and their families in every county of Kentucky.” 
In the corporation’s latest annual report for fiscal year 2025, it stated it had broken for the 12th consecutive year its “all-time sales record” with more than $2.1 billion in total sales. The report also stated the lottery put more than $384 million toward college scholarships and grants. 
Harville, who Beshear appointed as the corporation’s president in 2020 as the first woman in the role, said it was her “honor and privilege to serve as the face of the Kentucky lottery.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screen-Shot-2025-11-20-at-3.43.35-PM-1024x816.png,,,2025-11-20 16:57:24.917358

(Photo from the PSC website)The Florida Public Service Commission (PSC) approved a four-year settlement with Florida Power & Light (FPL) Thursday for about $6.9 billion, which opponents claim is the largest rate hike in U.S. history.
The investor-owned utility, Florida’s largest with approximately six million accounts totaling around 12 million customers, said in a press release that it will enable FPL to continue to make “smart, necessary investments in the grid to power Florida’s growth — while keeping customer bills well below the national average.”
The proposed rate hike was met with fierce opposition. More than two dozen local and state elected officials sent a letter to last month to Gov. Ron DeSantis and the PSC, calling on them to reject the proposal.
The rate hike also became an issue in the race for attorney general. Former Democratic state Sen. José Javier Rodriguez, running for the position next year, called on Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier to intervene in the case.
Attorneys general in places like Michigan, Connecticut, and Arizona have challenged proposed rate hikes by public electricity utilities this year, and Republican former Florida attorneys general such as Bill McCollum and Charlie Crist previously intervened in rate hikes proposed by investor-owned utilities.
However, Uthmeier declined to get involved.
‘Shameful decision’
Bradley Marshall, who represented several groups who opposed the rate hike, insisted the fight isn’t over yet.
“We look forward to reviewing the written decision and expect this case will be appealed to the Florida Supreme Court, where we look forward to presenting our case,” he told the Phoenix. “This decision hurts the people who are already struggling with higher power bills.”
Other critics blasted the PSC.
“Four years ago, FPL was awarded one of the largest rate hikes in U.S. history. Today, they’ve made history again at nearly double that amount. This shameful decision illustrates why our state energy regulators cannot be trusted to ensure that families have reliable, affordable energy,” said Food & Water Watch Senior Florida organizer Brooke Ward in a written statement.
“People are not asking for diamonds or gold — while greedy utilities keep raking in record profits, regular Floridians want to be able to afford running their air conditioners and heaters. The Legislature must pass affordable energy legislation this session to ensure fair electricity prices.”
“By approving this rate hike, the PSC has handed FPL another blank check while Floridians struggle to keep the lights on,” said Alyssa White, climate justice organizer for Florida Student Power. “This is a slap in the face to every family, student, and small business already drowning in high bills. Our communities deserve an energy system that puts people over profit, and we will continue to build the power to make that happen!”
FPL initially wanted bigger rate hike 
Originally, FPL proposed a four-year, $9.8 billion rate hike but, shortly before the PSC was scheduled to hold hearings on that proposal in August, FPL announced that it had reached an 11th-hour “agreement in principle” with what it described as a “diverse” group of organizations including Walmart, RaceTrac, Wawa, and the Florida Retail Federation. That proposal reduced the rate increase to about $6.9 billion but still maintained a return on equity of 10.95%. ROE is a measure of a company’s financial performance.
FPL’s revised proposal drew pushback from the Office of Public Counsel (OPC), designated by law to represent Florida consumers. The OPC worked with organizations such as Florida Rising and the League of United Latin American Citizens of Florida (LULAC) and came up with their own counterproposal, which did not include any input from FPL.
Their proposal would cut the base bill by nearly half for the average residential customer compared to FPL’s original proposal, to $5.2 billion. Their proposed ROE for FPL would be 10.6%.
PSC Chairman Mike La Rosa rejected the OPC proposal on Sept. 12, saying FPL was “an indispensable party to any settlement.” He added that while their proposal could not be presented as a settlement agreement, it could be included as part of their testimony in opposition to FPL’s agreement submitted in late August.
FPL says that in 2026, its “typical” 1,000-kWh residential customer bill in most of Florida will increase by $2.50 a month, or about 2%, from the existing $134.14 to $136.64. In Northwest Florida, the typical residential customer bill will remain relatively flat, going from the existing $143.60 to $141.36 in 2026.
“We appreciate the Florida Public Service Commission’s thorough review of our rate plan,” said FPL president and CEO Armando Pimentel in a statement.
“Today’s vote enables FPL to continue to deliver some of America’s most reliable electric service and meet the needs of our fast-growing state — and we project will keep customer bills well below the national average through the end of the decade. As we begin our second century of serving Florida, approval of this plan is a win for our customers and a win for the entire state.”

“He was a giant to the end,” Liz Cheney recalls to a crowd that included Biden, Pence and Pelosi, but not Trump.
The post Wyoming son Dick Cheney remembered for integrity, loyalty, intellect during D.C. funeral appeared first on WyoFile .","In the eyes of the world, Dick Cheney is known as the most powerful vice president in America’s history — a hawkish and reticent 9/11-era figure who helped expand executive power.
But to those close to him, Cheney was a Wyoming boy to his core; a man deeply devoted to his wife, Lynne, and his daughters; a keen history scholar; an avid fly-fisherman and a proud grandfather. 
He was a man whose work took him to the White House and to world capitals to convene with global dignitaries. But he also attended his grandson’s high school football games, packed and moved his granddaughter to college, and drove another around the West as her personal rodeo chauffeur. 
“I’m pretty sure he’s the only person who ever had the title vice-president-turned-rodeo-grandpa,” his granddaughter Grace Perry told a crowd gathered Thursday in the Washington Cathedral for Cheney’s funeral.

The funeral for former Vice President Dick Cheney was held Nov. 20, 2025 in the Washington Cathedral. (Screengrab/Washington National Cathedral) 
Attendees included friends, family and politicians of all stripes, including Gov. Mark Gordon, former President Joe Biden, former President George W. Bush, former Vice President Mike Pence and prominent Democrat Nancy Pelosi — but not President Donald Trump. The Cheneys, who had public beef with Trump in recent years, did not invite him, the New York Times reported. 
More than 1,000 people were estimated to be in attendance for the service, which came weeks after he died Nov. 3 at the age of 84.
Speakers recalled a man of enormous intellect who was plainspoken and humble, unassuming and competent, decent and patriotic. 
“The vice president was always the calmest person in the room,” said Jonathan Reiner, Cheney’s cardiologist for 27 years.
They also underscored his deep and abiding connections to Wyoming. 
“I can’t think of anybody who better embodied Wyoming values than Dick Cheney,” said Pete Williams, who worked as Cheney’s press secretary for seven years and who also grew up in Casper. “He was comfortable in the saddle on horseback. He judged people by what they accomplished and what they stood for. He loved the state where he grew up and met Lynne. And Wyoming loved him back, electing him six times to the House of Representatives.”
While some politicians shed staffers in favor of bigger names as they rise in prominence, Williams said, Cheney never abandoned the Wyoming folks who were with him from the start.

(Bruce Nichols/Casper College Public Relations Department Photographs and Records. Casper College Archives and Special Collections. Western History Center).  

“When George W. Bush chose him to be the vice presidential candidate in 2000, their first campaign stop together was Casper, a demonstration of Dick’s loyalty to his home state,” Williams said. (Williams sits on WyoFile’s board of directors.)
Bush himself stepped up to the dais to recall fond memories of Cheney, a man who he noted is the only person from America’s Mountain West ever elected to national office. 
“Dick was funny and easygoing in a style that his public image never caught up with,” Bush said. 
“I wish more Americans got to know Dick Cheney in the way that folks in Casper and Cody and Laramie got to know him. Smart and polished, without airs. Courteous and approachable, seeing everyone as an equal. A gentleman by nature. And a true man of the West.”
Country above partisanship 
Cheney, who grew up largely in Casper, served as Wyoming’s sole U.S. representative in Congress from 1979-1989. It was among his many roles in Washington. At age 34, he became the youngest presidential chief of staff in history when President Gerald Ford appointed him to the post. He served as secretary of defense under George H.W. Bush, and years later joined the ticket of George W. Bush to become vice president, serving two terms.
Cheney was famously in D.C. as terrorists attacked America on Sept. 11, 2001, the defining event of his career. He later became the chief architect of the war on terror, and was criticized for the surveillance and interrogation tactics implemented under his leadership.
He and his wife of 61 years, Lynne, continued to live part-time in Jackson, and often hosted family there. They also resided in Virginia, and the family opted to hold Cheney’s funeral in the cavernous Washington Cathedral. The ceremony was not a state funeral, a highly formal, public event administered by the Military District of Washington for distinguished public figures such as former presidents.

The people who showed up — and those who did not — were closely observed by journalists who regarded attendance as a reflection of the country’s current political divisions. Four former presidents were in attendance, along with Kamala Harris and Karl Rove. Neither Trump nor Vice President JD Vance attended the service, which was reported to be invitation-only.
Cheney, in 2024, announced he would vote for Harris in the presidential election, turning against Trump and his party. This came after his daughter, Liz Cheney, publicly criticized Trump for his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection. That move was considered highly consequential; Trump then backed Harriet Hageman, who unseated the younger Cheney to become Wyoming’s lone U.S. representative.  
Cheney’s Harris announcement led some Trump loyalists to distance themselves and others, formerly critical of Cheney, to warm to him. 
‘Without airs’
Bush had a big choice to make 25 years ago while looking for a VP, he recalled. So he hired a distinguished Washington veteran to help him find one: Dick Cheney. 
The men discussed the virtues he sought, Bush said: “preparedness, mature judgment, rectitude and loyalty. Above all, I wanted someone with the ability to step into the presidency without getting distracted by the ambition to seek it.” 
After weeks of these meetings, he said, “I realized the best choice for the vice president was a man sitting right in front of me.” He offered Cheney the spot. Most candidates would jump immediately at the chance, he said. 
“Dick stayed detached and he analyzed it,” he said. “Before I made my decision, he insisted on giving me a complete rundown of all the reasons I should not choose him.”
The way it unfolded followed a pattern of Cheney’s life, Bush said. “His abilities were self-evident, without need of calculation or self-promotion … Even before the Cheney name reached the national stage, people always saw something in the man, solid, reliable and rare.”
The most instrumental person to recognize these qualities, Bush noted, was Lynne Cheney, who is widely credited with convincing her husband to abandon the hard-partying ways of his youth and straighten up. 
Lynne’s influence, he said, “may explain how in just over a decade, a guy can go from laying transmission lines outside Cheyenne to serving as chief of staff for the president of the United States.”
Cheney had many traits uncommon of Washington politicians, Bush said. He was undramatic and even-keeled. He did not feel the need to vocalize every thought; he was sparing and measured with words.

“In a profession of trash-talkers, he was a thinker and a listener,” he said. 
Cheney was a grateful man, Bush recalled, and above all for the three women who shared his journey: Lynne and daughters Mary and Liz. 
“As I quickly discovered in 2000, when you choose one Cheney, you get four,” he said. “His busy and purposeful life was an adventure they experienced together. In a family so close, you dread the day when the circle is broken.”
Cheney was also a devoted grandfather, and three of his grandchildren spoke of the way he cooked Christmas dinner every year for his clan, listened to their troubles, dispensed advice, took them fishing and anchored the family with unwavering love. 
Liz Cheney spoke last, recalling the long road trips she shared with her father; his fascination with the country’s founding and history; his generous support of his family and unswerving commitment to the nation. 
“He was a giant to the end, a lion of a man who loved and served this great republic,” she said.

The Public Service Commission on Wednesday scheduled hearings on what is known as the JETx project, a transmission line between Jamestown and Ellendale.  
The PSC will hold public hearings in the three counties along the proposed route, Dickey, LaMoure and Stutsman. 
Before the public hearings there will be two days of technical hearings in Bismarck. Project developers will use that time to go over details of the 345 kilowatt line. Otter Tail Power Company and Montana-Dakota Utilities Co. are partnering to develop, build and co-own the 92-mile power line. 
PSC approves power line despite questions about need, cost

PSC Chair Randy Christmann said in some previous high-interest hearings, members of the public have waited for hours to comment on a project while listening to the technical details.
“Many times, we’ve gone well into the evening,” Christmann said. 
He said the new system should make it easier for the public to comment. 
“I’ve always felt it was so unfair to the landowners … to sit there hour after hour,” Christmann said.  
A bill passed in the 2025 legislative session allowed for the procedure change. Senate Bill 2116 faced little opposition in the Legislature. 
Commissioner Jill Kringstad on Wednesday noted that there have been times when people have shown up at PSC hearings but left before they could provide input. 
She testified in favor of the bill that gives the PSC the option to split up the hearings. The JETx case will be the first time the split hearings will be used.
“I really like this new approach,” Kringstad said Wednesday. 
Kringstad said most hearings will likely follow the traditional format, but split hearings can be used in cases with a large public interest.

Scott Skokos, executive director of the Dakota Resource Council, said a main reason the group supported the change was hearings on the proposed Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline. The PSC held several drawn out hearings in 2023 and 2024 before approving the carbon dioxide pipeline route. 
“The public would have to wait eight hours to testify after all of the technical experts were done,” Skokos said. 
Bismarck media law attorney Jack McDonald said it’s important to know that both the technical and public hearings are open for anyone to attend. 
“It’s actually a good thing for the public,” McDonald said. 
In the JETx case, the technical hearing will be Jan. 8-9 at the Capitol in Bismarck. Public hearings will be Jan. 12 in Ellendale, Jan. 14 in Edgeley and Jan. 16 in Jamestown. 
PSC hearings are typically livestreamed on the agency’s website. 
The Public Service Commission in November approved a certificate of need for the large power line. However, the project still needs a route permit from the agency. 
The JETx project received some pushback from landowners as the Legislature debated a power line zoning bill. The Legislature approved a bill that says electrical transmission line projects must follow state zoning rules, taking away local government authority.

,DC,2025-11-20 20:49:08+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Trump accuses 6 Democratic lawmakers of 'seditious behavior, punishable by death'",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-accuses-6-democratic-lawmakers-seditious-behavior-punishable-death,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump accused six Democratic lawmakers of sedition on social media Thursday and threatened them with punishment as severe as death, after they appeared in a video message encouraging U.S. armed forces to refuse “illegal orders.”Trump also shared another social media post that said the Democrats should be hanged.The video’s distribution online by Democrats comes as the Trump administration is mired in multiple legal cases objecting to the president’s deployment of National Guard troops to cities across the country, including a challenge to Guard troops in Chicago which is now before the U.S. Supreme Court.In several morning posts on his own social media platform Truth Social, Trump wrote, “This is really bad, and Dangerous to our Country. Their words cannot be allowed to stand. SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS!!! LOCK THEM UP??? President DJT” “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!,” he added a couple of hours later.Prior to writing and publishing his own, the president reposted several messages from users on Truth Social, including one by a user with the handle @P78 who wrote, “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD !!” Trump and his social media supporters were referring to the video, which featured Democratic U.S. lawmakers who served in the military telling current members of the military and the intelligence community to “refuse illegal orders.”Each line in the video is alternately delivered by Sens. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Mark Kelly of Arizona, and Reps. Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire and Jason Crow of Colorado.“We know you are under enormous stress and pressure right now. Americans trust their military, but that trust is at risk. This administration is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens. Like us, you all swore an oath to protect and defend this Constitution. Right now, the threats to our Constitution aren’t just coming from abroad but from right here at home. Our laws are clear: You can refuse illegal orders,” the lawmakers said.The video was titled “Don’t give up the ship.”Does Trump want to ‘execute’ Democrats?When asked by a CBS News reporter during the daily press briefing Thursday whether the president wants to “execute” members of Congress, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt answered, “No.”Leavitt said Trump was reacting to sitting members of Congress who “conspired” on the video message to encourage active duty service members and national security officials to “defy the president's lawful orders.”Leavitt singled out the participation of Slotkin and Kelly, who respectively served as a CIA intelligence officer and a Navy captain. Leavitt also highlighted  Goodlander’s marriage to former National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, who served under President Joe Biden.“They were leaning into their credentials as former members of our military, as veterans, as former members of the national security apparatus, to signal to people serving under this commander-in-chief, Donald Trump, that you can defy him, and you can betray your oath of office. That is a very, very dangerous message, and it perhaps is punishable by law,” Leavitt said.During the ongoing exchange, CBS’s Nancy Cordes pressed back, saying the lawmakers specifically say “illegal order” in the video.“They're suggesting, Nancy, that the president has given illegal orders, which he has not. Every single order that is given to this United States military by this commander in chief and through this chain of command, through the secretary of War, is lawful,” Leavitt responded.Democrats decry political violence Democratic lawmakers sounded the alarm Thursday over Trump’s social media posts, accusing him of encouraging political violence.“Let’s be crystal clear: the president of the United States is calling for the execution of elected officials. This is an outright threat, and it’s deadly serious. We have already seen what happens when Donald Trump tells his followers that his political opponents are enemies of the state,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on the Senate floor Thursday.“Every time Donald Trump posts things like this, he makes political violence more likely. None of us should tolerate this kind of behavior,” Schumer said, highlighting political violence in recent years, including the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, and political assassinations just this past year.House Committee on the Judiciary Chair Jamie Raskin, D-Md., called on Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to “immediately denounce these reckless statements.”The six Democratic lawmakers featured in the video issued a joint statement, saying they “love this country and swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.”“That oath lasts a lifetime, and we intend to keep it. No threat, intimidation, or call for violence will deter us from that sacred obligation. What’s most telling is that the President considers it punishable by death for us to restate the law,” the lawmakers said.",,,,2025-11-20 15:57:34.007033

Merv Riepe of Ralston confirmed on a radio show Thursday that he will seek re-election to the Nebraska Legislature in 2026.
Riepe is an 83-year-old U.S. Navy veteran and longtime health care administrator who represents District 12, which includes parts of Ralston, Millard and Omaha. He was first elected to the Legislature in 2014 and he returned in 2023 after losing a reelection bid to his predecessor — Democrat Steve Lathrop — in 2018.
In a campaign press release, Riepe said his re-election campaign will focus on “solutions, not sides” and on putting people over politics.
“District 12 deserves a senator who … isn’t afraid to stand up for them,” Riepe said. “I’ll continue working to control health care costs, expand access to care, maintain a balanced budget, deliver real tax relief, support public safety and grow economic opportunity for families across Nebraska.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Riepe has several times referred to his district as one of the most “purple” in Nebraska, meaning it has a roughly even mix of registered Republican and Democratic voters. According to the Nebraska Secretary of State’s latest data, the district has 8,900 Republican voters and 7,800 Democrat voters, plus another 6,500 nonpartisan voters. Ralston is an inner-ring suburb in the Omaha area.
This mixture has placed Riepe as a key swing vote who has halted a collection of controversial measures debated by the Legislature in recent years, including shifting the state to winner-take-all in presidential elections, school gender policies and abortion restrictions. He attempted to propose compromises to several of those measures, but was met with mixed results.
During his time in office, Riepe has passed several bills that adjusted various health care regulations in hopes of stabilizing health care costs for Nebraskans. Riepe said these priorities reflect his commitment to “doing what is right, not what is politically convenient.”

The slowdown is the result of a software system issue, agency spokesperson Mark Jones told Mississippi Today. 
“Our software systems are old,” he said.
Mississippians who receive their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits between the 14th and the 21st of each month will receive up to 65% of their November benefits on their regularly scheduled date. The remaining November benefits for all recipients will be issued separately “as soon as possible,” the agency’s website said Thursday.
Beneficiaries in Mississippi receive $183 on average in food assistance per month, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Partial benefits for the average beneficiary would amount to a loss of at least $65 in aid as Thanksgiving approaches. 
The nation’s largest food assistance program was paused beginning in November after the federal government said it would not use emergency funds to pay for the program, even though benefits have continued to flow to states in past shutdowns. 
Confusion ensued after more than a dozen states sued the Trump administration for its refusal to issue benefits. Mississippi said it would begin issuing partial benefits Nov. 10 in accordance with guidance from the United States Department of Agriculture, the federal agency that administers the program.
The state Department of Human Services announced that food assistance benefits were set to resume as normal on Nov. 13 after the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history came to an end. 
About 1 in 8 Mississippians — over 350,000 people — receive food assistance through SNAP. More than 67% of participants are in households with children, and about 41% are in households with older adults or adults with a disability. In four Mississippi counties, over a third of residents rely on the program to purchase food, according to a report from WLBT.
The state Department of Human Services awarded a contract to Deloitte Consulting LLP to improve the agency’s software system in May. Most MDHS eligibility systems were created over 35 years ago, according to the press release announcing the award. 
Jones said the software upgrades are set to be complete in 2027.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/04221933/AP25307719916985.jpg,,,2025-11-20 15:57:34.007033

Jennifer Copeland, executive director of the North Carolina Council of Churches (File photo)Faith leaders in North Carolina used a virtual press conference Wednesday to condemn recent federal immigration enforcement actions that have disrupted daily life for immigrants and their families across North Carolina.
More than 250 people have been arrested since the operations began, and the faith leaders said their congregants have said they’ve avoided going to work, school, and even church services out of concern they could encounter federal agents.
Clergy from the state’s mainline Protestant and interfaith communities called this week’s enforcement actions “harmful” and “devastating.”
“We are not a small minority,” said Jennifer Copeland, executive director of the North Carolina Council of Churches, which includes clergy from 19 denominations. “Millions of church members stand behind these speakers that you’ve heard today.”
Bishop Emily Hartner of the North Carolina Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America framed the situation in religious terms. “We draw on Jesus’s greatest commandment to love God and love our neighbor. And then the parable of the Good Samaritan, where the question is, who is my neighbor?
“When we answer that question, our Lutheran answer is, everyone is our neighbor,” Hartner said.
Speakers said some congregants have been so afraid of the enforcement activity that they have skipped church services altogether amid reports of federal agents stationed near bus stops, parking lots, and residential neighborhoods.
“Wave after wave of the way our government is functioning is doing real harm to ordinary people,” said Bishop Ken Carter of the United Methodist Church.
Rev. Amanda Weatherspoon of the Unitarian Universalist Community of Charlotte said congregations were coordinating with local organizations. She cited efforts with immigrant advocacy groups Siembra N.C. and the Carolina Migrant Network to train volunteers, share information and accompany families who feel unsafe leaving home.
Still, the faith leaders said they recognize the limits of offering protection. On whether churches might revive sanctuary practices — temporarily sheltering immigrants inside houses of worship — several noted that the legal risks had changed in the years since such movements gained national attention.
The Trump administration has also rescinded a long-standing “sensitive locations” policy that had generally barred immigration agents from taking enforcement actions at places of worship, hospitals, and schools without prior approval.
“I know that many congregations are reviewing updated legal policies around harboring and protection,” said Weatherspoon. “They are assessing what is possible and most helpful to fully protect immigrants and safeguard our congregations from legal proceedings amid these changes.”
David Smith, clerk of the North Carolina Fellowship of Friends, representing the state’s Quaker community, framed the debate as a test of core values. “We believe there is that of God in everyone. Every person on this soil must be afforded dignity, respect and due process,” he said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Rev.-Jennifer-Copeland-1024x1024.jpg,,,2025-11-20 15:57:34.007033

(Getty Images)More Arkansans will be subject to food assistance program work requirements starting Friday, after a panel of legislators approved emergency rules put forward by the Arkansas Department of Human Services Thursday.
The changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) implement work requirements on adult SNAP recipients younger than 64 and without dependents younger than 14 who are capable of working.
Previously, those with dependents 18 or younger and those older than 54 were not subject to SNAP work requirements. That changed as a result of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed by Congress over the summer. The work-requirement provisions went into effect when the law was signed, but states had until Nov. 1 to implement the changes.
But DHS didn’t receive guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for implementing the changes until October and couldn’t promulgate the rules in time for the Nov. 1 deadline, Mary Franklin, director of DHS’ Division of County Operations, told the Advocate after the Arkansas Legislative Council’s Executive subcommittee meeting Thursday.
Arkansas will start implementing the changes to work requirement exemptions upon adjournment of the Arkansas Legislative Council on Friday using the emergency rule approved by the body’s Executive Subcommittee. A permanent rule will come next year.
The federal law also removed work requirement exemptions for homeless individuals, veterans and those 24 or younger who have aged out of foster care.
Those subject to work requirements must work at least 80 hours a month, or be participating in education, training or volunteer work to receive SNAP benefits for longer than three months within a three year period.

Advocates have worried the changes to work requirements and additional financial burdens on states to operate the program could result in large numbers of individuals and families losing their benefits nationwide. In fiscal year 2024, 240,000 people received SNAP benefits in Arkansas, and 12.6% of the households receiving benefits had children, according to USAFacts.
Despite consistently being one of the most food insecure states in the U.S., according to USDA data, the number of Arkansans receiving SNAP benefits has fallen steadily even as poverty rates remained relatively constant. In fiscal year 2024, the number of Arkansans receiving food benefits was the lowest since 1991 and less than half of the number participating in the program in fiscal year 2013.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gettyimages-1287472642-2048x1365-1-1024x6831746533271-11761149882.jpg,,,2025-11-20 15:57:34.007033

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)A group of nine attorneys general, including North Carolina’s AG Jeff Jackson, said Thursday they had reached a settlement with the rental company Greystar. The group sued the company and several other property management firms earlier this year, alleging illegal rent fixing through the use of AI tools.
Greystar will pay $7 million to the group of nine states, Jackson’s office announced Thursday, and will stop using non-public data from other rental companies and RealPage, an AI software company, to determine rents.
“This settlement means that more than 25,000 renters in North Carolina are going to be charged fairer prices for rent at a time when housing costs are overwhelming,” Jackson said in a statement.
Under the settlement, Greystar will only be allowed to use third-party software or algorithms to price apartments under the supervision of a court-appointed monitor. The company will not share sensitive data with competitors in order to set rent prices, and will not attend meetings hosted by RealPage.
Greystar, headquartered in Charleston, South Carolina, is North Carolina’s largest landlord. The company has properties in Asheville, the Charlotte metro, the Cape Fear and Wilmington region, the Piedmont Triad and the Research Triangle, according to its website.
The lawsuit against RealPage and four other rental companies remains in court. It was filed in January alongside California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oregon and Tennessee.
RealPage is alleged to have used sensitive data to create a pricing algorithm that inflates rent and violates antitrust laws. The group of rental companies are alleged to have shared private information with RealPage and amongst themselves about prices and occupancy.
North Carolina in 2024 joined a separate federal suit against RealPage and a group of rental companies alleging antitrust violations under former AG Josh Stein, who is now governor.
That case also remains in court; Greystar and the federal government agreed to an August resolution with similar terms to the one finalized Thursday, and on Tuesday filed a joint motion with states to be dismissed from the 2024 suit.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4269-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-20 15:57:34.007033

President Donald Trump took to Truth Social, the social media platform that he owns, to post and re-post a number of statements calling for imprisonment and even death of a number of Democratic lawmakers, including U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin, calling a video they made “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS.”
“SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” Trump continued in a second post.
Slotkin, a former CIA officer, is joined in the video by fellow Democrats including Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, all military veterans and former intelligence officers, where they urge military members to “refuse illegal orders.” 
“This administration is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens,” Slotkin, Kelly and Crow say.  
In response to the video, Trump wrote on Truth Social, “Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL.” He followed this up with a series of “re-Truths” of posts calling the members of Congress “terrorists” and even one post calling to hang them. 
“This really isn’t about those of us who made the video,” Slotkin said in a video posted hours after Trump’s posts. “This is about who we are as Americans and how we’re going to engage with people who we disagree with.”

“We are veterans and national security professionals who love this country and swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States,” Slotkin and the other lawmakers wrote a joint statement. “That oath lasts a lifetime, and we intend to keep it. No threat, intimidation, or call for violence will deter us from that sacred obligation.”
“What’s most telling is that the President considers it punishable by death for us to restate the law,” the statement continues. “In these moments, fear is contagious, but so is courage. We will continue to lead and will not be intimidated.”
Curtis Hertel, chair of the Michigan Democratic Party, also released a statement on Trump’s posts.
“Threatening death against people you disagree with is totally unacceptable and un-American—especially when it comes to lawmakers who have dedicated their lives to serving this great nation and the Constitution. Donald Trump’s abuse of power to persecute his political enemies has reached a new height, attempting to intimidate anyone who defends the promise of our country,” Hertel said. “We know Senator Slotkin will never be intimidated as she stands up for Michiganders, Americans, and the very cornerstone of our democracy. Trump’s threats today go against everything this country stands for, and every single leader, Republican and Democrat, should be wholeheartedly condemning this behavior.”

Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania joins veterans protesting the Trump administration's proposed cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs on Tuesday, May 6, 2025, outside the U.S. Capitol. (Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)This story was originally published by WESA. 
U.S. Rep. Chris Deluzio of Western Pennsylvania is among a half-dozen Democratic legislators accused of sedition Thursday morning by President Donald Trump, citing a video in which the legislators urged military and intelligence personnel not to obey unlawful orders.
In social media posts made Thursday morning, Trump said the Democrats had committed “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL,”a crime he said was “punishable by DEATH” and that each legislator “should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL. … An example MUST BE SET.” Trump also reposted posts from other accounts, including one calling for the legislators to be hanged.
“ The fact that the president’s reaction to us stating a basic principle of the Constitution is to threaten us with death, tells me everything I need to know about the importance of restating our oath to the Constitution,” Deluzio told WESA on Thursday afternoon.
At issue is a minute-and-a-half-long video released Wednesday in which Deluzio, a U.S. Navy veteran, joins U.S. Rep. Chrissy Houlahan of eastern Pennsylvania and four other Democrats with military backgrounds. They speak in rotation as they directly address military servicemembers and intelligence personnel.
“We know you are under enormous stress and pressure right now,” said Elissa Slotkin, a U.S. Senator from Michigan.
The Trump administration, the Democrats say, is pitting the military and intelligence professionals against American citizens. And while Americans trust the military, “that trust is at risk,” Deluzio says in the video. Service members swear an oath to the U.S. Constitution, but Deluzio adds, “right now, the threats to our constitution aren’t just coming from abroad. … You must refuse illegal orders.”
“Don’t give up the ship,” the Democrats say together.
The video does not identify which actions they regard as “threats to our constitution,” although Democrats have been concerned about the administration’s willingness to deploy the military to cities such as Chicago and Los Angeles. There have also been concerns about a series of military strikes on boats in international waters that the War Department, formerly the Department of Defence, has said were engaged in drug trafficking.
Deluzio told WESA that “it’s  a basic constitutional principle of the oath that you have a duty to follow lawful orders and that no service member is ever forced to follow illegal ones.” He said that “there’s no specific past act we’re pointing to, but certainly there are concerns” about what Trump may demand in the future.
“The president himself has talked about using American cities … as training grounds with active duty troops being pitted against their fellow citizens,” he added. “And so it’s an important moment to reassert that basic constitutional idea of the oaths to the Constitution.”
The U.S. Military Code of Justice requires troops to follow only legal orders: They can be prosecuted for obeying orders that are unlawful. But conservatives expressed outrage at the video, arguing that it was an open call for troops to defy commands issued by Trump as Commander in Chief. Trump amplified that message Thursday, arguing that the video was “punishable by DEATH!”
“Their words cannot be allowed to stand,” he added. “We won’t have a Country anymore!!!”
Deluzio said he hoped that reaction to Trump’s statements would be “a turning point away from this dangerous drive into political violence and authoritarianism.
“ I wish I could say that preparing for the president of the United States of America to call for my death and hanging was not something that had crossed my mind. [But] now it’s happened because this is who he is, apparently.”
“I think this is a moment where everyone — Democrat, Republican, you name it — should be condemning the president’s calls for political violence against me and others, and I think every elected Republican in Pennsylvania should be asked whether they’re going to condemn that call for violence.”
The offices of U.S. Rep Guy Reschenthaler and U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick, both Republicans from Pennsylvania, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday afternoon. The office of U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly said that he would not be available to comment on Trump’s remarks Thursday, but it noted that he spoke about the video itself on Fox the day before.
In those comments, Kelly professed bafflement at the video. “I get confused from time to time whether it’s Trump Derangement Syndrome or people that actually just want to pivot to something else,” he said. ” I have deep respect for those who’ve served. But … most people who’ve served don’t make an issue of things and bring it out in public like that to criticize the President of the United States.
“Why would you bring out something like that?” he added. “What purpose does that play to tell people that you don’t have to follow orders. Really? I’ve never heard that before.”
Nationally, however, some Republicans justified Trump’s remarks, arguing that he was merely stating the penalty for seditious behavior, and that the video crossed a line. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson said the message was “wildly inappropriate” and “beyond the pale.”
Democrats reacted more quickly and forcefully, including Gov. Josh Shapiro, who himself was targeted in an arson attempt earlier this year.
In a social media post of his own, he said, “Not only has the president failed in his responsibility to lead this country — he is actively encouraging political violence once again, ratcheting up the real risk of danger to our elected leaders and deepening the divides in our country. The sycophants and enablers the president surrounds himself with are quick to condemn language like this when it suits their political purposes — but in moments like this, they remain silent
Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, who has not often challenged Trump in public, issued a social media statement of his own, saying: “I strongly reject this dangerous rhetoric. Do not threaten Members of Congress. Republican or Democrat. It’s deeply wrong with no exceptions — ever.”
In a Thursday-afternoon statement, Deluzio and the other Democrats struck a defiant note in response: “No threat, intimidation or call for violence will deter us from [our] sacred obligation” to the constitution.”
“What’s most telling is that the President considers it punishable by death for us to restate the law,” the statement continues. “This isn’t about politics. This is about who we are as Americans. Every American must unite and condemn the President’s calls for our murder and political violence. … Fear is contagious, but so is courage.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/veteransprotest-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-11-20 15:57:34.007033
,Mississippi Today,2025-11-20 20:21:29+00:00,Mississippi Today,Their loved one died far from home in a private Delta prison. Who’s accountable?,Mina Corpuz,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/20/men-died-in-a-private-delta-prison-whos-accountable/,At least five people who were from out of state or outside the county have died in the past 1 1/2 years inside the Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility.,"Michelle Hodges-Feek hasn’t opened the box in her living room that arrived weeks ago from Mississippi. 
She can’t bring herself to because inside are the cremated remains of her 40-year-old son, Daniel Hollan, who died Sept. 10 at a privately-run prison in the Mississippi Delta, hundreds of miles away. 
She didn’t get an opportunity to say goodbye. Months later, she has an official cause of death and a certificate, but she’s still left with questions: What happened? How or why did this happen? Who is responsible?
“Nobody cares that my son died except me, and all I got is a big box that I don’t have the guts to open yet,” Hodges-Feek, who lives outside of Kansas City, Kansas, said as she began to cry. 
One day she hopes to take a trip to Colorado, where their family previously lived, to have a memorial service for Hollan and spread his ashes. 
He is among at least five people who were from out of state or from outside the county who died in the last 1 1/2 years inside the Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility, a private prison operated by CoreCivic. Deaths there have left family members, like Hodges-Feek, uncertain about whom to go to for answers and whom to hold accountable. 
Hollan was convicted in Montana in 2017 and spent time in state and privately run prisons there before arriving in Mississippi in January among the first group of Montana prisoners at Tallahatchie Correctional. 
His mother sought answers and details from Mississippi and Montana prison officials, a county coroner and CoreCivic. 
It took a month for her to learn he died from an accidental drug overdose. Hollan had struggled with addiction before, but his mother believes he may have used drugs in prison to self-medicate. He had lived with chronic arthritis that affected his skin and joints and a more recent heart condition. 
To date, CoreCivic has contracted with four states, three counties, one U.S. territory and the U.S. Marshals Service to house people at the 2,672-bed Tallahatchie prison.
CoreCivic also signed a deal in February with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to expand immigration detention, including the use of 252 beds at the Tallahatchie facility. 
The facility houses detainees awaiting trial and the convicted, some serving up to life. A CoreCivic confirmed that pretrial detainees are housed separately from prisoners from state or federal agencies, but did not provide numbers of pretrial detainees and state prisoners. 
In the industry of incarceration, CoreCivic is one of the two largest private prison companies in the United States, operating more than 70 facilities. The Tennessee-based company reported quarterly earnings this month of $580.4 million, up from 18.1% from the prior year quarter. Tallahatchie Correctional is located in the small town of Tutwiler with a population of 1,635 – a fraction of the prison’s capacity. 
‘Is nobody responsible for these guys’ care?’
Hollan had never been to Mississippi, and it was not his decision to come. Montana prison officials, grappling with its prison population and needing to make upgrades to its main state facility, made the decision for him and 239 other prisoners when it signed a contract with CoreCivic. The state retained custody of him from hundreds of miles away.
Three years earlier, the Montana Board of Pardons and Parole ruled Hollan was not eligible for early release and needed to take a class. As he learned about his out-of-state transfer in 2025, he heard that the Arizona CoreCivic facility where Montana had already sent people offered the class he hoped to take to become eligible for parole, his mother said. 
By June of this year, Hollan was up for administrative parole review, but the board informed him by letter he was ineligible for early release again because he didn’t fulfill the class requirement. The board holds hearings and reviews for incarcerated people housed in Montana for state-owned facilities, as well as for those held out of state in private facilities like Tallahatchie Correctional. 
Hodges-Feek and her daughter, Rebecca McQuarrie, kept in touch with Hollan through several 5-minute weekly calls provided to prisoners. He shared that he had been trying to access medical care from the prison’s in-house staff for at least four months before his death.
“Is it Montana people who are watching them? Is it Montana people who are the guards?  It’s CoreCivic’s people who are the guards,” Hodges-Feek said.  “How can they pass the buck, is that legal? Is nobody responsible for these guys’ care?” 
In response, a CoreCivic spokesperson Brian Todd said the company is deeply saddened by the death of any person in its care, and that the company is serious about following standards and policies that its government partners expect. 
When someone dies, CoreCivic notifies the deceased’s home state and local law enforcement to conduct an investigation, Todd said. Then someone from Tallahatchie Correctional contacts the emergency contact listed in the prisoner or detainee’s file. 
“Every death is investigated thoroughly and transparently, but it’s important to note that the circumstances of each incident will dictate how the investigation is handled,” he said in a Thursday statement. “Our focus remains on doing everything possible to prevent these events from happening in the first place through training, oversight and continuous improvement in our standard of care.” 
Montana prisons spokesperson Alexandria Klapmeier wrote in an email that the Tutwiler Police Department investigated Hollan’s death and the Tallahatchie County Coroner’s Office was responsible for the death investigation.
Anthony Hawkins, the Tallahatchie coroner, confirmed he handles death investigations from the private prison, including that of Hollan and others sent from out of state or other Mississippi counties. After initially agreeing to speak, he has been unavailable for comment.

Hodges-Feek was told Hollan was found in his cell, blue in the face in the morning, multiple hours after he was last seen or heard from the previous day. She wonders if his cellmate or others had seen anything. 
She also submitted a public records request with the Montana Department of Corrections seeking copies of Hollan’s medical requests and related grievances. As of November, she is still waiting to receive those records. 
The Montana prison official who informed Hodges-Feek and his sister about Hollan’s death said it didn’t appear to be suicide, the women said. McQuarrie wanted confirmation because the youngest of her three brothers died from suicide in 2017 and she didn’t think her mother could handle losing another child that way. 
The state where a suspicious death occurs in a correctional facility outside Montana handles the investigation following that state’s legal processes and laws, Klapmeier said. Once the coroner finishes a death investigation, that official shares the information with the contract prison department and medical and investigation staff, she said.
Mississippi’s State Medical Examiner’s Office conducts the autopsies, as required by law for people who die in public or privately run prisons, jails or correctional facilities. The examination is used to help complete a death certificate, which is issued by the state Department of Health. 
That office completed Hollan’s autopsy and those of the Vermont prisoners and Hinds County detainees, said Bailey Martin, spokesperson for the Department of Public Safety, which oversees the medical examiner’s office.
Mitzi Magleby is an advocate who has worked with incarcerated people and their families in Mississippi’s state- and privately run prisons. Whenever anyone dies in prison, she said the priority should be informing families and guiding them through processes. 
“To me it’s a communication breakdown,” she said. “There’s not enough communication with these families. They’re in the dark.”
For out-of-state families like Hodges-Feek, Magleby said having to seek information from two state prison agencies and a private company is even more red tape to navigate. 
Klapmeier, the Montana prison spokesperson, said the state pays to bring the body of the deceased to their family’s choice of funeral home in the state or transport their cremation remains to the family. 
This was not made clear to Hodges-Feek. She said as her family considered the cost of bringing Hollan’s body home, her daughter and son-in-law considered taking out a loan to pay for it, but Hodges-Feek said she didn’t want them to take on that financial burden. Instead, she approved Hollan’s cremation in Mississippi.
Cremation felt like the only option to get her son home because it wasn’t clear where he would have been buried – Montana or Mississippi – if she pursued that option. 
‘The safest and most dignified option’
Two men from Vermont, which also contracts with CoreCivic, also died in the Tallahatchie facility.
At the end of February 2024, 71-year-old Alfred Brochu, who was serving life for murder, was found unresponsive in his cell and taken to a hospital where he died. He had been at Tallahatchie Correctional since 2011, Vermont media reported. 
Two weeks later in March, 43-year-old Sean Osterhout died. He came to Mississippi in 2019 and was serving up to a 30-year sentence for two charges of lewd and lascivious conduct with a child.
The Vermont Department of Corrections handled the death investigations and found that the deaths were not suspicious, said Haley Sommer, a department spokesperson for the Vermont Department of Corrections.
When a death of one of its people occurs at Tallahatchie Correctional, Vermont prison staff travel to the facility to look at circumstances that lead to the death and to consult with the medical team in Vermont about medical records, she said. From there, Vermont’s Defender General’s office has discretion of whether to conduct an investigation into a prison death.
Vermont has faced a challenge with space in its correctional facilities, and the state’s preference has been to send people out of state to reduce overcrowding at home, Sommer said.  
The state has contracted with CoreCivic since 2018, and Vermont has found that contracts with private companies like CoreCivic to be useful because the state is able to maintain custody, which includes making decisions about inmates’ medical care. 
“It is the safest and most dignified option,” Sommer said about sending inmates out of state to Mississippi and other prison facilities.

Months before Hollan’s death, Hinds County detainees Ulysses Nelson III and Christian Dyre, both 24, died within days of each other in the Tallahatchie facility. 
Dyre had been at Tallahatchie Correctional since October 2023 and was facing a murder charge, and Nelson had been at the prison since January awaiting trial for aggravated assault, domestic violence and rape, Hinds County Sheriff Tyree Jones said. 
Jones said their deaths were believed to be drug-related because there were reports of contraband in the zone where they both were housed. He said at the time that Tutwiler police would investigate and the State Medical Examiner’s Office would conduct an autopsy and toxicology reports. 
Todd, the CoreCivic spokesman, said there is a zero-tolerance policy for anyone to introduce contraband into its facilities. The company seeks to prevent contraband from coming through such measures as searches, patrols, monitoring systems and mail checks, he said. 
Tallahatchie Correctional medical staff immediately respond to emergency calls and are equipped to provide lifesaving care such as the administration of naloxone, which is an opioid-overdose reversing drug, he said. 
Mississippi Today requested records about the men’s cause of death, but the information was not available by publication. 
In an October interview, Jones would not comment about the sheriff’s office’s working relationship with operators of the Tallahatchie facility, citing ongoing litigation around the Hinds County Detention Center. 
In 2023, the county signed a two-year contract with CoreCivic to send detainees to the private prison due to limited staff and conditions of a housing pod that has been closed down.
‘Nobody cares about these boys once they get locked up’
In the weeks after his death, Hodges-Feeks joined a Facebook group with other family members with loved ones in CoreCivic facilities in Mississippi and Arizona, including those who died there. She now knows she is not alone. 
With questions still unanswered about her son’s death, Hodges-Feek and Hollan’s sister try to remember him as a person who put others first and had a good work ethic. When tornado sirens went off, Hollan was often the first to react and tell his family to get to a safe place. As a child, he saved his own money to buy a video game console.

But Hollan also had a knack for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. This, his mother said, paired with the death of his younger brother led him to turn to drugs and alcohol, and actions stemming from their use led to prison time, his mother said. 
After completing an earlier sentence, Hollan tried to get a fresh start in Montana. Instead, he began to use drugs again, which Hodges-Feek said contributed to another prison charge. Hollan was convicted in 2017 of prostitution and received a 99-year sentence with 75 years suspended, according to court records. 
Hodges-Feek kept in contact with her son over the years as he was moved to state-owned and private prisons in Montana. 
In Mississippi, Hollan used his free weekly calls to tell his mother and sister what he was experiencing: How January rain caused flooding in the prison and the summer passed without air conditioning.
Hodges-Feek has seen how her older son, who also served time in prison, was able to turn his life around. She wonders what could have happened if Hollan had received a similar chance. 
“(Daniel) never got the opportunity,” she said. “Nobody cares about those boys once they get locked up.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20131305/MT-TallahatchieCoCorrectionalFacility-FeatImage-02.jpg,,,2025-11-20 15:57:34.007033

(Photo by Leah Romero / Source NM)New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver recently signed a letter to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem expressing concern about the federal government’s request for states’ voter rolls.
The Nov. 18 letter, as Colorado Newsline originally reported, was signed by 10 Democratic secretaries of state, and raises concerns about inconsistent information from the federal agencies about how they are using and sharing voter data requested from states in recent months.
The election officials’ recent letter notes that everyone who signed it—which in addition to Toulouse Oliver includes the secretaries of state from Arizona, California, Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont and Washington—received letters requesting voter data lists—in some cases redacted lists that included “dates of birth, state driver’s license numbers, and last four digits of Social Security numbers.”
In the case of New Mexico, as Source NM previously reported, the United States Department of Justice initially reached out to Toulouse Oliver in July. She told Source NM this week the state provided the federal government with “the publicly available file that anyone has access to,” which does not include Social Security Numbers and only years of birth.
Following the requests for data, the letter says, officials heard inconsistent information about how the information would be used.

According to the letter, at the end of August in a phone call meeting arranged by the National Association of Secretaries of State, a U.S. Department of Justice representative said the lists would be used to assess compliance with the Help America Vote Act and the National Voter Registration Act.
Then a DHS official named Heather Honey, in a separate meeting, said that “that DHS had not received voter data or requested it. She then suggested that DHS had no intention of using voter data.”
That information was contradicted when the Trump administration acknowledged that the Department of Justice was sharing voter information with Homeland Security to search for non-citizens.
Honey, according to the DHS website, holds a position as Deputy Assistant Secretary for elections integrity. The letter from the secretaries of states notes that Honey “has a history of spreading false claims about elections.”
She pushed to overturn Trump’s loss in the 2020 election. Now she’ll help oversee election security.

“Federal law and the U.S. Constitution are clear: states are responsible for administering elections,” the letter reads. “Additionally, transmitting this information to another federal agency raises serious Privacy Act concerns and risks improper dissemination of and access to sensitive voter data. We are deeply concerned about the inconsistent and misleading information that Secretaries have received from the DOJ and DHS and with the potential lack of compliance with federal law.”
The letter asks for answers to a series of questions by Dec. 1 about how the voter information has or will be used or shared.
In response to a query from Source NM regarding the letter, a U.S. Department of Justice spokesperson referenced a previous statement on the topic provided by a spokesperson that says:
“Enforcing the Nation’s elections laws is a priority in this administration and in the Civil Rights Division.  Congress gave the Justice Department authority under the NVRA, HAVA, the Civil Rights Act, and other statutes to ensure that states have proper voter registration procedures and programs to maintain clean voter rolls containing only eligible voters in federal elections. The recent request by the Civil Rights Division for state voter rolls is pursuant to that statutory authority, and the responsive data is being screened for ineligible voter entries.”
Source has a pending query with Homeland Security regarding the letter and its content.
In a phone interview Wednesday, Toulouse Oliver told Source NM that she had two main concerns about the federal government’s request for voter data rolls. First: “What is the data being used for outside of verifying citizenship? That’s a big concern, because we’re not in the business of creating citizenship lists or providing information to [Immigration Customs Enforcement] that would potentially harm people who are legally here in the United States. We’ve seen from many, many news reports, there are a number of people that ICE have detained that are either US citizens or have legal status, so to me, that’s deeply concerning.”
Toulouse noted, as she has previously to Source, that she’s not worried “that there is some huge amount, if any, non-citizens on our voter registration list. What I am concerned about goes to the number two concern, which is they have insisted that we send them our data and that they do the matching. And that’s not how it works. We, the county clerks and my office, are experts in matching data for voter registration purposes, and we go out of our way to ensure that a match is an accurate match.”
Accurate matches, she said, “go beyond having the same name and birth date. Because you can have two Juan Sanchezes with the same birth date; it’s not hard to imagine in New Mexico. We have deep concerns about how they are doing their matches and what is the level of scrutiny that’s being applied to that process.”
If state officials were doing the checking, Toulouse Oliver noted, “I would trust that process a lot more than whatever mysterious process they’re doing because, again, I know that we are going to exhaust every possible resource at our disposal to ensure that when we say this person is a non-citizen and they’re on the voter registration list, that we are sure that they are and or that we have a high percentage of being sure.”
The bottom line, she said, “they’re actually using voter registration as a tool to try to find non-citizens to prosecute or persecute through their other agenda regarding non-citizens. And it’s not, in my mind, about making sure we don’t have non-citizens on the voting rolls, although that should be a goal that we all share. It’s more about using that data for other purposes.”
And while Toulouse Oliver said she doesn’t necessarily expect to receive a response to the questions posed by the letter, “If I don’t stand up and use my voice for what is right, then I’m complicit. If I don’t stand up and I don’t say, ‘Hey, this is wrong. Can you please provide us with some answers?’ then I’m not doing my job.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/elex3LR-2048x1356-1-1024x678.png,,,2025-11-20 15:57:34.007033

July 19, 2022. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance.After a federal appeals court held that Michigan is not immune to legal action for its decision to revoke a Canadian energy company’s easement to operate a pipeline in the Great Lakes, the Whitmer Administration is seeking an appeal to the United States Supreme Court. 
In a petition filed on Nov. 13, attorneys for the state have asked the high court to weigh whether the state is entitled to legal immunity in cases where a private entity seeks relief that would diminish the state’s ownership and control of its own lands. 
Attorney General Dana Nessel argued the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals erred when it agreed that Enbridge Energy’s case against Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Scott Bowen, the director of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, fell within the exceptions to sovereign immunity, which prevents a state from being sued in state or federal courts without its consent. 
“This Court’s intervention is urgently needed because the Sixth Circuit’s rule strikes at not one, but two core attributes of statehood: a State’s immunity from suit and its dominion over sovereign lands,” attorneys for the state wrote in their petition. 
20251113124945367_Whitmer v Enbridge Petition A
Enbridge filed its lawsuit against the state in response to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s decision to revoke and terminate its permit to operate the Line 5 pipeline on the bottomlands of the Straits of Mackinac, where Lake Michigan and Lake Huron meet. 
Whitmer and Nessel, alongside Native American Tribes and environmental activists have raised alarms about the potential for the pipeline to rupture, with one University of Michigan researcher concluding the Straits of Mackinac are the “worst possible place” for a Great Lakes oil spill. 
While the state argued Enbridge had repeatedly violated the easement’s terms, the company argued that the governor and the Department of Natural Resources have no authority over pipeline safety matters and that the termination of their permit ran afoul of the Federal Pipeline Safety Act and the 1977 transit pipelines treaty with Canada. 
Although Enbridge was given until Dec. 17 to respond to the state’s petition to the Supreme Court, the company filed a document noting it does not intend to respond.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9924-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-20 15:57:34.007033

Toby Overdorf speaks to reporters after a property tax meeting on Nov. 20, 2025. (Via Liv  Caputo/Florida Phoenix)Florida House Democrats found common ground with Gov. Ron DeSantis Thursday in vehemently opposing Republicans’ eight property tax proposals, all of which have passed their first committee hurdles along party lines.
The measures aim to slash most property taxes while keeping law enforcement funding intact. Although seven of the eight are proposals to amend the state Constitution, House Republicans wouldn’t mind presenting voters with all seven options on the November ballot — over DeSantis’ objections and Democrats’ fears of harming local governments.
“None of these proposals directly conflicts with another,” said Rep. Toby Overdorf, R-Palm City, chair of the 37-member House Select Committee on Property Taxes. “There may be some overlap between some of the proposals, but there’s not conflict.”
DeSantis has bitterly feuded with House Republicans since Miami Rep. Danny Perez took the helm as Speaker last year. Perez, a Republican, urged his members to shift away from the dogged obedience to DeSantis demonstrated as the governor ran for president, and toward independence.
He systematically opposed DeSantis on most proposals, drawing the governor’s ire as he began to insult the GOP-supermajority House as “rotten” and recently called their property tax proposals “milquetoast.”
Overdorf told reporters following Thursday’s meeting that he’d “love to compare plans” with the governor “once we receive a plan from him.” None of the House’s proposals are, as of yet, mirrored in the Senate.
“None of the bills address that…”
Democrats joined not only DeSantis but a slew of local government officials in opposing each of the eight proposals Republicans presented. 
City commissioners, mayors, and pro-local groups spoke during Thursday’s four-hour meeting as nearly all derided the measures as potentially expensive, dangerous, and harmful to their communities.
They argued that, although each of the measures stays away from school property taxes and forbids de-funding law enforcement, the “drastic” cuts could make it difficult to fund firefighters, emergency management services, and other locally covered services largely drawn from property taxes,
Port St. Lucie Vice Mayor Jolien Caraballo said that 49% of her city’s $212.5 million general fund comes from property taxes. She claimed that if some of these proposals were enacted, it would leave her city with $108.3 million. Of that, $94.6 million goes to law enforcement.
“That [would leave] only $13.7 million to fund every other department to support our more than 263,000 citizens,” Caraballo said.
Similar sentiments were echoed by representatives from Apopka, Wauchula, and Bartow. Democrat Rep. Mike Gottlieb argued that none of the measures address spiraling housing costs.
“The real drivers of higher housing costs are limited supplies, zoning barriers, construction costs, and soaring insurance and HOA fees,” he said. “None of the bills address that.”
What are the proposals?
Here’s a list of the proposals filed by House Republicans, as the Phoenix has previously reported.

HJR 201 by Rep. Kevin Steele (R-Dade City): Would eliminate all non-school homestead property taxes. If approved by voters, the House staff analysis estimates it will have a negative cash impact of $14.1 billion and a negative recurring impact of $18.3 billion. Recurring means a continuing loss year after year.
HJR 203 by Monique Miller (R-Palm Bay): Would phase out non-school homestead property taxes annually over 10 years. The House staff analysis estimates it will have a negative cash impact of $4.4 billion and a negative recurring impact of $13.3 billion.
HJR 205 by Juan Porras (R-Miami): Would exempt Florida residents over the age of 65 from paying non-school homestead property taxes. The House staff analysis estimates it will have a negative cash impact of $5.1 billion and a negative recurring impact of $6.7 billion.
HJR 207 by Rep. Shane Abbott (R-DeFuniak Springs): Would create a new homestead exemption for non-school property taxes equal to 25% of the assessed value of the House. The House staff analysis estimates it will have a negative cash impact of $3.5 billion and a negative recurring impact of $4.6 billion.
HJR 209 by Rep. Demi Busatta (R-Miami): Would create a new property insurance relief homestead exemption of $100,000 — as long as the property is covered by a comprehensive “multiperil” property insurance policy. The House staff analysis estimates it will have a negative cash impact of $6.6 billion and a negative recurring impact of $8.6 billion.
HJR 211 by Rep. Toby Overdorf (R-Palm City): Eliminates the cap on a portability transfer under Florida’s Save Our Homes benefit, allowing a homeowner to transfer their entire accumulated Save Our Homes benefit to their new home, even if that home has a lesser value.  The House staff analysis estimates it will have a negative cash impact of $42.7 million, and a negative recurring impact of $336.8 million.
HJR 213 by Rep. Griff Griffitts (R-Panama City Beach): Would llimit the growth in assessed value of non-school homestead property to 3% over three years (it’s now 3% per year) and 15% over three years for non-homestead property (it’s 10% per year now). The House staff analysis estimates it will have a negative cash impact of $1.7 billion, and  negative recurring impact of $5.2 billion.

HB 215 by Rep. Jon Albert (R-Frostproof): The only bill, not proposed amendment, filed. The measure would make various statutory changes including requiring a 2/3 vote for any increase in the millage rate by a local government and allow newly married couples to combine their accumulated Save Our Homes benefits, not exceeding a total of $500,000.

When two unmarked SUVs full of Border Patrol agents arrived Tuesday at the Cary construction site where Vazquez, 18, is employed, the only thing he could think of was to call his dad, another worker on the site. “I just told him, run, and to hide.”
The work at the site was virtually complete, with only around 10 workers present on an average day. Because of absences — with fears of Border Patrol and ICE chilling construction sites across the Triangle — Vazquez said there were only about four people on the site, part of why he didn’t believe they would be targeted.
“I didn’t believe it would happen to me,” Vazquez said. “I was born here.”

Vazquez had left the site to buy a drink at a nearby store. As he walked back, he saw a gray Chevy Tahoe and a black Ford Expedition roll up to the site. Vazquez retreated into a fenced-off HVAC area and took out his phone to get a better look at them.
But the agents had already spotted him.
The agents who approached him wore masks, gloves, and dark glasses. At first, Vazquez reserved his right to remain silent, but when one agent began questioning him in Spanish, he started swearing at them “to make time to stall them,” he said. “I’m thinking about the workers and my dad.”
As he tried to step out of the enclosure, he said, Border Patrol agents climbed over the fence to corner him. One yanked an AirPod out of Vazquez’s ear and set it on the AC unit beside him. When Vazquez tried to retrieve it and put it back in the case, he said, the agent shouted, “Don’t touch me.”
“I’m like, ‘I’m not touching you.’ And then he said, ‘If you touch me, there’s going to be a problem,’” Vazquez said.
That was when they handcuffed him and searched him, pulling his wallet out of his pocket.
“They saw my North Carolina Real ID,” he said. “They were looking for an ID or some sort of documentation, so at that moment, they could have let me free. But no, they decided to take me.”
Vazquez was placed in the SUV with one of his fellow workers on the construction site, a young man who was crying. As they drove away, the agents continued to question Vazquez, asking him again where he was from and where he was born as they went through his wallet.
When he told them he was born in Raleigh, the agent questioning him grew angry, Vazquez said. They abruptly pulled off the road into the parking lot of a carpet cleaning company, where they dumped him, a half mile away from where they picked him up, throwing his wallet and cards out of the SUV window as they drove off.
“I have no idea why they just dropped me off,” he added. “I kind of felt like I was being kidnapped.”
His video of Border Patrol uncuffing him and driving away has gone viral on TikTok, accumulating 3 million views and thousands of concerned comments. In the video, an agent with his face covering lowered appears to lunge at the phone with a raised hand, which Vazquez said he believed was an attempt by the agent to conceal his identity.
As Vazquez left the SUV, the other detainee asked him, “Tell my brother that they got me.”
“It devastated me,” Vazquez said. “It broke my heart to realize how two brothers were being separated in front of my eyes.”
As he ran back to the site, he called his mom to pick him up. His first reaction was fear that his dad may have been taken in the other SUV. When he told her what happened, she didn’t believe him. “Until she heard me running worried and worried, that’s when she believed me,” he said.
When he got back to the site, he told his dad and the detainee’s brother, another worker on the site, what happened. “His brother was just outside in shock,” he said.
The other worker told Vazquez that another Border Patrol vehicle was still patrolling the area, so he called his mom back, warning her not to pick him up. Instead, he got the keys from his dad and drove home himself.
Vazquez’s encounter with Border Patrol comes as immigration enforcement agencies conduct large-scale raids in Charlotte, Raleigh, and surrounding areas. He was far from the only U.S. citizen to be swept up in them.
A spokesman for Customs and Border Protection declined to comment on the incident, but said Thursday afternoon that Operation Charlotte’s Web in North Carolina has resulted in 370 arrests. “The operation is not over and it is not ending anytime soon,” Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.
Earlier Thursday, Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden said he had been told by federal agents that Border Patrol operations had ceased in Charlotte, though he noted that ICE will continue to operate in the area “as they always have.”
It is unclear whether Border Patrol operations in the Triangle area remain ongoing. A spokeswoman for Wake County Sheriff Willie Rowe said their office has had no communication from federal authorities.

North Carolina politicians from both parties have urged federal agents to focus their efforts on criminals instead of carrying out indiscriminate arrests.
Sen. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) wrote in a post on X that operations should target “those who not only violated our immigration law but also pose a threat to our communities.”
“Federal law enforcement has been tasked with removing criminal offenders who never should’ve been in the U.S.,” Budd wrote Wednesday. “They should carry out this mission responsibly to ensure that violent individuals are quickly identified, detained, and deported.”
Gov. Josh Stein issued a direct condemnation of ICE and Border Patrol for “operating in the shadows” in the state on Tuesday.
“If this were targeted to going after known people who are criminals or known people who are drug traffickers who are engaged in violent crime, that would be a good thing,” Stein said after an event in Benson. “But they’re just sweeping sidewalks. They’re sweeping parking lots. They’re going into stores and churches.”
“This is causing widespread fear, widespread uncertainty,” he added. “This is not about public safety, and I wish that it were.”
Vazquez said he would advise those concerned they could be picked up to carry their documentation with them at all times. If possible, he said, don’t leave the house at all.
“If you don’t have to come outside, don’t come outside,” he said. “If you need any help, ask somebody.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CBP-Drives-Away-e1763667956759.png,,,2025-11-20 15:57:34.007033

The railroad is seen at left running through town and meeting up with the river near the top of the frame. (William Woody for Colorado Newsline)State leaders are applauding another major step finalized Wednesday toward permanently protecting upper Colorado River water flows on the Western Slope.
Members of the Colorado Water Conservation Board gave unanimous approval to an agreement between Xcel Energy and the Colorado River District, which manages water supplies for 15 Western Slope counties, to transfer two key water rights associated with the Shoshone Hydroelectric Generating Station to the district for $99 million.
The terms of that deal called for the CWCB, which manages water resources statewide, to approve the Shoshone water rights as “instream flow” rights under a state program created in the 1970s to secure water rights for “nonconsumptive,” environmental uses. The two water rights held by the small hydropower plant date to 1905 and 1940 and add up to over 1,400 cubic feet per second of Colorado River water flows — two factors that would make it the most substantial set of rights ever secured by the instream flow program.

“The importance of today’s vote cannot be overstated as a legacy decision for Colorado water and the Western Slope,” Andy Mueller, general manager of the Colorado River District, said in a statement. “It secures an essential foundation for the health of the Colorado River and the communities it sustains.”
Western Slope counties have worried for years about the consequences for Colorado River flows if the Shoshone plant, which is now nearly 120 years old, were to be bought and shut down. Located just east of Glenwood Springs, the plant has a maximum capacity of 15 megawatts, making it one of the smaller generation assets in Xcel’s portfolio.
But the “seniority” of the power station’s 1905 water right is a powerful tool in shaping regional water use — including how much of the Colorado River is siphoned off by Front Range water utilities through transbasin diversions. While the Colorado River District says its aim is to preserve the river’s historical status quo, utilities including Denver Water have voiced concerns about the effect the deal could have on their more junior water rights.
“Acquiring the Shoshone water rights for instream flow use is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to preserve and improve the natural environment of the Colorado River,” said Dan Gibbs, executive director of Colorado Department of Natural Resources. “But I also want to stress that the state is committed to ensuring that the historical use of the water rights is maintained at the status quo and we are committed to participating in any process to settle and resolve these issues for all water users.”
In addition to the go-ahead from the CWCB on Wednesday, the $99 million agreement between Xcel and the Colorado River District in 2023 is contingent on approval by a state water court and the Public Utilities Commission. The Shoshone Water Rights Coalition, made up of local governments supporting the deal, has secured $57 million in funding from its members and from the state, but it needs another $40 million from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which was included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.
“Those funds remain under review by the current administration,” the Colorado River District said in a statement. U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, in a press release applauding the deal, called on the Trump administration to “heed the bipartisan, statewide support” and release the funding promptly.
“Thousands of Coloradans, our fish, and our wildlife depend on this water every day,” Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement. “This is another step toward finalizing a powerful tool for supporting competing demands — hydropower, environment, agriculture and recreation — while giving west slope water users more certainty about our future water security.”

Maura Healey’s desk, and what’s still on hold until 2026 now that the Legislature is done with major business for the year?","IT’LL BE A FEW more weeks until the icicle lights go up, but the holiday season has already begun atop Beacon Hill. 
Lawmakers on Wednesday concluded their final formal sessions for the year, kicking off a break of six weeks or longer. The House and Senate will continue to meet twice per week in that span, though those gatherings will be lightly attended informal sessions where only minor, uncontroversial business can be considered. 
All of the big stuff that did not get addressed before the final gavel rang out Wednesday night is now, essentially, on hold until 2026. 
So what happened with the legislation that was on the move this week? 
On the governor’s desk 
Other than half a dozen local bills or land transfers, the only significant measure to get all the way to Gov. Maura Healey on Wednesday was a $2.3 billion spending bill needed to close the state’s financial books for the fiscal year that ended June 30. 
Lawmakers were, once again, late getting to the matter. State law technically requires the comptroller to file a financial report by October 31, which cannot happen until the Legislature and governor agree on a so-called closeout budget. 
For the sixth time in the past seven years, the final legislative action on the annual bill did not come until after the Halloween deadline. Comptroller William McNamara warned two weeks ago that the tardiness could prompt the federal government to “slow or withhold federal funds,” according to the State House News Service. 
Healey will get 10 days to review the measure, which injects more than $1.6 billion into MassHealth, all but $303 million of which is poised to be reimbursed by Washington, DC. 
Senate budget chief Michael Rodrigues said spending on the state’s Medicaid program — which could be upended in coming years by already-approved federal cuts — has been “growing exponentially.” 
“It’s growing much higher than predicted, much higher than the health care benchmarks that were established,” Rodrigues told reporters Monday. “That’s something that certainly has us concerned.” 
The bill also transfers $50 million toward rental housing support, provides another $12 million for free K-12 school meals, and makes $10 million in state funding available for the 2026 World Cup, as long as event organizers secure private matching dollars. 
Legislative negotiators settled on providing just $27 million for county sheriffs, withholding the majority of the funding law enforcement officials sought until after a proposed inspector general review of their spending habits. 
It’s not clear if Healey will agree with that approach or will instead push for the full appropriation she originally proposed. A Healey spokesperson said last month only that the governor would review whatever legislation she receives. 
The closeout budget has some notable policy riders, too, including language opening up access to some patient records at current and former state-run facilities and provisions decoupling vaccination schedules from the recommendations of a federal panel whose approach has created concerns among scientists. 
Approved in both chambers, but not yet to the governor 
After working through dozens of amendments, the Senate voted in favor of a major marijuana industry reform bill just after 9 p.m. Wednesday. 
The House already approved its own version of the bill back in June, and now Democrats in each chamber will need to reconcile differences between the measures before they can send a final version to Healey. 
Both bills would overhaul the Cannabis Control Commission, which has been marked by a series of controversies, and shrink its membership from five to three. They would also increase the number of cannabis licenses a single retailer could hold and boost the purchase and possession limit for recreational users. 
“This legislation is not about starting over,” Sen. Adam Gomez, who co-chairs the Legislature’s Cannabis Policy Committee, said Wednesday. “It’s about building on what we’ve learned. It’s about making sure that our laws keep pace with the current industry while protecting consumers, supporting small businesses, and advancing equity.” 
Lawmakers have not yet appointed a so-called conference committee of representatives and senators that would be tasked with ironing out a compromise version. They could do that next week, or legislative leaders could instead work more informally to come to an agreement on what to ship to the governor. 
Headed to DC 
Both branches were in alignment on action they say will protect the country from potential overreach by the Trump administration. 
Article V of the US Constitution allows constitutional amendments to be considered at a convention if two-thirds of state Legislatures request such a summit.  
Massachusetts previously transmitted requests for an Article V convention to Congress that technically remain pending, including one sent in 1977 seeking a constitutional ban on abortion, according to House Speaker Ron Mariano’s office. 
An Article V convention has never happened, but Democrats are concerned that leaving those resolutions in place could push the nation closer to the critical mass required for one, where President Donald Trump and Republicans could pursue sweeping changes to the Constitution. 
The House and Senate voted Wednesday to rescind all previous Article V resolutions adopted in Massachusetts, which legislative leaders say makes Massachusetts the 17th state to do so — putting the two-thirds majority out of reach for those who want a convention. 
“Without clear boundaries, an Article V convention could open the door to rewriting the very foundations of our democracy,” said House Assistant Majority Leader Alice Peisch. “It could jeopardize the principles that generations of Americans have fought and sacrificed to preserve.” 
The newly approved resolutions will now be transmitted to the clerk of the US House and the secretary of the US Senate.  
Through one branch, but not the other 
The Legislature operates on two-year cycles, and bills do not expire in between years one and two. So for legislative leaders in either chamber, the final flurry of activity was a chance to get a couple of priorities done and officially shift the onus to their counterparts across the hall. 
On Tuesday, the penultimate day for major business this year, the House approved a nearly $3.3 billion rewrite of Healey’s borrowing bill designed to fund campus infrastructure improvements at public colleges and universities. 
The House on Wednesday also advanced legislation aiming to rein in violence that health care professionals face at work by establishing new preventative standards and boosting reporting requirements. 
Neither measure has emerged yet in the Senate, which will almost certainly wait until the new year to act, if it does.  
Never came up  
For more than a week, it seemed like House Democrats would push for a vote on sweeping energy legislation that sought to rein in utility prices while also defanging the state’s 2030 decarbonization requirements. 
Rep. Mark Cusack, the architect of the dramatic rewrite to Healey’s energy affordability bill, said he hoped for a vote before the holiday break and that he had the backing of the speaker. 
But the proposal did not get to the House floor after all. Following immense blowback from environmental groups, House Ways and Means Committee Chair Aaron Michlewitz — a top Mariano deputy — said his panel still has “a lot of work to do” before any bill on the topic is ready for action. 
“We are probably going to have to have to have a conversation at some point related to whether we can meet our goals for 2030,” Michlewitz said Monday. “I think that’s a real challenge that we’re facing, particularly when you have a federal government that is trying to thwart us at every possible turn in relation to trying to get to those goals. Having that conversation is certainly coming to a head at some point, but I do not think it will be in this vehicle as we move forward.”  
The retreat delays any action on Healey’s energy affordability until 2026.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_6282-edited-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024%2C767&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-20 14:57:45.761185

This is the fourth large data center planned for Mississippi, with a combined $29 billion in investments. There are already two Amazon data centers being built in Madison County.  
With the current artificial-intelligence boom, companies are building data centers across the country. Many are being built in the Deep South because of its abundant land and water resources, less environmental regulations and relatively cheap energy for the power-hungry centers.
The center planned for Warren County will create at least 200 full-time jobs according to a statement from Amazon and Gov. Tate Reeves’ office. Reeves said it would be the largest private investment in Warren County’s history. Construction is expected to start in 2026.
Amazon also announced it would commit $150,000 to a new Amazon Warren County Community Program that will provide grants to local organizations.
While data centers promise jobs and tax revenue, critics have pointed out that they create very few jobs relative to the size of the investment and footprint. They have raised concerns over environmental impact, energy consumption and prices for consumers and lack of public transparency about their development or operations.

Its first round of recommendations largely involves what happens after they commit offenses, both minor and violent.
The committee met Tuesday to discuss proposals to send House Speaker Murrell Smith, a Sumter Republican who appointed the six-member panel. Most involve amending bills filed earlier this year that deal with violence and overcrowding at state-run juvenile jails.
The proposed changes to state law would reduce or eliminate time youth spend in detention centers before their case goes to trial, as well as push older, more violent teens into the adult justice system.

The committee took no votes. But committee members and staff will work with leaders at the state Department of Juvenile Justice over the next month to draft the language, Rep. Brandon Cox, the panel’s chairman, told the SC Daily Gazette.
The Goose Creek Republican said he’ll then work Smith’s office to pre-file the bills for the 2026 legislative session that begins in mid-January.
What they’re working on
Proposals include partially walking back South Carolina’s so-called “Raise the Age” law for 16-year-olds accused of violent offenses that carry a possible 30-year sentence and 17-year-olds accused of gun crimes. Instead of starting in the juvenile court system, as required since 2019, those youth would automatically be charged as adults.
Between July 2018 and June 2024, 166 16-year-olds accused of attempted murder and first-degree burglary were referred to the juvenile justice system. Of those, family court judges chose to transfer 58 to the adult system, according to data provided by the state Department of Juvenile Justice.
Following the agency’s advice, the legislative committee also wants to give family and circuit court judges more options when it comes to sentencing teens.
“Right now, we’re kind of stuck in our juvenile system,” the agency’s director, Eden Hendrick, told the legislators.
Youth younger than 18 who are convicted of murder can be sentenced to a juvenile facility for no more than 4½ years. But if they’re tried in Circuit Court as an adult, the sentence is 30 years to life, she said.

“There’s nothing in between that,” Hendrick said. “It doesn’t make any sense.”
“We know that youth are different than adults,” she added. “We should have some other options.”
There are also efforts that do away with, or at least lessen, any jail time for what are known as status offenses, such as skipping school or running away from home.
“Usually, when law enforcement’s called in the middle of the night, they have two options: detention or placing the youth in foster care,” Hendrick said. “And neither one of those are really appropriate.”
On Hendrick’s advice, the to-be-drafted legislation would also remove the possibility of pre-trial detention for juveniles charged with misdemeanors that carry sentences of 30 days or less. Such crimes include minor theft, property damage, and simple assault for a schoolyard fight.
Those are among the most frequent crimes committed by juveniles in the state over the past five years, according to data presented by State Law Enforcement Division Chief Mark Keel. In 2024, they accounted for more than half — 16,264 of the 28,128 offenses — committed by youth younger than 18.
Ideally, Hendrick said, the state would have safe places in each county to hold children until they can get before a judge. But that’s not the case, so she suggested allowing juveniles to stay home, possibly with ankle monitors, as long as they’re not a danger to the community.
The panel also wants to address sentences for children who violate probation.
More than 25K SC teens committed crimes last year. Legislators are looking for solutions.

How teens get guns
Of all the ideas discussed, only one involved guns.
It’s illegal for a teenager younger than 18 to buy or carry a gun under state law. Last year, more than 1,600 teens 17 and under were charged with illegally owning or carrying them. Most of those guns are stolen from locked vehicles, Keel testified.
Gun owners often are unwilling to report theft, either out of embarrassment or not knowing the specifics of their gun, such as the serial number, he told legislators.
The idea of penalizing adult gun owners who leave their vehicle unlocked, resulting in a stolen firearm, came up.
But only freshman Rep. Harriet Holman, R-Ridgeville, appeared willing to go there.
Holman said someone stole her husband’s gun out of his vehicle about six years ago. Because he filed a report, police ultimately located and returned it to him.
“So, if there’s some way that, when people’s firearms are stolen out of their vehicles, that they’ll report it — some incentive to tell them to report these firearms — would be very important,” said the retired Army lieutenant colonel. “That way we could have accountability on how many firearms are even out there loose like that.”
Gun owners are supposed to report theft. The so-called requirement was added to last year’s so-called “constitutional carry” law, which allows adults to carry a handgun — openly or concealed — without a permit. But there’s no penalty for not reporting, making it more of an encouragement.
That law also forbids law enforcement from stopping someone just because they see a gun. That means officers can’t stop a juvenile toting a gun for that alone because there’s no way to tell for certain whether someone’s 18 years old or 16 just by looking at them.
SC juvenile justice changeups add capacity to reduce overcrowding, violence

According to Cox, a U.S. Air Force veteran, South Carolina has a long history of not requiring citizens to report information about the guns they own to the government.
“This seems like a straightforward, common sense issue, but as the committee takes it up … we have to be very careful because of the constitutional implications,” he said.
Holman countered, “I just don’t personally see the harm of reporting something stolen from you.”
“I just think it is being responsible to allow the authorities to know that your weapon is out there and it could be being carried by a youth,” she said.
This is just the first round of legislation the panel plans to champion.
In January, the group will reconvene and attempt to come up with solutions to more complex issues that lead teens down violent paths, Cox said. That would likely include adding or expanding existing grant programs to fund community nonprofits focused on mentoring youth.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC_0905-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-20 14:57:45.761185

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)In a split ruling that has far-reaching implications for child abuse cases, the New Jersey Supreme Court on Thursday barred prosecutors from blaming shaken baby syndrome for children’s unexplained head trauma in criminal and custody cases.
Justice Fabiana Pierre-Louis, in a lengthy majority decision that five other justices joined, said the syndrome has not been generally accepted in the biomechanical community, making expert testimony about it unreliable and inadmissible in court. While child abuse is unquestionably reprehensible, the courts must ensure proceedings are fair to both defendants and their accusers, she wrote.
“Regardless of the severity or viciousness of a crime … only evidence that is sufficiently reliable and has probative value not outweighed by the evidence’s prejudicial effect may be presented to the jurors to inform their consideration of the charges against the accused,” she wrote. “That requirement extends to expert testimony, which must be properly admitted like all evidence.”

Thursday’s decision affirms lower court rulings that had declared shaken baby syndrome “junk science.”
Justice Rachel Wainer Apter penned a fiery and solo 44-page dissent that is sure to fuel the ongoing global debate about shaken baby syndrome, which is also known as abusive head trauma. She warned that “every other state” allows such testimony and “every other court that has considered the question” has upheld it as admissible.
It has been generally accepted in the medical community, Wainer Apter noted, citing endorsements by more than 20 professional medical organizations and a 2018 consensus statement by physicians and pediatric radiologists that the American Academy of Pediatrics backed.
The majority opinion places a handful of biomechanical engineers “on equal footing with the consensus perspective of every major medical society in the world and grants the former a veto over the latter. What’s more, it does so in a case about the admissibility of a medical diagnosis,” she wrote.

She added: “Judicial humility requires us to accept that we are judges, not scientists. Nor are we experts in the scientific method … In this case, recognizing that we are not scientists requires acknowledging that what the majority calls Shaken Baby Syndrome/Abusive Head Trauma (SBS/AHT), and what scientists simply call Abusive Head Trauma (AHT), is generally accepted by those who are.”
Scientific unanimity is not required for testimony to be valid, she added, citing a 1994 California appellate ruling.

In other cases where the New Jersey Supreme Court has deemed evidence scientifically deficient — including voiceprint analysis, claims that rapists share psychological traits, and height deductions based on a person’s shoe size — no major scientific association endorsed those claims, she added.

The courts should allow testimony on shaken baby syndrome and let jurors decide for themselves whether it’s scientifically sound, she wrote.
“Acknowledging a debate and granting a new trial to allow experts to dispute the merits of a particular medical diagnosis is entirely different from prohibiting a trial from taking place at all. The majority has chosen the latter,” she wrote.
 Widespread impact
Defense attorneys celebrated the ruling, saying it gives new grounds for appeal for countless people convicted in cases with no signs of impact, visible injuries, or other evidence of abuse.
A person’s liberty cannot depend on expert evidence that lacks scientific grounding, cross-disciplinary support, or methodological reliability, the New Jersey Office of the Public Defender said.
“The Constitution demands more than speculation dressed in scientific language. It requires reliable, validated, scientific evidence. And that’s what the court said,” said Danica Rue, the office’s executive director of investigations and police accountability. “I would certainly hope that people are able to now seek justice where it was not meted out earlier.”
Attorneys for the state had warned that prohibiting testimony about shaken baby syndrome in criminal cases would represent “a significant setback to public safety” and interfere with state child welfare workers’ ability to remove children from parents and guardians suspected of abuse. About 1,300 cases of shaken baby syndrome are reported in the U.S. every year, according to the National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome.
Spokespeople for the state Attorney General’s Office, whose attorneys argued the case, declined to comment.
In the two unrelated cases decided by the court Thursday, authorities accused two fathers, Darryl Nieves and Michael Cifelli, of assaulting their children.
Nieves was charged with aggravated assault and endangering the welfare of a child after three incidents over a two-week period in February 2017, when his 11-month-old son became limp and appeared to lose consciousness. Cifelli was similarly charged after his 10-week-old son had to be hospitalized twice in December 2016 and January 2017 for vomiting and seizure-like behavior.
The babies, both born premature, were found to have the “triad of symptoms” typically associated with shaken baby syndrome — subdural hematomas, retinal hemorrhages, and encephalopathy, according to the ruling. But prosecutors in both cases couldn’t otherwise show the fathers assaulted the infants. The same Middlesex County pediatrician, Dr. Gladibel Medina, attributed both infants’ injuries to shaken baby syndrome.
The public defender’s office represented Nieves, who was barred from seeing his child for years while his prosecution and the appeals unfolded, Rue said.
“The impact that this decision will have on families in the state of New Jersey really cannot be overstated,” she said. “There are hundreds of people, perhaps more, who have been separated from their children, who have been criminally prosecuted and received felony convictions for this. There are people sitting in prison right now who have been convicted under this now debunked theory. So this is a tremendously important decision.”
The court’s majority said prosecutors should continue working to hold child abusers accountable — but must do so by showing physical evidence of trauma or other evidence of abuse.
Shaken baby syndrome could be considered in child abuse cases again someday “if new, reliable, scientific evidence is developed,” Pierre-Louis wrote.
“Science is constantly evolving, so the door is not forever closed on making such a showing of reliability,” she wrote.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)A Utah lawmaker wants to codify higher standards for mental health and substance abuse treatment in prison after two audits found the state failed to properly monitor, medicate and treat many with severe mental illness. 
“I think everyone’s in agreement that we can do better,” Rep. Steve Eliason said Wednesday. 
 

 Suicide prevention resources

If you or someone you know is experiencing suicidal thoughts or is in distress, call or text 988 to speak to crisis counselors 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. 
More information and ways to connect are available at 988.utah.gov and 988lifeline.org. Counselors through the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline can help with mental health struggles, emotional distress, alcohol or drug use concerns, or if you just need someone to talk to.
There is no wrong reason to call.



Eliason, R-Sandy, said the prison already has to meet a general standard for medical care set by the National Commission on Correctional Health Care. Now he wants it to hit higher thresholds from the same group that are specific to treatment. 
The pair of wide-ranging legislative audits found inmates who were deemed “acutely suicidal” weren’t constantly monitored in 2024 and 2025. Some managed to harm themselves and one person died in a suicide, auditors said.  
With help from an outside expert, psychiatrist Daniel Inouye, they also found examples of inmates getting the wrong drugs for their conditions, waiting months for an appointment, or being told to submit a request for care even though they were “out of touch with reality.” 
In response, the state Department of Corrections and the Division of Correctional Health Services said they’re putting together new policies, training and ways to review care, with plans to have some changes in place by next July and others by January 2027.   
Eliason said a majority of states contract with outside agencies for behavioral health services in prison, “which intuitively makes a lot of sense, because a lot of can be provided virtually, and they can rotate through different settings so they don’t maybe experience this high rate of burnout.”
His proposal is part of a bigger measure that would also help the state tap into more federal funding for certain prison health care and allow it to order treatment as a condition of parole, among other changes.
The bill would help cut down on repeat offenses and the need for more prison beds by helping to treat patients’ underlying issues, Eliason told lawmakers on the Health and Human Services Committee. 
The panel voted unanimously Wednesday to advance the bill to the full House for consideration during the 2026 Legislature, which convenes in January. 
“We know that it’s not a silver bullet,” said Rep. Jennifer Dailey-Provost, D-Salt Lake City. “But we’re definitely, I think, moving in the right direction.”
Audit: ‘Inmates are often abandoned’ by mental health care system in the Utah State Prison

The auditors focused on the Utah State Correctional Facility in Salt Lake City, which has designated housing for inmates with significant mental health needs. They said problems stemmed from a staffing shortage and a period of more than a year without a full-time psychiatrist, a delay the Division of Correctional Health Services attributed to challenges offering a competitive salary.
The prison now has a psychiatrist working 32 hours per week and making $134 per hour, along with two psychiatry fellows from the University of Utah assisting eight hours per week, said Josh Loftin, a spokesperson for the division.
The division asked lawmakers for a boost in funding last year but didn’t get it, Loftin said. It’s now finding ways to stretch its budget and be more efficient instead of requesting more.
The Department of Corrections’ former Draper location and current Gunnison site were already accredited by the National Commission on Correctional Health Care when it comes to general health care, which includes mental health standards, Loftin said. But none of its sites have received stepped-up accreditations specific to mental health and substance abuse. 
The Salt Lake prison isn’t accredited right now because it had to reapply after moving from Draper in 2022. It is scheduled to be evaluated as part of the process next month, the soonest slot available because of pandemic delays, Loftin said.

Republican Sen. Thom Tillis had recently said he was blocking a committee vote on the four Mississippi nominations over negotiations with Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi on the Lumbee people being officially recognized as a Native American tribe. Wicker is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which has sway over legislation in which proponents wanted the Lumbee recognized.
The Judiciary Committee on Thursday approved Trump’s nominations of Robert Chamberlin and James Maxwell, both justices on the Mississippi Supreme Court, to vacant federal judgeships in northern Mississippi. The committee also voted to advance Scott Leary and Baxter Kruger, Trump’s choices for U.S. attorney for the Northern and Southern districts of Mississippi, respectively.

The nominations now advance to the full Senate.
The Lumbee is a group of indigenous people in North Carolina that has been seeking federal recognition as a tribe for over a century. But other federally recognized tribes have opposed this effort.
Language granting federal recognition of the tribe had been added to the House version of the Pentagon’s annual spending bill, but was not included in the Senate’s version, which Wicker oversees.
Earlier this month, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs held a hearing on the Lumbee Fairness Act, legislation now being pushed by Tillis and other North Carolina lawmakers. President Trump has also endorsed recognition of the Lumbee as a tribe.
In a recent press release Tillis said: “This issue has come before Congress many times over the decades, but never with this level of unity and support. These days, it’s rare to see Republicans and Democrats come together on anything. But when it comes to Lumbee recognition, the support is overwhelming and it’s bipartisan. We’re talking about support from President Donald J. Trump, President Biden, Vice President J.D. Vance, former Vice President Kamala Harris, Governor Josh Stein, the North Carolina General Assembly and nearly every member of our state’s congressional delegation. Here in the Senate, nearly two dozen members from both parties have co-sponsored the Lumbee Fairness Act…”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11144848/AP25197697979549.jpg,,,2025-11-20 14:57:45.761185

When a patient with dementia arrives at the hospital, the clinical priority is addressing the medical issue that brought them there. But for many, the experience of hospitalization can intensify confusion, anxiety, or agitation. At Beebe Healthcare, a new initiative is providing an unexpected source of comfort: baby dolls.
Beebe’s Doll Therapy Program, launched in January 2025, places realistic baby dolls into the arms of patients diagnosed with memory loss. Each patient receives a doll along with clothing, a blanket, and a bottle, all of which they are encouraged to keep after discharge. The dolls serve as a non-pharmacologic, person-centered intervention for dementia-related behaviors, and this has already shown strong and measurable results.
“The dolls provide patients with a sense of purpose and comfort. They feel like they need to take care of it, which shifts their thinking,” said Logan Jarrell, BSN, RN, NICHE (Nurses Improving Care for Healthsystems Elders) Coordinator at Beebe.
RELATED STORY: Senior Care: What Adult Caregivers Need to Know
For Jarrell, the program grows out of both research and personal experience. Before becoming NICHE coordinator, she worked as a bedside nurse and saw daily the gaps in diversional activities for older adults.
“I was working as a bedside nurse prior to this. My passion has always been the elderly. I saw first-hand how frustrating it was that we did not have diversional activities available on the unit,” Jarrell said. “So when a patient does start acting out or even just gets bored, we didn’t have anything to give them. We had volunteers going around with an activity card but they’re only there certain hours of day. This made things very difficult.”
Her inspiration for the idea goes back to her earliest experiences in care settings.
“I remembered back in nursery school, especially when we went to skilled nursing facilities that had memory care units, you would see a lot of older adults with baby dolls and stuffed animals and I thought it would be interesting if we could get that in a hospital,” she said.
Building the Program

The doll therapy initiative grew out of another project Jarrell launched six months earlier: Therapeutic Activity Kits. These kits, designed for dementia patients across Beebe, contain diversional activities and detailed instructions staff can use when patients show signs of distress or restlessness. While researching additional tools for the kits, Jarrell revisited doll therapy—an approach supported by evidence showing that dolls can reduce anxiety and provide a meaningful focus for people with dementia.
“In January 2025, I initiated the Doll Therapy Program at Beebe Healthcare as an extension of the Therapeutic Activity Kits initiative I began six months earlier,” she said. “The Therapeutic Activity Kits were developed to provide readily available diversional activities for dementia patients on the nursing units, ensuring staff had accessible tools and an accompanying instruction guide to identify appropriate activities for various situations.”
Jarrell said she recalled how dementia patients in care facilities responded positively to doll therapy during her nursing school clinical rotations, and wondered how it might work in an acute-care hospital setting.
Beebe partnered with Angie’s Purpose and received donor support through the Beebe Medical Foundation to launch the program. But getting it off the ground required navigating logistical hurdles.
“Implementing the program presented several challenges, including securing staff buy-in, identifying appropriate storage for the dolls, developing educational materials, and determining the best methods to adapt this intervention to an acute care hospital setting, where evidence and research are limited,” Jarrell said.
Still, she said, “the program has laid important groundwork for enhancing person-centered dementia care within the hospital environment.”
90 Patients, 89 Safety Successes
Since January 2025, the program has tracked 90 patients who received dolls. According to Jarrell, the impact has been striking.
“We’ve seen fantastic results since implementing this,” she said. “We started the program in January 2025 and to date we’ve had 85 patients throughout the whole hospital who have been given the dolls. Out of those patients, all but one did not have a physical workplace violent event, wasn’t placed in restraints, or didn’t have a fall for the rest of their hospitalization.”
A later update increased the number to 90 patients, with 89 remaining “incidence-free” after receiving a doll.
These numbers matter, Jarrell noted, because they speak directly to safety and patient well-being—two of the biggest challenges in caring for individuals with dementia in hospitals. She added that the program has also impacted internal culture.
“The program has also helped reshape the nurses’ way of thinking,” she said. “In the past, people felt it was easier to medicate the patient when you can actually just give them something to do.”
A Wider Educational Mission
Although Jarrell is the only NICHE coordinator, she has worked to ensure the program is accessible to all staff, regardless of department or shift.
She works very closely with case management team so they all have access to this resource guide that she’s created. “All Beebe employees have access to that: nurse managers, community health workers,” she said. “Although there is only one of me, I make these resources readily available so that when I’m not there, it can be utilized.”
Beebe’s intranet now houses more than 100 resources for senior care. Jarrell brings these materials to outpatient sites, health fairs, and community events, and said she is working toward a public version so families can access the information at home.
She said NICHE’s structure makes education a core component.
“NICHE is also an education program, so I have certified geriatric nurses throughout the hospital who are very well-aware of the resources so they know to advocate for these resources and diversional activities,” she said. “I also try to go to as many staff meetings as I can to educate. I try to get out there as much as I can and talk to as many people as possible to spread awareness.”
Challenges Seniors Face
Jarrell said one of the biggest barriers families encounter is acknowledging when a loved one needs help.
“A lot of people I work with struggle to admit they need help because they feel like it’s a sign of weakness when it’s really not,” she said.
She added that people don’t always know where to start or what resources exist. Patients entering the hospital are often dealing with an acute medical issue, not thinking about longer-term planning.
“That’s why I really try to harp on pre-planning,” she said, describing situations in which caregiving arrangements can change unexpectedly. Her goal is to make sure seniors and caregivers know what support is available before a crisis happens.
Family Response: “Overwhelmingly Positive”
For Jarrell, feedback is an essential part of the program. Staff record each use of doll therapy—what behaviors were present before, how the patient responded, and any additional observations. Jarrell also conducts rounds to witness the effects firsthand.
Families often witness the interventions and frequently share their perspectives.
“Families are often present and consistently share positive feedback,” she said. “Many express appreciation that the dolls are not solely for hospital use—the dolls are gifted to patients to keep after discharge, which helps maintain continuity of comfort and familiarity at home or in long-term care settings.”
All feedback is collected in a database, reviewed monthly, and shared with leadership teams.
“The ongoing feedback loop has been instrumental in refining the program and reinforcing staff engagement through visible, meaningful outcomes,” she said.
A Regional Ripple Effect
Beebe’s program is already inspiring others.
“Two of our post-acute facilities (Excelcare & Ocean Grove) have now signed on with the same doll therapy program,” Jarrell said. “One of them is even making a nursery for the baby dolls in their memory care unit.”
Christiana Hospital has expressed interest as well, and Bayhealth has reached out about learning from Beebe’s outcomes.
“It is incredibly rewarding to see this initiative extend its influence beyond our hospital walls,” she said. “Knowing that the program will soon bring comfort and meaningful engagement to residents across Sussex County reinforces the broader value of non-pharmacological, person-centered dementia care.”
Technology and Future Tools
While doll therapy may seem simple, Jarrell said technology could also play an expanding role in diversional activities.
“I do think AI and technology have the ability to help with this,” she said, noting that activity kits include a range of items families can purchase for loved ones—including tech-based tools.
“There are also projectors that project all kinds of different games on to the patient’s bedside table or wall or ceiling and they mimic the patient’s movements,” she said. “What’s great about this is you can use it over and over again.”
Beebe is also exploring dementia education simulations for nursing staff and interactive light-technology programs that promote cognitive stimulation and social interaction.
Looking Ahead
Jarrell hopes the next year brings continued growth—both in patient outcomes and community partnerships.
“Looking ahead, I hope to see Angie’s Purpose and the Doll Therapy Program implemented at Bayhealth and Christiana Care,” she said. She also wants more families to understand how meaningful diversional activities can be at home.
“Ultimately, my goal is to see our program numbers, patient outcomes, and staff and family feedback continue to grow positively, reflecting the sustained value and transformative impact of non-pharmacologic, person-centered dementia care.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/img_4202.jpg.webp,,,2025-11-20 14:57:45.761185

(Getty Images)DES MOINES — Two alleged whistleblowers are suing Farm Bureau Property & Casualty Insurance Co. and its affiliates for alleged racketeering, wrongful termination and concealment of information from state regulators.
The lawsuit alleges Farm Bureau officials repeatedly concealed from regulators in Iowa and other states instances of fraudulent activity committed by company agents or employees. The defendants’ conduct in the matter amounts to racketeering, obstruction of justice, and mail fraud or wire fraud, the lawsuit claims.
The lawsuit was filed by James Newton and Brent Meskimen, former police officers who later became special investigators for Farm Bureau. They are suing Farm Bureau Property & Casualty Insurance Co., FBL Financial Group, Farm Bureau Financial Services, and the West Des Moines law firm of Wickham & Geadelmann in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. Also named as defendants in the case are several Farm Bureau executives and attorneys.
The lawsuit claims Farm Bureau officials “engaged in a scheme to defraud insurance policyholders, insurance and other governmental regulatory authorities, and other participants in the insurance industry who are complying with their mandatory duty of reporting fraud and other fraudulent or other illegal acts.”
It also claims the defendants violated Iowa’s law on the wrongful discharge of employees in violation of public policy. That law prohibits the termination of employees for refusing to participate in illegal conduct or for acting as whistleblowers by reporting or objecting to illegal conduct.
The defendants in the case have yet to file a response to the lawsuit. Calls to Farm Bureau, Farm Bureau Financial Services and the law firm of Wickham & Geadelmann were not immediately returned Wednesday.
Break-in at policyholder’s residence
The lawsuit claims that as far back as 2011, Farm Bureau officials failed to report to state regulators evidence of fraudulent activity within the company, but the “straw that broke the camel’s back” was an insurance adjuster’s alleged break-in on a policyholder’s property.
According to the lawsuit, a residential fire occurred at the policyholder’s Nebraska residence on May 5, 2023, and the policyholder immediately filed a claim for losses.
In the course of investigating the claim, Farm Bureau’s Special Investigation Unit learned that an adjuster working for the company had used a credit card to pick the lock of the policyholder’s garage near the scene of the fire to determine whether it contained items the insured claimed as being lost in the fire, the lawsuit alleges.
Newton and Meskimen allegedly met with Farm Bureau’s general counsel, Wickham, and advised him Farm Bureau had an obligation to inform the policyholder of the illegal access to their garage.
According to the lawsuit, the company’s assistant general counsel, Karl Olson, “eventually agreed” to allow Meskimen and Newton to meet with the policyholder and inform them of the illegal garage entry by the adjuster, but barred Meskimen and Newton from disclosing that two third-party vendors hired to investigate the claim had also been inside the garage.
The lawsuit claims Olson and Property Casualty Claims Vice President Anthony Kimmi then agreed that all “poisonous” documentation pertaining to the illegal entry, including photographs, should be placed in a separate file using a canceled insurance policy associated with a Minnesota policyholder who had no association at all with Nebraska fire.
After the new file was created for information about the garage, efforts were made to “lock down” the file to ensure limited access to its contents, and Kimmi directed the staff to suppress all printout capabilities from the file, the lawsuit alleges.
On June 9, 2023, Newton and Meskimen allegedly met with Wickham, the general counsel, at the Farm Bureau home office in West Des Moines and reported that they “could no longer in good conscience be associated with this file,” the lawsuit claims, telling Wickham “it was wrong ethically and that it violated state statutes, claims best practices, Farm Bureau core values, doing what’s right, and that it could very well be criminal and could potentially violate privacy rights.”
According to the lawsuit, Wickham responded by saying he’d speak to Farm Bureau leadership “to make sure this never happens again,” to which Meskimen allegedly said the directive to create the file “came straight from General Counsel Wickham’s own assistant general counsel, Olson.”
After Newton, Meskimen and the Special Investigations Unit concluded fraud had been committed by the company, the findings were allegedly relayed to Paul Swinton, a vice president and assistant general counsel of property and casualty at FBL Financial Group, according to the lawsuit.
The lawsuit claims Swinton refused to forward “the significant majority of the findings” to regulators in Iowa and Nebraska for their review and investigation, despite mandatory-reporting requirements.
Lawsuit: State regulators kept in the dark
According to the lawsuit, the 2023 incident was not the first time Swinton and Newton clashed over information that wasn’t being shared with state regulators.
“Newton and Meskimen were often and continually directed not to make mandatory referrals to the appropriate Departments of Insurance for review and investigation by the appropriate insurance regulators in states where FBL Financial Group was operating and conducting business, including Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico,” the lawsuit alleges.
Among the alleged examples cited in the lawsuit:

Forged signatures: In the spring of 2023, a Farm Bureau agent in Kansas admitted he had forged the signatures of approximately 50 of his policyholders, without their permission, over a period of three to four years, and that the forms contained false and misleading information to support of the clients’ insurance policy applications. Farm Bureau “refused to allow Newton and/or Meskimen to submit this admitted fraudulent conduct to the Kansas Department of Insurance,” the lawsuit alleges, despite a state law requiring such reporting.


Two fired agents: In 2022, Swinton refused to share information with regulators about two fired Farm Bureau agents. In one of the two cases, a Kansas agent admitted to having forged at least 900 various documents with clients’ signatures, allegedly with the clients’ consent, and another 100 documents without the clients’ consent. Swinton allegedly refused to share information with regulators about the two firings. The lawsuit claims that after Newton wrote in an annual report that he had concerns with such matters going unreported, Wickham “was furious” and instructed him to never put anything in writing like that again.


Fraudulent claim: In 2023, after a Farm Bureau agent was fired for filing a fraudulent claim on his own home in Utah, Swinton or others within the company refused to allow Newton and Meskimen to submit information on the agent’s conduct to the Utah Department of Insurance, despite a state law requiring such a referral.


Father’s altered policy: In 2018, the company’s Special Investigations Unit determined an Iowa agent had altered a customer’s policy after a fire so that the policy included a Ford Mustang that was consumed in the blaze. The customer was the agent’s father and a retired Farm Bureau agent. The lawsuit claims Swinton barred the unit from referring the incident to the Iowa Department of Insurance.

Newton and Meskimen are fired
The lawsuit alleges that while the unreported instances of fraudulent activity date back to 2011, it was the May 2023 garage break-in that “the tipping point for Newton and Meskimen.”
The lawsuit alleges that on Aug. 30, 2023, Newton had an in-person meeting with Wickham and insisted the information related to that case needed to be referred to the Nebraska Department of Insurance. “Wickham responded by telling Newton that if he made that referral his career would be over,” the lawsuit claims.
On Nov. 9, 2023, Newton and Meskimen allegedly met with Karen Rieck, the vice president of human resources for Farm Bureau Financial Services, and voiced their concerns about the lack of referrals to state regulators.
A week later, Newton received a phone call from Wickham and Rieck, in which Wickham said Newton had “essentially resigned” by refusing to report directly to Swinton. The lawsuit alleges Newton indicated he had no problem reporting to Swinton but that if Swinton was not going to make the mandatory referrals related to fraud, he would do so himself.
“As a result, Newton was fired,” the lawsuit claims. Meskimen was allegedly fired five days later after telling his superiors that he, too, would make such referrals if they were required by law.
The lawsuit claims that shortly before the two men were fired they each were given positive performance reviews, with Newton described by his superiors as “one of the most well-respected employees in the organization” and Meskimen described as a trusted leader whose “integrity is beyond reproach.”
In addition to Swinton, Olson, Kimmi and Wickham, the named defendants in the lawsuit include Daniel Pitcher, chief executive officer of FBL Financial Group and Farm Bureau Financial Services, and Ronald Mead Jr., the chief operating officer for property casualty of FBL Financial Group and Farm Bureau Financial Services.

Ken and Fritz Maytag have been committed to this building. Their values align closely with ours — with what Central wants to achieve in the world and who we are in the world.”
Much of the renovation work funded by the donation has already been completed, Rowe said in her email, with new amenities now available for students. The Maytag Student Center now houses the Maytag Marketplace, which includes a redesigned food and convenience store, the university’s Spirit Shoppe, temporary vendor spaces and areas for “public engagement.”
Putnam said in the release new technology will be added to certain rooms in the student center in the future through the donation, and lounge spaces will receive new finishes, seating and carpeting.
Iwan Williams, Central College executive director of retail management, said in the release the university used a student survey to learn what they would buy from a campus store if one was available, and from those responses, a “convenience store model” was developed. Now students can buy hot food, various beverages and more from the space in addition to grab-and-go food.
The marketplace’s new “pop-up vendor window” brings in local businesses to sell wares on campus, Williams said in the release, and has already seen success from Top Shelf Nutrition, which recently utilized the space.
As the marketplace is open to the public, Williams said in the release he expects groups like summer camps held on campus, as well as members of the community, to benefit from it. The space also fits into the college’s “Imagine More: It’s Central to Pella” initiative, which seeks to bring campus and community closer together through strategic partnerships and projects, both off and on campus.
“We’re drawing in local and specialty businesses that appeal to students and employees,” Williams said in the release. “It’s a manifestation of the Imagine More concept created here in the Maytag Marketplace. What we see right now is just the beginning.”

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)Montana’s 2025 fire season is expected to be pricey — between $50 and $70 million — driven largely by a complicated wildfire near Drummond earlier this year that’ll likely come out to be the most expensive suppression effort in state history.
A state Department of Natural Resources and Conservation official said during the Oct. 23 Environmental Quality Council meeting that 2,303 fires burned 75,000 acres in Montana this year. 
This was one of the lowest acreages burned in state history, which Gov. Greg Gianforte has repeatedly pointed to and praised DNRC for its work. 
DNRC’s fire management manual says that under state law, the department is required to perform aggressive initial attack on all fires and keep them “as small as possible.”
“Under Montana Code Annotated 76-13-104, the DNRC has the responsibility to protect land, property and natural resources within the state,” the agency said to the Daily Montanan. “The department places the utmost importance on the lives of firefighters and the public and will not intentionally jeopardize safety in pursuit of fire suppression responsibilities.”
The steep costs of the fire season coupled with the sparse acres that burned have raised questions about the state’s approach to wildfires. The Gianforte Administration has focused on suppression, calling their methods, “a model of proactive planning and decisive action.” Legislators are drilling down on wildfire as part of a state study on suppression, as new research shows forests might not actually be as dense as once thought, directly contradicting a large swath of American fire policy.
The huge cost and relatively low acreage was discussed during a meeting of the Environmental Quality Council last month, as the state is studying fire suppression costs.
Fire mitigation, the practice of reducing risk of catastrophic wildfires, is one way state and federal legislators are looking at trying to solve the problem.
But some mitigation practices — including logging, thinning and prescribed fires — are controversial to some environmentalists and there is vast disagreement within those circles about what, if anything, should be done to the nation’s forests.
Legislators heard testimony on suppression efforts and smoke impacts of prescribed burns during the meeting, which comes under the backdrop of massive federal changes surrounding wildfires.
The Fix Our Forest Act, recently proposed federal legislation from Montana U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy, has been a touchpoint for some environmental groups, saying that so-called thinning operations, a tool fire managers use to reduce fuel loads in forests, is opening the door to major logging projects in national forests. Sheehy himself is connected to the wildfire fighting industry, having founded Bridger Aerospace, an aerial firefighting company.
Those same environmental groups, as well as a California author and research ecologist studying the issue, also say the way prescribed burns and thinning operations are being conducted does not follow historical wildfire patterns, saying specifically that the idea that huge swathes of the country’s forests are too dense is fundamentally incorrect.
The state and federal government work closely together on wildfires, as about 30% of Montana’s land is federally owned. This also complicates who pays for what, as Montana receives reimbursements for wildfire expenditures, but it does not cover the whole bill.
Legislators passed a slew of wildfire-related bills during the last session, including House Bill 70, a study into state fire suppression, which is driving conversations on the topic and is expected to be picked back up again in January.
“It’s really difficult to totally criticize,” Sen. Willis Curdy, D-Missoula, vice-chair of EQC told the Daily Montanan of the effort on Windy Rock. “But on the other hand I think some serious questions need to be asked.” 
Gov. Greg Gianforte receives a brief from fire officials at the Windy Rock fire near Drummond, Montana, on Monday, Aug. 25, 2025.
‘A policy of aggressive attack’
The most expensive wildfire this season, the Windy Rock Fire, located about 17 miles from Drummond, still had people assigned to it in October, after being initially reported in late August.
The total cost to suppress the fire was about $56 million, though a DNRC spokesperson told the Daily Montanan that number is subject to change. The fire started on August 14 and burned 6,175 acres.
“It’s really important to note that the figure we provide may change and does not include the (Fire Management Assistance Grants). Finalized numbers for fire costs and FMAGs can take months and sometimes even years,” DNRC spokesperson Moria Davin wrote in an email.
The grants come from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which has been in chaos since President Donald Trump returned to the White House. 
Likely, though, it’ll be among the most expensive suppression efforts in state history. Montana’s 10-year annual average for firefighting costs is about $30 million, said Wyatt Frampton, a DNRC official addressing the committee. There are no solid numbers yet on actual expenses, which also makes this year an outlier, Frampton said.
“Given prolonged staffing that we had into October and some ongoing significant expenses associated with special activities, we don’t have a firm resolution for you yet on those final estimates for fire season cost,” Frampton told the committee.
The Windy Rock Fire originated on Bureau of Land Management land and the state responded with its county assist team. Montana and the BLM have an agreement over fire “offset” protection in that area, Frampton explained.
“There are exchanges of protection,” Frampton told the committee. “There’s areas where the Forest Service protects Forest Service or BLM protects private property, and likewise, the state will protect federal lands to try to have a net balance between the agencies.”
The fire also became complicated almost immediately and it burned in rocky and steep terrain, which complicated efforts. It threatened about 175 residences as well, Frampton said. And beyond that, there were other problems, too.
“Dead and down fuels from a past Mountain Pine Beetle outbreak pose additional challenges,” an Aug. 16 press release from the fire states. “The Windy Rock Fire is located near a Wilderness Study Area and a Backcountry Conservation Area, requiring fire operations to take special considerations for these landscapes.”
The fire became something of a spectacle, in part drawing massive air tankers to Helena Regional Airport that performed sorties on the fire for a week in late August. Firefighters on a Sanders County fire noted getting air resources as “challenging” due to “escalating demands” in the region on Aug. 22.
When incidents get larger or more complicated than local or state resources can handle, special teams are called — in this case, Northwest Team 2.
The day they took command from the state, Aug. 25, Gov. Greg Gianforte visited and toured the fire’s command post saying that day, “we’ve pursued a policy of aggressive attack on all fires.”
And the state did — per reporting by Substack and podcast, The Hotshot Wakeup on Aug. 25, the amount of fire retardant Montana used increased from 400,000 gallons to more than 1 million gallons in a week around the time those tankers were operating out of Helena.
Beyond the cost, many environmental groups have serious concerns with fire retardant, which contains high levels of toxic metals. The effectiveness of aerial attack on a fire is greatly debated and aircraft are not effective and often grounded in windy conditions.
Former legislator Jim Keane, a member of the Environmental Quality Council, asked questions to state staff regarding the cost of aerial attack versus ground efforts. 
“There has to be an astronomical amount of aviation assets that went into this fire year on a minimum amount of acres,” Keane said during the meeting.
The Trump Administration has pushed for more money and equipment for firefighters, with some focus on aerial firefighting. In fact, Sen. Sheehy was a cosponsor on bipartisan legislation earlier this year that made it easier for private contractors to acquire airplane parts for the nation’s firefighting fleet.
This fire season is expected to be the most expensive in U.S. history, though stats available through the National Interagency Fire Center, which tracks fire acreage and cost, are not adjusted for inflation, the agency has previously told the Daily Montanan.
But it’s a flawed assumption that fires can be put out, said Chad Hanson, a research ecologist, an author and the co-founder of the John Muir project, calling into question the amount state and federal governments spend on suppression.
He went on to say that studies by the U.S. Forest Service regarding forest density are flawed, saying money currently being spent on suppression and many fire mitigation practices would be better spent on hardening homes against fire.
“Pretty much everything that we’ve been told about fire in our forests is incorrect, scientifically,” Hanson said. “And it’s not just some loose theory.”

‘A wink and a nod’
Hanson and several fellow researchers have authored studies in response to research from the U.S. Forest Service regarding density in forests.
The density question is fundamentally a disagreement over forestry practices. The general idea among those in support of logging and thinning to reduce fire risk is that suppression practices on wildfires in the United States have led to forests that are too dense. They say there used to be many small intensity fires in the nation’s forests and that thinning and prescribed burns will replicate this natural process.
It’s a focus of a Sen. Sheehy bill — the Fix Our Forest Act — currently moving through Congress. The bill would also make it easier for land management agencies to conduct thinning and prescribed burn operations. In practice, prescribed burns often cut down small trees and brush, which is known as mechanical thinning, which are then put into small piles and burned. 
And Hanson says that the assumption all American forests had frequent, low-intensity fires is fundamentally incorrect and that federal research left out information contrary to that.
“They omitted and didn’t mention massive amounts of data that showed that historical forests were really variable,” Hanson said. “There were open forests, for sure, but there were also a lot of really, really dense forests, a lot of forests in between. This really simplistic notion that the forests were all open and park-like at low density, is not even remotely accurate based on the science and that’s not a contested notion.”
That’s not to say Hanson is against prescribed burns — there’s places where it could help, he said — but he does think the forests are closer to their natural density than some federal studies would suggest. Hanson and other researchers, including William L. Baker, a University of Wyoming professor, wrote a peer-reviewed review of a federal study called “Evidence for widespread changes in the structure, composition, and fire regimes of western North American forests.”
The Baker paper found most evidence was omitted in the federal study was information that, “does not support their low-severity model, including 10 published rebuttals of their papers.”
The federal study included logging interests, the Missoula Fire Science Laboratory and Environmental and Forestry Departments from major state schools across the west, including the University of Washington, UC Berkeley, Northern Arizona, Penn State, Utah State, Oregon State, and Arizona. It also included the Nature Conservancy, as well as various state and federal land management agencies.
Many of those researchers get money from the U.S. Forest Service, Hanson said, which has priorities of its own.
“Under Federal laws, the Forest Service can sell trees on public lands to private logging companies and keep most of the revenue generated from those timber sales for its own budget, using the money to pay staff and buy new equipment,” Hanson writes in his 2021 book, Smokescreen. “This creates a powerful perverse financial incentive for Forest Service staff to ignore wildlife and recreational impacts and emphasize industrial logging.”
It’s important to note, Hanson said, that the Forest Service is in charge of managing the nation’s forests, not necessarily protecting trees.
“We’ll do all these logging operations, we’ll call it thinning and fuel reduction, with a wink and a nod, and it will tell communities it’ll stop the fire from reaching the towns,” Hanson said. “And that is a dangerous lie, because that’s not what’s happening. The fires are blowing right through those thin areas.”
It’s the same logic the Fix Our Forest Act is based on, Hanson said, which is why it’s drawn criticism from some environmental groups like the Alliance for the Wild Rockies and EarthJustice.
“Prescribed fire doing preventing stand replacement fire is immediate massive loss of wildlife habitat,” said Sara Johnson, an environmental advocate who founded Native Ecosystems Council. “It prevents stand replacement fire, which is a huge benefit to wildlife.”
‘Active forest management’
In 2020, the Montana Forest Action Plan, a report commissioned under then-Governor Steve Bullock found 3.8 million acres of Montana’s forests “in greatest need of attention” 
U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz, who spent 14 years with the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, has said the nation’s forests are in trouble because they’re not being logged enough — and Gianforte, the state’s current Governor, is a noted supporter of the logging industry as well.
“Montana’s forest products industry has an important and necessary role in achieving landscape-scale forest restoration and management across the state,” the report states.
Less than 100,000 acres per year were being treated in Montana in 2020, according to the report. That number appears to have increased — earlier this year, the Forest Service said they conducted hazardous fuels reduction work on 200,000 acres of Montana forest in 2024. The BLM conducted approximately 38,000 acres of prescribed burns last year.
“Active forest management, such as mechanical thinning and prescribed fire, is one of the most important tools to reduce the risk and severity of wildfire alongside a robust community preparedness strategy,” the report reads. “This approach is especially important in the low-elevation fuel types where past fire suppression has had the greatest impact in terms of in- creased fuel loading.”
A separate 2020 report commissioned by the DNRC found that 85% of the state’s forests are at an increased risk of wildfire. According to the agency, historical Montana fires  were characterized by frequent, low-intensity fire that mostly burned surface fuels without killing mature trees. 
This also occasionally included moderate or higher severity fire, agency spokesperson Anna Lau wrote in an email. Lau went on to say that the state’s low- to mid-elevation forests, which are mostly ponderosa pine and Douglas fir, fires would typically occur every 5 to 30 years. That maintained open forest structures and created variability in the forest, Lau wrote.
“It’s important to recognize that high-intensity, stand-replacing fires play a natural and necessary role in certain ecosystems particularly at higher elevations, such as subalpine fir and lodgepole pine forests,” Lau wrote. “These forests have evolved with infrequent but severe fires that reset ecological succession.”
The DNRC does prescribed burns as well and the Montana Department of Environmental Quality has a call every day in the fall with the U.S. Forest Service to discuss the day’s burn requests.
Smoke from prescribed burns is a concern and EQC members heard from one woman who described significant smoke impacts. Logging has no smoke impacts, which EQC chair Rep. Paul Fielder, R-Thompson Falls, brought up.
“There’s different options for managing forests,” Fielder said. “You can do prescribed burns, or you can do thinning and other methods of reducing the fuel loads there. And as long as we just say prescribed burns are the best way to go without looking at other options. I think we’re not considering the health effects of this.”
A 2025 Stanford study showed prescribed burns “can meaningfully reduce smoke emissions,” from wildfires. And the DEQ has multiple factors it considers in those decisions.
“Burn decisions are determined based on how efficiently the smoke is going to exit the community,” DEQ meteorologist Aaron Ofseyer said in a statement. “A critical metric for determining this is the ventilation index. This index is calculated by multiplying the mixing height and the transport wind. The higher the index, the more likely the DEQ is to approve a burn.”
For those deeply involved with the work, like Tim Rochell, a prescribed fire expert with Missoula County, there’s been movement in public perception of the issue. 
“What we’re doing right now is we’re changing a culture like people have been taught to be afraid of fire, as opposed to something that’s a natural part of our landscape,” Rochell said. “And I think we’re slowly starting to change that.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/WindyRock2-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-11-20 13:57:30.106139

Emmer, a Minnesota Republican who serves as one of the top party leaders in the U.S. House, endorsed Siouxland Chamber of Commerce President Chris McGowan in Iowa’s 4th Congressional District and former state legislator Joe Mitchell in the 2nd District.
Both candidates are running in open primary fields for the congressional seats as the current GOP representatives are running for other offices. U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, in Iowa’s 4th District, is running for governor and U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson in the 2nd District is running for U.S. Senate.

McGowan and Mitchell were the top fundraisers in their respective races during the most recent campaign finance reporting period.
While Washington, D.C., party leadership often issues early support for incumbent candidates and criticizes opponents from other parties, endorsements are less common during the primary campaign season. In the 4th District, McGowan is competing against several other well-known GOP candidates, including former House Majority Leader Matt Windschitl, Ryan Rhodes, the founder of the Iowa Tea Party, as well as Christian Schlaefer, a software consultant.
Emmer said in a statement, “Chris McGowan is exactly the kind of battle-tested conservative we need in Congress.”
“As a veteran, business leader, and devoted family man, he embodies the values of faith, family, and freedom that define Iowa’s 4th District,” Emmer said. “Chris will be a strong voice for the America First agenda, a reliable partner in the House Republican Conference, and a leader who will deliver real results for Iowa.”
McGowan thanked Emmer for his support, saying the congressman  “understands what it takes to win tough races and to govern with strength.” If elected, McGowan said he would focus on enacting President Donald Trump’s and Republicans’ policies by “bringing Iowa values of faith, family, freedom, and grit to Washington to fight for the America First agenda.”
Emmer also endorsed Mitchell in the 2nd District, as he runs for the Republican nomination against state Sen. Charlie McClintock, R-Alburnett, and Rep. Shannon Lundgren, R-Peosta. Mitchell, a former regional administrator for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in Trump’s administration and the founder of Run Gen Z, a young conservative organization, said Emmer’s endorsement is a “a strong sign of the momentum we’re building.”
Emmer said electing Mitchell in 2026 is a vital part of keeping Republicans in control of Congress.
“If House Republicans are going to stay in the majority and continue delivering for the American people, it is vital we send bold conservative candidates like Joe Mitchell in Congress,” Emmer wrote in a social media post. “Radical Democrats will stop at nothing to return to power and revive Biden’s reckless policies. Iowans can’t let this happen, which is why they’re going to send Joe Mitchell to Washington so we can continue to Make America GREAT again!”
Emmer also traveled to Iowa in October to support U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks at a fundraiser, as she runs for reelection in Iowa’s 1st Congressional District. At the event, he told the crowd Miller-Meeks’ winning in 2026 “means we’re winning everything that you’re fighting for in Iowa” and would be an important step in keeping the GOP majority in the House. Iowa’s 1st District is projected to be one of the most competitive races in the 2026 election, with political forecasters rating the district as a “toss-up.”

Spencer Deery and Dan Dernulc were the latest victims of attempted swattings as early redistricting supporters turn up the heat on opponents and undecided lawmakers. (Photos courtesy Indiana Senate Republicans)As redistricting rhetoric intensifies in Indiana, three Republican lawmakers who oppose the prospect — or are undecided —  have reported attempted swatting attacks on their homes.
“It is disturbing that anyone would attempt to harm or intimidate lawmakers, but sadly not all that surprising in the current environment,” Sen. Spencer Deery, said Thursday, after police “thwarted” an attempt at his West Lafayette residence.
“Swatting” involves hoax calls or reports to emergency services intended to trigger armed responses — and can have lethal consequences for unwitting victims at the swatted location.
Redistricting rift growing among Indiana Republicans

Deery, a vocal opponent of early congressional redistricting, was notified about 8 a.m. Thursday that police dispatch had received a report of domestic abuse at his address. It included a threat of violence to officers who responded.
“I am grateful to the West Lafayette Police Department for their professionalism and preparedness to recognize this as a swatting attempt,” Deery said, noting it was resolved without endangering his children or others in the neighborhood boarding buses to school.
He assured constituents, “We will continue to do our duty and to do what is in the best interest of our district, no matter the threats.”
Deery’s not the only one facing threats in the frenzy for early maps. Redistricting is traditionally done every 10 years, after the census.
Republican supermajorities drew the current congressional boundaries in 2021, maintaining a 7-2 GOP majority. Two blue districts cover northwest Indiana and Indianapolis. President Donald Trump and his supporters want Indiana to produce a 9-0 map ahead of the 2026 midterm elections as part of his push to keep GOP control over the U.S. House.
Trump has ratcheted up the pressure, telling Gov. Mike Braun on Tuesday that he “must produce” on redistricting. That day, Braun proclaimed he’d find ways to “compel” recalcitrant senators to obey his special session call after they voted to ignore it and adjourn.
Thursday’s attempt on Deery came a day after Sen. Dan Dernulc reported a foiled swatting attempt on his home in Highland.

“Local law enforcement officials were quick to analyze it, recognize the report was false and inform me of the attempt,” Dernulc said in a Wednesday statement.
He hasn’t yet made a decision on redistricting, telling the Capital Chronicle earlier this week it’s “because I haven’t even seen a map.”
“Until I see something, I don’t want it being like (Democratic former U.S. House Speaker) Nancy Pelosi, where they say you have to vote for something and then find out,” Dernulc said at the time.
Later, he called Wednesday’s attempt “scary and shocking.”
“I have always done my best to serve my community, be their voice, and work … to help make Indiana a great state,” Dernulc’s statement continued. “It is sad because of these efforts and work that I am villainized in some minds to the point of harmful retaliation. Threats to public officials cannot and should not be the norm. I hope to see justice for this illegal behavior.”
Another undecided Republican colleague, Sen. Greg Goode, reported a swatting attempt on his Terre Haute residence Sunday. It came hours after Trump called him out by name as a “RINO,” or “Republican in name only,” in a post to Truth Social.

Braun denounced the attempts as “absolutely terrible” on Thursday, telling reporters, “That’s way beyond the pale. Unacceptable. … All I’m saying as governor, leader of the state: stop it.”
Asked if he thought aggressive rhetoric had contributed, Braun responded that there’s “rhetoric on a lot of issues.” He said it “boils down to personal responsibility not to do something stupid.”
Deery also slammed an unpaid pizza delivery to his home this week, which he framed as a more subtle attempt at intimidation.
“This may seem like a harmless prank, and it certainly isn’t as serious as a swatting, but it still is an attempt to intimidate an elected official by conveying ‘we know where you live,'” Deery said. “Even this less serious tactic should be condemned and never normalized.”

It’s the game in which a tower’s blocks are removed until the absence of one causes the entire structure to collapse.
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is that consequential piece in the health insurance game, and very shaky, unsteady Republicans are messing with it.
To insert another board game, it’s like the GOP is remaking “The Game of Life,” which simulates the journey through adulthood, college, career, marriage, children, retirement, all the things. Of course, bad journeys on board games are overcome by reshuffling a deck of cards and giving another twirl to the doohickie that spins to indicate how many spaces to advance on the board.
In real life, though, do-overs aren’t so clean.
Sure, federal employees have been unshackled, no longer forced to work without pay after Democrats caved and created a crooked path for Republicans to reopen the government. But plenty of those federal workers had to work side jobs in the interim. The 43-day federal shutdown forced folks living a paycheck-to-paycheck existence to exchange that for a more extreme checking account-to-reserve funds lifestyle.
Unlike board games, real people are the pawns in the game of life. The unpaid federal workers playing catch-up are real people. Folks getting over the trauma of facing hunger because they couldn’t buy groceries through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, are real people — all 42 million of them.
The 24 million individuals receiving health insurance through ACA marketplaces? They’re real people. Based on what they saw when open enrollment began Nov. 1, some are considering cancelling coverage and foregoing mental health care, colonoscopies, all of the necessary things to which the politicians who denied them remained privy.
“That scenario is wrong in so many ways,” said Advance Carolina policy director Jovita Lee, Ed.D. “Throughout the shutdown, members of Congress kept getting paid, never had to contemplate losing health insurance. It was a different story for their constituents. So what we have are politicians not only using gerrymandering to pick their voters but also making those voters do free work at airports so they could fly home after leaving work early and unfinished in D.C.”
Air traffic controllers were among the federal workers forced to work without pay during the shutdown.
Most Democrats in Congress voted against the continuing resolution that ultimately reopened the government. They refused to say yes without Republicans agreeing to extend the subsidies that have made ACA marketplace insurance more affordable. Without the subsidies, people are poised to pay hundreds of dollars more per month for health insurance premiums.
Even if you don’t get insurance through an ACA marketplace, you’re still prone to paying more for health care. You see, like Jenga, health care is a collective thing. As rumblings permeate about people pulling out of ACA marketplaces because they can’t afford coverage, leaders at insurance companies will hear that and raise costs to compensate for folks getting sicker because they stopped going to see their doctors. Somebody has to pay to offset the price differential in order to keep the health care system propped up. That would be you. Ask your provider.
Even better — ask your Congress member. And get them to explain how the resolution that reopened the government is temporary, so another impasse is likely, another shutdown, possibly in January.
Tell that Congress member to admit that the overarching issue with all of this is the health insurance system wholly needing an overhaul to make premiums realistic again.
It’s enough to make you wonder whether elected officials are taking away necessities just to get people worn down and so focused on survival that they disengage politically. The tiresome antics are wearying, for sure, their fanciful board games, as it were.

Campbell plant was expected to save Michigan ratepayers $600 million by 2040. (Photo/Sarah Leach)As the Department of Energy issues a third order prolonging operations for a coal plant in west Michigan slated to close in June, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has requested a stay on the extension. 
On Wednesday, Nessel filed a request with the department arguing its justification for another extension was based on outdated assessments of the Midwestern grid operator, Midcontinent Independent System Operator, of its energy reserves heading into the winter. 
The initial order, which extended operations at the J.H. Campbell coal plant from its planned closure on June 1 until August 21, initially argued the plant’s resources were needed to prevent blackouts at homes and businesses amid high demand over the summer, despite projections from the grid operator which determined it would have enough resources to meet demand from consumers. 
The department’s latest order, issued Tuesday, extends operations until February 17, 2026. Energy Secretary Chris Wright argued that while the North American Electric Reliability Corporation had yet to issue its reliability assessment for winter 2025-2026, assessments from the previous two years had presented concerns on whether Midcontinent Independent System Operator’s energy reserves would be sufficient in “above-normal conditions.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
However, the 2025-2026 assessment was released hours before the order was issued, with Nessel arguing its contents completely negate Wright’s arguments justifying an extension. 

While the assessment found multiple regions in the U.S. could have insufficient energy to support its customers amid extreme weather, MISO was listed at a “normal risk,” meaning that its resources will be sufficient to meet operating reserves under normal and extreme peak demand and outage scenarios.
The assessment also notes that this year’s risk scenario for the grid operator should not be compared to last year’s as there have been changes to the assessment methods
“[The Department of Energy] is using outdated information to fabricate an emergency, despite the fact that the truth is publicly available for everyone to see,” Nessel said in a statement. “[The department] must end its unlawful tactics to keep this coal plant running when it has already cost millions upon millions of dollars. My office will continue to fight back against these arbitrary orders and ensure residents aren’t forced to foot the bill for these unreasonable costs.”
According to the plant’s owner Consumers Energy, keeping the plant operating has cost the company $80 million, or more than $615,000 a day. The company was able to recoup $84 in separate costs by selling energy to Midcontinent Independent System Operator. 
Consumers Energy Media Relation Specialist Brian Wheeler said the company is prepared to continue operating the Campbell plant as required by the Department of Energy. He noted the costs for operating the plant are not solely borne by Consumers Energy customers, but by ratepayers across the grid.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original story.)Ohio lawmakers passed a bill early Thursday morning that would ban intoxicating hemp products and make changes to the state’s marijuana laws. 
The Ohio House voted 52-34 to pass Ohio Senate Bill 56, sending it to the Senate. 
Ohio Republicans Thaddeus Claggett, Levi Dean, Brian Lorenz, Jason Stephens, D.J. Swearingen, and Michelle Teska joined Ohio Democrats in voting against the bill around 1 a.m. Thursday morning.
The House vote took place after the bill was originally scheduled to go to conference committee Wednesday morning, but the meeting did not happen until just before midnight Wednesday.
Ohio state Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, offered about a dozen amendments during the conference committee, but none of them were adopted.
The Ohio Senate has an if-needed session scheduled for Dec. 10 and Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, said he is confident the Senate will pass the bill. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The Republican lawmakers on the conference committee said a lot of accommodations had to be made. 
“We were so close that things came together and we did not want to walk away being so close with where we’re at,” said Ohio state Sen. Steve Huffman, R-Tipp City. “I think we came to a good compromise.” 
Huffman introduced the bill in January and the Senate originally passed the bill in February, but the House made major changes, most notably by adding intoxicating hemp regulations. 
The Ohio House passed Ohio S.B. 56 in October with a bipartisan vote and the Ohio Senate voted unanimously one week later not to concur with changes made to the bill, sending it to conference committee. 
After the bill was sent to conference committee at the end of October, changes were made to hemp at the federal level.
Congress recently voted to ban products that contain 0.4 milligrams of total THC per container earlier this month when they voted to reopen the government. 
Previously, the 2018 Farm Bill said hemp can be grown legally if it contains less than 0.3% THC.
There is a one-year implementation delay for the federal hemp ban, but states can create their own regulatory framework before then. 
“On the hemp side, what the the federal government did certainly influenced what we needed to do,” Huffman said.

Ohio’s bill complies with recent federal changes by banning intoxicating hemp products from being sold outside of a licensed marijuana dispensary.  
“When it comes to intoxicating hemp products, we essentially cut to the chase,” said Ohio Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville. 
“We had already whittled down most retailers where those could be sold. That is going to kick in. They’re going to have the 90 days of runway that’s in the bill. After that, all those products are either going to be sold in a marijuana dispensary or they won’t be allowed to be sold.”
If the Ohio Senate passes Ohio S.B. 56 in December and Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signs the bill into law before the new year, Ohio’s intoxicating hemp could take effect as soon as March.
Ohio S.B. 56 allows five milligram THC beverages to be manufactured, distributed and sold until Dec. 31, 2026. 
“There’s aspirational language in here that the legislative leaders have agreed on that says, if the federal government takes action and makes (THC beverages) legal again, that it’s our intent that we would come back and have legislation to create a structure and have legal THC beverages again,” Stewart said. 
On Oct. 8, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine announced a 90-day executive order that bans the sale of intoxicating hemp products that started on Oct.14, but a Franklin County Court of Common judge has placed a temporary restraining order on DeWine’s ban until Dec. 2.  
On the marijuana side, the bill would reduce the THC levels in adult-use marijuana extracts from a maximum of 90% down to a maximum of 70%, cap THC levels in adult-use flower to 35%, and prohibit smoking in most public places. 
Ohio S.B. 56 would give 36% of adult-use marijuana sale revenue to municipalities and townships that have recreational marijuana dispensaries. The bill also maintains the 10% tax rate on recreational marijuana and keeps home grow the same at six plants per adult and 12 per residence. 
Ohioans passed a citizen-initiated law to legalize recreational marijuana in 2023 with 57% of the vote, and sales started in August 2024. 
Ohio lawmakers can change the law since it passed as a citizen initiative not a constitutional amendment, something they have been trying to do since late 2023. 
“(Ohio S.B. 56) fundamentally undermines the will of the voter and what they said that they wanted,” said State Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney, D-Westlake. “They told us at the ballot box. They said we need to stop punishing adults for responsible use.” 
Ohio recreational marijuana sales topped $702.5 million in the first year. 
“People wanted the ability to smoke it where they wanted to smoke it, the ability to have their neighbors exchange marijuana and see whose brand was better,” DeMora said. “This bill does none of that stuff.” 
Ohio Republicans disagree.
“I don’t think it goes against the will of voters,” Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman said. “You can say we got 57% of the vote, but is it the will of all the people that you’re allowed to smoke marijuana cigarettes while you’re walking into the Cincinnati Reds baseball game? I don’t think so.”

In September the FDA approved a new generic form of mifepristone, bringing the total approved manufacturers to three.
This federal approval, which drew the ire of anti-abortion groups, came after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promised U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, that his agency would conduct a “complete review” of mifepristone. 
“If the FDA is reevaluating the brand-name drug’s safety, then it needs to stop rubber-stamping new mail-order generic versions before more women are hurt,” Hanaway said in a statement Thursday.
The new FDA approval will make medication abortions more accessible, Hanaway argues.
“The supply of mifepristone will increase, the cost will decrease and the number of chemical abortions will rise… across the nation,” the new court filing reads.
The lawsuit demands the federal government restore its previous restrictions on mifepristone by requiring three in-person doctor visits, reducing the gestational period during which the medication can be taken from 10 weeks to seven and rolling back recent federal policy that allowed for the mailing of mifepristone and allowed for prescriptions to be made online or through pharmacies.
Medication abortion — used in about two-thirds of abortions in the U.S. — requires two kinds of pills. The first, mifepristone, causes the embryo or fetus to stop growing and detach from the uterine wall, ending the pregnancy. The second, misoprostol, causes the uterus to expel the pregnancy tissue. Both medications are also used to treat miscarriages.
“For Missouri and other states with strong protections for unborn life and maternal health, the widespread mail-order distribution of mifepristone directly undermines state law and burdens state hospitals, emergency rooms, and taxpayers,” Hanaway said in her statement Thursday.
The FDA states that mifepristone is safe to use if taken as directed in the first trimester of pregnancy. 
Bleeding and cramping are expected side effects. More rarely, there can be hemorrhaging and infection. Those prescribed mifepristone are urged to call their doctor if they experience heavy bleeding, abdominal pain or a fever. This guidance also applies to those who recently underwent surgical abortions, experienced miscarriages or delivered a baby.
Since the medication was approved for use nearly three decades ago, the FDA has reported only 32 deaths associated with mifepristone. The report evaluates data from 5.9 million women who took mifepristone between 2000 and 2022. Of the three dozen deaths, 11 were the result of sepsis, 20 were homicides and two were suicides.
Missouri still among worst states for infant, maternal health as new Medicaid cuts loom

Hanaway stepped into the legal challenge to mifepristone first filed by her predecessor, Andrew Bailey. The federal lawsuit challenging the safety of mifepristone was taken up by the attorneys general of Missouri, Idaho and Kansas last year after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the original lawsuit, saying the anti-abortion doctors and medical organizations in Texas who brought the original case didn’t have the standing to sue. 
The case was recently moved from a federal court in Texas to the eastern district of Missouri in St. Louis after a federal judge in Texas said he no longer had jurisdiction over the plaintiffs. A court date has not yet been set.
Despite voters enshrining the right to abortion in the Missouri Constitution last year, medication abortion is inaccessible through Planned Parenthood clinics in Missouri.

Murphy proposes rescue, reform of public worker health plan system",Nikita Biryukov,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/11/20/governor-murphy-state-health-benefits/,Gov. Phil Murphy's proposal to revamp the health benefits program for government workers would shift costs away from premiums and onto health care visits. The state's largest public-sector union is opposed.,"Gov. Phil Murphy's proposal to revamp the health benefits program for government workers would shift costs away from premiums and onto health care visits. The state's largest public-sector union is opposed. (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)Gov. Phil Murphy proposed an overhaul of the state’s public worker health plans on Thursday that would flatten the number of plans offered to government workers, shift more costs for health care visits onto workers, and inject $260 million in a bid to attract local governments that have fled the public plan over years of steep premium hikes.
Murphy’s proposal comes as the local part of the State Health Benefits Program threatens to collapse amid a dwindling pool of subscribers driven ever smaller by rising rates that spur more departures and, in turn, more rate increases. And it comes as Murphy, a Democrat, is nearing the end of his two terms as governor. Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill (D) succeeds him in January.
“Unless we take sweeping action now to shore up this program, there are tens of thousands of New Jerseyans whose access to health care will be in serious jeopardy, and next June’s rate increases will be astronomical,” Murphy said during a speech at the New Jersey League of Municipalities’ annual conference.
The State Health Benefits Program covers both state and some local government workers, and the local part is technically insolvent. Even after years of double-digit rate increases — including a 37% increase approved in September — the premiums it collects from local and county governments and their workers are not enough to cover its costs.
Its reserves, which actuaries say should hold enough to cover two months of claims, are depleted, and the local part has been taking loans from state workers’ better-funded plan to continue offering health benefits to nearly 146,000 workers across New Jersey.
That number is falling every year as surging rates push local governments with younger, healthier workforces to cheaper options in the private market, pushing rates up as the program’s insurance pool grows older, sicker, and riskier to insure.
“This program provides health care coverage to our state’s valiant, and often under-appreciated, public servants,” Murphy said, adding, “These New Jerseyans — along with our state’s taxpayers — are counting on us to prevent the SHBP for local government from collapsing.”
The governor acknowledged passing the reforms before he leaves office on Jan. 20 would be difficult.
In a bid to lower premiums, Murphy’s plan would increase workers’ share of health care visit costs, and the proposal has already drawn opposition from the Communications Workers of America, the state’s largest public-sector union.
“This proposal, as it is, is a nonstarter,” said CWA District 1 New Jersey Area Director Tonya Hodges. “The SHBP Stabilization Act of 2025 is nothing but an egregious attempt to dismantle local government health care, continue shifting costs onto the backs of public workers, and perpetuate a system that allows insurance carriers and [pharmacy benefit managers] to increase prices with impunity.”
Senate President Nicholas Scutari said he believes a compromise is possible to address the problems plaguing the State Health Benefits Program. (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)
Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) in a statement said Murphy’s proposal underscores the key tenets needed for reform.
“The foundational principles that are needed to enable the plans to operate effectively and efficiently are the stabilization of local governments going in and out of the system, reducing the number of health plan options, and breaking the stalemate between management and labor. Although the proposals from the Governor and the Assembly address these principles differently, the Senate Workgroup that I charged with addressing this issue believes there is an opportunity for a compromise that preserves vital health care for workers while protecting municipal and county taxpayers,” Scutari said.
Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex), meanwhile, said in a statement that he welcomes discussions on how to lower costs for taxpayers and municipalities “while providing quality, affordable health insurance to public workers.”
 A $260 million one-shot
Key to Murphy’s pitch is a one-time $260 million appropriation that would be used to pay down money loaned from the state worker side of the State Health Benefits Program. That balance is projected to reach $180 million by the end of 2025, and whatever remains of the appropriation would go into the plan’s reserve.
The appropriation is significant, accounting for about 11.5% of the nearly $2.3 billion that the local government workers’ health plan is expected to spend in 2025, and could allow the state to lower the rates approved in September in early 2026, long before a slew of other reforms take effect in 2027.
At present, the program’s premiums include added charges to repay loans to the state workers’ plan and rebuild the local part’s depleted reserves.
Murphy administration officials hope that rate reduction will encourage local units that have left the plan over rising costs to return, driving rates down as the insurance pool’s risk falls.
“Our administration is willing to provide a quarter-billion dollars, in the short-term, to keep the SHBP for local government solvent in exchange for smart, structural reforms that will stabilize the program in the long-term,” Murphy said.
The governor’s proposal would require local governments to stay inside the State Health Benefits Program for five years once they join and stay out for the same period if they leave. The provision is meant to keep the plan’s insurance pool stable.
 Less generous plans
Local government workers’ health plans would become less generous under Murphy’s proposed changes, and there would be far fewer plans presented to workers.
At present, the local part of the State Health Benefits Program offers 50 plans, though as many as 95% of local government workers are enrolled in plans that cover at least 97% of health care visit costs, meaning most workers are responsible for paying just 3% of their health care expenses through coinsurance, copays, or deductibles.
That figure, called an actuarial value, does not include premiums and would fall significantly under the three health plans the governor’s proposal would create beginning in 2027.
It would drop to a statutorily mandated 88% under a PPO plan, or 78% under a high-deductible plan. The actuarial value of a proposed tiered-network plan was unclear.
Administration officials hope shifting costs away from premiums will help keep healthier workers in the public plan, and they hope raising workers’ share of health care visit costs will discourage them from seeking unnecessary or excessive care.
That framework would necessarily raise costs for some of the plan’s members, especially those with chronic conditions who require frequent care. Morgan, the Communications Workers of America official, said the proposal would lock government workers “into inferior plans.”
“We should be moving toward more oversight and more affordable benefits,” Hodges said.
Union leaders have protested efforts by the Murphy administration to offer public employees slimmer health benefits, saying the changes would put too much of a financial strain on workers. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)
 A new commission
Murphy’s plan would also alter governance over local government workers’ health plans.
A new seven-member commission would oversee rate setting and plan design, though they would be bound to keep actuarial values at the levels set in statute.
It would include four cabinet heads from the Departments of Treasury, Banking and Insurance, Community Affairs, and the Civil Service Commission or their designees, giving the state government a majority on the commission.
The governor would appoint the three remaining members, with one each recommended by the New Jersey League of Municipalities, the AFL-CIO, and the state’s largest police and firefighter unions.
Local governments have long sought representation on the bodies that oversee New Jersey’s public worker health plans. They have none under current law.
Treasury officials have said the frequent deadlocks in the state’s plan design committees, whose membership is evenly split between state and labor representatives, have contributed to rising premiums.
Murphy’s proposal would allow the state treasurer to act as tiebreaker if plan design committees that set rules for the state part of State Health Benefits Program deadlock.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)As some South Dakota dairy farmers struggle to find workers and as the state’s unemployment rate remains the lowest in the nation at 1.9%, South Dakota’s economic development office continues to approve incentives for the industry.
Two boards affiliated with the state Governor’s Office of Economic Development approved $17 million of aid for businesses this month, according to a press release from the department. Most of it was for dairy operations.
“When businesses grow in our small towns, it creates a ripple effect that strengthens the whole community,” said Commissioner Bill Even, who leads the office. “Each of these projects represents a partnership between the state, local leaders and business owners working together to move South Dakota forward.”
Drumgoon Dairy, near Lake Norden, lost 38 of its 50 employees this summer after a federal Department of Homeland Security audit flagged workers for inaccurate, outdated or incomplete proof of U.S. citizenship or permission to work in the country. Dairy audits in the state increased this year, farmers have said, and Drumgoon has struggled to hire local employees to replace the workers in the aftermath.
Noem’s South Dakota neighbors hit with an immigration audit that decimates their workforce

That hasn’t stopped state officials from continuing to direct aid to the dairy industry. Warner-based Silverstreak Dairies was awarded up to $12 million this month in Livestock Nutrient Management Bonds to build manure containment systems as part of the company’s recent $32 million expansion, which doubled its capacity to 5,400 head.
Annie Vannurden, a partner in the Warner operation, told South Dakota Searchlight it employs 30 people. With the recent expansion, Silverstreak pivoted toward more technology to address workforce shortages, including introducing a post-milking robot and using collars to monitor cows’ needs and reduce the amount of human interaction.
The Livestock Nutrient Management Bond program issues tax-exempt bonds to purchasers — typically local banks — who set the repayment terms and interest rates for the company borrowing the money. This is the first bond in the program approved so far this year.
Vannurden said the bond program helps dairy farms invest in their operations and technological upgrades rather than pay higher interest to other loan programs.
“It just shows that South Dakota cares about its dairy farms, people in agriculture and the environment,” Vannurden said, adding, “because they want us to be thoughtful and mindful and complete in our manure handling and compliance.”
Silverstreak Dairies is headquartered in Pierz, Minnesota, and operates eight dairies — the Warner dairy is the company’s sole South Dakota operation. The Warner operation was previously awarded $8.74 million in a Livestock Nutrient Management Bond in February 2024.

Starting in January, residential and small commercial customers of CMP will see rates increase to 12.72 cents per kilowatt hour, up from 10.61 this year. Versant Maine Public District residential and small commercial customers will see rates increase from 11.65 cents per kilowatt hour to 14.87.
Public Advocate Heather Sanborn said in a statement Thursday that an analysis by her office estimates customers can expect their monthly bills to go up, on average, between $13 and $17. 
Utility regulators reject CMP’s proposed rate hike, for now

“When every dollar matters, this is a significant increase for families and small businesses that are already stretched thin,” Sanborn said.
A power bill has two primary components: the cost of the energy being supplied, and the cost of the infrastructure to deliver it. Private utilities are responsible for delivering power. They also serve as intermediaries with energy suppliers, which are selected through a competitive bidding process overseen by the commission. This chosen supplier is known as the “standard offer,” since households are also entitled to seek an alternative “competitive electricity supplier.” 
“We recognize that rising energy costs create real challenges for Maine households and businesses,” said commission Chair Philip L. Bartlett II. 
The new standard offer rate, he said, “reflects current market realities and the commission remains committed to securing the lowest reasonable prices for Maine electric utility customers in a challenging energy environment.”
Sanborn said the higher costs are likely the result of increased natural gas prices, as well as changes in the wholesale market that have introduced new pricing risks for power suppliers.
On Tuesday, the commission rejected CMP’s proposed 10-year delivery rate increase, which would have raised costs for the average customer by $35 per month or $420 per year by 2030. The three-member panel encouraged the utility to resubmit a plan that takes into greater consideration long-term resilience planning and the impact on ratepayers.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2153308881-scaled-1-2048x1152-1-2-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-20 11:58:09.848621

New micro-neighborhood provides longer mental health residential stays at a lower price point, customizable treatment plans, and job assistance.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  With expansion, Spring Lake Ranch hopes to be missing link in mental health care.","It’s a familiar story for Vermonters: A loved one experiencing a mental health crisis goes to the hospital. They spend a few days in a psychiatric unit, or two weeks at one of the few drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities in the state, and then they’re sent home. All the stressors, patterns, people, and pathways that originally led them to crisis are still there, and they relapse.
Relationships are damaged and resources are strained. In some cases, hospital and rehab stays are replaced by prison sentences, which exacerbate the difficulties of reintegrating in a safe and healthy way. Relapse. Crisis. Each time the cycle repeats, it fuels a sense of hopelessness that makes long-term recovery from mental health challenges feel that much harder.
At Spring Lake Ranch Therapeutic Community (SLR) in Shrewsbury, VT, an expanded step-down program seeks to bolster residents’ long-term success. SLR hopes the program can become a model for others across the country. 

The Banks Transitional Living Program (TLP) at Spring Lake Ranch is a micro-neighborhood currently being constructed on the Ranch’s 700+ acre, mountain-top property where their primary mental health facilities have existed for nearly 100 years. Within three new apartment buildings and a community center, residents will receive customized support to bridge the gap between residential care and independent living. 
“This is something we’ve been wanting to do for a long time,” says Rachel Stark, Executive Director of the Ranch. “We hope this will be the missing link for people who are ready for new challenges, but not quite ready to be fully on their own.”   
Clients come to SLR from all over, often from intensive inpatient and rehab facilities. Common diagnoses include depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Some residents are simply having trouble making life transitions or experiencing “failure to launch” syndrome. About 80% have dual diagnosis, which means they are experiencing both mental health and substance use challenges. 
Residents participate in a farm-based therapeutic work program while receiving clinical care within a supportive community. The typical stay is 6-8 months, but timelines are individual. After that, residents currently have the option of transitioning to Elliot Program, a 6-bedroom pilot of the Banks TLP, where they can have a car, manage their own medication, go to school, or work off-site. Last year, roughly a quarter of SLR residents chose Elliot Program before discharge.
“We did a market study, we did a feasibility study,” says Stark. “But more than that, we talked to families. We talked to residents. This is what people were looking for.”

The 12-bed Banks TLP will offer apartments and suites, depending on resident preference. The rooms have been designed with care, full of light and each with its own balcony overlooking green pastures and lush forest. The community center will be a gathering place for residents, staff, and families, with a large kitchen and offices. 
Residents and their families will choose between a variety of service packages. All will receive continued clinical support and coaching with trusted providers, accountability in recovery, vocational counseling, and help in further developing their independent living skills. They can also choose add-on services like physical wellness, family wellness, and transportation assistance. 
Additionally, residents who’ve been in the Banks TLP for at least a year can participate in the Pathways to Activities, Socializing, & Support (PASS) program, providing continued assistance once they move off-site.  
The Ranch wants to help residents succeed by strengthening the full continuum of care. Mental wellness and recovery are lifelong goals, and by giving residents more time and specialized focus on skill-building and independent living, SLR believes they will be better equipped to escape the cycle of relapse and crisis. 
This level of care comes with a financial cost, which insurance does not currently cover. SLR designed the Banks TLP as a package model so that families could choose the most feasible plan with service add-ons. Residents are also encouraged to apply for financial aid.
Currently, 30-40% of residents receive financial aid for the primary therapeutic work program, covering up to 80% of costs. Earlier this year, the Ranch announced their goal of doubling the amount of aid distributed to residents by 2030. This aid is funded by donors, as well as by sales of Ranch-made products like maple syrup, woven goods, and granola.

“When somebody is right for this program, we do what we can to get them here,” says Kevin Molloy, Director of Operations and Admissions, himself a former resident. “It may feel out of reach, but the support is there to make it happen. This model of care works, I’m living proof of that. So, we want to make it accessible to as many people as possible.” 
In 2024, SLR launched a three-year, $18 million Capital Campaign to fund the Banks TLP as well as other updates necessary to support the expansion. With one year left in the campaign, they’re looking to raise the final three million. 
Development and Communications Director Rose McCracken is working hard to hit that goal. 
“The early support was really amazing. People who’ve been to the Ranch or who’ve had a loved one here know how powerful the program is and they want to see it grow. What we need now is help from folks who may not have heard of us but are passionate about mental health care.”
Investing in mental health benefits us all, McCracken says. “These are not just our family members and friends. They are our future neighbors, coworkers, and community leaders. When we give them the tools to thrive, it enriches life for all of us.”
The Banks Transitional Living Program at Spring Lake Ranch will begin accepting residents in 2026. For more information, visit springlakeranch.org/bankstlp. Donations to the Capital Campaign can be made online at springlakeranch.org/capitalcampaign or by emailing Rose McCracken at rosem@springlakeranch.org.

Lawmakers in New York are introducing a bill that would ban law enforcement officers, including federal U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, from wearing masks. The bill, sponsored by Assemblymember Tony Simone, would be called the Mandating End of Lawless Tactics (MELT) Act. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)The Michigan Supreme Court proposed on Wednesday an order to prohibit any civil arrests from taking place in a courthouse “while attending a court proceeding or having legal business in the courthouse.”
While not explicit in the text of the proposal, it matches actions taken by other states to prevent federal immigration agents from arresting noncitizens with no criminal record on civil immigration warrants while they attend court hearings for unrelated, minor offenses. 
“We welcome this proposed order by the Michigan Supreme Court as it would strengthen public safety, transparency, and accountability for the benefit of all Michigan residents,” Christine Sauvé, the policy, engagement and communications manager at the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center. 
“We increasingly receive calls from individuals detained by ICE at or near courthouses in Michigan,” she added. “Often simply the presence of ICE or Border Patrol near these locations – or the possibility of their presence – is enough to deter a range of individuals from accessing the critical process they need to preserve individual rights, the wellbeing of vulnerable people, and public safety.”
Connecticut was the latest state to implement such guidance, last week passing a bill that would bar most civil immigration arrests on courthouse grounds. Meanwhile, in New York, on Monday a judge threw out a challenge by Trump to a 2020 law that limited civil arrests in local courts and state facilities.

Currently, ICE guidance — issued the day after President Donald Trump took office — instructs officers that they “may conduct civil immigration enforcement actions in or near courthouses when they have credible information that leads them to believe the targeted alien(s) is or will be present at a specific location, and where such action is not precluded by laws imposed by the jurisdiction in which the civil immigration enforcement action will take place.”
As of Sept. 21, over 70% of people detained by ICE had no criminal convictions, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data research organization, meaning that their arrests generally come under civil immigration warrants. 
The proposed order also “does not apply to arrests made pursuant to a valid warrant that a judge has authorized,” while ICE civil warrants are generally administrative warrants as opposed to judicial. 
“This is a commonsense safeguard that benefits all Michiganders because we need everyone to come to court,” Sauvé wrote. “Other states have taken similar measures to ensure there is not a chilling effect on resident access to justice, and these efforts have passed Constitutional muster.”
Justice Brian K. Zahra, the sole Republican on the court, noted in the order that he would have declined to publish the proposal for comment. The order is open for public comment through Dec. 22.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/court-arrests.jpg,,,2025-11-20 11:58:09.848621
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-20 16:25:13+00:00,CT Mirror,Hartford HealthCare could add 2 Prospect CT hospitals to its system by year’s end,Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/20/hartford-healthcare-prospect-medical-ct-hospitals/,HHC pitched its case to buy Manchester and Rockville hospitals owned by Prospect Medical Holdings. CT must issue a decision by Dec. 30.,"After years of uncertainty regarding the future of the Connecticut hospitals owned by bankrupt operator Prospect Medical Holdings, two of the three facilities could have a new owner by the end of the year.
On Tuesday, Hartford HealthCare, one of Connecticut’s largest health systems, presented its case to the state’s Office of Health Strategy to purchase Manchester Memorial and Rockville General Hospitals. Under the new expedited approval timeline for hospitals in bankruptcy, state officials must issue a decision by Dec. 30.
During the public hearing, Hartford HealthCare CEO Jeffrey Flaks said the health system plans to bring all its expertise, resources and capabilities to Manchester, Rockville and the surrounding towns.
“The robust apparatus of Hartford HealthCare will be brought to these communities to make health care better. That’s why I’m so confident that we have this very unique opportunity to dramatically improve health care that will be here for generations going forward,” Flaks said.
Hartford HealthCare will spend $86.1 million to purchase the facilities and pledged to invest an additional $225.7 million towards capital improvements, like facility and IT upgrades, over the next three years. 
Hartford HealthCare also plans to recruit new physicians to the Manchester and Rockville communities, as well as expand access to specialty care, like oncology, inpatient rehabilitation and vascular and orthopedic surgical services, according to the application submitted to the state.
If approved, the deal would serve as the first step towards concluding a lengthy search to find new buyers for Prospect’s Connecticut hospitals — a process that often seemed on the brink of failure.
In 2022, Prospect signed a deal to sell its three Connecticut hospitals — Manchester Memorial, Rockville General and Waterbury — to Yale New Haven Health for $435 million. But the deal was mired in setbacks and litigation. 
In August 2023, a cyberattack crippled operations at Prospect’s facilities around the country. In 2024, Yale New Haven Health and Prospect Medical sued and countersued each other over the true value of the hospitals. In January 2025, Prospect filed for bankruptcy and, by the following month, Yale officials said a deal appeared “impossible.” 
In September, Yale agreed to pay $45 million to Prospect to end all disputes over the hospitals’ sale. 
Hartford HealthCare stepped in and its acquisitions of the Manchester and Rockville facilities could be finalized by the end of the year. Connecticut’s flagship academic medical institution, UConn Health, seems poised to acquire Waterbury Hospital. A judge for the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Northern Texas approved the UConn deal earlier this week, and now the transaction must obtain state approval.
It’s a speedy transition for the three hospitals, whose ownership had languished in uncertainty for years.
While the Yale deal was pending, Lamont and OHS received broad criticism for the lengthy approval process. That led state legislators to approve a measure earlier this year that allows for an expedited timeline for the acquisition of hospitals that have filed for bankruptcy. 
Under the emergency certificate of need timeline, OHS must issue a final decision within 60 days from when the application is deemed complete. 
In an emailed statement, Lamont’s spokesperson Rob Blanchard said OHS “met all statutory timelines in the Yale-Prospect [certificate of need review]” and that the legal disputes between the two companies illustrate the transaction’s complexity. 
“Yale’s decision to file suit against Prospect less than two months after the agreed settlement raised clear concerns about the parties’ readiness to close the deal. The disputes that prolonged the CON process are now evident in the lawsuit, countersuit, and resulting $45 million settlement,” Blanchard stated in emailed comments.
Erosion of services at Rockville
Despite the promise of new ownership for Prospect’s Connecticut hospitals, the formerly private equity-backed operator will leave a lasting imprint on the state’s hospital system — perhaps most notably in the erosion of services at Rockville General.
When Prospect acquired Eastern Connecticut Health Network, which includes Manchester Memorial and Rockville General Hospitals, both facilities were full-service acute care hospitals. Today, Rockville — which serves a geographic region that’s largely rural — functions as a satellite campus of Manchester, with only an emergency room and behavioral health unit. 
A spokesperson for Prospect did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.
Rep. Tammy Nuccio, R-Tolland, lays the blame for the diminishment of the hospital directly with the state.
“That’s OHS’s failure,” Nuccio said. “They allowed this to happen.”
A 2023 investigation by The Connecticut Mirror found that Prospect began cutting services during the early days of the pandemic, eventually shuttering most of Rockville’s inpatient units without obtaining the required state approvals. Records and employee testimony submitted to the state show that officials were aware of the unauthorized cuts going back as far as 2021.
In February 2022, OHS fined Prospect for some of the service cuts at Rockville, but the operator appealed the penalty. The agency ultimately found it did not have substantial evidence to penalize Prospect, and waived the fine. 
In October 2024, OHS launched another investigation into the service cuts. In May of this year, Connecticut officials reached a settlement with Prospect Medical Holdings. OHS fined the operator $300,000, but the agreement also allowed Prospect to shutter all services at Rockville aside from the emergency room and behavioral health, officially making the facility a satellite campus of Manchester.
At the time, then-OHS commissioner Deidre Gifford issued a statement saying the agreement “protects critical resources” for patients and families in the area.
“The agreement also holds the Prospect applicants accountable to the community, requiring public notice of past terminations and development of a strategic plan for the consolidated hospital. The plan must be developed with community input and presented to the community in a public forum,” Gifford’s statement read. 
Hartford HealthCare has said as of now they don’t expect service cuts at either Manchester or Rockville. But Nuccio said she’s suspicious based on the company’s history with Windham Hospital, which HHC acquired in 2009. 
In 2015, Hartford HealthCare announced the conversion of Windham’s critical care unit to what’s known as a progressive care unit, which can’t handle the same complexity of care. Most recently, the company received strong pushback from the local community over the system’s decision to shutter Windham’s labor and delivery unit, which stopped performing births in 2020.
During the hearing on Tuesday, executives with HHC stated that the system improves the quality of care at all of the hospitals that join its system and that they are proud of the work done with former acquisitions. The company’s certificate of need application states that HHC invested hundreds of millions of dollars in facilities it acquired in the past, resulting in drastically improved quality of care for patients. 
Tina Varona, a spokesperson for Hartford HealthCare, declined to make Flaks available for an interview after he testified in Tuesday’s hearing, saying he had to leave immediately. 
“We are unable to comment outside of the testimony at this time due to the NDA and pending regulatory review,” Varona stated in an email follow-up after the hearing. 
Following Tuesday’s hearing, Attorney General William Tong issued a statement saying he expected Hartford HealthCare to maintain services, including labor and delivery, intensive care and behavioral health. But he called on OHS to hold Hartford HealthCare to its promises.
“Expectations must be matched by accountability: Absent other legal impediments, I would urge the Office of Health Strategy to seek firm commitments to continue these vital services,” Tong said. 
Vernon mayor Dan Champagne shared Nuccio’s sentiments in holding the state accountable for what happened to Rockville Hospital, particularly for how long officials took to approve the failed 2022 deal with Yale. But, he said, he’s grateful Rockville has not suffered the same fate as Prospect hospitals in Pennsylvania, which had to close because they couldn’t find a viable buyer.
Champagne said he understands skepticism of what an acquisition by a big hospital system could mean for Manchester and Rockville. But for him, Hartford HealthCare’s bid will guard against the most damaging result: closure of the hospitals and the flight of medical professionals from the communities.
“There are a lot of people who say, ‘big systems can sometimes lead to increased prices or closure of services,’” Champagne said. “We need to go back to what we’re facing here. I’m watching other hospital systems close from Prospect. We have an opportunity to keep this open. That’s the most important thing.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023_0927_SR_Hospitals_004-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-20 11:58:09.848621

Charlie Baker and followed a landmark court ruling that found the state needed to issue more specific and stringent regulations in order to meet the 2050 climate commitment.,"NO AGENCY SUBMITTED reports to comply with a 2017 rule requiring cuts to the emissions produced by state-owned vehicles — and environmental regulators didn’t aggressively enforce the rule, either, according to new court documents filed last week. 
Massachusetts agencies that own or lease at least 30 passenger vehicles, from the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs to the Department of Transportation, are compelled to reduce the pollution stemming from that vehicle fleet each year by specific amounts and submit reports to the Department of Environmental Protection in order to show compliance.  
But MassDEP has no records of these reports and didn’t follow up with the relevant agencies to receive that data for each year going back to 2019, when the reports were first due, according to the court documents that are in connection to a lawsuit the state brought against oil giant Exxon Mobil.  
The Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, which oversees MassDEP, declined to comment, citing the ongoing litigation. 
The rule was issued under Republican Gov. Charlie Baker and followed a landmark court ruling that found the state needed to issue more specific and stringent regulations in order to meet the 2050 climate commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 85 percent compared to 1990 levels. That 2016 ruling prompted an executive order from Baker directing DEP to issue additional regulations to help Massachusetts achieve those emissions reductions. 
A suite of six regulations emerged, one of which was the state passenger vehicle emissions reduction rule. But that regulation appears to have been ignored since it took effect in the wake of the 2016 litigation that was spurred by groups like the Conservation Law Foundation.  
DEP made the admission, ironically, in a court proceeding tied to a lawsuit the state filed against Exxon, accusing the company of deceiving the public and investors about the risks of climate change and its role in contributing to it. That litigation, initiated in 2019 by then-Attorney General Maura Healey, has now raised questions about the state’s own efforts to reduce emissions.  
After a judge denied Exxon’s attempt to obtain data and documents pertaining to Massachusetts’s vehicle fleet rule via discovery, the company pivoted to seek the information through a public records request in January. And when the state denied that record request, Exxon sued this past March — ultimately producing some relevant documents, including agency communications related to the rule and one request from EEA in 2019 for a modification of its vehicle’s emissions limit. 
But Exxon, believing that the state was withholding additional information, pressed the state for more. That’s when, in defense of the state’s motion to dismiss the records case, DEP admitted last week that “no agencies had submitted reports under the fleets regulation.” 
Conservation Law Foundation, whose lawsuit gave rise to this regulation requiring emissions reductions from state-owned vehicles, said the court documents are concerning. 
“CLF is still reviewing the record, but we fought for these [Global Warming Solutions Act] regulations to ensure real climate action,” said Seth Gadbois, staff attorney at the Conservation Law Foundation. “All levels of government are bound to follow them. When they’re ignored, it’s a step backward for the climate goals Massachusetts is legally required to meet.” 
The state passenger vehicle regulation is, of course, just one piece of Massachusetts’s broader efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector — which account for the largest share of pollution in the Bay State at 38 percent. 
Baker, in 2021, went significantly further in cracking down on the emissions tied to state vehicles by requiring through executive order that the state’s fleet be 100 percent zero-emission in 2050.  
Since then, the Healey administration has allocated tens of millions of dollars for electric vehicle charging infrastructure, including for public entities and the state fleet, along with school bus electrification — though Massachusetts would still need to triple its annual rate of new charging deployments through 2030 to achieve its climate commitment of cutting pollution in half compared to 1990 levels. 
Still, the lack of compliance with and enforcement of an emissions-reduction regulation that was the direct result of a major legal victory for environmental activists is likely to raise scrutiny of state climate efforts. The revelation from the Exxon Mobil lawsuit comes as the Trump administration’s push to squash clean energy further jeopardizes Massachusetts’s ability to meet those 2030 goals. 
The regulation states that when MassDEP believes an agency has exceeded its emissions limit “or violated any other condition” of the rule, DEP “may require” an agency to perform audits on its carbon dioxide emissions and deliver periodic reports “to assure continuous compliance.” The regulation also grants MassDEP the ability to “verify compliance” by conducting inspections and requesting additional information. 
None of the records made public through the lawsuit show DEP taking any such steps. Sharon Weber, deputy division director for air and climate programs at DEP, confirmed in a deposition last month that DEP has no documents showing any instances of “compliance verification” or other enforcement actions in spite of the fact that no agency appears to have filed reports detailing the emissions of its vehicle fleet.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Healey-Baker.jpg?fit=1000%2C690&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-20 11:58:09.848621

Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab and Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins […]","Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, while serving as a Republican state senator during the 2021 legislative session (Missouri Senate Communications). TOPEKA, Kansas — The Republican secretaries of state for Kansas and Missouri have signed a memorandum of understanding to exchange voter registration information in a bid to identify people who failed to cancel registrations after moving from one state to the other.
Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab and Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins said the partnership would enhance voter roll maintenance by “securely” sharing personal details on 1.87 million registered voters in Kansas and 4.13 million registered voters in Missouri.
Two organizations dedicated to advancing voter rights expressed skepticism the two-state agreement would do much to strengthen election security.
Neither secretary of state offered an estimate of the number of people in Kansas and Missouri who might have active registrations in a state where they used to reside.
“We can reduce duplicate registrations, created when residents move across the state line, by updating voter registration records timely and as allowed by law,” said Schwab, a candidate for the 2026 GOP nomination for governor in Kansas.
Hoskins said Missouri engaged in rigorous voter registration maintenance in accordance with state and federal law, but the deal “allows us to improve accuracy even further.”
He said the risk of duplicate registrations was real because thousands of Missourians and Kansans relocated each year across the state line in Kansas City metropolitan counties.
“This partnership is good government, plain and simple,” Hoskins said. “When voters move, their information should follow them and our local election officials deserve every available tool to keep the rolls clean, current and transparent.”
Democratic state election officials ​in letter ​ask if they were ‘misled’ by Trump administration

Esmie Tseng, spokesperson for the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas, said the organization’s concerns with the Missouri-Kansas arrangement were comparable to those shared in September when Schwab announced a voter registration collaboration between Kansas and Texas. She said both states must carefully guard personal information, and the states ought to proceed with the understanding that databases could be flawed.
“It should not be used as a way of simply scaring people about election integrity,” Tseng said.
Some states — but not Kansas — striving to upgrade election security in the past decade turned to the Electronic Registration Information Center. ERIC an organization of member states worked to collate motor vehicle department data, Social Security Administration death reports, address information from the U.S. Postal Service and state voter registration records to search for possible illegal voting.
Schwab’s predecessors as Kansas secretary of state operated the now-defunct Crosscheck program that promised to improve accuracy of state voter registration rolls. A lawsuit was filed challenging Crosscheck’s security shortcomings and a high rate of false positives. Settlement of the lawsuit in 2019 led to shelving of Crosscheck.
“Given the history of voter data mismanagement and its negative impact on Kansans, our big question is: How is this better than ERIC and different from Crosscheck?” said Melissa Stiehler, advocacy director for Loud Light, a Kansas organization focused on civil and voting rights.
Whitney Tempel, director of communications for Schwab, said all data sharing relevant to maintaining accurate voter rolls would be conducted in accordance with mandates of state or federal law.
She said the Kansas agreements with Missouri and Texas were part of a trend in which states proactively sought to update voter rolls through direct cooperation with other states.
“This is part of a national surge in one-to-one state agreements as opposed to multistate groups,” Tempel said. “This is one more tool for voter roll maintenance.”
Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said Kansas and Missouri were part of a growing trend among states that voluntarily partnered on data-sharing projects to streamline work on election security.
In early 2025, the U.S. Department of Justice requested states turn over voter registration lists as part of a national inquiry into potential voter fraud. The Justice Department said the goal was to guarantee compliance with federal laws. DOJ subsequently revealed information was shared with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for inclusion in the Systemic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, database.
On Tuesday, election officials in 10 states sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and DOJ asking for clarification of statements about uses for voter registration data by the administration of President Donald Trump. DOJ filed lawsuits against eight states for declining to comply with demands for information, which included driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers.

More often than staff at the Mount Washington Observatory would like, that’s just how it goes for weather monitoring equipment high on the mountain’s slopes, according to Mount Washington Observatory Director of Weather Operations Jay Broccolo. 
Mounted on aluminum tripod frames, the equipment is designed to monitor conditions including wind speed, snowfall, and solar radiation on the mountain Broccolo and others proudly say is home to “the worst weather on Earth.” But even cutting-edge technology can’t always stand up to Mount Washington’s worst: As ice builds up on the equipment, the surface area exposed to the gales increases and increases. Sometimes, Broccolo says, the metal structures supporting the tech simply buckle.

The automated weather stations are part of a network the Mount Washington Observatory is in the process of expanding throughout the North Country and up and down the slopes of Mount Washington, Broccolo said. The dozens of stations provide real-time weather updates and contribute to a log of local climate data that helps scientists track change over time and understand more about the White Mountains’ unique environment. 
Data from high on the peaks is very valuable to the effort, particularly because it is so hard to come by, Broccolo said. But that’s for good reason. The observatory’s main structures and infrastructure on the peak itself are hardy, but maintaining smaller, standalone weather stations is very difficult — particularly above 4,000 feet on a mountain where, in winter, top wind speeds may approach (or exceed) 100 mph on a daily basis.
“We’ve tried three times, and they’ve lasted not even a month into the winter on every single one,” Broccolo said, speaking to reporters, North Country business owners, and scientists at the foot of Mount Washington Nov. 18. 
A new attempt at solving that takes the form of a collaboration between the Mount Washington Observatory and the Cog Railway. The Cog is aiding in the construction of a new, steel tripod station along its tracks that will — hopefully — prove more durable than the aluminum structures used by the observatory in the past, Broccolo said. 
“It’s very much a trial-as-you-go situation,” he said. “There’s very few places on the planet that experience the weather that this place does.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mesonet-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-20 11:58:09.848621

In this image from May 21, 2025, Schwab participates in an interview in Topeka. (Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Republican secretaries of state for Kansas and Missouri signed a memorandum of understanding to exchange voter registration information in a bid to identify people who failed to cancel registrations after moving from one state to the other.
Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab and Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins said the partnership would enhance voter roll maintenance by “securely” sharing personal details on 1.87 million registered voters in Kansas and 4.13 million registered voters in Missouri.
Two organizations dedicated to advancing voter rights expressed skepticism the two-state agreement would do much to strengthen election security.
Neither secretary of state offered an estimate of the number of people in Kansas and Missouri who might have active registrations in a state where they used to reside.
“We can reduce duplicate registrations, created when residents move across the state line, by updating voter registration records timely and as allowed by law,” said Schwab, a candidate for the 2026 GOP nomination for governor in Kansas.
Hoskins said Missouri engaged in rigorous voter registration maintenance in accordance with state and federal law, but the deal “allows us to improve accuracy even further.”
He said the risk of duplicate registrations was real because thousands of Missourians and Kansans relocated each year across the state line in Kansas City metropolitan counties.
“This partnership is good government, plain and simple,” Hoskins said. “When voters move, their information should follow them and our local election officials deserve every available tool to keep the rolls clean, current and transparent.”
Esmie Tseng, spokesperson for the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas, said the organization’s concerns with the Missouri-Kansas arrangement were comparable to those shared in September when Schwab announced a voter registration collaboration between Kansas and Texas. She said both states must carefully guard personal information, and the states ought to proceed with the understanding that databases could be flawed.
“It should not be used as a way of simply scaring people about election integrity,” Tseng said.
Some states — but not Kansas — striving to upgrade election security in the past decade turned to the Electronic Registration Information Center. ERIC an organization of member states worked to collate motor vehicle department data, Social Security Administration death reports, address information from the U.S. Postal Service and state voter registration records to search for possible illegal voting.
Schwab’s predecessors as Kansas secretary of state operated the now-defunct Crosscheck program that promised to improve accuracy of state voter registration rolls. A lawsuit was filed challenging Crosscheck’s security shortcomings and a high rate of false positives. Settlement of the lawsuit in 2019 led to shelving of Crosscheck.
“Given the history of voter data mismanagement and its negative impact on Kansans, our big question is: How is this better than ERIC and different from Crosscheck?” said Melissa Stiehler, advocacy director for Loud Light, a Kansas organization focused on civil and voting rights.
Whitney Tempel, director of communications for Schwab, said all data sharing relevant to maintaining accurate voter rolls would be conducted in accordance with mandates of state or federal law.
She said the Kansas agreements with Missouri and Texas were part of a trend in which states proactively sought to update voter rolls through direct cooperation with other states.
“This is part of a national surge in one-to-one state agreements as opposed to multistate groups,” Tempel said. “This is one more tool for voter roll maintenance.”
Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said Kansas and Missouri were part of a growing trend among states that voluntarily partnered on data-sharing projects to streamline work on election security.
In early 2025, the U.S. Department of Justice requested states turn over voter registration lists as part of a national inquiry into potential voter fraud. The Justice Department said the goal was to guarantee compliance with federal laws. DOJ subsequently revealed information was shared with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for inclusion in the Systemic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, database.
On Tuesday, election officials in 10 states sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and DOJ asking for clarification of statements about uses for voter registration data by the administration of President Donald Trump. DOJ filed lawsuits against eight states for declining to comply with demands for information, which included driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers.
In response, the Kansas secretary of state praised the federal SAVE database. Schwab committed to providing DOJ with publicly available voter information.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5210800-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-20 11:58:09.848621
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-20 16:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT survey finds ties between financial stress, mental health issues",Sasha Allen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/20/ct-survey-mental-financial-stress/,"A survey of over 1,300 CT adults found residents are struggling more than they were in 2018 and are concerned about federal cuts to benefits.","Connecticut residents are struggling more with mental health issues and some basic needs than they were in 2018, according to a community survey released earlier this month by DataHaven, a nonprofit organization producing data for the state.
The survey, conducted from August through October 2025, surveyed over 1,300 Connecticut adults to asses quality of life, health, employment and resources across the state. 
One takeaway: Connecticut residents making less than $30,000 per year are, predictably, more likely to struggle with food, housing and transportation costs — but these residents are also more prone to mental health issues.
Mark Abraham, the executive director of DataHaven, said the survey elicited some positive findings.
“Connecticut continues to show great resilience and a high quality of life, with more than 83% of adults saying they are satisfied with the place they live,” Abraham said in a Nov. 6 press release.
The survey found that the majority of those surveyed believe Connecticut is a “good” or “excellent” place to raise children — and most were satisfied with the city they lived in.
However, many questions included in the survey related to the numerous changes and cuts being made to social safety net programs at the federal level — and found that nearly 30% of families with children have struggled this past year.
“The data also reveal areas of concern that communities are working hard to address, including cuts to food assistance, health care and housing that over a million people in our state have been relying on,” Abraham said. “The results also show rising anxiety, worries about immigration enforcement, differences in access to economic and health opportunity, and financial stress, especially for renters and families with children.”
Anxiety, depression and mental health care access
While 200,000 more adults reported feelings of anxiety and depression now compared to 2018, the survey also found a strong correlation between mental health issues and income.
Thomas Burr, the public policy and affiliate relations manager at the Connecticut branch of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, wasn’t surprised by the survey’s findings.
“That’s what I’m hearing,” Burr said. “It seems like this last year especially, all the drama coming out of D.C., coupled with an economy that’s still not great for a lot of people, has really brought a lot of people down.”

“Demographically speaking, mental health affects everyone, whether you’re wealthy or poor,” Burr said. “But I think because being poor and having issues potentially putting food on your table or [keeping] stable housing is just more trauma on people. And the more traumatic stuff you’re dealing with, the more challenges you’re dealing with, the greater the impact on your overall mental health.” 
When broken down by race, Black, Latino and Puerto Rican residents had heightened feelings of anxiety.
One question added to the survey just a few years ago asked residents: “During the past 12 months, was there any time when you needed mental health treatment or counseling for yourself but didn’t get it?” Statewide, 13% of Connecticut residents answered yes. But 19% of those making under $30,000 reported not getting mental health treatment when they needed it.
“It’s higher for folks who have limited income because cost was a big reason,” Abraham said. “But also just not knowing where to go for support or to find those services was a big reason, especially for younger people.”
People ages 18 to 24 were more likely to have not found mental health treatment when they needed it compared to older residents.  
Compared to the 2018 survey, feelings of depression and hopelessness are more common than they were in 2018. While the number of residents experiencing depressed feelings every day stayed the same, 5% fewer residents experienced no feelings of depression.
DataHaven also included survey questions about immigration status and deportation fears following a steep increase in deportations under the Trump administration. 
Statewide, 31% of residents either worried “a lot” or “some” about themselves, family or a close friend getting their immigration status revoked or being detained or deported.
“Even before new policies take effect that will dramatically increase the federal budget for immigration enforcement and deportations, many residents are already feeling an impact on their health and well-being,” Abraham said in the DataHaven press release.
Tabitha Sookdeo is the executive director for Connecticut Students with a Dream. She said that her members, ranging in ages 14 to 25, are scared.
“I feel like this entire survey reaffirmed so much of what we have been seeing on the ground and what we’ve been feeling,” Sookdeo said. “You know, I have to literally create a mental health fund for our staff and for our members and for their families.”
Latino and Puerto Rican residents worried more than white or Black residents about possible deportations or detainments — and Sookdeo said two of the organization’s members were detained by ICE over the past few months. The organization was able to get them back through a bond process, but those members and their families are “not doing well.”
When President Donald Trump took office in January, Sookdeo said, she went to the different chapters of Connecticut Students for a Dream to discuss the possible risks to members and their families.
“You could see the light kind of start to dull in their eyes … trying to process what this means,” Sookdeo said. “And that was before inauguration, so fast forward to today, it truly is a traumatic experience. These are still young people, they’re still children, their brains are still developing. And that’s happening in extraordinarily traumatic circumstances.”
Many of the organization’s members have been struggling, Sookdeo said, and she has been having sleepless nights herself.
“So many people are suffering and in such a state of despair,” Sookdeo said.
Housing and food — can people afford the necessities?
Similar trends emerged when comparing responses among economic brackets on food and housing questions; Connecticut residents making less than $100,000 were much more likely to have struggled with food and housing money in the past 12 months.

However, for families with children, there was more struggle. DataHaven found that over a quarter of families with children did not have enough money for food at some point in the past 12 months, and nearly 15% struggled to pay for housing.
Jason Jakubowski is the president and CEO of Connecticut Foodshare. He said that it is “absolutely” the case that families with children are struggling especially. However, because of the recent government shutdown and the federal changes to SNAP regulations this November, Jakubowski said these issues are exacerbated, and new faces are showing up to the pantries.
“Since this SNAP crisis began, actually, I’ve seen more senior citizens come out in these last couple of weeks,” Jakubowski said. “There’s a lot of them that rely on SNAP benefits that probably weren’t included in that data that ended in October, and now, suddenly, they’re thrust into the system.”
From 2024 to 2025, food insecurity fell for everyone except families with children. But overall, food insecurity is a larger issue now than it was pre-pandemic — 100,000 more adults are experiencing food insecurity today.
Jakubowski said the CT Foodshare pantries have experienced between a 50% and 100% increase in clients in the past couple of weeks. And as for the last couple of years, Jakubowski said, CT Foodshare has seen similar trends to what was identified in the survey.
“We’ve definitely seen food insecurity increase over the last couple of years,” Jakubowski said. “We’ve definitely seen it spike over the last couple of months, and obviously, even more so over the last couple of weeks.”
Nearly a quarter of residents surveyed who make less than $30,000 struggled to afford housing within the last 12 months. Affordable housing in Connecticut has been a heated topic of discussion after Gov. Ned Lamont vetoed House Bill 5002 during session. The bill would have pushed towns to reform their zoning laws, among other initiatives. 
Housing growth is slow in the state, but the passage of House Bill 8002 during the special legislative session, among other initiatives, expands fair rent commissions and incentivizes towns to begin creating more housing.
Changes to Medicaid and SNAP programs in CT
Major eligibility changes to SNAP and Medicaid under the Trump administration will leave thousands in Connecticut uninsured or with less money for food. DataHaven found that residents in the state are worried.  

The survey asked residents how worried they were about current governmental policies that could lead to residents struggling to afford food, housing and health insurance. These questions specifically referenced changes to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, changes to SNAP coverage and changes to subsidized housing or Section 8 programs.
When it comes to Medicaid, those in urban areas and rural towns are the most worried that more residents could lose health insurance coverage. Over half of the residents from both urban and rural areas were “very concerned” about adults and children losing health insurance coverage.
Burr is worried that a federal change not yet implemented, requiring the redetermination of eligibility every six months through a lengthly paperwork process, could also kick some people off Medicaid — especially those with cognitive impairments or mental health conditions. 
“Having the wherewithal to be able to provide all the information they’re looking for to be redetermined as eligible, it’s not a trivial thing,” Burr said. “And there will definitely be people who fall off the rolls who would otherwise be eligible, but they just can’t do the paperwork.”
And in terms of food insecurity, Jakubowski said, there is “definitely” an indirect effect between Medicaid cuts and the amount of people utilizing food pantries.
“People come to one of our pantries and people go to one of our mobile trucks, because they have to make a choice … do they pay for shelter, electricity, heat, medication, health care or food?” Jakubowski said. “And they say, ‘Well, food is the thing I can go without.'”
Despite the possible correlation between Medicaid benefits and food, residents in rural towns were less worried about SNAP benefits and affordable housing. Residents in urban towns, however, were most worried about all the cuts. 
But overall, an overwhelming majority of Connecticut residents are anticipating the loss of housing, food and health care benefits for many people throughout the state.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1105_SR_SNAPFoodPantries_112-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-20 11:58:09.848621

On a quiet Sunday morning in September, I came across a legal notice referencing a rezoning request for several large rural parcels. The notice didn’t say much, but someone online mentioned it was for a massive data center campus. 
I froze. 
I’ve been following news about data centers across the country all year and even other parts of Michigan. 
I never imagined one would come here.
I posted the notice in a local Facebook group, hoping a few neighbors might know more. Within hours, hundreds of comments poured in. People were scared, confused, and unexpectedly united. Howell is a town where people rarely agree on anything, and yet most of us were uniting against this. The conversations were robust and civil. 
Then they were gone. Deleted from Facebook. 
Residents who live near the site told me they had no idea about the proposal until a letter arrived in the mail or a neighbor knocked on their door. I emailed the township asking for more information just two days after the notice appeared. I didn’t receive the documents until November 4 (seven weeks later) and only after submitting a FOIA request costing hundreds of dollars. What the emails revealed wasn’t necessarily illegal, but it was deeply troubling.
While the community was left in the dark, key conversations had already happened with a small handful of people. By the time the public learned about the project, the rezoning and site plan were already moving full speed ahead.

The landowner seeking the rezoning had helped township officials plan the logistics of the public meeting, including recommending that it be livestreamed, and strategized about keeping people outside under tents and letting them in the building one at a time. 
Safety and accessibility were barely mentioned and glow sticks were offered as the solution to safety concerns about people walking down a dark, curving, busy road in the dark. The emails also mentioned that the local utility company was pressuring him to make sure the hearing didn’t get postponed.
Public meetings are supposed to belong to the public. They are not supposed to be co-designed by the private party asking for a special deal.
No matter where someone stands on a project, that should bother all of us.










Good, solid, well thought-out projects don’t need secrecy, non disclosure agreements (NDAs), or fear of public pushback. Only bad ones do.

And this situation isn’t unique to Howell Township. It’s happening across the state. Township halls in Pavilion, Augusta, Kalkaska, Dundee, Saline, and other communities have been filled beyond capacity with residents saying the same thing:
Slow down. Tell the truth. Respect our community.
Residents have good reason to be worried.
A single hyperscale data center can use as much electricity as 750,000-1,000,000 homes. Michigan’s utilities admit they’re being flooded with interest. Consumers Energy has received inquiries totaling 15 gigawatts of potential data center load; DTE another 7 gigawatts.
That’s 22 gigawatts – the equivalent of powering 16 million homes.
Independent experts estimate that even one 100-megawatt data center can require nearly $500 million in new power plants, battery farms, and grid upgrades.
If the company scales back or closes (as many tech projects have nationwide) those “stranded” costs don’t disappear. They get pushed onto all of us through higher electric bills.
And the water impacts are just as serious.
Data centers can use between one and five million gallons of water per day for cooling.
In Michigan, we like to think our freshwater supply is endless. It isn’t. The Alliance for the Great Lakes warns that heavy withdrawals and evaporating millions of gallons in cooling towers can stress aquifers, lower private wells, and affect nearby rivers.
Groundwater is connected. It doesn’t recognize property lines or promises in a rezoning packet.

Yet despite all these concerns, Howell Township residents were given just 14 days’ notice for the largest land-use proposal in recent county history. Planning commissioners didn’t receive much more than the public. One commissioner said he barely slept for two weeks trying to understand what was happening.
At the same time, the tech industry driving this boom is openly admitting it’s risky and unstable. Jeff Bezos has called the AI investment wave an “industrial bubble.” Mark Zuckerberg said he’d rather risk “misspending a couple hundred billion dollars” than fall behind. Even Michael Burry, the investor who correctly predicted the 2008 crash, has bet against major AI companies.
These billionaires see data centers as a gamble worth taking.
But for communities like Howell Township, the risks aren’t theoretical. We’re the ones staring down decades of construction, new power plants, battery farms, diesel generators, transmission lines, water withdrawals, noise, traffic, heat, and light. All this built to serve companies who may not be here in five years.
And when the bubble pops, they walk away.
As regulators plan for Michigan’s energy future, environmentalists speak out on data centers

We stay with the costs.
The good news is that when regular people stand together, it works, even across political lines.
Just across Lake Michigan in Caledonia, Wisconsin, residents pushed back on a proposed Microsoft data center, and even after receiving local approval, Microsoft abruptly withdrew citing “community feedback.” 
And in Port Washington and Menomonie, two more nearby communities, residents demanded transparency, and those projects ultimately stalled or paused.
The movement has become large enough that Microsoft now warns investors about “community opposition, local moratoriums, and hyper-local dissent.”
One of the largest corporations on Earth is telling Wall Street that ordinary people in small towns can stop billion-dollar deals.
That shouldn’t scare us. It should empower us!
Here in Howell Township, thousands of residents are calling for a six-month moratorium on data center approvals.
This is not a ban. This is not “anti-technology.” It is simply a pause and the only ethical path forward.
A pause gives the township time to:

update zoning and ordinances
get independent environmental and infrastructure reviews
understand water, energy, noise, and emergency impacts
create rules that protect residents-not developers

If a project is truly good for us, it will still be good after careful study. Good, solid, well thought-out projects don’t need secrecy, non disclosure agreements (NDAs), or fear of public pushback. Only bad ones do.
I love this community. I love the people in it. And I believe in fairness, freedom, and local control. That means decisions made in the open, with honest information. It doesn’t mean rushed deals pushed by trillion-dollar corporations and utility companies who do not live here.
Something big is happening in Livingston County. But we are not powerless.
We are stronger when we stand together.  And the power is, and always has been, with the people. Now is the time to use it. Show up to the meetings. Give a public comment. This is our home. Our water. Our future. We will decide what happens here.

It’s the second highest cost burden for most American households, just below housing. (Photo: Ronda Churchill/Nevada Current)Despite the government reopening, Americans are still suffering from the chaos of an administration that is out of touch with the needs of the people.
Though federal workers are back on the job and agencies are resuming their work, countless essential programs are stalled or at risk, costing all of us by failing to invest in the services we need, like health care, housing, and transit.
Reopening the government is not the same as restarting the economy — and if Congress and the White House want to turn relief into momentum, they need to put real investment behind one of the strongest engines of growth we have: public transportation.
Public transportation is one of the best economic investments a government can make. Every $1 billion invested in public transit creates and supports more than 50,000 jobs, according to the American Public Transportation Association.
Strong transit networks attract businesses, get people to their jobs, and revitalize downtowns. Cities like Denver, Dallas, and Seattle have already seen how modern transit systems can spur billions in investment around new rail lines and stations.
Transportation also lies at the heart of our affordability crisis. It’s the second highest cost burden for most American households, just below housing.
But instead of addressing this head on, the administration is reneging on its funding obligations for projects of all types and threatening to further deplete investments that would give us more affordable options to get around. Across the country, bus lines are being cut, subway systems are aging, and commuter rail projects are stalled because federal funding remains uncertain or insufficient.
Which is why it is so troubling that the Trump administration is threatening to take the unprecedented step of gutting federal transit funding altogether in the next funding fight.
While this move may have the politically motivated goal of impacting larger transit systems in cities like New York and Los Angeles, what the administration does not realize is that the communities that would suffer the most are those with transit agencies who rely the most heavily on federal funding:.
These include small urban and rural agencies like the ones you’ll find in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, Flagstaff, Arizona, or Rocky Mount, North Carolina, where students rely on transit to get to class, warehouse workers rely on transit to get to work, and older adults rely on transit to remain independent and stay connected to their communities.
Washington’s next move should be clear: reject Trump’s plan to gut transit funding and pass a long-term, fully funded transit package.
That means investing in operating funding, supporting maintenance and modernization, and putting resources towards expansion, so that local and state partners aren’t left to carry the burden alone. The return on that investment isn’t abstract — it’s faster commutes, stronger local economies, and cleaner air.
But this will require political will from our leaders. It means resisting the easy allure of short-term fixes like formula funding for highway expansion and narrow discretionary grants for transit, and instead delivering the long-term funding for the infrastructure that makes cities thrive.
Federal and state governments must prioritize sustained, predictable funding for local transit agencies. At the local level, cities should redesign streets for buses, bikes, and pedestrians — not just cars.
The government is open again. Good. Now let’s keep the country moving — literally.
A nation that invests in its people’s ability to move freely and affordably is a nation that’s investing in its own growth. And we need that more than ever.

Their contention is members of Congress hold a serious advantage over everyday Americans when buying and selling stocks because of their access to information on Capitol Hill.
The House Committee on Administration convened Wednesday morning to hear how existing guardrails laid out in the 2012 STOCK Act fall short and consider the options to revamp it.
The Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, shortened to the STOCK Act, codified that members of Congress, congressional employees and other federal officials are not exempt from federal insider trading laws. 
The law also required that lawmakers and certain congressional staffers must disclose stock transactions that amount to over $1,000 within 45 days.
The law built upon the late 1970s-era Ethics in Government Act that established financial disclosure requirements for officials in all three branches of government.
“While rules already govern how public officials trade stocks, stronger restrictions may be necessary to restore trust and ensure officials are not profiting from their positions,” said Chair Bryan Steil, R-Wis.
Ranking member Joe Morelle, D-N.Y., said that he “unequivocally” supports a ban on members of Congress trading individual stocks and “that ban should extend to the co-equal branches of government as well.”
Law seen as ineffective
Policy experts before the committee poked holes in the protective measures already on the books.
“Despite allegations of improper conduct, no member of Congress has ever been prosecuted under the (STOCK) Act, nor do any public records exist indicating that officials have ever paid statutory fines for STOCK Act disclosure errors,” said James Copland, senior fellow and director of legal policy at the conservative Manhattan Institute. 
Trust in lawmakers and government officials to self-police is eroding, argued the experts and several committee members. 
Roughly 86% of the public across party lines wants to ban members of Congress from trading individual stocks, according to a 2023 survey from the University of Maryland School of Public Policy.
Dan Savickas, vice president of policy and government affairs for the advocacy group Taxpayers Protection Alliance, said data collected by stock activity trackers and journalists reveals Congress’ sticky entanglement with the market. 
According to a January 2024 report from Unusual Whales, a platform that monitors lawmakers’ stock transactions, dozens of members who traded in 2023 outperformed the S&P 500 Index. 
A New York Times investigation published in 2022 found 3,700 stock transactions by members of Congress from both parties from 2019 to 2021 “posed potential conflicts between their public responsibilities and private finances.” 
Savickas said a number of issues exist in the law’s current form, not least of which is that the STOCK Act “does not prevent conflicted trading by members of Congress, but merely requires them to report when and if they do so.”
Plus, many report them late without consequence, he added. Additionally, a violation is only subject to a $200 penalty and enforcement is left up to the executive branch, leaving it vulnerable to subjectivity and politics, Savickas said.
Some members of the committee questioned how lawmakers would be taxed should they be forced to divest, and how to navigate specific family investments. That included Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Va., whose family owns 20% of a community swimming pool he and his family have long used.
“How do we make sure that we’re not eliminating me or making me sell something that I feel strongly about? This has been part of my childhood, part of all my kids’ childhoods,” Griffith said, adding that his son coached the local swim team to the championships last year.
“How do we protect that while curing the ills of people who are trying to do bad things?”
‘As crooked as a dog’s leg’
During a press conference ahead of the hearing, Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., said “this place is as crooked as a dog’s leg, and it needs to stop.”
Burchett joined Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., and Seth Magaziner, D-R.I., in urging Johnson to bring to the floor the Restore Trust in Congress Act, a bill joining together several members’ proposals from this year.
The bill would prohibit Congress members, their spouses, and any dependent children and trustees from owning, buying or selling securities, commodities, futures and certain other assets. If enacted, a lawmaker and their family members would have 180 days to divest. Those newly elected would have a 90-day timeline to do so. The ban would not apply to diversified funds.
“Everybody standing here along with a number of others have been working on this issue for some time,” Magaziner told reporters. 
“We all worked together over the course of the summer to come up with a single, unified bill. So we have one bill, one strategy, and now it is on leadership to get this done and give us a vote,” he continued.
Other leaders on the issue who’ve signed onto the joint effort include Reps. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., Chip Roy, R-Texas, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Joe Neguse, D-Colo. Nearly 80 others signed as cosponsors in addition to the 16 original names.
Fitzpatrick said lawmakers “have to get this done, we will get this done this Congress.”
“Mark my words, this bill, or a bill, will come to the floor, hopefully through an open amendment process where we can make this better,” Fitzpatrick told reporters.
“If we are all willing to accept the premise, and I hope everyone is, that members of Congress unequivocally have access to inside information — we do — if you accept that premise then we have to do something on the stock trading front,” he continued.
Johnson timeline for action
When asked by States Newsroom if Johnson has a timeline for bringing any of the proposals to the floor, a spokesperson responded in an email, “We’ll defer to House Admin (committee) for the time being whether they plan to markup a bill etc.”
Johnson told Punchbowl News in September that a stock trading ban bill is “a tough issue.”
In May, Johnson said he worried whether a ban would affect who could serve in Congress because salaries haven’t risen in several years.
“But on balance, my view is we probably should do that because I think it’s been abused in the past and I think, sadly, a few bad actors discolor it for everyone,” he said.

A federal three-judge panel heard arguments in a Winston-Salem courtroom Wednesday about the new congressional districts in eastern and northeastern North Carolina that Republicans adopted in October. Opponents want the judges to block the new districts from being used next year. 
Republicans want to make sure that the 1st Congressional District, which has been represented by a Black Democrat for more than three decades, will elect a Republican next year. 
Republican President Donald Trump and U.S. Rep. Don Davis, a Democrat, both narrowly won the 1st District last year. It was considered the state’s only competitive congressional district before it was redrawn.
Hilary Harris Klein, a lawyer representing the North Carolina NAACP, Common Cause and individual voters, argued that the redistricting deliberately targeted the people in that district for how they voted in 2024, and for bringing a lawsuit against congressional and legislative districts used last year. 
“This is an unprecedented escalation,” she said. “This has created a new kind of harm.”
North Carolina is part of a national wave of redistricting instigated by Trump. He wants Republican states to create more GOP congressional districts in time for the midterms to prevent Democrats from taking the majority in the U.S. House.  
States redistrict after each census, and more often if courts require it. This is the first time North Carolina has redistricted at a president’s explicit request. 
The new North Carolina congressional map was designed to elect 11 Republicans and three Democrats. The current congressional delegation has 10 Republicans and four Democrats. 
Sen. Ralph Hise (R-Mitchell), who was in charge of drawing the districts, was the hearing’s only witness. No racial data was used to create the plan, he said.
“We undertook the process to improve the partisan advantage for Republicans,” Hise said. 
Klein argued that if allowed, Republicans would be able to redistrict after every election if they don’t like the results. 
“It can create an infinity loop that will forever frustrate judicial review,” she said.

The judges, all Republican appointees, had pointed questions for Klein and Lalitha Madduri, who represents a separate group of voters. 
State and federal courts have declared that they will not consider cases claiming partisan gerrymandering. Klein was asked repeatedly how the harm to voters she described differs from any harms from partisan gerrymandering the courts allow. 
Klein said this year’s redistricting is different because legislators had no legitimate reason to do it. “The only reason they did it was to hurt our clients” and other voters, she said. 
Meantime, Madduri argued that the census data used to draw the districts is old, so the districts are out of proportion. The main reason states redraw district boundaries every 10 years after the census is to make the district populations as close to equal as possible. 
However, Madduri could not say how far out of balance the districts have become. 
Judge Thomas Schroeder suggested that the novelty of the retaliation argument would work against opponents’ efforts to have the map blocked until the case can be tried. They have to show a likelihood of success on the merits to win a preliminary injunction. 
“This is a novel proposition where there is no current law,” he said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_4636-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-20 09:58:32.691778

She is pictured here in 2021. (Photo by Thad Allton for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — For nearly 20 weeks, certain lawyers, paralegals, psychologists, interpreters, court reporters and investigators were not paid.
Federal funding for a group of criminal justice professionals expired in early July, and the government promised to reimburse them in October, but the longest shutdown in U.S. history delayed that promise.
As of Nov. 14, the government racked up a $682,598 bill owed to appointed federal defense attorneys, experts and service providers in Kansas alone. It is a fraction of the $70 million in unpaid vouchers across the country.
The delayed payments are a symptom of years of inadequate funding, resulting in understaffed public defender offices, financially strained panel attorneys and apprehension at the integrity of constitutional rights for people charged with federal crimes.
It is a crisis that isn’t solely financial. It is constitutional, said Dionne Scherff, a criminal defense attorney and the Kansas representative on the Criminal Justice Act panel, which is made up of private attorneys who take on indigent defense cases when federal public defenders cannot.
Scherff is one of roughly 60 attorneys who are appointed to federal criminal cases in Topeka, Kansas City and Wichita if public defenders can’t take on additional caseloads or run into conflicts. Without funding, critical service providers such as interpreters and court reporters have continued to work without pay, as have attorneys.
One Kansas attorney drew from a personal line of credit and retirement funds to keep a law office open and pay living expenses, according to a Sept. 10 letter to the Kansas congressional delegation.
“The smart economical and constitutional thing to do would be to fund it on the front end,” Scherff said.
In Congress’ legislation to end the shutdown, it carved out nearly $1.6 million for federal public defenders. That was about $200 million below defenders’ request, but it will make available the $70 million owed in back pay to panel attorneys. Payments are being processed and are expected to land in attorneys’ and service providers’ bank accounts this week.
However, the stopgap measure doesn’t carry public defenders and panel attorneys through the end of the fiscal year next October. It gets them to Jan. 30.
 
‘Crisis will come sooner’
The payment freeze is the longest since 2013, when panel attorneys and service providers went five weeks without pay. It caused constitutional violations and cracks in the criminal justice system.
In California, a federal judge tossed out a criminal case, finding that the defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel had been violated.
“The right to effective assistance of counsel is a bedrock principle of this country and is indisputably necessary for the operation of a fair criminal justice system,” said Judge John Mendez of the Eastern District of California in a Nov. 12 ruling.
The case’s defendant was indicted last year on one count of methamphetamine distribution. He argued the lack of funding created an “untenable conflict between counsel’s professional obligations and their basic economic survival.” A jury trial was scheduled for January.
The Sixth Amendment doesn’t just articulate assistance of counsel but “effective assistance of counsel,” Mendez wrote.
The appropriate way to remedy “this chronic constitutional violation,” he said, was to dismiss the defendant’s indictment.
“To expect defense counsel to properly prepare for trial, while consistently denying her the tools to do so is, in this court’s view, not only unconscionable but also unconstitutional,” Mendez said.
In New Mexico, a group of Criminal Justice Act panel attorneys informed a federal judge that they would no longer accept new cases. They wrote in the Nov. 5 letter that the lack of funding placed “untenable strain” on attorneys and contractors who provide expert services.
“The more CJA cases we take on, the more harm we risk doing to our existing CJA clients because that means more time spent on other work for income streams and less time available to our indigent clients,” the attorneys wrote.
They said 2026 will be worse, predicting funding will run out even sooner than this year’s date of July 3.
Melody Brannon, the federal public defender for Kansas, agreed.
“The crisis will come sooner,” she said.
Inadequate funding is a shortsighted move, said Brannon, who also signed the letter to Kansas’ congressional delegation. Bills will come due and costs will rise later, culminating in a more expensive approach, she said.
“Budgets are moral documents,” she said. “Budgets reflect our values.”
Underfunding threatens the criminal justice system’s credibility, and it further erodes the confidence of clients, their families and the public, and choosing to continue to underfund federal public defenders reflects a society that is not valuing its most vulnerable members, Brannon said.
 
‘Justice is blind’
Federal public defenders and panel attorneys do not choose their cases. More than 90% of people charged in federal court are appointed an attorney.
”We’re standing in a line and ready to do a job because individuals — whether they’re charged with child pornography or a Jan. 6 incident or charged with a bank robbery — it actually does not matter to us,” Scherff said. “We don’t look at it with a political lens.”
It is expected, constitutionally and ethically, that panel attorneys and public defenders take a case and defend it vigorously, Scherff said.
“Justice is blind in that sense,” she said.
But, she added, clients suffer when Kansas panel attorneys resign because of no pay and more vow to leave if funding pitfalls continue.
If Jan. 30 arrives without full funding, federal public defenders, which have been under a hiring freeze for the past two years, will return to a state where they become strained when panel attorneys cannot take on new cases, Brannon said.
“And then,” she said, “what happens when someone comes to court and there is no attorney there to take that case?”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/065A9854-1024x643.jpg,,,2025-11-20 09:58:32.691778

(Photo by Craig McCaa/U.S. Bureau of Land Management)The state’s annual North Slope oil and gas lease sale drew brisk bidding that was dominated by small independent companies, some of which were new entrants to Alaska, officials reported on Wednesday.
The Division of Oil and Gas said nine companies submitted a combined $16.97 million in high bids for 271 onshore tracts in the central North Slope.
It was the most tracts sold in a North Slope lease sale since the annual areawide leasing program started in 1999, and it was the highest amount of money submitted in high bids since 2014, when 254 North Slope tracts were sold for $39.85 million.
The sale had offered 3,121 tracts over about 5 million state-owned acres.
In a statement, John Crowther, acting commissioner of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, said the sale results show evidence of a continuing North Slope oil “renaissance.”
“Over the last decade we’ve seen significant exploration, major new discoveries, and more and more acres under lease — and today projects with significant new production are on the verge of coming online. Now we have a record-setting lease sale at the same time we’re heading into one of the busiest construction seasons on the Slope in years. The future is bright,” Crowther said in the statement, which was released by DNR.
Surprise Valley Resources, a Texas-based independent, was the top bidder, picking up 116 tracts for about $8 million in total, according to preliminary results. The company entered Alaska last year, submitting winning bids on 41 tracts in the 2024 areawide North Slope lease sale.
Texas-based Burgundy Xploration, an independent that has previously invested in Alaska, was second on the list, picking up 57 tracts for about $2 million.
Several other small companies acquired tracts in the lease sale, including some newcomers to Alaska: Duncan Resources LLC and Frontier Exploration LLC.
But some established energy companies participated as well.
Oil Search (Alaska) LLC and Repsol were also significant bidders. Repsol, which is based in Spain, picked up 45 tracts in areas south of the Kuparuk River field, according to the preliminary results. Oil Search (Alaska) LLC, which is owned by Australia-based Santos but which is still registered in Alaska as a lease-holding entity under that name, picked up 22 tracts, mostly adjacent to its existing and under-development Horseshoe Unit. Horseshoe is near the Pikka Unit, in which Santos and Repsol are partners.
The Pikka field is expected to start producing oil next spring, a Santos vice president told a conference audience in Anchorage in August. After a first phase of development, with production estimated at 80,000 barrels per day for a few years, a second phase is expected to result in peak production of 120,000 barrels per day, according to Santos, the unit’s operator.
In the DNR statement, Gov. Mike Dunleavy said the Trump administration deserves some of the credit for the successful North Slope lease sale.
“From new Alaska-based explorers to long-established global producers, companies are stepping up because they recognize the tremendous opportunities our state offers. The Trump Administration’s commitment to responsible resource development is helping unlock those opportunities,” Dunleavy said in the statement.
The state’s two other annual Arctic oil and gas lease sales, with results also announced on Wednesday, drew more muted responses.
The Brooks Range Foothills sale, which offered 813 tracts over 4.3 million acres, attracted seven bids for a total of $200,581.92. All were from AK Frontier Energy LLC., another new entrant. The Anchorage-based company was registered Nov. 6.
The Beaufort Sea sale, which offered 570 tracts over 1.7 million state-owned offshore acres, attracted nine bids for a total of $364,346.10. All were from Samuel Cade, an Alaska investor who frequently participates in state lease sales.

Photo by TW Farlow/Getty Images.Minnesotans stared at their screens in horror last June as the raging Blue Earth River swallowed a beloved country store near Mankato. The same flood badly damaged a nearby dam and caused well over $1 billion dollars in damage across 22 southern Minnesota counties.
It was one of more than 60 billion-dollar weather disasters to hit the state over the past 45 years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. About 20 of those have struck since 2021, laying bare the real-world stakes of a warmer, wetter Upper Midwest.
As the Trump administration sits out an annual United Nations climate change meeting in Brazil that could (maybe) produce a detailed roadmap to transition the global economy away from fossil fuels, local governments in Minnesota and across the U.S. are preparing for more extreme weather to come.
At least 22 Minnesota city, county, regional and tribal governments have published “climate action” or resilience plans to mitigate the human and financial costs of future weather disasters, according to a report out Tuesday from Josefina Hajek-Herrera, a fellow with the Building Power Resource Center and climate policy consultant.
They include Minneapolis, St. Paul, Rochester, Duluth and 12 other communities with more than 10,000 Minnesotans. Mankato published its own climate action plan less than a year after the June 2024 flood inundated low-lying parts of town.
State Sen. Jen McEwan, DFL-Duluth, said during a call — hosted by report sponsors 100%, an environmental justice nonprofit, and Building Power Resource Center — that the infrastructure-busting impacts of extreme weather are apparent even in her purported “climate change haven” hometown. 
In June 2012, Duluth received over seven inches of rain in less than 48 hours, tearing up hillside roads and sewers. Powerful storms damaged Duluth’s popular Lakewalk a few years later, spurring a major fortification project set to begin construction in 2026.
“(Those floods) woke up a lot of people to the fact that climate change is happening now, in real time,” McEwan said.
The planning push comes as President Trump rolls back ambitious environmental laws, regulations and programs enacted under former President Biden. The Trump administration and its Republican allies in Congress have canceled billions in federal grants to help local governments reduce pollution and harden infrastructure against extreme weather. Billions more remain in legal limbo, including $7 billion in renewable energy funding for lower-income communities — which the Biden administration said would cut energy bills for 900,000 households — and nearly $1 billion for “pre-disaster” mitigation projects.
“What we’re seeing at the federal level is a morally indefensible and astronomically ignorant approach to energy and climate action,” DFL State Rep. Larry Kraft said on the call. Minnesota cities, he added, “can pick up the slack.”
Municipal planning staff or outside consultants take the lead on climate action planning, often with substantial input from residents, businesses and community groups. Most plans detail a mix of shorter- and longer-term goals to reduce local greenhouse gas emissions, such as by purchasing renewable power, installing high-efficiency electric heating at city facilities and adding electric vehicles to city fleets. 
Those goals mirror or in some cases front-run Minnesota’s statutory mandate for statewide carbon neutrality by 2050. In that sense, the plans put a local spin on what state law already requires over the next 25 years. Given the vast scale of human-caused climate change, however, their direct planetary impact will be negligible.
In recognition that the costs of climate change are already piling up, all but one of the 10 climate action plans released since 2022 contain “climate vulnerability assessments” that identify populations and infrastructure most at risk from extreme heat, flooding, poor air quality, food insecurity and high energy costs, Hajek-Herrera said in the report. 
The report hails successes like St. Paul’s jargon-free Climate Action Dashboard, which shows progress toward its 2030 goal of carbon-neutrality in city operations across city-led initiatives like electric heating at Como Park Zoo and Conservatory and the new, ultra-low-impact North End Community Center. 
On the call, Diana Chaman Salas, Hennepin County climate and resiliency department director, ticked off some of her employer’s accomplishments: a 10% cut to miles driven by county vehicles, a comparable reduction in county departments’ electricity use from onsite solar power by 2027 and enough community garden capacity to feed 1,000 people last year.
But recent plans’ focus on “cross-jurisdictional relationships” relating to transportation, education, renewable energy development and other projects offer tacit acknowledgement that local governments can’t do everything on their own.
St. Paul admits its fleet electrification plan has been held back by slow deployment of public charging infrastructure. Grand Marais fell behind on its building electrification goals earlier this decade due in part to a local shortage of qualified heat pump technicians, Hajek-Herrera said in the report. Electric grid constraints and red tape around key grant programs have stymied Northfield’s ambitious plans for solar arrays on public property. 
And formidable funding challenges — made worse by the federal government’s war on clean energy and climate science — loom over the entire enterprise.
“Ongoing uncertainty in federal climate policy further underscores the necessity for sustained and enhanced state-level support to bridge implementation gaps and strengthen local capacity,” Hajek-Herrera said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/electricschoolbus-1536x1024-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-20 09:58:32.691778

Read this story in English.
La Cámara de Representantes y el Senado aprobaron la semana pasada un amplio proyecto de ley de vivienda para reemplazar uno similar que el Gobernador Ned Lamont vetó tras la sesión ordinaria.
El Proyecto de Ley 8002 de la Cámara de Representantes exige a los municipios la creación de planes de desarrollo urbanístico, modifica los requisitos mínimos de estacionamiento fuera de la vía pública, amplía las comisiones de alquiler justo e incentiva a los municipios a tomar medidas para permitir la construcción de más viviendas, entre otras medidas.
Su principal objetivo es facilitar la construcción de más viviendas en Connecticut. El costo de la vivienda ha aumentado y la falta de vivienda se ha incrementado en los últimos años. Los expertos afirman que no se han construido suficientes viviendas en Connecticut para satisfacer la demanda, lo que ha agravado estos y otros problemas.
Se espera que Lamont firme el nuevo proyecto de ley, que ayudó a negociar con los líderes locales.
A continuación, un resumen de lo ocurrido en materia de legislación de vivienda durante la sesión extraordinaria de la semana pasada.
¿Por qué se convocó una sesión extraordinaria?
Durante la sesión ordinaria, la legislatura aprobó un ambicioso proyecto de ley de vivienda conocido como Proyecto de Ley 5002 de la Cámara de Representantes, pero Lamont lo vetó tras la oposición de los líderes locales. Afirmó que quería encontrar la manera de lograr su apoyo.
Después de meses de trabajo en una nueva versión del proyecto de ley, Lamont convocó a la legislatura a una sesión extraordinaria de dos días. La Cámara de Representantes se reunió el miércoles y el Senado el jueves. Aprobaron el proyecto de ley de vivienda, además de otros tres proyectos de ley.
Lamont ha elogiado el nuevo proyecto de ley porque los líderes locales, que se oponían mayoritariamente al anterior, lo han respaldado. Un grupo bipartidista de alcaldes y primeros ediles hablaron en una rueda de prensa en apoyo del nuevo proyecto de ley.
Los Demócratas afirmaron que querían que se aprobara un proyecto de ley para satisfacer la necesidad de más viviendas lo antes posible, mientras que los Republicanos criticaron la sesión extraordinaria, argumentando que el proyecto de ley debería haberse presentado en la sesión ordinaria, cuando el público podría leerlo y opinar.
¿Qué cambiará en la zonificación de mi ciudad?
Algunos aspectos aún no están claros y dependen de su municipio. El proyecto de ley exige a los municipios la creación de planes de desarrollo urbanístico, con objetivos específicos sobre la cantidad de viviendas que planificarán y la zonificación correspondiente.
Si los municipios elaboran estos planes o toman medidas para aumentar la vivienda cerca de estaciones de tren y autobús o en el centro de las ciudades, tendrán acceso a un nuevo fondo estatal y podrán obtener un mayor reembolso estatal por los gastos en construcción de escuelas.
El proyecto de ley también establece que los municipios no pueden exigir a los promotores que construyan nuevos apartamentos con menos de 16 unidades que incluyan estacionamiento fuera de la vía pública, con algunas excepciones.
Los Demócratas y los defensores de la vivienda afirman que estas medidas incentivarán a los municipios a construir más viviendas, ya que muchas normativas locales de zonificación dificultan la construcción de apartamentos. Los Republicanos temen que esto reduzca la autonomía local.
¿Qué más incluye el proyecto de ley?
Este es un proyecto de ley extenso que aborda diversos temas. Amplía el número de comisiones de alquiler justo, un organismo gubernamental que puede atender quejas sobre aumentos de alquiler y decidir si se modifica el monto de dicho aumento.
Prohíbe la “arquitectura hostil”, es decir, el uso de elementos como reposabrazos en el centro de los bancos o pinches que dificulten que las personas sin hogar se acuesten.
También establece el Departamento de Vivienda de Connecticut como autoridad estatal de vivienda, lo que significa que puede colaborar con los municipios para construir más viviendas y edificar en terrenos estatales.
¿En qué se diferencia del proyecto de ley anterior?
Este proyecto de ley tiene muchas similitudes con el anterior. Muchos Demócratas que trabajaron en él afirmaron que la mayor parte se ha mantenido igual; los cambios se centran principalmente en las disposiciones sobre zonificación.
Una diferencia es la creación del fondo estatal para incentivar a los municipios a participar en los programas para aumentar la cantidad de viviendas cerca del transporte público y en los centros urbanos. El proyecto de ley anterior incluía medidas que priorizaban la financiación de ciertas infraestructuras existentes para los municipios que decidieran realizar determinados cambios en la zonificación.
Además, elimina el proceso conocido como “cuota equitativa”, que asignaba a cada municipio un número específico de unidades para planificar y zonificar. En su lugar, los consejos regionales de gobierno determinarán cuántas unidades necesita planificar cada municipio.

In October, an immigrant truck driver — who federal authorities alleged does not have legal status — killed three people in an Ontario car crash. In a letter sent last week, the U.S. Transportation Department’s Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration claimed the collision “may have been avoided,” if California had complied with new federal rules — rules that could also lead to 61,000 truck drivers in California losing their licenses.
As CalMatters’ Adam Echelman explains, before President Donald Trump’s return to the White House, non-citizen immigrants, such as refugees and asylum seekers, were allowed by the federal government to carry trucking licenses. More than 720,000 trucking licenses are active in California, with about 61,000, or 8%, belonging to non-citizen immigrants. 
But in September, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy issued new regulations prohibiting certain immigrants from holding commercial trucking licenses — and singled out California in the process.
After claiming that the transportation department conducted a “nationwide audit” of trucking policies, Duffy threatened to withhold $160 million, or roughly 4% of the state’s federal highway safety funds, from California due to alleged violations.

Duffy, in a September statement: “California’s reckless disregard is frankly disgusting and an affront to the millions of Americans who expect us to keep them safe.”

Duffy, in that same statement, argued that issuing licenses to “dangerous foreign drivers” threatens “the safety of every family on the road.” Yet, in publishing the new regulations, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration also acknowledged that there’s not enough evidence to prove that certain kinds of immigrants drive more dangerously than others. 
The transportation department also said it won’t award the state $40 million from a separate federal grant because it claims that California is failing to enforce English-language proficiency guidelines for truck drivers.
If California rescinded the trucking licenses from all its non-citizens, the sudden drop in truckers could result in increased shipping costs, experts say. California’s trucking industry could also take a hit: Despite the explosive growth of online retailers in the last decade, which has helped expand the trucking industry, trucking companies still struggle to retain workers who are willing to work the long hours and receive the low pay that entry-level positions offer.

Budget outlook looks familiar

California is likely to remain in the red for next year, according to the latest analysis by the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office, writes CalMatters’ Yue Stella Yu.
California will likely face a $17.7 billion budget gap in the new fiscal year, which could grow to an annual $35 billion by 2027-28 as spending continues to grow, the report finds. 
This is the fourth year in a row during Gov. Gavin Newsom’s governorship that the state is projected to have a deficit despite increasing its revenue. Between just July and October, the state exceeded projected tax revenue by $6 billion — mostly powered by the fanfare around artificial intelligence in Silicon Valley — but nearly all of that will go toward K-12 schools, community colleges and state reserves, the office said.
Assembly Budget chairperson Jesse Gabriel, an Encino Democrat, said the committee “remains committed to crafting a responsible budget.” But the vice chairperson of the budget committee in the Senate, Republican Sen. Roger Niello of Roseville, blamed the structural deficit on Democrats’ “unstoppable spending problems.”

Zoning lawsuit won’t reach Supreme Court

From CalMatters housing reporter Ben Christopher: 
East Palo Alto settled a lawsuit challenging its “inclusionary zoning” policy, ruling out — for now — the possibility that a federal court might find it, and similar programs across the country, unconstitutional.
Like nearly 150 jurisdictions across California, the Bay Area city requires developers of new multifamily housing to either set aside some units for lower income tenants or pay a fee to the city’s affordable housing fund.
The case began with local couple Wesley and Angela Yu who decided to split their lot and build two units on the new parcel. The city required them to sell or rent one out at below-market rates or pay $54,891.
The Yus sued with the help of the libertarian Pacific Legal Foundation, arguing that the policy violates the U.S. Constitution’s prohibition on the seizure of property without compensation. The case’s backers believed the U.S. Supreme Court’s conservative majority would see things the same way should the suit ever make it that far.
It won’t. Shortly after the suit was filed, East Palo Alto’s city council voted to exempt lot splits like the Yus’ from the policy. On Tuesday, they formally settled the case.
Pacific Legal settled a similar challenge in Healdsburg last year and has pending challenges to inclusionary zoning rules in Denver, Colorado and Jackson, Wyoming.

Senate Joint Resolution 1 was introduced in the 11th hour of the 36th Special Session, which ended Wednesday on day seven.
As a resolution, it is not subject to a gubernatorial veto. It is also not subject to the state law requiring the Legislature to only consider topics included in the governor’s proclamation.
Proposed constitutional amendments initiated by state lawmakers must pass (as resolutions) in two consecutive legislative sessions. SJR1’s passage during a special session effectively shortens that timeline.
The resolution will now return to the 2027 Legislative Session for consideration. If passed by state lawmakers again, it will appear on general election ballots in 2028 for final approval by voters.
The resolution passed both houses on party lines.
In the Senate, the 12 Democrats present voted for it, and the four Republicans present opposed. In the Assembly, the 26 Democrats present supported and the nine Republicans opposed. Seven members of the chamber were absent.
When asked about the timing of the resolution’s introduction, Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro said that the Legislature had been prioritizing bills because they needed committee hearings and floor votes.
“This was somebody that we had ready to go,” she added.

One day prior, a bipartisan supermajority of state lawmakers formally petitioned to add their own topic to an ongoing special session.
Republican state Sen. Ira Hansen and Assemblymember Alexis Hansen, who are married, negotiated with Democrats to force one of their own priorities to be considered. That priority: Limiting the purchasing power of corporate owners.
A 2025 regular session bill sponsored by Democratic state Sen. Dina Neal was resurrected as Senate Bill 10 for the special session. It was heard in a joint committee of the Senate and Assembly Wednesday morning.
As expected, Ira Hansen voted with Democrats to pass the bill out of the upper chamber. Then, in an emotional floor statement, Alexis Hansen announced she would not vote for the bill despite being a part of the petition to have the bill considered.
The Hansens left their respective floors shortly after their notes. Neither was there for the SJR1 votes.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC08784-Edited-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-20 09:58:32.691778
,California,2025-11-20 13:31:00+00:00,CalMatters,"He built a nursing home empire despite state investigations. Now, lawsuits are piling up",Jocelyn Wiener,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/11/nursing-home-shlomo-rechnitz/,"California nursing home owner Shlomo Rechnitz received a batch of state licenses in 2023 despite past scrutiny from the attorney general's office and the state auditor. Today, his companies are facing half a dozen lawsuits over patient care.","In February 2024, a Los Angeles County jury awarded $2.34 million to an 84-year-old nursing home resident named Betsy Jentz, finding that the facility had violated her rights on 132 occasions, at times leading to serious injuries.
Six months later, an Alameda County jury found another facility had violated the rights of 71-year-old James Doherty, Sr. more than 1,400 times. That included seven instances in which staff failed to transport him, causing him to miss chemotherapy treatments, court documents said. Doherty died following the development of a large pressure sore. His family was awarded $7.6 million.
In February, a jury in Shasta County is scheduled to hear a case against a nursing home accused of negligence in the 2020 COVID-19 deaths of 24 patients. 
And next spring, trial is scheduled to begin in the case of a 79-year-old dementia patient, referred to as Cheryl Doe, who was allegedly raped twice in another Alameda County facility; a second case against the same facility alleges that excessive sedation of 64-year-old Alando Williams led to his death.
All of these facilities have one thing in common: state records list Shlomo Rechnitz as an owner.
Court documents show Rechnitz and his companies have denied all allegations in all of the cases. Mark Johnson, an attorney representing Rechnitz’ facilities and one of his main companies, Brius LLC, said in an email that facilities cannot comment on active litigation. 
“It is accurate that nursing homes are the target of abusive lawsuits that accomplish nothing but depleting resources for patient care,” he said. 
Johnson sought to distance his clients from the cases, saying that Rechnitz and his wife, Tamar, “are passive owners of the facilities” and have “absolutely no role in operations or management.” Johnson said “the licensees” contract with a company to manage the facilities, adding that  “each facility has all the necessary resources for patients and staff.”
Rechnitz has been on the state’s radar for years. In 2014, then-Attorney General Kamala Harris attempted to prevent him from purchasing new homes. In 2018, the State Auditor’s Office found his companies had significantly higher rates of federal deficiencies and complaints than the rest of the state’s care facilities.

In 2021, a CalMatters investigation documented that the state Department of Public Health allowed Rechnitz and his companies to operate 18 nursing homes while delaying a decision on granting licenses to them. The state had kept the license applications in a “pending” status for seven years after he acquired the homes. Rechnitz and his companies were allowed to continue operating five additional homes even after the state denied licenses to them. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law meant to address the issue, but state regulators in 2023 granted Rechnitz’ companies the licenses to operate the homes just before the measure took effect.
Now elder care advocates say he is Exhibit A in how regulators at the Department of Public Health are failing some of California’s most vulnerable citizens. They say the state could push for greater accountability, including withholding licenses from owners they deem to be bad actors.
Wendy York, a Sacramento attorney specializing in nursing home abuse, said that watching elderly and disabled residents repeatedly suffer the same types of injuries in these facilities “feels like a broken record. It feels like Groundhog Day.”
York brought the lawsuit in 2021 alleging that one of Rechnitz’ companies’ facilities, Windsor Redding Care Center, was responsible for the COVID-related deaths of some 24 elderly and dependent residents. Johnson, the attorney for Rechnitz’ facilities, previously said the company “vehemently” disagrees with the allegations in the case, which is headed to trial early next year.
There are “government agencies who are responsible for their oversight,” York said, but “at the end of the day, it feels like we’re the ones who are doing the enforcement.”
Johnson called it “crucial to note that California is one of the only states in the country to provide zero liability protection for healthcare providers during the unprecedented pandemic.”
“This is particularly noteworthy since nursing homes were the front line in trying to protect our frail and elderly,” he said.
At least one of the cases against Rechnitz’ facilities includes allegations about his own conduct. A man suing Rechnitz and his companies over a relative’s injuries wrote in a sworn declaration filed in court that Rechnitz attempted to intimidate and bribe him with Lakers tickets during an unexpected phone call on the eve of his scheduled testimony in Los Angeles County Superior Court. 
Johnson, the attorney representing Rechnitz’ facilities, called allegations about threats “completely false and defamatory.” A judge ruled the conversation could not be introduced as evidence.

In another case, Rechnitz and his wife Tamar in discovery disclosed their net worth: $786 million. 
Tony Chicotel, a senior staff attorney for California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform, said that dollar figure hasn’t been divulged publicly before.
 “At least in some of these chains, the money that was meant to go for patient care is being stripped away and sent up top to the ownership,” he said.
Johnson, the attorney for Rechnitz’ facilities, did not comment on the disclosure of the family’s wealth when CalMatters asked him.
‘Heightened monitoring’ for two years
The Department of Public Health has for years refused CalMatters’ requests for an interview about licensing issues related to Rechnitz’ companies’ homes. They again declined requests for an interview for this story. They did not provide a reason. 
Instead, spokesman Mark Smith, said in an emailed statement that the department “remains committed to transparency and accountability for all providers, and to the health and safety of all nursing home residents in California.” In response to CalMatters’ questions about facilities in which Rechnitz is listed as an owner, Smith noted that the department had “negotiated for and obtained heightened monitoring authority and additional enforcement powers, beyond those applicable to other skilled nursing facilities, for a period of two years at 24 of this provider’s locations.” 
That period has ended.
“This does not mean our department will avoid holding this provider or their facilities accountable,” he said. “We will continue to monitor these locations as appropriate, enforce and cite for regulatory violations if needed, and take further corrective action if necessary.”
A CalMatters analysis of data from both the state health department and the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services found 78 California facilities in which Shlomo Rechnitz or his wife, Tamar, were listed as having an ownership stake. On average the facilities fared poorly on several key quality metrics compared to the state overall. 

In the past three years, the 78 nursing homes received an average of 12.4 citations for facility-reported incidents, compared with 6.1 for all nursing homes statewide.
A higher proportion of these facilities has received a federal fine in the last three years than the state’s overall rate. Two-thirds of the facilities received at least one federal fine in the last three years, compared to half of all facilities across the state.
The facilities have been fined an average of $47,897 during the last three years, compared to an average of $29,573 for all California facilities.
The facilities had comparably low federal quality ratings: Almost 58% of these facilities had recent ratings of one or two stars (out of five), compared with slightly over 37% of facilities statewide.

Johnson, the attorney for Rechnitz’ facilities, noted in his email that a large percentage of these facilities are located in Los Angeles County, which he said issues deficiencies at a higher rate than any county in California, many of which are overturned on appeal.
He also said that “Mr. Rechnitz’ facilities self-report at a significantly higher rate than other comparable facilities,” which, in turn, could lead them to have a higher number of deficiencies.
Kamala Harris’ intervention
Back in 2014, Rechnitz bid on 18 Country Villa nursing homes in federal bankruptcy court. Then Attorney General Harris was so concerned with his track record that she filed an emergency motion to prevent him from purchasing or managing the homes, describing him as “a serial violator of rules within the skilled nursing industry.” At the time, Rechnitz’ attorney characterized the remarks as “defamatory” and “outrageous.”  
The purchase went through. 
Rechnitz then submitted change-of-ownership applications seeking licenses to run those homes. Rather than approving or denying them, CalMatters found that the state Department of Public Health simply left his applications in “pending” status for years. Despite that, his companies were allowed to continue operating the homes.
In 2015, he applied for licenses for five Windsor nursing homes. The next year, the department denied the change of ownership applications, but again allowed Rechnitz’ companies to operate them. 
In her scathing 2018 report, the state auditor Elaine Howle criticized the California Department of Public Health, saying weak oversight and licensing lapses increased risk to nursing home residents. 
In an effort to address these issues, the Legislature passed a law in 2022 to close a loophole that had allowed nursing home operators to run facilities without first receiving licenses. The law required the Department of Public Health to look at an applicant’s track record over several years before granting a license.
But before that law took effect the following year, the Department of Public Health suddenly granted Rechnitz and his companies many of the licenses it had previously left pending or outright denied. The group includes nursing homes that were the focus of recent lawsuits, such as Country Villa Wilshire, the Los Angeles-area facility where a jury awarded $2.34 million after a woman allegedly fell repeatedly due to understaffing; Windsor Redding, where the 24 patients died during a COVID outbreak; and Windsor Healthcare Center of Oakland, where complaints filed in Alameda County Superior Court allege a woman was sexually assaulted twice and a man died after being given too much medication.
Ed Dudensing, a Sacramento-based attorney who specializes in elder abuse in nursing homes, is bringing the case in Alameda County Superior Court alleging that neglect and poor staffing allowed a fellow patient to rape 79-year-old Cheryl Doe on multiple occasions while she stayed at Windsor Healthcare Center of Oakland. He is also representing the family of 64-year-old Alando Williams in the lawsuit against the same facility alleging overmedication and wrongful death.
Dudensing has three other active cases against facilities affiliated with Rechnitz and his web of companies alleging neglect, abuse and wrongful death. 
In one of them, 78-year-old Barbara Pendley allegedly died after suffering severe dehydration at North Point Healthcare & Wellness Centre in Fresno. 
North Point was another facility that the state opted to grant Rechnitz and his companies the license for under the 2023 settlement agreement. 
Rechnitz and his companies have filed legal responses denying allegations in all of these cases, several of which are scheduled to go to trial in the coming year. 
“We’ve just got to keep fighting,” Dudensing said.
“There was a time when there was a lot of scrutiny and that’s obviously well-documented,” he said. “But he managed to slip through.”
Cassie Dunham, the previous deputy director of the Center for Health Care Quality for the California Department of Public Health, last year became chief executive and president of the California Association of Health Facilities, the industry’s lobbying group. Through a spokesperson, Dunham declined an interview for this story citing her involvement with the development of departmental policy during the time that the state granted Rechnitz the licenses.
Corey Egel, a spokesman for the industry group and himself a former spokesman for the Department of Public Health, said in a statement that the association “supports strong, transparent oversight but believes the system would benefit from clearer timelines, more consistent application of standards, and more efficient resolution of pending cases — so that regulatory goals and resident care priorities can both be met.”
Patient lawsuit at newly licensed nursing home
Among the facilities that Rechnitz’companies received a state license to run in 2023 was Country Villa Wilshire, an 81-bed Los Angeles nursing home. 
According to a lawsuit against the facility, 84-year-old Betsy Jentz landed there in November 2020 after she fell and fractured her ribs and hip. Prior to her injuries, the complaint stated that Jentz had been in excellent health; her attorneys said she had run 27 marathons.
But during the next year, according to a plaintiff’s brief, Jentz fell at least 10 times. On some of these occasions, she hit her head, suffered a fractured and dislocated shoulder and a fractured pelvis. The complaint also described malnutrition and severe pressure ulcers. It attributed those injuries to neglect. In court filings, Rechnitz and his companies have denied all responsibility.

On the evening of Jan. 28, 2024, Jentz’ great nephew Derek Skylar Aud was preparing to testify in court the next morning. Then, according to court documents, he received an unexpected phone call.
The man on the other end of the line introduced himself as Shlomo Rechnitz, Aud later wrote in a declaration filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court.  
Over the course of more than an hour, Rechnitz allegedly told Aud that “things would get very nasty” for him and Jentz if Aud testified, the declaration said. Rechnitz allegedly said he would prolong the case for years and bring to light damaging information his private investigators had collected about Jentz. 
He also said his private investigators had learned that Jentz loved basketball, and said she could receive courtside Lakers tickets “right next to LeBron James” if she agreed to a side deal, Aud told the court.
“Mr. Rechnitz then said ‘listen, I get it, we really fucked up and I’m accepting full responsibility, but I want the remedy or accountability to be on my terms and cut all these outrageous attorney’s fees out of the picture,’” Aud said in the declaration. “He also said ‘we fucked up and I accept responsibility, we were severely understaffed.’” 
Rechnitz did not directly respond to these allegations in court, and the judge ultimately did not allow the jury to consider the phone call to Aud in making its decision. 
Attorneys from Lanzone Morgan, a Long Beach law firm that specializes in nursing home abuse, represented Jentz and Aud in their case against Country Villa Wilshire. They said that the judge accepted defense attorneys’ argument that the call constituted “confidential settlement discussions” and did not allow the jury to hear testimony about it. Gittler & Berg and Ekpebe Law Group, the law firms that represented Rechnitz and his companies in the case, did not respond to CalMatters’ requests for comment. The jury’s $2.34 million verdict is now being appealed.
Lanzone Morgan also brought the case against Alameda Healthcare & Wellness that ended in the $7.6 million judgment in August. The case is in a post-trial phase in which the judge is determining how to apportion the liability among defendants.
Rockport Healthcare Services, the administrative services company for many of the homes, is also named in some of the lawsuits, including the one against Alameda Healthcare & Wellness. Rockport is owned by Steven Stroll, who has also served as Rechnitz’ accountant. Rockport has filed responses in court denying responsibility for the allegations. 
Elizabeth Kim, an attorney with Lanzone Morgan, said she wants to see the Department of Public Health stop issuing licenses to Rechnitz and “other bad actors.”
“It’s shocking to me that he’s able to get licenses after he pretty much runs many of his facilities into the ground,” she said. She referred to an Aug. 22 trial in which Rechnitz acknowledged owning a private plane and having recently sold a home in Los Angeles for $23 million. 
Her client, Aud, whose great aunt Jentz died in January 2025 a few months after the jury made its decision, wrote in his declaration to the court:
“I continue to feel uneasy about the calls and threats and I carry the fear of retaliation with me daily…I do live in fear that Mr. Rechnitz is now even more furious and that he will make good on his threats.”

Here’s why",Adam Echelman,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/2025/11/immigrant-drivers/,"The Trump administration is cracking down on immigrants who drive trucks in California, creating new regulations and threatening to withhold millions in federal highway funding over alleged violations by the state’s DMV.  Newsom says those allegations are a lie.","In summary
The Trump administration is cracking down on immigrants who drive trucks in California, creating new regulations and threatening to withhold millions in federal highway funding over alleged violations by the state’s DMV.  Newsom says those allegations are a lie.


New federal regulations could leave California with 61,000 fewer truck drivers as the Trump administration bans certain immigrants from operating large vehicles. With fewer truck drivers on the road, consumers may see higher shipping costs, too. 
Following an executive order from President Donald Trump in April, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy began cracking down on truck drivers by creating new regulations that prevent refugees, asylum seekers, and those with Deferred Action for Child Arrivals, or DACA, from holding commercial trucking licenses. The administration is also increasing enforcement to penalize those who have limited English proficiency. 
California is the main target of both actions, sparking a feud between Duffy and Gov. Gavin Newsom. 
“Licenses to operate a massive, 80,000-pound truck are being issued to dangerous foreign drivers — often times (sic) illegally. This is a direct threat to the safety of every family on the road,“  Duffy wrote in a statement in September. “California’s reckless disregard is frankly disgusting and an affront to the millions of Americans who expect us to keep them safe.” 
Newsom has been unsparing in his responses. “Sounds like the federal Secretary of Transportation needs a lesson on his own road rules,” wrote his press office in October on the social media platform X. “Once again, the Sean ‘Road Rules’ Duffy fails to share the truth — spreading easily disproven falsehoods in a sad and desperate attempt to please his ‘dear leader,’” the office said in November, responding to more allegations by Duffy. 
Until recently, the federal government allowed states to issue trucking licenses to non-citizen immigrants, including refugees, asylum seekers, and those with DACA. Of the more than 720,000 trucking licenses that are active in California, about 8%, or roughly 61,000, belong to this class of immigrants. 
Now, under the new federal regulations released in September, nearly all of the 61,000 immigrants will lose their licenses in the coming months or years — for some, as soon as January. 
Losing thousands of license-holders could disrupt California’s transportation economy, said Rebecca Higgins, vice president of policy for the Eno Center on Transportation, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. These cuts may lead to a sudden drop in the number of drivers in the state, potentially increasing shipping costs, she said. 
In addition to the new regulations, the U.S. Transportation Department has repeatedly claimed that it conducted a “nationwide audit” of trucking policies and that at least five other states —  Texas, South Dakota, Washington, Pennsylvania, and Colorado — have a history of violating federal law by giving licenses to ineligible immigrants. But the transportation department only publicly released an audit of California’s Department of Motor Vehicles and has refused to respond to CalMatters’ requests for data on any other state. 
Duffy has threatened to withhold $160 million in federal highway safety funds from California because of alleged violations found in the audit. That money, representing about 4% of these federal funds, is supposed to arrive next fall. Duffy doesn’t have the legal right to withhold the remaining 96%. 
Separately, the transportation department said it will no longer award any money to California from a different federal grant, totaling about $40 million, because it alleges that California isn’t enforcing English-language proficiency guidelines for truck drivers.
‘Insufficient evidence’ to support new regulations 
Over the last decade, the demand for truckers has grown as companies like Amazon increasingly offer home shipping for any product imaginable. The trucking industry has expanded along with it, though companies have long struggled to retain workers willing to work the long hours with low pay that many entry-level positions offer. 
With more trucks on the roads compared to 10 years ago, truck drivers are involved in a higher percentage of crashes and traffic-related fatalities. Duffy said the new regulations for immigrant drivers are an effort to save lives. But in publishing the new regulations on immigrant truck drivers, Duffy’s transportation department acknowledged that there’s “insufficient evidence” to prove that certain kinds of immigrants drive more dangerously than other drivers. Instead, the department  justified the regulations by citing a number of high-profile crashes involving truck drivers who allegedly lack legal status, including a fiery crash on the I-10 in Ontario in October.   
The driver, Jashanpreet Singh, is in jail, where he’s charged with vehicular manslaughter and reckless driving leading to the death of three people and injuries of two more. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security claims he lacks legal status and said it plans to detain him even if the charges are dropped.
In a Nov. 13 letter, the transportation department claims that if California had complied with the new regulations then “the crash may have been avoided.” But Higgins said the federal focus on a few crashes involving immigrants is glossing over the “root cause” of most traffic accidents, such as speeding and driving under the influence.
Thousands of licenses rescinded
Following the federal audit of California’s DMV, the state has already rescinded 17,000 licenses from immigrant truck drivers, giving each of them 60 days to stop driving and find a new job.  Duffy said California was “caught red-handed” violating federal law on trucking licenses while Newom’s press office said that was a “lie.”
The reality is more nuanced. The federal audit found that California had issued some trucking licenses with expiration dates that extend past the dates that the driver could prove their legal right to remain in the U.S. The California DMV said that federal law never prohibited this practice until September, when the transportation department changed the rules. California rescinded these 17,000 licenses to abide by the new regulations and never violated the law, the DMV said.  
After it rescinded those licenses, California asked the federal government to drop its threat to withhold $160 million in highway safety funds, but the transportation department refused. 
All told, the money at risk represents a small fraction of the total federal dollars that go to California’s highways, so small that most Californians are unlikely to notice the change on the road, said Higgins. “The general public doesn’t notice a 3% or 2% reduction in highway funding, and they don’t notice a 1% reduction in trucks on the road.”
Still, she said many truck drivers and trucking companies could be hit hard.
Because of the transportation department’s new rules, California has already denied over 300 applications for truck licenses from refugees, asylum seekers, and those with DACA status, said Toni Tinoco, the assistant deputy secretary for communications at the state’s transportation agency. Driving schools say that some students have decided not to apply at all, knowing that their applications won’t be accepted.
Even after rescinding 17,000 licenses, California still has about 44,000 immigrant truck drivers whose licenses are still valid. But it’s likely that they won’t be able to renew their licenses as long as the federal regulations remain in effect. The only exceptions are those who have certain work visas known as the H-2a, H-2b or E-2, which are relatively rare for truck drivers.
A lawsuit by two national unions representing truck drivers appealed the new federal regulations and a judge agreed last week to temporarily pause their implementation, saying the federal government didn’t give states enough prior notice before changing its rules. 
But the U.S. Transportation Department said the ruling doesn’t apply to any state under disciplinary actions, such as California. Tinoco said California will continue denying immigrants their licenses.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/092425_Melon-Farm-Day-2_LV_CM_08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-20 08:57:06.598628

Sen. Dan Thatcher of West Valley City announced last month that he is looking to leave the Legislature, but only if his party — which he joined in March after leaving the Republican Party — would be able to replace him through an election open to all voters in the district, which includes parts of Tooele, Eagle Mountain, West Valley City, West Jordan, Herriman and Magna.
It’s still possible that state leaders or the Utah GOP could step in to oppose the Forward Party’s plans. The Forward Party of Utah has said Utah law allows it to define its own process for selecting an appointee to fill a midterm vacancy; that nomination would then need to be approved by the governor.

Dan Thatcher, a former Republican from West Valley City who is now affiliated with the Utah Forward Party, speaks at a joint convention of the United Utah and Utah Forward parties, where members of both parties voted to merge into one.

In a release Wednesday, Utah’s Forward Party released the names of five eligible candidates who have applied to replace Thatcher and published profiles for each of them online at 11chooses.com. A candidate forum is scheduled for Dec. 4. 
The candidates are:

Tynley Bean, Erda
Maleah Bliss, Kearns
Emily Buss, Eagle Mountain
Jeff Marshall, Magna
Jeff Saunders, Tooele

The party also shared its plans for approval voting, including options to vote online or in person between Dec. 5 and Dec. 11 after voters verify their identities. The winning appointee will be announced Dec. 12 and then sent to Gov. Spencer Cox for approval. 
The voting schedule released by the Forward Party of Utah says:

Dec. 5: Mailed codes delivered; online voting opens
Dec. 9: Half-day in-person voting open in Tooele
Dec. 10: Half-day in-person voting open in Eagle Mountain
Dec. 11: Last day to vote; four in-person locations to vote throughout the district.

In a statement, Michelle Quist, chair of the Forward Party of Utah, called the replacement process “unprecedented.” 
“We believe this process is better for Utahns because it encourages participation, strengthens democracy, and returns choice to the people. We hope every registered voter in SD11 reviews the candidates at 11chooses.com in preparation for their vote,” Quist said.

The votes could bring an end to two long-running battles over free expression and content in state libraries, particularly on LGBTQ+ issues. Craig Scott, a past president of the Alabama Library Association and critic of the changes, said that the vote was simply a formality.
“They already know what they are going to do,” he said. “It is all but done essentially.”

John Wahl, the chair of the APLS board and the Alabama Republican Party, denies that the process was unfair.
“I think it was overwhelmingly fair,” he said. “We submitted a public comment period that was longer than required by state code. We had public time where everyone was invited to come and speak. I think this is a code change that the board does support.”
Both issues have been before the APLS board for months at the behest of board member Amy Minton, who is also running for Alabama Senate.  Minton first proposed the “gender ideology” restrictions — never defined — in May. Minton cited an executive order from President Donald Trump saying there are two genders and the Alabama Legislature’s passage of the “What Is A Woman” Act, defining gender by the presence of sexual organs. An executive order is not a law.
The APLS Board voted in July to adopt Minton’s proposal through the administrative code change process, which then initiated the formal process that included a public comment period that began at the end of August and ran through mid-October. Free speech advocates, including Read Freely Alabama, an organization that opposes the restrictions, criticized the process as unfair and not transparent.
During an Oct. 21 meeting , Ron Snider, one of the board members, accused Wahl of using his position as chair of the Alabama Republican Party to influence the results of the written submissions during the public comment period.
Wahl has denied any wrongdoing on his part.
“Party members passed resolutions,” he said. “County parties sent stuff out, the state party sent out an email letting people know about the public comment period, and I think they should have. This is a healthy part of the process. We want people to know about decisions that are happening. We want people to let their voice be heard, no matter what side it is.”
Snider provided two letters penned by Alabama Republican Party staff urging their supporters to submit comments in favor of Minton’s proposal to update the administrative code. Those then resulted in a flood of comments shortly before the Oct. 14 deadline.
APLS staff said that 873 comments were submitted before the final day and that more than 600 were in favor of the administrative code changes. Then, on the deadline, 7,605 comments were submitted and of that, 6,173 were in favor of the administrative code.
“I think it has been a bit of a farce,” said Angie Hayden, one of founding members for Read Freely Alabama. “It is the board’s attempt at looking like they are following the procedure and respecting the wishes of parents when really, they have had an agenda from the beginning.”

Fairhope

APLS will also decide whether the Fairhope Public Library is following the administrative code and eligible to, once again, receive state aid. The APLS Board voted to suspend state aid for the library in March amid complaints from a handful of people who accused library staff of shelving inappropriate material in its teens section in violation of the administrative code that APLS passed in the summer of 2024.
Fairhope Public Library officials said they had been complying with the code and submitted their policies for review by APLS when the administrative code changes were updated in 2024 and were not told they were out of compliance.
Since their funding was revoked, Fairhope started the process to review the books that some in the community had challenged and reshelved seven of the titles in the adult section while retaining 10 in the teens section of the library.
However, APLS opted to continue to suspend state aid for the library at the September meeting so that members of the board could review the challenged books themselves to determine if the library is complying with the administrative code changes.
Fairhope has permanently forfeited state aid for the rest of 2025, roughly $22,000, because they had been out of compliance with the administrative code after the June 30 deadline to receive the funding since it was suspended.
The question is whether APLS will continue to deny the library its funding moving forward. Supporters of the Fairhope Public Library raised more than enough to offset the funding that was lost for 2025.
“Luckily, we were able to raise that money in record time, in less than seven days,” said Elizabeth Williams, who helped set up the GoFundMe account to fundraise. “We raised, I think $48,000 is the final amount when we cut off giving. The library will not suffer. The library is well funded for quite some time. That $22,000 will be given back to them. We have held off delivering the funds to the library because we wanted to see, and they wanted to see, if the state would reinstate the funding.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_7612-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-20 08:57:06.598628

A recent report says the use of prison labor by Hyundai suppliers may be holding down wages for other auto workers. (Courtesy Jobs to Move America)Mark Miller worked a dangerous job for more than four decades, but he said he’d never gotten hurt at work until his employment with an automotive supplier in Montgomery.
In two years with the company, he broke his hand and four ribs in two separate accidents. Miller said he received no safety training before being charged with running production lines for vehicle consoles and dash components, and employees were constantly dodging forklifts whizzing by at full speed, carrying parts from trucks to assembly lines.
“You was on your alert at all times,” said Miller, who worked at the facility from 2022 to 2024.“I was trained maybe 10 minutes on the job, and I was told to do it and go as fast as I could go.”
As bad as these conditions were, Miller — at the time one of thousands of incarcerated people that private companies employ in Alabama — said quitting would have meant facing greater risks in a higher security facility within the state’s notoriously dangerous prison system.
“So I had no choice in the matter,” he said.
The limited options Miller and other incarcerated workers face could be suppressing wages and increasing safety risks throughout the automotive-supply industry in areas — including Montgomery — where suppliers make use of prison labor. That’s the conclusion of a study the Columbia University Labor Lab released Nov. 6.
“Even when you just look at the free-world workers, the non-incarcerated workers, we find that the plants that are using a higher share of incarcerated workers have worse wages, worse working conditions,” Suresh Naidu, an economics professor at Columbia University and one of four study authors, said at a Nov. 6 press conference during which Miller also spoke.
Focus on Hyundai supply chain
Hyundai and other major manufacturers don’t use prison labor in their own facilities in any meaningful way, said Aaron Sojourner, a senior economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research. “It’s too reputationally risky for the brand,” he said.
The study instead centers on Hyundai suppliers in Alabama, companies that provide the automaker with parts for vehicle construction.
Through the Alabama Department of Corrections’ work-release program, prisoners are housed in minimum-security facilities and work, without officer supervision and in plain clothes, alongside free employees for private companies. They also work for public agencies. Auto suppliers employ many people in the work-release program, which is being challenged in court through state and federal lawsuits after a 2022 change to Alabama’s Constitution that banned “involuntary servitude.”
In addition to working for auto-parts suppliers, incarcerated people work in a range of industries, including general manufacturing, lumber, fast food, meat processing and other food processing/distribution, according to the federal lawsuit and public records reviewed by the Alabama Reflector. Incarcerated people also work for city, county and state agencies, including the Alabama Department of Transportation, the city of Montgomery and Jefferson County, according to the federal lawsuit.
The study connects prison labor to low pay among Alabama’s Hyundai suppliers.
The study correlates a 10% increase in the proportion of incarcerated workers at a plant with a 10% to 14% drop in wages for free workers.
Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama’s plant, which produces around 360,000 vehicles annually, has been operating since 2005. With 4,500 workers, the plant is Montgomery’s largest manufacturing employer and is one of only two plants in the United States where Hyundai vehicles are assembled. The other opened in Georgia late last year.
Hyundai’s supply chain is concentrated in the Montgomery area, and its suppliers employ another 6,000 people nearby, according to the study. Multiple facilities that house work-release inmates also are in this part of the state.
According to the study, wages for workers in the entire auto-supply sector in the Montgomery area are 7% to 9% below expectations, based on wages in nearby regions.
Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama did not respond to specific questions from the Alabama Reflector, but public relations manager Scott Posey provided a statement saying the company is aware some suppliers previously participated in Alabama’s work-release program.
“However, Hyundai was not involved in any supplier’s decision to participate in such program,” the statement reads. “Consistent with the standards and values to which we hold ourselves as a company, we mandate that our suppliers and business partners strictly adhere to the law, and we have an established track record of taking action when alleged violations occur.”
Posey also pointed to Hyundai’s supplier and business partner codes of conduct, both of which have sections on forced labor.
“HMMA expects Business Partners to support HMMA’s commitment to ensuring that no products entering its supply chain are mined, produced, or manufactured, in whole or in part, with forced, imprisoned, indentured, or indentured child labor (collectively, “forced labor”), by preventing the use of forced labor within their own operations and undertaking measures to ensure that forced labor is not used within their supply chains,” states the business partner code of conduct, which includes suppliers in its definition of business partners.
Still, advocates contend suppliers are still employing Alabama prisoners through the work-release program.
Effects of prison labor on all workers’ wages, working conditions
Study authors explained how prison labor can push down wages and negatively impact working conditions for all employees in a facility or entire industry sector.
When workers feel they can’t leave a job, this gives employers power to keep wages low, they said. Using surveys of more than 600 auto-supplier workers in Alabama — 13% of them incarcerated — researchers found that incarcerated workers were less likely than others to quit their jobs based on hypothetical wage decreases and felt less freedom in general to leave their employment.
Jobs to Move America has been investigating prison labor in the auto-supply chain for years, and staff conducted worker surveys used in the Columbia study between August and December 2024, primarily through in-person visits to manufacturing plants.
Alabama’s work-release program participants typically receive only a third of wages their employers pay. The state takes 40% of their gross earnings and also deducts fees for things like transportation and laundry.
And workers don’t choose their jobs in the first place. Job-placement officers at work-release facilities and community work centers where they’re housed make those decisions.
“I was put there,” Miller said of his assignments to two Montgomery-area plants operated by the same Hyundai supplier. He said he was told, “if I couldn’t do my job, that they’d just call the camp and report it, and then the camp would write me up if I didn’t do it, and probably send me back to one of the dangerous prisons.”
In a lawsuit the U.S. Justice Department filed against ADOC in 2020, the department said its investigation into the state’s prisons for men found use of excessive force by guards, failure to protect inmates from violence, overcrowding, understaffing and other conditions that amounted to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of inmates’ Eighth Amendment rights. The litigation is ongoing, and ADOC public information manager Kelly Windham Betts said the department can’t comment on it for that reason.
By contrast, work-release facilities are often safer.
An ADOC regulation requires employers to pay for inmate labor in the same manner as for any other employee, which means they must pay the same wage for similar work. Because of this — and because surveys showed free workers in the Montgomery area also felt compelled, to a higher-than-average degree, to stay in their jobs — study authors said prison labor is a factor that explains lower wages for all auto-supplier workers in the Montgomery area.
“Since the free-world workers also find it hard to quit, and the suppliers and the plants that use incarcerated labor have access to this additional pool of workers that have an even harder time quitting, employers can profitably lower wages for both free and incarcerated workers,” Naidu said.
Some of the same dynamics also could be affecting safety and other working conditions, according to the study.
The ADOC regulation states employers must comply with the Fair Labor Standards Act and incarcerated workers can’t be used as strikebreakers, but the Columbia study points out those on work release aren’t allowed to join labor unions.
Job-placement officers within ADOC’s work-release program monitor working conditions for people in the program and handle any complaints, Betts wrote in an email. “Work release programs are instrumental to the success of inmates preparing for release back into the community,” she continued.
Study authors also note reports that Hyundai suppliers have used child and migrant workers, according to reporting by Reuters and the New York Times and a lawsuit,  “for whom similarly coercive dynamics likely apply, and which similarly drive down wages and working conditions for all.”
Possible solutions
In an academic working paper related to the study, the same authors report creating a model to determine how four potential changes could affect both incarcerated and free workers.
They conclude all four changes — reforming prison conditions to eliminate violence, eliminating prison labor wage garnishment, imposing a $15 minimum wage, and abolishing prison labor — would improve welfare of free workers while only the first three would positively affect incarcerated workers. Ending prison labor would have negative consequences for those who are incarcerated, the authors write.
Will Tucker, Southern director for Jobs to Move America, said his ideal solution would be to release, through parole or other means, all participants in the work-release program.
“They are quote-unquote safe enough to be released into the free world to work an 8-hour, 10-hour shift, and yet they’re not safe enough to just go home to their families,” he said. “That’s absurd. They should just be freed. And for a state that has a massive overcrowding problem in their prisons, it’s a solution that’s right there in front of them.”
In the meantime, cutting contracts with private employers and sending people back into dangerous prisons isn’t the right thing to do, he continued.
Companies that are benefiting from the work-release program have a role to play as well, he said.
Jobs to Move America filed a lawsuit in California on Nov. 13 against Hyundai and Kia alleging the automakers falsely certified compliance with that state’s “high-road” labor standards while profiting from suppliers in the U.S. South that have used child and prison labor.

A long history

Mark Miller said he was injured while working for a Hyundai supplier through a work release program. (Courtesy Jobs to Move America)
Alabama’s work-release program is the latest chapter in a long history of systems that make use of captive labor.
After slavery was abolished, Alabama came to operate the most profitable convict-leasing system in the country, said study author Adam Reich, a sociology professor at Columbia. And it was the last state to end convict leasing in 1928. Prison labor currently benefits the state to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars per year, according to one lawsuit.
Arguments in the courts surrounding another lawsuit, which challenges the legality of the work-release program in light of the 2022 state constitution change, hinge on the definition of “involuntary servitude,” with attorneys for the state saying it doesn’t exist in Alabama’s prison system.
Miller gained his freedom in April. Tucker said Jobs to Move America and some of its partners successfully advocated for his and six other former workers’ parole — a major feat in Alabama, where parole is denied to the vast majority of those eligible for it.
Miller said after he broke his ribs at work and was lying on the ground, gasping for air, supervisors told him they would call an ambulance, but they called the state van instead. He said the company called him back to work before he had healed, and supervisors ordered him to continue working immediately after the incident that broke his hand.

(Photo courtesy of Angela Mund)Rural residents in South Carolina face significant challenges when it comes to accessing health care. Many live in areas where hospitals and health facilities are few and far between, forcing patients to travel long distances for even basic medical services.
Several rural hospitals have closed in recent years, further straining an already fragile system. The shortage of health-care providers means patients often wait weeks or months for appointments.
Certified registered nurse anesthetists help to fill critical gaps in care, providing safe, quality, and cost-effective care, especially in these rural and other medically underserved areas where physician shortages are most acute.
Limited public transportation, higher poverty rates, and lack of health insurance compound these barriers, while aging populations and rising rates of chronic disease increase the demand for care.
Together, these factors create a cycle of health inequity that leaves rural South Carolinians with poorer outcomes and fewer options for timely, affordable care.
Without certified registered nurse anesthetists as the primary providers of anesthesia care, many of these health-care facilities would not be able to offer obstetrical, surgical, pain management, trauma stabilization and other services that patients deserve.
According to national statistics, more than 80% of anesthesia providers in rural counties are certified nurses who are fully qualified to provide the entire spectrum of anesthesia services, from the simplest to the most complex procedures.
Thursday is National Rural Health Day, when our nation honors the community-minded focus of health care in rural America and recognizes the unique challenges that rural communities face, it’s important to applaud the workers who deliver that care.
Rural patients need access to surgical and anesthesia care, often times at a moment’s notice, particularly so that older patients who may have higher rates of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, ischemic heart disease, hypertension and heart failure don’t have to travel long distances to access the care they need.
The expertise of certified registered nurse anesthetists ensures patients get the care they need.
Bound by bureaucracy: How South Carolina ties the hands of its nurse practitioners

But even with all that they do, challenges remain. There are still gaps to fill.
Right now, outdated “supervision” requirements in South Carolina prohibit them from practicing to the fullest extent of their education and training.
It has been four decades since substantial changes have been made to the way anesthesiology is delivered in the Palmetto State. Yet, the needs of our communities and the overall health delivery landscape have changed drastically.
I have seen firsthand how much certified registered nurse anesthetists can do when burdensome and outdated regulations are removed and these highly trained professionals are allowed to reach their full potential.
Health systems deliver safe, high-quality anesthesia services more efficiently, surgical delays are reduced, and patients receive expanded access to essential medical procedures.
More people are moving here, yet we face a health-care worker shortage. Simple policy solutions can add to the ranks of anesthesiology professionals.
Fortunately, legislative proposals would modernize the way anesthesia is delivered in South Carolina and bring us into alignment with other states.
These measures would remove the supervision requirements of certified registered nurse anesthetists, ensure that each health-care facility has the flexibility to utilize them in the ways that best meets the needs of their communities, and grant limited prescriptive authority to allow them to effectively order and administer timely care to their patients.
Expanding their autonomy through legislative reforms is a critical step toward stabilizing our rural health-care network and empowering certified registered nurse anesthetists to deliver comprehensive care where it’s needed most.
But policy alone isn’t enough. We need sustained investment in rural hospitals, workforce development, and insurance coverage to ensure that every South Carolinian has access to safe, quality, and cost-effective care.
The bottom line: Certified registered nurse anesthetists aren’t just filling gaps — they’re holding the system together.
It’s time to give them the tools and support they need to ensure that every South Carolinian has access to safe, timely care, no matter where they live.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Mund-in-OR-cropped-1024x768.png,,,2025-11-20 07:56:50.611714

(Joshua Bowling/Source New Mexico) Each of New Mexico’s district attorneys on Wednesday asked state lawmakers during ongoing Legislative Finance Committee hearings to increase their funding in the upcoming legislative session. Most every prosecutor’s office asked for more money to hire attorneys and support staff, but DAs in New Mexico’s most rural areas had a unique set of requests.
In the Eighth Judicial District, which includes Taos, Colfax and Union counties, prosecuting attorneys rely on a high-mileage fleet of cars to cover courthouse visits that require driving as much as 140 to 266 miles round-trip. In the Fifth Judicial District, which includes Roswell, attorneys experience disruptions to internet speeds and reliability during electronic discovery processes. And across the state, IT services and computers are “at end-of-life” and need a major overhaul, the president of the New Mexico Administrative Office of the District Attorneys said.
Marcus Montoya, district attorney for the Eighth Judicial District and president of the New Mexico District Attorneys’ Association, said his office currently has 10 vehicles, two of which have clocked more than 100,000 miles. The odometer on his office’s 2005 Toyota Matrix recently rolled over to 142,282 miles, he said, noting that Kelley Blue Book assigns that vehicle an average lifespan of 147,428 miles.
His staff attorneys need the vehicles to attend court hearings, serve subpoenas and attend meetings throughout the vast district, Montoya said. Extreme weather isn’t uncommon in his part of the state, where roads and highways stretch through craggy, mountainous terrain.
“We are the Dutch boy plugging the dam with our finger,” Montoya said.
He asked state lawmakers to increase his office’s base budget by about 4.4%, which would include $75,000 to upgrade its vehicle fleet. In all, his office requested about $6 million. Montoya’s office isn’t alone — the 12th Judicial District Attorney’s Office, which includes Alamogordo, also requested about $71,000 to replace vehicles with 150,000 miles. 
Dianna Luce, DA for the Fifth Judicial District, told state lawmakers that her office has issues with internet speeds and said that convincing University of New Mexico law graduates to move to Chaves County is a tough proposition. As of Wednesday, she said her office has seven unfilled staff attorney positions.
“It is extremely difficult to hire attorneys,” she said. “We primarily hire from outside the state.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ruralDas-1024x697.jpg,,,2025-11-20 07:56:50.611714

New Jersey has seen hundreds of suits filed under the statute by Atlas Data Privacy on behalf of police officers and other officials whose information is shielded by Daniel’s Law, with Atlas alleging data brokers and other companies have not complied with requests to scrub the officials’ personal information from the internet. Those suits have spurred some constitutional concerns as they’ve proceeded through state and federal courts.

Johnson’s legislation would remove covered individuals’ ability to select an assignee to sue to enforce Daniel’s Law on their behalf, and it would give judges discretion to award damages in such cases. Those awards are mandatory under existing law.
The bill would also limit damages to cases where data companies accused of disclosing officials’ personal information showed negligence or intention to violate the law. There is no such requirement under existing law.
Johnson, echoing concerns raised by data firms that have sued to strike the law as unconstitutional, said amendments made to Daniel’s Law in 2023 that allowed individuals covered by the law to designate assignees to enforce it on their behalf created a “cottage industry” for outside firms to profit.
Those changes “opened the door for predatory companies who have turned this protection into a profit scheme, which does nothing to protect the people we’re trying to protect and makes money for them,” Johnson said.
But supporters of the 2023 bill that made those changes argue its provisions are key to the law’s enforcement. That measure’s prime Senate sponsor, Sen. Joe Cryan (D-Union), said data brokers had largely ignored Daniel’s Law until his bill increased their liability.
“We established true penalties, and we had assignability in there, and that was meant to simply protect people. And I noticed that’s when all the multi-billion data privacy companies that sell your data each and every day, that’s when they started to pay attention to it,” he said.
Removing covered persons’ ability to have third parties sue on their behalf would stifle enforcement by forcing individuals to fight large firms with teams of attorneys in court, Cryan said. Other penalties introduced by Johnson’s bill would not be enough to force compliance, he added.
In place of mandatory damages and a court-heavy enforcement system, Johnson’s amendments would require firms to regularly access an online portal where individuals whose information is shielded from disclosure can request it be removed, or pay a $200 fine.
“The reality is those fines are a drop in the bucket to these kinds of companies if they even pay attention to them. Remember, they have a demonstrated history of not paying attention, and when we amended this bill, that’s when they started to pay attention,” Cryan said.
Firms would also be forced to pay an annual fee to access the portal. The bill gives state officials the authority to set that fee.
Johnson acknowledged concerns about his bill’s effect on the enforceability of Daniel’s Law and said he is willing to discuss changes to his legislation, including possible provisions that would allow people covered by Daniel’s Law to lodge class action suits to shield their information.
“This bill is a living document that can be amended again,” Johnson said. “We’re always open for discussion.”
Cryan was Union County sheriff before entering the Legislature in 2002. His personal information, like Johnson’s, is already shielded by the law, though Johnson’s bill would extend its protections to court administrators and legislators.
Protections for lawmakers’ personal information, already a concern in Trenton after years of escalating threats of political violence, became a focal point for state lawmakers after a gunman in June killed Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and left another state lawmaker and his spouse critically wounded.
Johnson’s bill would give those hosting shielded information significantly more time to comply with removal requests, raising the window from 10 business days under current law to 45 business days.
Dozens of data brokers sued by Atlas Data Privacy last year argued in court that timelines under present law gave them little time to comply with takedown requests filed on behalf of more than 19,000 individuals.
That case is continuing to move through the courts. The U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments in the case in July. In September, the appeals court said it was unsure of the law’s constitutionality and asked New Jersey’s Supreme Court to weigh the challenge.
Atlas opposes Johnson’s bill, which the senator has dubbed the “Protect Daniel’s Law Act.”
“Slapping a ‘Protect Daniel’s Law’ label on a bill that destroys privacy is like bottling poison and selling it as spring water. This bill would sacrifice the safety of New Jersey’s public servants, and their families, to increase the profits of powerful data brokers,” said Matt Adkisson, the company’s president.
Daniel’s Law is named for Daniel Anderl, who was slain during the attempted assassination of his mother, U.S. District Court Judge Esther Salas. The law’s critics have said it impermissibly chills speech, which they say is compounded by its targeting of even unintentional violations.
Johnson acknowledged those constitutional concerns as one of the bill’s drivers. He said Senate leadership agreed to give the bill a committee hearing, though it’s not clear when it will come before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Johnson said he hopes to have it passed before the new session of the Legislature begins in mid-January.
The bill’s Assembly companion is sponsored by Assemblyman Lou Greenwald (D-Camden), the chamber’s majority leader.

Rural and urban areas have different health outcomes, needs and disparities. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Jan K. Carney: On National Rural Health Day, why community engagement and trusted voices matter in our changing world.","This commentary is by Jan K. Carney, M.D., M.P.H., associate dean for public health and health policy at the University of Vermont’s Larner College of Medicine.


With nearly two-thirds of our population living in rural settings, National Rural Health Day, on Nov. 20, highlights the strengths of our rural communities. Federal changes to expert scientific panels, cuts to health agencies and health programs, and widespread scientific misinformation create confusion in critical areas of health and science. Our Vermont rural strengths can help us directly and positively impact today’s complex health challenges. 
Rural and urban areas have different health outcomes, needs and disparities. Health is heavily influenced by ZIP code due to differences in economic opportunities, affordable housing, food security, transportation and access to health care services.
National initiatives, such as America’s Health Rankings, confirm that many rural states, such as Arkansas, Mississippi, West Virginia, and Alabama are far less healthy, and rural states together have a 23% higher overall mortality rate compared to urban environments. In contrast, despite their rurality, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine have better health outcomes than other rural states. These rural strengths can help guide us in meeting our health and social challenges. 
Publicly accessible health data by geographic regions may also help inform us. One model from the County Health Rankings & Roadmaps project includes measures of population health and well-being, healthcare, quality of life, physical environment, social and economic factors.
Someone living in Addison County, for example, can see how they compare to Vermont and the U.S. in health and social measures. Similarly, Vermont Department of Health cancer data shows differences in risk factors by county, such as tobacco use and rates of HPV vaccination.
The Rural Health Information Hub is another user-friendly source of high-quality data. Taken together as a reflection of our community’s health, these practical sources of data can help us build on our strengths and identify priority health challenges.  
Community engagement and partnerships contribute positively to health outcomes and provide proven strategies for our rural communities. Research from the Northern New England Clinical and Translational Research Network shows a high level of trust with our community partners in advancing research that connects community needs and our academic medical centers. Lessons learned from community-academic partnerships in medical education suggest that community benefit is essential for long-term community engagement and further strengthening our collaborative goals. 
Communication preferences for health information in Vermont rural communities may differ from urban areas. Understanding these preferences is essential to improving health literacy and empowering individuals and entire communities to act on health information that is based on science.
A pilot study with older adults living in rural housing during the Covid-19 pandemic explored how their feedback influenced the specific ways we communicated vaccine information, and used their communication preferences to maximize confidence in public health science.
A statewide electronic survey, in partnership with the United Way of Northwest Vermont, highlighted key differences in how rural residents preferred to receive health information. Whereas the internet, Front Porch Forum, and television were generally preferred by urban respondents, rural populations preferred word of mouth, posters, Facebook, and local papers. This suggests that community “conversations” through local channels, in addition to information from trusted sources, may be key to further improving our individual and collective health. 
Recent examples from the Leahy Institute for Rural Partnerships are testing the possibility of using local libraries to offer telehealth services in rural locations, and our local libraries can also improve health literacy in individuals and families.
What other innovative health connections could we make in our many rural locations? Such strategies can better connect us, reaching individuals, neighbors and families with health information based on science. Whether vaccines, health care services, or advocacy for health and social issues, together, these approaches can contribute to better health, stronger communities and enduring health connections. 
We know our most trusted sources for health information. Recent national polls from the Kaiser Family Foundation confirm that for seeking reliable information about vaccines, physicians, nurses and other health professionals, along with local public health agencies are overwhelmingly trusted for critical health information.
The Vermont Department of Health has 12 local health offices throughout our state, part of a trusted network that connects health care and public health. Expanding our range of trusted voices can prevent disease and illness, and promote access to needed health care, social services and life-saving preventive measures. 
For health, place matters. Our rural strengths, community-academic research, innovations and health communication are all needed, expanding our network of trusted voices. These represent unique opportunities to further strengthen our collective health and become partners in our own health and health care, at every age and in every Vermont community.

Gretchen Whitmer.
Null was charged but was later found not guilty for his alleged role in offering support to the men who conspired to kidnap Whitmer in 2020. He was also one of several militia members who entered the state Capitol, with tactical gear and long guns strapped around their torsos, in protest of Whitmer’s lockdowns at the height of the COVID pandemic.
News of his candidacy was met with near immediate skepticism from Republicans and others on social media, who questioned if Null could amass the more than 15,000 valid signatures needed to make the ballot. Even if he does make the ballot, he faces fierce competition in U.S. Rep. John James, also of Shelbyville, who has positioned himself as a frontrunner in the race.

Aside from James, the full slate of Republican gubernatorial candidates includes Michigan Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt of Porter Township, former Attorney General Mike Cox, former House Speaker Tom Leonard, far-right activist Anthony Hudson and anti-property tax advocate Karla Wagner.
Two men were found guilty in the plot to kidnap Whitmer: Adam Fox and Barry Croft, who are currently serving prison sentences. But several others were arrested and prosecuted on separate federal and state charges. Those who faced federal charges other than Fox and Croft were acquitted, but at least one of them pleaded guilty and testified against the defendants.
Null was among those charged on alleged state crimes of offering material support to Fox and Croft. Several were convicted, but Null, his twin brother Michael Null, and Eric Molitor were found not guilty.
Molitor is listed in campaign filings as the treasurer for Null’s new bid for Michgian’s highest office.
He has been eyeing a run for governor since last year.
The Michigan Democratic Party in a news release condemned the burgeoning campaign.
“William Null is a far-right extremist and former militia member whose dangerous, violent extremism has no place in our state,” Michigan Democratic Party Chair Curtis Hertel said in a statement. “The Michigan Democratic Party strongly condemns Null’s candidacy for governor, and we urge Michigan Republican Party Chair Jim Runestad and each of the Republican candidates for governor to join us in condemning Null and his dangerous extremism.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Facetune_19-09-2024-12-22-27-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-20 07:56:50.611714

The letter, dated Tuesday, is addressed to Pam Bondi, the U.S. attorney general, and Kristi Noem, secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The Department of Justice, overseen by Bondi, in recent months has demanded voter information from numerous states. The information would allow the DOJ to evaluate state compliance with federal voting laws, department officials had said.
But federal officials later acknowledged that the DOJ shared voter roll information with Homeland Security to search it for noncitizens as a way to “scrub aliens from voter rolls.”
The secretaries in their letter express “immense concern” about how the information is being shared, and they “seek clarity on whether DOJ and DHS actively misled election officials regarding the uses of voter data.”
The letter is signed by Colorado’s Jena Griswold as well as Adrian Fontes of Arizona, Shirley Weber of California, Shenna Bellows of Maine, Steve Simon of Minnesota, Francisco Aguilar of Nevada, Maggie Toulouse Oliver of New Mexico, Tobias Read of Oregon, Sarah Copeland Hanzas of Vermont, and Steve Hobbs of Washington.
The secretaries fear Trump officials could misuse the information.
“Is the administration collecting in an unprecedented way mass voter data and dumping it into an untested, unverified federal system to spread voter disinformation — disinformation to undermine our elections?” Griswold said in an interview with Newsline.
Trump’s DOJ wants access to Missouri voting equipment used in 2020 election

DHS operates Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, which can identify the citizenship status of a person. The system can be prone to errors.
“We would like to know what the Trump administration is doing with voter data, and I am proud to stand with nine other secretaries of state to demand answers and accountability,” Griswold said. “We ultimately would like to know what the Trump administration is doing and whether they’re taking appropriate steps required under the law to protect voter information.”
The secretaries of state met with senior DOJ and DHS officials twice, on Aug. 28 and Sept. 11, according to the letter. A DOJ official during the first meeting told the secretaries the department intended to use voter data “to assess compliance with the voter list maintenance provisions of the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) and the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA).”
On Sept. 11, Heather Honey, an election conspiracist who is a Homeland Security “election integrity” official, told the secretaries the department had not requested voter data and had no intention of using it, the letter says.
“The same day, DHS publicly contradicted her representation and confirmed that they had received this data and would input it into the unproven and potentially insecure citizenship-check system, SAVE,” the letter says.
The secretaries request details on the sharing of voter data between federal agencies, the security of the information, and contradictory statements by federal officials. They request a response by Dec. 1.
 Sweeping requests for information

The DOJ has sent requests for voter data to at least 40 states, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. The request to Colorado in May was among the most sweeping — it sought “all records” related to the 2024 election, among other information.
In response, Griswold’s office supplied two copies of the state’s master voter list — one from 2022 and one from May — and one copy of the master voter history list dating from after the election in November 2024. The data includes the names of voters, their residential addresses, birth year, and, if provided by the voter, phone numbers — all public information. It does not include a voter’s social security number, driver’s license number, month and day of birth, signature or email address.
Other states, including Maine, refused to hand over any information. New Hampshire’s Republican secretary of state David Scanlan, citing a state prohibition, said he wasn’t authorized to provide the DOJ with his state’s voter roll.
The voter data requests are just one of many ways the Trump administration has “made our elections less secure,” she said.
In March, Trump issued an executive order that, though a court has blocked key parts of it, would disenfranchise millions of Americans if it were implemented, according to voter advocates. The administration has dismantled federal entities that had worked to support election security or counter foreign election disinformation. It is attempting to eliminate mail-in ballots.
It is trying to free Tina Peters, the election-denying former Colorado county clerk who is serving a prison term for her role in a scheme to breach the security of her own election equipment.
“I do think it’s very important for elected officials to stand up whenever they can,” Griswold said. “It’s all these small situations that grow on top of each other, and we can’t ignore what’s happening at large. And in this situation, I’m proud that 10 of us are coming together and saying we demand answers from Pam Bondi and Kristi Noem to shine light on whatever the Trump administration is doing with this data.”

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)For decades, Hoosier governors and lawmakers have sparred over what can be done during a special legislative session. But state leaders are now confronting a different dilemma — can the General Assembly legally ignore a governor’s demand to convene?
Indiana’s debate reached a new breaking point Tuesday when the Senate chamber voted to adjourn until Jan. 5, rebutting Gov. Mike Braun’s call for a special session on redistricting.
The Senate’s decision to simply not show up appears to be unprecedented in state history.
Republican Sen. Mike Young, who supports redistricting, said Tuesday that lawmakers are already, by definition, in a special session and therefore can’t ignore it.
“The governor has the power to call us into a special session, which he’s done,” Young said. “But we have a right as a body to set a different schedule. … We could have been in and adjourned, sine die, but we chose not to do it. This is a slap in the face of the governor of the state of Indiana.”
He told the Indiana Capital Chronicle that the legislature must at least gavel in and out of the special session — even if redistricting matters are left untouched.
“We first have to go in,” Young said. “I’m not saying we have to do any work. I’m just saying they’re not following the rules of the Constitution.”
But Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray, who leads the chamber, told reporters the opposite.
“It does not appear to be a problem that we can make a decision as to whether we come in or not,” Bray said, citing internal legal advice to the Senate.
Republican House Speaker Todd Huston offered only a brief response Tuesday when asked whether he believes the legislature can ignore the special session call entirely.

“We’ll see if that’s even necessary,” Huston said.
Facing mounting resistance from his own party, Braun said he’s now looking for ways to “compel” the Senate to act. The governor’s office had no further details on what authority he believes he can use. He did radio and television interviews Wednesday but didn’t include print reporters.
The legislature previously planned to meet Dec. 1 to take up President Donald Trump’s wish for Republican-led states to draw more GOP-friendly U.S. House districts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
Indiana’s Senate Republican leadership has maintained the caucus lacks enough support to pass mid-cycle congressional maps. GOP senators were split 19-19 in a vote to adjourn until January. It passed with Democrat support.
‘I don’t see where the legislature can ignore that’
Over the last century, governors of both parties have relied on special sessions to resolve deadlocks, rewrite tax codes and complete budgets. While executive and legislative leaders have clashed, at times, over the content and length of special sessions, historical records reviewed by the Capital Chronicle showed no examples of the General Assembly simply refusing to convene at all.
In 1865, then-Gov. Oliver Morton called a special session to address Civil War–era financial emergencies and reorganize state institutions. In 1919, Gov. James Goodrich summoned lawmakers so Indiana could ratify the 19th Amendment.
In 2002 and again in 2018, governors convened special sessions to tackle unfinished bills and complete budget work. And in 2022, former Gov. Eric Holcomb called lawmakers back for a special session that ultimately produced the state’s near-total abortion ban.
The Indiana Constitution provides that “if, in the opinion of the Governor, the public welfare shall require it, he may, at any time by proclamation, call a special session.”

But the Constitution also grants each chamber authority to “determine its rules of proceeding, and sit upon its own adjournment.” It does not say what happens if lawmakers simply do not convene.
Who controls the session’s length, agenda and existence once called has been debated since Indiana’s first constitutional convention in 1816 and again in 1850.
It resurfaced most recently in a 2022 Indiana Supreme Court case involving Holcomb.
In that case, the high court justices struck down a statute — House Enrolled Act 1123 — that would have allowed the Legislative Council to call the full legislature into special session. The justices held that the governor alone has that authority — but notably did not decide whether the legislature is legally required to meet once the governor calls them in.
The 2022 ruling also traced how delegates in 1850 explicitly rejected proposals to allow the legislature to call itself into session — evidence which the justices said reflected a deliberate choice to vest that power exclusively in the governor.
The opinion further noted that while governors historically initiated special sessions, “the General Assembly retained authority over the conduct and duration of such sessions.”
Indiana Code currently caps special sessions at no more than 30 session days and no more than 40 calendar days following the first day of the governor’s desired session calendar.” 
Former House Speaker Brian Bosma, who served in more than half a dozen special sessions during his tenure, said his reading of the Indiana Constitution is that lawmakers are required to convene, even if only for minutes.

“My personal view, my read of the Constitution and statutes as a lawyer, is that the governor has every right to call us because it’s a singular right to call a special session. And I don’t see where the legislature can ignore that,” Bosma said. “But what I’m confident the legislature could do is come in on the first day and adjourn.”
He added that lawmakers could “adjourn after two minutes,” taking attendance, saying the pledge, and ending the session if they choose.

“It seems to me that the legislature is compelled to be there,” Bosma continued, “but it could adjourn.”
The former House speaker pointed to a notable gathering in 1991, when Senate Republicans abruptly adjourned the first special session during a budget impasse — and “no one questioned (then-Senate President Pro Tem Bob Garton’s) authority to do so.”
Could Braun force lawmakers to appear?
Internal legislative policies could help compel some senators — but only if enough show up in the chamber first.
Senate rules, for example, allow 25 members to “compel the attendance of absent Senators.” There are 40 Republican senators currently in office. 
If at least 25 senators appeared — along with Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith, who presides over the Senate as its constitutional president — they could order absent senators to return, issue calls of the Senate, or adjourn.
But, crucially, those powers apply only after the Senate gavels into session. If the chamber never convenes, none of those enforcement mechanisms can be activated.
Indiana has some precedent for large-scale absences, though. In 2011, Democrats fled the state during a weeks-long walkout over “right-to-work” legislation.
Bosma said “there has been discussion in the past” of the governor “dispatching the state police to collect people up and bring them in” — including in 2011. But while “it’s been threatened, it’s never happened.”
In the wake of that walkout, Indiana enacted “anti-bolting” laws that allow the House and Senate to fine members who intentionally refuse to attend and prevent a quorum. Those penalties can reach $1,000 per day. But those statutes apply only when the chamber is already in session — meaning they provide no mechanism for enforcing attendance at a special session lawmakers never convene.
Bosma emphasized that then-Gov. Mitch Daniels declined to send state police to retrieve the absent lawmakers, however, and noted that such a move today could be politically explosive.
“Certainly, it wouldn’t be done, I would think, (by) a Republican governor to Republican legislators,” he said. “But we’ll see how it plays out.”

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)Minnesota cities and counties spent millions of opioid settlement payouts in 2024 largely on treatment, support for those in addiction recovery, education and administrative costs. Some Minnesota counties spent the cash on law enforcement expenditures intended to weed out drug stashes and bolster criminal investigations: Three spent money on K-9 units, and at least two counties used the funds to pay the salaries of agents investigating drug-related crimes.
The money comes from a series of settlements after state and local governments sued corporations — Johnson and Johnson, McKensson, CVS and other pharmaceutical giants — for their roles in creating and perpetuating the opioid epidemic.
Fewer Americans died from an opioid overdose in 2023 compared to 2022 — 79,358 compared to 81,806 — but that’s still up from 2019, when overdoses killed 49,860. The trend is similar in Minnesota, where opioid overdose deaths rose from around 400 a year in the late 2010s to roughly 1,000 per year since 2021. Provisional CDC data suggests that opioid overdose deaths decreased in 2024, mirroring the dip in all drug overdose deaths in Minnesota and the country.
Local governments have wide discretion in how they spend the money that’s intended to remediate the harms of the epidemic, which is reflected in the variety in local uses of settlement cash.
Local spending picked up in 2024 after a slow start in the first two years, which leaders told the Star Tribune was to be expected for strategizing and decision-making. In 2024, local governments spent over $17 million, compared to $5.5 million in 2023 and $538K in 2022.


The settlements are important in filling funding gaps in the steps of addiction care, said Jeremy Drucker, the state’s addiction and recovery director, who is himself in long-term recovery. Unlike treatment, prevention and long-term recovery services are not covered by Medicaid. Minnesota cities and counties have filled the gap with grants and now opioid settlements.
The largest portion of the settlement money in Minnesota has gone towards supporting people recovering from addiction. Clay County, for example, funded a new detox and withdrawal management facility that opened in 2024. Several counties partnered with existing organizations; Minneapolis spent $500,000 on Turning Point, an organization that provides culturally specific recovery services in north Minneapolis.
Another big chunk — nearly $4 million — was spent on administrative costs, largely to hire staff and form committees to figure out how to spend the rest of the money.
Hennepin County, which will receive over $70 million in the next 18 years, by far the largest share, spent $1.5 million on administrative costs in 2023 and 2024. Julie Bauch, the county’s opioid response senior strategist, said that spending went towards data analysts, contract managers, an opioid finance expert and other staff. The county also spent nearly $1 million on its medical examiner’s office to keep up with increased deaths from drug overdoses.
To date, drug makers, wholesalers and pharmacy chains have reached settlements to pay over $50 billion to state, local and tribal governments, with various deadlines within the next two decades. In Minnesota, an agreement between state and local governments dictates that 75% of the roughly $633 million so far in opioid settlements will go directly to cities and counties, which are required to report spending to the state but otherwise operate with relative autonomy. Though the agreement lists abatement strategies, it also explicitly states that fund recipients have the flexibility to modify their approach “as needed.”
A Tuesday decision by a federal bankruptcy judge adds another $7.4 billion from Purdue Pharma — which made over $35 billion selling OxyContin — and the Sackler family, Purdue’s owners and one of the most notorious players in fueling the opioid epidemic. Minnesota’s share of the Purdue settlement is $59 million over 15 years to state and local governments.
Nationwide, most opioid settlement money so far has gone to treatment, overdose reversal medications, education, counseling and housing-related programs for people with substance abuse issues. A smaller portion of funds went towards law enforcement initiatives like rifle suppressors in Indiana and drones in Arizona, which addiction experts found questionable, a KFF Health News analysis found.
Lackluster oversight of local spending in other states has resulted in expenditures like $600,000 for opioid-awareness concerts in New Jersey, which the state’s comptroller called a “waste” and “misuse” of funds.
Bauch said local governments may be tempted to get creative with opioid settlement money and use it to backfill federal cuts, but she added that Minnesota’s agreement has guardrails in place to prevent shenanigans.
According to the Opioid Settlement Tracker, a website created by lawyer Christine Minhee, Minnesota is one of 20 states committed to reporting 100% of its spending.
Some law enforcement spending seen as questionable
Abigail Winiker, a drug policy researcher, said in an interview that spending on K-9 units and officers for drug investigation task forces “doesn’t stand up to what I consider our standards for effective spending of settlement funds.”
Winiker is on a team at Johns Hopkins that laid out principles to localities spending opioid settlement dollars — a framework which Minnesota’s Department of Health adopts in its own guidance. The first two principles are to “spend the money to save lives” and to “use evidence to guide spending,” both of which are not met by law enforcement spending that targets drug supplies, in Winiker’s view, since drug busts are usually accompanied by arrests of addicts.
“We know from decades of failed Drug War policies and lots of research that a punitive approach to opioid use disorder is ineffective if you want to reduce the harms of the crisis,” Winiker said.
Winiker’s recommendation to counties handling smaller amounts of money is to “not try to re-invent the needle and look for work already being done on the ground” in recovery, harm reduction and prevention.
An opioid epidemic group at RAND also published strategies for allocating local settlement dollars that is referenced in the Minnesota Department of Health’s guide. Bradley Stein, the director of the group at RAND, agreed with Winiker’s assessment.
“I am not aware of anything in the opioid settlement language that would make getting a drug-sniffing dog consistent with the intention of the settlement,” Stein said. “The opioid settlement was pretty clear: It’s to help people that have been affected.”
Drucker said that although the state encourages local governments to invest in prevention, treatment and recovery services, the spirit behind the agreement giving local governments control over three-quarters of the funds was the belief that “local communities know their own needs.”
Kristen Pendergrass, the vice president of Shatterproof, a national addiction nonprofit, acknowledged that communities are faced with hard decisions when it comes to spending. Drug busts can actually make overdose rates go up — because users seek out new dealers with unfamiliar supply — and increase volatility of the drug supply, Pendergrass said. On the other hand, she added, ”We can’t just let illegal drugs flow into communities.”
Blue Earth, Redwood and Le Sueur counties spent a total of $86,156 on police dogs in 2024. Lakeville Police Department spent $196,998 to assign a full-time officer to a county drug task force.
“It’s really a holistic approach,” said Josh Milow, Blue Earth’s deputy county administrator. The county has also spent opioid settlement money to pay for mental health counselors in its schools along with programs for peer recovery support. “We’re really looking at early childhood, we’re looking at mental health, we’re looking at all those steps. Enforcement is also a piece of opioid remediation and we’re going to try to especially get fentanyl out of our community.”
Brad Paulson, the Lakeville chief of police, acknowledged in an email the value of education, treatment and recovery, but added: “Knowing that there are others actively working in those spaces, with the expertise to do so, we’ve chosen to steer our focus largely on the criminal aspect as that is the space we are most familiar with.”
Minnetonka spent $94,425 — most of its opioid settlement spending to date — on a device to identify drugs as well as a fume hood for its police evidence room. The description for the device purchase cites the strength of fentanyl and the need to minimize police exposure to illicit drugs.
Theories that significant fentanyl exposure can happen through skin contact or accidental inhalation have been debunked by the American College of Medical Toxicology and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology. Multiple studies have explored the pervasive misconception that law enforcement officers can accidentally overdose on fentanyl on the job, a belief bolstered by social media videos of officers experiencing symptoms of panic — not opioid overdose — after coming into contact with the drug.
“The fume hood and other tools help increase safety for our staff by decreasing the chance of accidental exposure (to all drugs, not just fentanyl),” said Jessica Case, a Minnetonka Police spokesperson, in an email.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GettyImages-609942630-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-20 07:56:50.611714

Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer. Minnesota has a big problem: Native Americans make up just 2% of the state’s adult population, but they represent 30% of the homeless population. 
This disparity is staggering, sobering and devastating. But surprising?
Tent Cities. The Wall of Forgotten Natives. 
When you drive around the streets of Minneapolis and other areas of the Twin Cities in recent years, the impact of homelessness on Native American communities — and particularly, unsheltered homelessness — has been unmissable. But our relatives’ stories are far more complex than what you see at first glance.
Wilder Research has been working in partnership with the Minnesota Tribal Collaborative to Prevent and End Homelessness, a group of tribal nations working together on homelessness, as well as housing service providers across the state to try to capture and tell these stories. 
In September, we released two companion reports (here, and here) that paint the most comprehensive picture to date of the challenges facing Native Americans experiencing homelessness statewide. This is what we learned: 

An alarming number of Native American adults who are experiencing homelessness are outside, unsheltered. About half of the Native Americans who we interviewed spent at least one night unsheltered in the past month, though many stayed outside for multiple nights.
Many Native American women experiencing homelessness are victims of violence and exploitation before and during their time without housing, echoing the broader crisis of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Relatives. About half of Native American women reported that they had stayed in an abusive situation because they had no other housing options. Native Americans experiencing homelessness are at high risk for being the victim of violence; 44% reported being attacked or assaulted.  
Lack of affordable housing is a critical barrier for homeless Native Americans in greater Minnesota, the Twin Cities metro, and on reservations. In the Twin Cities, Native Americans experiencing homelessness earn a median income of just $203 per month, far less than the median rent for a 1-bedroom apartment, which is $1,115.
High rates of mental illness and substance use disorders make it difficult for people experiencing homelessness to access and maintain stable housing. Native Americans experiencing homelessness were far more likely than non-Natives to have anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and bipolar disorder. Similarly, in our study, Native Americans were five times more likely than non-Natives experiencing homelessness to use fentanyl, four-and-a-half times more likely to use heroin, and three times more likely to use methamphetamines. 

These findings do not exist in a vacuum. They are the result of complex intergenerational and epigenetic trauma. There is a long history of displacement, suppression of culture, breaking up of traditional family and community systems, and genocide that has contributed to this tragic disparity in homelessness for Native Americans in Minnesota. 
Boarding schools, the Indian Adoption Project of the 1950s and 1960s, and the child “protection” system has taken generations of Native children from their families – 38% of Native American adults experiencing homelessness spent time in foster care, compared with 18% of non-Native adults. 
In the 1950s, the federal government also began systematically encouraging Native Americans to relocate from their reservations to several U.S. cities, including Minneapolis. Native American families were given a free one-way ticket, limited financial assistance, and the promise of vocational training, good jobs and a high quality of life. In reality, these families faced housing and job shortages, prejudice, and disconnection from their traditional food systems and cultural and community resources. 
These actions by the federal government (and many other systemic factors) directly contributed to the urban American Indian homelessness problem we face today. 
Despite all this, when we asked them what helps them stay strong during hard times, Native Americans experiencing homelessness identified as strengths their determination, love and responsibility for their children, and resiliency. It is critical to recognize these strengths in any solutions to addressing homelessness.
Self-determination is a key component of any solution to this problem. Our relatives who are experiencing homelessness should be at the center of any solution, with tribal nations and urban American Indian community leaders surrounding these relatives in a protective circle of support and culturally driven approaches. 
Local, state and federal government agencies and private funders should address this circle with humility and respect and should offer a multi-jurisdictional, all-hands-on-deck response to fix this problem that their systems have created over time.  
As a community member, if you want to help, there are many things you can do. You can volunteer for and/or donate to local homeless service providers, including those that focus on the Native American community. Or, consider volunteering for the next Minnesota Homeless Study, taking place in October 2026.

 don’t tax me,
 tax the man behind the tree.
Gov. Mike Kehoe’s recent announcement that he wants to eliminate the Missouri’s income tax causes me to paraphrase this old poem, used often by the late U.S. Sen. Russell Long, longtime chair (1966-1981) of the Senate Finance Committee, when considering proposals for whatever was presented as “tax reform.”
No matter what the fate of the state income tax, the real questions are: (1) for what purposes does the state take our money? (2)  How much money does the government need? and (3) who’s going to pay?
The income tax, like all taxes, starts out with a bad rap.
The more money you make, the more income tax you pay. An income tax can be progressive — before that word came to mean “bad” to some people and “good” to others — which means that the higher your income goes, the higher the percentage the government takes. Missouri’s income tax can hardly be called progressive because it only goes up from 2% to about 4.8%. It used to be 6%, but in recent years legislators could not resist the urge to “cut” taxes even if the cut was modest and triggered by some supposedly good news about tax collections.
The brutal unforgiving fact is that government costs money, and it’s got to come from someone.
If you cannot find the man behind the tree… well, you can’t tax the tree.
Somebody’s got to pay for public education, roads, bridges, public transportation, public health, health care, mental health, courts, law enforcement, state parks, recreation areas, protection of the natural environment and the National Guard.
The public goods that we buy collectively through our governments are what we need to help us make and keep our civilization. Civilization ain’t cheap. A society can go cheap, but going cheap costs a lot. Just look around. You may see some things that inspire you, but a lot of other things really need improvement.
The quality of a state’s civilization is what attracts people to move here and keeps young people from moving away. St. Louis, for instance, has public institutions like the zoo, history museum, botanical garden, science center, art museum, public libraries, well maintained public parks that are free — all supported by taxes and augmented by charitable contributions.
Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. said: “Taxes are what we pay for civilized society….”
 How much money does the government need to nurture a civilized society? Actually, it’s “governments” plural.
School districts are governments that get about half of their budgets from the state. Some districts are being driven by rising costs to four-day weeks, leading us to ask President George W. Bush’s famous question: “Is our children learning?”
Sewer districts, water districts, fire districts, library districts, mosquito control districts, counties, municipalities — they all need money.
The state’s major source of revenue is the income tax. Local governments, school districts and other special districts “own” the property tax, and municipalities and counties “own” the sales tax, with a few exceptions.
Real estate taxes are unpopular because they are based on the rates set locally and the valuations of real property are set by assessors, who in most counties are elected. Disparities exist. The loss of your job does not affect how much property tax you pay. The same is true for the annoying annual personal property tax.
The sales tax is relatively popular among the rich and the near-rich — those who don’t spend all their money on necessities. The sales tax only taxes certain things you buy, mostly goods but not services.
Missouri’s “modern” sales tax was enacted when the economy was largely goods. Services, by and large, are not taxed. Now that we are mainly in a service economy, the current sales tax is stressed out. If the state broadens the base of what is taxed as sales, as a way of making up for ditching the income tax, the burden of taxation will fall disproportionately on those who need to spend all or most of their money on necessities.
In the 1970s, U.S. Rep. Al Ullman, a Democrat from Oregon, proposed a “value-added tax,” a consumption tax that is added to a product at each stage of production or distribution. The value-added tax would have replaced some or all the federal income tax.
It is used in more than 160 countries including the European Union, Canada and the United Kingdom. But it’s not the most popular idea in America. At Ullman’s next election, his constituents voted that he should retire from public service. Sadly, for him, there was no man behind the tree.
So how do the governor and his legislative allies eliminate the state income tax? Eliminating the tax is easy. Replacing it is hard.
Watch for this: One approach is a “phase-in,” meaning that our leaders will do “tax reform” over a period of years, so their voters presumably won’t notice. But if people fail to notice, it will be like the old “boiling frog” story — if you put a frog into boiling water, he will immediately jump out, but if you put the frog in cool water and gradually turn up the heat he will stay in the pot until he’s cooked.
Bad ideas are bad ideas even when they are phased in. The challenge for our leaders will be to find good and equitable replacements for the income tax, if they exist.  Voters who pay attention, I hope, will not fall for any proposal that starts with the prefix “re” – as in reform, reorganize, reallocate, etc.
Especially as concerns taxation, if we go for “reform” that is “phased in,” we may get cooked.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Assembly met for its final floor session of 2025 Wednesday, where Democratic lawmakers sought to pass a bill that would extend Medicaid coverage for new mothers for one year after the birth of a child, though Republicans blocked it. Bills to encourage school district consolidation and make changes to elections laws passed.
Republicans block Democratic efforts to get a vote on postpartum Medicaid bill 
Wisconsin is one of two states in the U.S. that have not taken the federal government’s postpartum Medicaid expansion, and Democratic lawmakers hoped to begin the process of changing that during the floor session. 
The bill, which passed the Senate in April on a 32-1 vote, would allow eligible mothers to keep their Medicaid coverage for a year postpartum. Currently in Wisconsin, mothers only get 60 days of coverage if they don’t otherwise qualify for Medicaid.
Assembly Democrats planned to employ a rarely used Assembly rule to pull the bill out of committee and bring it up for a vote. Under the rule, if 50 lawmakers sign a petition, a bill can be brought to the floor. Democratic lawmakers hoped to have the chance to convince some of the Republican cosponsors of the bill to sign on.
Before that could come to fruition, however, the Assembly clerk notified Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) of the plan, Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) told reporters. 
Republicans moved the bill from the Assembly Rules Committee, where it had sat since May, to the Assembly Organization Committee — triggering a rule that says a  withdrawal petition on the bill cannot be circulated for 21 days. 
“This is a great effort by the Speaker to prevent this important bill from getting a vote on the floor,” Neubauer said. 
Neubauer said she didn’t know why the clerk notified the Assembly Republican leaders.
“There had been some conversation with staff about the timeline for [the petition], but I’m not really sure why it happened the way it did,” Neubauer told reporters. She said that Rick Champagne, director of the Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau, told the lawmakers that notification should have happened when they turned the petition in with the 50 signatures, not prior to the petition circulating.
All 45 Democratic lawmakers are cosponsors of the bill as are over 20 Republicans, but the bill has been hung up in the Assembly due to opposition from Vos, who has said in the past that he doesn’t support expanding “welfare.” The bill only needs a simple majority of 50 votes to pass the Assembly.
Neubauer read out the names of the Republican cosponsors during the press conference. 
“These are legislators who believe that this bill should become law, so they say, but they have been bullied by their speaker into not pushing for a vote on this bill on the floor,” Neubauer said. “Frankly, Robin Vos’ move to prevent us from circulating this petition and his refusal to bring this bill to the floor is pathetic, and when moms in Wisconsin and their babies are put at risk, their health and well-being is put at risk, because they do not have adequate health care in the year after they have given birth, it will be Robin Vos’ fault.” 
The Republican lawmakers on the bill include Reps. Patrick Snyder (R-Weston), Jessie Rodriguez (R-Oak Creek), Scott Allen (R-Waukesha), Elijah Behnke (R-Town of Chase), Barbara Dittrich (R-Oconomowoc), Bob Donovan (R-Greenfield), Cindi Duchow (R-Delafield), Benjamin Franklin (R-De Pere), Rick Gundrum (R-Slinger), Nate Gustafson (R-Omro), Dean Kaufert (R-Neenah), Joel Kitchens (R-Sturgeon Bay), Rob Kreibich (R-New Richmond), Scott Krug (R-Rome), Tony Kurtz (R-Wonewoc), Dave Maxey (R-New Berlin), Paul Melotik (R-Grafton), Jeff Mursau (R-Crivitz), Adam Neylon (R-Pewaukee), Todd Novak (R-Dodgeville), Kevin Petersen (R-Waupaca), David Steffen (R-Howard), Rob Tusler (R-Harrison), Chuck Wichgers (Muskego), Rob Wittke (R-Caledonia), Rob Summerfield (R-Bloomer), Calvin T. Callahan (R-Tomahawk), Clint Moses (R-Menomonie) and Joy Goeben (R-Hobart). 
Democratic lawmakers also tried to introduce amendments to a bill on the floor that would have extended postpartum Medicaid coverage, but those were also blocked by Republicans.
“It shouldn’t be this hard to get Republicans to do the right thing. Wisconsin women deserve access to quality, affordable health care and that includes postpartum care,” Vining said before she was cut off by Speaker Pro Tempore Kevin Petersen who said she wasn’t on topic.
“This is a disgrace,” Vining yelled out.
School district consolidation 
Democratic and Republican lawmakers split over a package of bills that would encourage school districts to consolidate. Republican lawmakers argue the bills are necessary due to falling enrollment, which they say is the reason for school districts’ financial struggles. 
Rep. Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) said at a press conference that the bills would address declining enrollment and the cycle of repeatedly going to referendum to raise money from local taxpayers that school districts are in. Schools in Wisconsin have seen a drop of about 53,000 students over a decade, from the 2013-14 to 2022-23 school years.

Of Wisconsin’s 421 school districts, about two-thirds are struggling with declining enrollment with preliminary numbers from the Department of Public Instruction showing that enrollment for public school districts in the 2025-26 school year fell by about 13,600 students. Total enrollment across Wisconsin school districts is about 759,800 this year. 
“Districts with declining enrollment receive less in state aid and to make up for that revenue loss. We’ve seen a growing cycle of constant referendums with varying degrees of success,” Nedweski said. “Wisconsin taxpayers are frustrated with our public school system… They are frustrated with districts continuously asking them to raise their own taxes, frustrated that their generous investments have not produced matching results.”
Democrats blamed Republicans for school districts having to go to referendum, noting that state aid has not kept pace with inflation in nearly two decades. They also said Wisconsinites have not been asking to close schools. Neubauer said Republicans were “proving how disconnected they are from our constituents.”
“Wisconsinites do not want to close school buildings, break up their communities, force their kids to ride on the bus for hours a day, or lose their local sports teams. Wisconsinites want us to fund our public schools,” Neubauer said. “Republicans’ push to close schools misses the mark completely, and Wisconsinites deserve better… Don’t close schools, fund them.”
According to the Department of Public Instruction, Wisconsin is spending the least, proportionally, in state revenue that it has ever spent on schools under the current funding formula. About 32.1% of state general purpose revenue goes to state general aid to schools, while that percentage used to be around 35%.
Rep. Angelina Cruz (R-Racine) noted during floor debate that many school districts lost state aid this year. Data from DPI for the 2025-26 school year shows that of 421 districts, 71% — or 301 districts — will receive less state aid this year compared to the prior year and 26% will receive more.
“For 15 years, Wisconsin has intentionally divested in our public schools while expanding privatization through voucher schemes,” Cruz said at a press conference, adding that Racine Unified School District has felt the loss of revenue acutely.
According to DPI data, about 15% of Racine’s revenue limit — or $43 million — goes to pay for voucher program participants.
“Since 2011, our community has gone to referendum three times —  in 2014, 2020 and 2025 — asking residents to raise their own property taxes to provide what the state has refused to fund,” Cruz said. “Even after those referendum paths, our district has been forced to close and consolidate schools including… the school where I grew up as a teacher. This is not about a lack of community commitment. It is about the state failing its constitutional obligation to provide free and as nearly uniform as practicable schools to children… Let me be clear, if there is money to close public schools, there is money to fund public schools.”
Rep. Joel Kitchens (R-Sturgeon Bay) rejected claims that the choice program is to blame.
“That’s a tiny little percentage of this,” Kitchens said. “It’s happening because of declining birth rates, of people choosing to have less kids, waiting long to have kids. I can’t imagine how anybody can look at our 421 school districts that we have right now and think that in 30 years, that’s going to be sustainable.”
Kitchens also emphasized that the bills are voluntary.
“Let’s trust our communities to work through these things and decide for what’s best for themselves,” Kitchens said. 
Republicans also rejected Democratic lawmakers’ insistence that the state needs to invest more money in its public schools. 
“[Democrats] want us to believe that if we simply spend more on K-12, people will flock to Wisconsin and increase enrollment,” Nedweski said. She compared Wisconsin to New York, which according to the New York Focus spends more per public school student than any other state. “Their outcomes are no better than ours, and they are losing students even faster than Wisconsin. As they elect more communist leaders like [New York City Mayor-elect] Zohran Mamdani, I suspect more New Yorkers will rapidly leave tax-and-spend Democratic Socialist policies. More spending is not a strategy, it’s denial.”
Nedweski said the bills are a “lifeline” for school districts that can use it and will encourage savings and “invest in increasing opportunities for students who may not otherwise have access to things like AP classes, world languages, advanced tech ed and specialized learning services.”
The six bills in the package:

AB 644 would increase additional state aid to schools that consolidate in 2027, 2028 and 2029 to $2,000 per pupil in the first year. Under current law, school districts receive additional aid when they consolidate. For the first five years after consolidation, a consolidated school district gets $150 per pupil. In the sixth year, the aid drops to 50% of what the school district received in the fifth year and in the seventh year, the aid drops to 25% of the fifth year. It passed 53-44 with Rep. Shae Sortwell (R-Two Rivers) joining Democrats against the bill. 


AB 645 would provide grants of up to $25,000 to groups of two or more school district boards for the costs of a feasibility study for school district consolidation or whole grade sharing agreements. It passed on a voice vote.
AB 646 would launch a study of Wisconsin’s school districts, looking at current school district boundaries, potential school district consolidations, existing school district facilities, staffing levels and salary scales, the population of school-age children in each school district, and revenue limits and current overall spending. It passed 54-43 along party lines.


AB 647 would create a four-year grant program for school districts that enter into a whole-grade sharing agreement, agreeing to educate students at one location. School districts would get up to $500 per pupil enrolled in a single grade. It passed 54-43 along party lines.


AB 648 would help create new supplemental state aid for consolidated school districts to  address differences in school districts’ levies when they merge. The measure is meant to address concerns of higher property taxes for residents of low-levy districts when a consolidation takes place. It passed 54-43 along party lines.
 AB 649 provides the funding for the bills, including $2.7 million for grants to schools that enter whole-grade sharing agreements, $3 million to provide state aid to offset levy limit differences and $250,000 for feasibility studies. It passed 54-43 along party lines.

Vote on online sports betting bill delayed
After being fast tracked through the public hearing process, a vote on a bipartisan bill that would legalize online sports betting in Wisconsin was postponed. 
The Wisconsin Constitution requires that gambling in the state must be managed by the state’s federally recognized Native American tribes. Following that requirement, sports betting has been allowed in Wisconsin since 2021, but bets have had to be made in person at tribal casinos. 
AB 601 would expand this to allow for online sports betting anywhere in the state by placing servers running the betting websites and apps to be housed on tribal land; this is known as a “hub and spoke” model. It was introduced in October and received hearings in the Assembly and Senate earlier this month. 
Assembly Majority Leader Tyler August (R-Walworth) said that he still would have had the votes on the bill if it had come up for a vote, but he had conversations with members of his caucus over the weekend that brought new issues to his attention. He would not provide details on what the concerns were, though he said they didn’t deal with issues of constitutionality.
“I’m not going to get into the details of the conversations that I’ve had with members,” August said. “We’re just working through some of that right now, and I’m confident that there’s no rush on this. It’s the right thing for the state, and I’m confident that we’ll get there.”
Neubauer said she planned to support the bill. 
“We know that our tribes in Wisconsin have the right to control gaming in our state, and right now, that’s not happening with online sports betting,” Neubauer said. “I do hope that we pass a bill that puts control of that industry back in their hands.”
The Assembly passed and concurred in a total of over 50 bills. Others include:  

AB 596 and AB 597, which passed unanimously, would direct $1.9 million to be used for a state grant match program for veterans’ housing. A nonprofit group would need to be participating in the federal program, which currently provides about $82 per day per veteran housed to groups that offer wraparound supportive services to homeless veterans, to be eligible for a state matching funds of $25 per day per veteran. While no one voted against the bills, Democratic lawmakers expressed concerns that the bill would not fill the gaps that currently exist due to the closure of two Veterans Housing and Recovery Program sites earlier this year. 
AB 602, which would instruct Evers to opt into a federal school choice program, passed 54-44 along party lines. 
A pair of bills meant to help address students who are disruptive in class passed in 54-43 votes. AB 613 would require principals to provide written notification to parents every time a student is removed from a class and “the quality or quantity of instructional time provided to the pupils in the class is diminished.” AB 614 would add language into state law to say that teachers are allowed to maintain order in the teacher’s classroom, establish and enforce classroom rules, call 911 in an emergency, take immediate action if a pupil’s behavior is dangerous or disruptive and request assistance from school administrators during a disruptive or violent incident.
AB 207, which would provide information about constitutional amendments to voters including their potential effects, passed on a voice vote.
AB 312  passed on a voice vote. It would require absentee voting sites to be open for at least 20 hours during the period for voting absentee in-person.
AB 385 passed in a 55-42 vote with Rep. Lori Palmeri (D-Oshkosh) joining Republicans in favor. The bill would prohibit a political committee, political party or conduit from accepting contributions that are made with a credit card online unless the contributor provides their credit card verification value (CVV) or code and the billing address associated with the card is located in the United States. Republican state lawmakers introduced the bill following efforts by Republicans and the Trump administration to target ActBlue — a Massachusetts-based platform that processes donations to Democratic campaigns. 
AB 617 passed 53-44. Rep. Paul Tittl joined Democrats voting against the bill. It would make a number of changes to elections law, including requiring that alternate absentee ballot sites must be in a building or facility constituting a fixed location and requiring absentee ballots with faulty or missing certifications be returned to voters if they are received seven days before the election. It is similar to a bill introduced last session, but it does not include a provision that would have allowed for Monday processing of absentee ballots. Rep. Scott Krug (R-Rome) said that he is speaking with the Assembly Elections Committee chair about potentially having an informational hearing on Monday processing.

Young Municipal Center, Detroit | Susan J. DemasFollowing an Australian clean energy company’s decision in September to cancel plans for a battery plant in Detroit, state Sen. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit) joined leaders from the Michigan Electric Vehicle Alliance and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 58 to break down how the project could have helped the community. 
Fortescue, a green technology and metals company, announced in 2024 that it would redevelop a vacant industrial building near the historic Ford Piquette Plant into a $210 million electric vehicle battery factory which was expected to create 600 jobs. However, that plan soured, with the company telling Crain’s Detroit Business that the “current policy settings and market conditions” including President Donald Trump’s Administration’s decision to eliminate “critical tax credits” for electric vehicles and clean energy were the driving force behind the decision to scrap the project. 
Chang, who has served in the Legislature since 2015, noted that she has represented communities throughout Detroit who are facing environmental justice concerns, including disproportionate impacts from air pollution. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
She noted that the Asthma and Allergy Foundation had ranked Detroit as the most challenging city in the nation for people with asthma based on the prevalence of asthma, and the higher than average number of asthma deaths, with vehicle exhaust and industrial emissions serving as major risk factors for individuals with respiratory conditions.
The Fortescue plant would have been an amazing example of revitalization for the city, Chang said, with construction crews already working on remediation and electrical upgrades. However, the Trump Administration’s move to cut support for clean energy and transportation put a stop to that, Chang said. 
“And this is after $12.7 million in state incentives and $11 million in Detroit incentives that were offered and thankfully were not paid out due to the cancelation,” Chang said. “About eight out of 10 Michiganders support clean energy investments, but the Trump administration is out of step with what our state wants and what Michiganders need.”

As a result, Detroiters and Michiganders are seeing stalled progress and backward momentum on clean energy jobs, Chang said.
The potential health benefits that could have come alongside the adoption of more EVs and clean energy sources will also go unrealized, Chang said, 
“Detroiters with asthma are going to continue to suffer. Clean air would have led to better health and more worker productivity, but we are going to be losing out on this opportunity.” Chang said. “So today, we are calling on the Trump administration to end the attacks on climate policy and clean energy investments. Michiganders and Americans deserve clean air and good clean energy jobs, and the federal government should do its part.”
Jamie Racklyeft, the executive director of the Michigan Electric Vehicle Alliance, argued against treating investments in clean energy as a partisan issue. 
“Michigan now has well over 120,000 people working in clean energy and clean transportation jobs, with the sector growing faster than the overall economy and ranking among the strongest in the nation,” Racklyeft said. “Every lost project means fewer paychecks, slower neighborhood revitalization and more tailpipe and smokestack pollution in places that have already carried that burden for generations.”
Meanwhile, China continues to dominate the EV market, while the U.S. only makes up a small margin of EVs sold, Racklyeft said. 
“Analysts are warning the continued policy uncertainty here will only help China pull farther ahead in the global EV race,” Racklyeft said. “This is the real choice in front of us. Do we want to import the clean vehicles of the future, or design, engineer and build better vehicles here in Detroit and across Michigan?”
Andrew Dueweke, the assistant business manager for the IBEW Local 58, similarly called for people to look past the politics on clean energy. 
“Who knows when this investment might be able to come back to the city,” Dueweke said. 
As members of the Legislature weigh what the future of the state’s tax incentives will look like for businesses, Chang said she was hopeful supporting clean energy jobs could be a part of that conversation.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_9079-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-20 06:56:20.398912

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Directors of a Madison health care system will consider Thursday whether to change course in the organization’s response to a union organizing campaign.
Supporters of the union campaign at Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin put five motions before the board of directors at an in-person meeting in October — including one to voluntarily recognize the union, SEIU Wisconsin.
A statement from the co-op management Wednesday did not address whether the board will directly act on any of the motions when it meets.
“The motions are advisory to the Board of Directors concerning its instructions to management about the unionization efforts of our direct care employees,” Group Health stated. “All the Motions will be considered by the Board at the November 20th meeting. The results of those discussions will be communicated to our membership in a future statement.”
Group Health’s response to the union drive, which became public about a year ago, has produced a rift between the co-op’s management and some of its members, who have criticized the organization’s response as a betrayal of its progressive heritage.
“To me it was horrifying to learn that we had people leaving because the conditions were not tolerable,” said Ruth Brill, a Group Health member since 1979 who has supported the union organizing campaign.
According to union supporters, the five motions offered at an Oct. 11 in-person mass meeting to discuss the union organizing campaign passed unanimously. About 170 Group Health members attended that meeting, and union allies said it was the largest turnout in memory for an in-person meeting of co-op members.
Three of the five motions call on the board, the co-op management, or both:

To report to members how much money Group Health has spent in 2024 and 2025 to pay the law firm Husch Blackwell, which has represented the co-op in connection with the union campaign.
To voluntarily recognize SEIU Wisconsin as the representative for the professions and departments that the union first sought to represent when workers petitioned the National Labor Relations Board for a union election on Dec. 12, 2024. That motion also demands that Group Health “observe strict neutrality regarding the unionization of any of its workers.”
To compile a report “of all meeting minutes, emails, and other communications involving Board members, administrators, and/or supervisory employees regarding union activity, from January 2024 to the present.”

The third motion also demands a report on all legal or consulting fees that Group Health has spent related to the union drive, including itemized details.
The fourth motion demands that the board and administration “faithfully follow the democratically expressed will” of the co-op members, charging that the membership has “been denied an opportunity to duly and fully exercise its role” in leading the co-op.
The fifth motion calls for a meeting by mid-January “on the democratization of GHC governance.”
“GHC says members are the most important part of our cooperative and yet the board is not listening to what the members have very clearly stated what they would like to happen,” said Dr. Nisha Rajagopalan, a family practice physician and among the union campaign’s leaders.
“If we are a cooperative that is for our members and our patients, those people showed up in the room and they voted and said exactly what they wanted, and we would like to hear the board uphold that,” said Katie Cloud, a certified medical assistant who has also been active in the union campaign.
Paul Terranova, a Group Health member for 25 years, organized a presentation to the co-op board earlier this year to make the case for unionization in the context of a nonprofit co-op. He later helped organize a slate of candidates for the board in opposition to four incumbent board members. All four of the rival candidates were elected in June.
Terranova said that board members have not communicated directly with Group Health members about the union campaign. Board discussions about the matter have been conducted in closed sessions.
The board’s consideration of the motions is “a really pivotal moment for GHC,” Terranova said, “and how they handle this is going to say a lot about whether this is still a cooperative or if it’s become just a corporate board with cooperative window dressing.”



 A conflict over who should be in the union and how it should be recognized
The union campaign at Group Health Cooperative has been mired in conflict over who should be represented.
Originally union organizing focused on specific health care professions in specific departments where union activists said there was the strongest interest in union representation and where there were specific concerns in common about working conditions.
Group Health management opposed that bargaining unit, asserting that because Group Health is “an integrated care delivery system” all health care-related staff should be included and should vote in the election.
Union supporters have argued that expanding who votes in the election was a ploy to defeat the union, an accusation that Group Health management officials have denied.
“The only reason to include people who would not be interested [in union representation] would be to water down the vote, so that there’s a higher chance that the vote for representation will fail,” said Ruth Brill, a retired member of the state employees’ union who is supporting the Group Health unionizing campaign.
Hoping for a compromise agreement, the union and employees leading the union campaign changed their petition to confine the election to a single clinic. Instead, however, the co-op stuck to the original management proposal covering all health care workers.
The National Labor Relations Board regional director assigned to the case chose the company’s proposed unit over the union’s single clinic proposal.
After that decision, however, SEIU Wisconsin argued that dozens of unfair labor practice charges against Group Health would intimidate employees from voting for the union and prevent a fair election. The NLRB regional director agreed to block the election until the unfair labor practice charges are resolved.
While awaiting the NLRB’s investigation of the charges, employees campaigning for the union have argued instead that Group Health should voluntarily recognize the original bargaining unit that the union proposed.

The National Conference of State Legislatures and Council of State Governments West have long provided research and training to members and staff of the Wyoming Legislature, but annual dues raised eyebrows earlier this year. 
The post Wyoming Legislature reverses course on axing memberships with national associations perceived as too costly, liberal appear[...]","Lawmakers reversed course Tuesday on the prospect of cutting ties with two national, non-partisan, non-profit organizations that have long provided research and training to members and staff of the Wyoming Legislature. 
Wyoming pays biennial dues to the Council of State Governments West and the National Conference of State Legislatures that cost approximately $271,300 and $293,500 respectively. Each is included in the Legislature’s two-year operating budget lawmakers approve in even-numbered years. 
The value of those memberships, however, came into question during a Management Council meeting in April. As such, lawmakers invited both national groups to attend Tuesday’s meeting to make their case. Ultimately, their pitches worked. 
“If the good [Senate] President and I had not asked those questions, we wouldn’t have learned all this information we’ve had today,” Speaker of the House Chip Neiman, R-Hulett, said at the meeting. “I will tell you right up front, I had no idea how much our Legislative Service Office utilizes NCSL and the amount of value that it evidently brings to our offices, and to those folks here that we’re counting on to help us with all our duties, and obligations, responsibilities,” he said. 
Senate President Bo Biteman, R-Ranchester, said he agreed with Neiman, and also thanked Montana State Sen. Barry Usher, NCSL’s president-elect, who testified at the meeting and met with the two Wyoming lawmakers ahead of the meeting.
“It was a very enlightening and great conversation, and I appreciate you challenging us to step out and step up and get out of our echo chambers, and not being afraid to defend our ideas,” Biteman said. 
The council voted unanimously to sponsor the budget bill with the dues intact. 
How we got here
Concern over membership dues grew out of a discussion by the Management Council in April over whether to update its reimbursement policy for out-of-state travel. 
The policy covers two meetings per lawmaker during the legislative off-season of “a national or regional organization in which the Legislature participates,” such as NCSL or CSG West. All other out-of-state travel must be specifically approved in advance by the Management Council. 
In April, the council changed the policy to include travel expenses for lawmakers who attend American Legislative Exchange Council meetings. Also known as ALEC, the group is a national organization funded by corporate and conservative donors known for pushing model bills out to state legislatures. The argument to include ALEC in the policy partly originated with how lawmakers perceived the other groups already included in the policy.

“I’m not going to throw one of [those] organizations under the bus,” Biteman said at the April meeting. “But I went to one of them and wasn’t impressed. It just wasn’t — it did have kind of a liberal bent to it. I didn’t enjoy any of the programming.” 
Tuesday meeting
Edgar Ruiz, director of CSG West, defended his organization Tuesday to the Management Council. 
“We’re not a federal program. We’re not a think tank. We’re not a lobbying group. And we’re not an association that is separate from the states that we serve,” Ruiz said. “Rather, CSG West is a member-driven, member-led organization that services you.”
Ruiz also explained how the organization supports all three branches of state government and how it protects its “political balance.”
“Our four officers rotate among a Republican and a Democrat. Each of our policy committees are co-led by a Republican and Democrat,” he said. “And our executive committee, which is our governing board, is comprised of legislative leaders of the 13 western states that we serve.”
Ruiz also detailed the key regional issues CSG West brings lawmakers to examine together, including water, agriculture, energy and public safety. 
In 2018, in particular, the organization worked with Wyoming legislators to sort out “what was causing our Department of Corrections’ budget to continually go up,” Sen. Tara Nethercott, R-Cheyenne, said.

It wasn’t clear at the time whether the cause was Wyoming judges sentencing too harshly, law enforcement overresponding, or something in state statute, Nethercott said. 
But CSG West, in partnership with Pew Charitable Trusts and federal agencies, worked to identify the problem — probation revocations — saving the state $18 million in contract bed costs. 
Rather than merely pointing to what other states were doing, Nethercott said CSG helped lawmakers craft solutions by providing “necessary information to make real, sound policy decisions that was based on Wyoming data.”
Montana Sen. Usher, meanwhile, spoke on behalf of NCSL. 
“NCSL is the only bipartisan organization dedicated solely to America’s state legislatures,” Usher said. “Whether you’re a deep conservative member like myself, or a liberal member, NCSL is the place where we can come together, compare notes, and share what we are working on in our states.”
Usher said one of his leadership goals for the organization “is to change the perception that NCSL is a liberal organization. I can assure you it is not. The conversations lean whatever way those in attendance take it.”
Usher also noted that his home state and Wyoming have some of the lowest staff per legislator rates, making NCSL that much more valuable. 
That benefit was reiterated by Legislative Service Office Director Matt Obrecht. 
“About 10 years ago, I had a unique ethics question that I was working on a memo for the Senate Rules Committee, and I was just absolutely hitting a dead end with my own research on that,” Obrecht told the council. “No court cases on it. It’s a legislative ethics question. I couldn’t find anything online. So I called NCSL.”
The organization gave him the help he wouldn’t have found otherwise, Obrecht said. 
“What I’m hearing you say is you feel that the value is there,” Sen. Mike Gierau, D-Jackson, said. “I’m asking you directly the value, the cost of these two organizations from a staff standpoint. I’m not talking about legislators and what we get out of it. But from a staff standpoint, do you feel that the money we spend on these organizations is worth it?”
“What we pay in dues to NCSL and CSG is an absolute bargain for what we get in return,” Obrecht said, adding that the organizations also rely on LSO for fiscal and budget information as well as responses to surveys and questionnaires. 
Later in the meeting, Nethercott pointed to the “’Colorado River situation’ as one of the great challenges facing us.”
“The ability to have a non-partisan entity providing a structure for us to participate and build a network of relationships within the region to help tackle this fundamental issue — I think we are not fully appreciating the significance of that,” she said. 
The legislative budget will still need to be approved by the full Legislature, which convenes for the 2026 budget session in February.

There are parallels between the anti-evolution trial of 1925 and our current politics in Wyoming, writes columnist David Romtvedt. 
The post Things evolve, but stay the same appeared first on WyoFile .","In 1925, the Tennessee Legislature passed the Butler Act, which made it unlawful for any teacher in the state’s public schools and universities “to teach any theory that denies the story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible, and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals.” Meant to stop teachers from introducing Charles Darwin’s work on evolution to their students, the bill mandated that “offending teachers be fined between $100 and $500 for each offense.” In 2025 dollars, that’s a fine of slightly less than $2,000 to $10,000. 

Opinion

Shortly after the bill became law, John Scopes, a high school teacher in Dayton, Tennessee, agreed to serve as the criminal defendant in a test case to be focused on the constitutional protections of freedom of speech. But things went sideways fast. Three-time presidential candidate and former Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan volunteered his services for the prosecution saying, “Teachers in the public schools must teach what the taxpayers desire taught.” Clarence Darrow, who was the most famous criminal lawyer of the period, volunteered to direct the defense with his team saying, “The question is not whether evolution is true or untrue, but involves the freedom of teaching, or more important, the freedom of learning.”
Over 200 reporters came to town along with 3,000 spectators. Merchants decorated their shops with pictures of apes and monkeys. The local drugstore offered Simian Sodas and the town constable affixed a sign to his motorcycle reading “Monkeyville Police.” Everyone agreed it would be the trial of the century.
Among those present that summer was a young Black fiddler and mandolinist named Howard Armstrong. Born in Dayton in 1909, the 16-year-old musician was busking on the streets throughout the trial. Seventy-five years later, at 91 and a recipient of the National Heritage Award, Armstrong came to Wyoming, where he performed and taught workshops for adults and students. He told me that it was when all those people were in Dayton for the trial that he began to play music of many kinds — Irish, Italian, Polish, Mexican. Later, living in Chicago, he translated English lyrics to sing in Chinese. “You had to play for everybody if you wanted to make a living,” he said.
Another musician influenced by the trial was Uncle Dave Macon, a white banjo player. In 1926, he recorded “The Bible Song,” one verse of which declares, “Evolution teaches man came from a monkey. I don’t believe in no such a thing in a day of the week or Sunday. For the Bible’s true. Yes, I believe it. I’ve seen enough, and I can prove it. What you say, what you say, it’s bound to be that way.”
While the Scopes trial had a comic carnival-like atmosphere, it was deadly serious business — the first battle in our now hundred-year-long culture wars. It took place in a time of social upheaval and dislocation — the aftermath of World War I and the global flu epidemic, widespread anti-immigrant sentiment, the arrest and imprisonment of people for criticizing then-President Woodrow Wilson, the round up and deportation of suspected socialists, anarchists and communists.
It’s unnerving how much this sounds like our situation now — ongoing wars in Ukraine and Gaza, the aftereffects of the Covid-19 Pandemic, the U.S. president’s attacks on his critics, and ignoring due process, his order to murder suspected drug traffickers in international waters. Along with these, we’re experiencing a rise in anti-immigrant sentiment fueled by the rise in global migration that is itself fueled by war, climate change, ethnic and racial conflict, and by ordinary intractable poverty in the face of unimaginable wealth. Think of Elon Musk with over $500 billion.
Just as the 1925 Tennessee Legislature passed a law to control access to what was then a controversial book, so has the 2025 Wyoming Legislature’s Joint Judiciary Committee voted 11-2 to introduce a bill mandating that public and school libraries keep “sexually explicit” material inaccessible to people under 18. Perhaps not surprisingly, the bill does not appear to be aimed at what people often call pornography. Rather, it’s to keep LGBTQ+ materials out of the reading view of young people seeking to understand themselves and the society they will both inherit and shape.
Tennessee’s 1925 Butler Act banning the teaching of evolution and Wyoming’s 2025 proposed bill to limit young people’s access to materials exploring human development and personal identity are misguided and, in the long run will not attain their goals, neither those that are stated nor those that remain unspoken. 1925 to 2025 — a hundred years. I hope we evolve beyond such legislation before another hundred pass.

Roberts — the former president of Wyoming Catholic College, now president of the Heritage Foundation — apologized for using an antisemitic trope.
The post Antisemitism accusations plagued Kevin Roberts’ political heroes too appeared first on WyoFile .","This commentary was originally published by National Catholic Reporter.
In the bruising backlash over his defense of conservative commentator Tucker Carlson’s interview with notorious white Christian nationalist Nick Fuentes, Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts faces similar accusations to those that plagued his two greatest political heroes.  

Analysis

Moreover, as a prominent critic of “cancel culture,” a leading Catholic traditionalist and a shepherd of the controversial Project 2025 government reorganization plan, Roberts finds himself threatened with cancellation.
Roberts, 51, is the former president of tiny Wyoming Catholic College who vaulted into his $926,000-a-year position atop Heritage in 2021 after a four-year stint at the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation.
Roberts describes himself as a “devotee” of Russell Kirk, who died in 1994.
Kirk, who authored the canonical 1953 book The Conservative Mind, and Pat Buchanan, conservative political pundit and perennial presidential candidate, were repeatedly branded — many say unfairly — as antisemites, mainly for their shared belief that Israel had too much influence over American foreign policy. 
Roberts has described The Conservative Mind as “the most important book about conservatism ever written.”  
Buchanan, who retired from public life in 2023 and is now 87 years old, has long been Roberts’ political idol and guiding star. As a college freshman in his native Lafayette, Louisiana, Roberts organized a rally for Buchanan’s 1992 primary campaign against eventual nominee George H.W. Bush. Roberts also attended the Republican convention in the Houston Astrodome, where Buchanan delivered his famous “culture war” speech. 
Both Kirk, considered a father of the so-called “paleoconservative” movement, and Buchanan, a former advisor to Presidents Reagan, Nixon and Ford, faced accusations of antisemitism over statements about Israel and its purported outsized influence on American policy. 
Kirk said in a 1988 Heritage Foundation lecture: “Not seldom it has seemed as if some eminent neoconservatives mistook Tel Aviv for the capital of the United States.” Midge Decter, Jewish director of the Committee for the Free World and wife of neoconservative mainstay Norman Podhoretz, attacked Kirk’s comments as “a bloody outrage, a piece of anti-Semitism.” Kirk also opposed the first Gulf War in 1990, calling it a “war for an oil can.”
Buchanan, who grew up in a family steeped in the isolationist, antisemitic rhetoric of Catholic radio broadcaster Father Charles Coughlin and famed aviator Charles Lindbergh, also used similar language in his opposition to the Gulf War. On a 1990 television broadcast of “The McLaughlin Group”, Buchanan declared, “Capitol Hill is Israeli-occupied territory.” Later that year, on the same show, Buchanan said, “there are only two groups that are beating the drums for war in the Middle East — the Israeli defense ministry and its ‘amen corner’ in the United States.”
Buchanan’s comments inspired the wrath of the late New York Times editor and columnist Abe Rosenthal, and prompted a 40,000-word article examining conservatives’ antisemitism by William F. Buckley Jr. in his National Review magazine. Comments by Rosenthal and others, including Holocaust survivor and author Eli Weisel, were scathing. Buckley was more forgiving. Buckley concluded: “If you ask, do I think Pat Buchanan is an antisemite, my answer is, he is not one. But I think he’s said some antisemitic things.”
Unlike Kirk and Buchanan, Kevin Roberts has publicly condemned antisemitism on several occasions. Under his leadership, Heritage unveiled “Project Esther” in 2024 to combat antisemitism. 
But as a result of his comments defending Tucker Carlson after Carlson hosted white Christian nationalist Nick Fuentes, Roberts found himself in a similar pickle as his ideological role models, but with far greater potential consequences.
In a video statement, Roberts characterized criticism of Carlson as “slander” by a “venomous coalition” and said the outspoken former Fox News star will always remain “a close friend of The Heritage Foundation.” Roberts said that while he “abhors” some things that Nick Fuentes has said, “cancelling him is not the answer either.”
But the most damaging part of his defense may have been his comment that “Christians are entitled to critique the State of Israel without being labeled as antisemitic.” Later, he added, “…conservatives should not be compelled to automatically support any foreign government, regardless of the pressure from the globalist elite or their representatives in Washington.” The term “globalist elite” is sometimes interpreted as an antisemitic trope.
Most of the immediate backlash focused on Fuentes and his well-established racist and antisemitic stances. The lead editorial in the Nov. 2 Wall Street Journal began “An old political poison is growing on the new right, led by podcasters and internet opportunists who are preoccupied with the Jews. It is spreading wider and faster than we thought and it has even found an apologist in Kevin Roberts, president of the venerable Heritage Foundation.”
But the editorial also focused on Roberts’ distinction between criticism of Israel and antisemitism. “This is what Hamas supporters on the left say: What do you mean? We were only criticizing Israel. Not exactly.” The editors even borrowed a line from William Buckley’s takedown of Pat Buchanan, calling Roberts “a pyromaniac in a field of straw men.”
But while Kirk and Buchanan suffered few consequences for their controversial statements, interpreted by many as antisemitic, Roberts’ future at Heritage seems endangered. In the wake of the dust-up, several staffers resigned or moved to other positions. Roberts issued another statement strongly condemning Fuentes.
Earlier this month, Roberts apologized before an all-staff meeting at Heritage headquarters in Washington. His contrite comments were leaked to the Jewish News Syndicate and Washington Free Beacon.
“I made a mistake, and I let you down and I let this down this institution. Period. Full stop,” Roberts told the staffers, according to the Jewish News and Free Beacon reports. He said the comments were written by his former chief of staff, Ryan Neuhaus, who was subsequently removed from the position. But Roberts said it was his fault for not sufficiently reviewing the material before making his comments, released as a video on X.
“I didn’t know much about this Fuentes guy. I still don’t, which underscores the mistake.”
He specifically apologized to Jewish staff members for using the term “venomous coalition” — an antisemitic trope — in his comments defending Carlson.
“And I very sincerely — very, very sincerely — apologize to you in particular, and to all of you for using that. It was not my intention to use a trope. I should have been better.”

(Photo: April Corbin Girnus/Nevada Current)After seven days of intense lobbying and political drama, the Nevada State Legislature adjourned the 36th Special Session on Wednesday without approving a $1.8 billion megadeal derided by progressive and conservative groups alike as a “Hollywood handout.”
The hotly debated proposal to expand the state’s film tax credit program to $120 million per year for 15 years needed the support of 11 state senators. It fell one senator shy, with 10 voting for the bill, eight voting against, and three absent but assumed nos.
The failure of the bill to pass is seen as a loss for Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, who put the film bill on his packed special session proclamation and sent the state’s preeminent consultant Jeremy Aguero to consult with legislators behind closed doors on the potential fiscal impact.
The weeklong special session was marked by what lawmakers described as relentless lobbying and it laid bare divisions within the majority party caucus. And, in true blockbuster fashion, it ramped up in the third act.
‘I could not deliver for you today’
In the upper chamber Wednesday, support for the film bill came from eight Democrats and two Republicans.
State Sen. Dina Neal, a vocal critic of public subsidies for corporations who has voted against previous megadeals, cast a “yes” vote that surprised many. In a floor speech, the North Las Vegas Democrat said she would vote for the bill because of Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro, who Neal said saved her life when she had a medical episode earlier this year.
“Dear Hollywood, I want to be absolutely clear that, although this vote may benefit you, it is not for you,” said Neal. “It’s not even a consideration about you.”
Neal chastised the lobbying and pressure exerted on legislators.
“I am angry with the political tactics that cause pain to my colleagues. I’m angry that there was a sense in this building that somehow people owe 100% loyalty — not even 100% loyalty, 1000% loyalty. And that folks in this building were looking for political corpses to press a button.”
Lawmakers in opposition were “being disrespected at every turn,” she added.
Neal’s support ultimately did not matter to the end result, and she told reporters after the session adjourned that she was happy the bill died.
“I was very clear my vote was for Majority Leader (Cannizzaro),” she said, “and that I had to do it my way.”
State Sen. Angie Taylor, a Reno Democrat who throughout the seven-day special session was rumored to be on the fence about the film studio bill, ultimately voted against it. She told the Nevada Current that, while the state needs to diversify its economy, there was also the question of whether the state could afford the upfront investment.
“I could just never get to a point where I was comfortable enough with the financial piece,” she said.
Taylor said that passing legislation is always a process of “give and take” but that “it was on steroids” during this special session.
State Sen. Melanie Schieble, a Las Vegas Democrat many thought might support the bill, said she asked difficult questions about the fiscal responsibility of the proposal and attempted to find solutions to mitigate those.
“Ultimately, in my view, we’ve been unable to do that,” she said.
See the numbers: Nevada’s potential film studio fiscal cliff

A fiscal analysis by the Legislature’s own nonpartisan staff found the film bill would lead the State of Nevada’s general fund off a fiscal cliff in 2030. Public sector employees, including AFSCME members and public school teachers, warned the structural deficit created by the film bill would force the state to layoff employees or cut essential services.
Opponents characterized the measure as a corporate giveaway to the developer Howard Hughes Holdings, the mega studios Sony Pictures Entertainment and Warner Brothers Discovery who would earn up to $120 million in transferable tax credits for shooting in state, and other large companies who would purchase the transferable tax credits at a discount and apply them to their own gaming, insurance or modified business taxes to lower their tax bills.
But it seemed for every opponent in the capital worried about the lackluster return on investment, there was a member of a building and trades union saying the film bill would bring thousands of construction jobs that could put them to work.
A coalition of these unions in weeks leading up to the special session formed a Nevada Jobs Now PAC and launched a “public information campaign” that included mailers to voters and television ads.
Several state senators addressed those labor unions and their workers before voting in opposition of the bill.
“I’m very sorry I could not deliver for you today,” said state Sen. Shelly Cruz Crawford (D-North Las Vegas) during her brief statement on the floor.
State Sen. Edgar Flores (D-Las Vegas), who voted via Zoom, said policy changes that he believed would have “protected the interest of the entire state” were rejected by “some of the stakeholders” and that as a result he had an obligation to the state to vote no.

During a recess held after the bill failed to pass, members from the construction unions coalition stood outside the Senate Majority Leader office. When Cannizzaro emerged, they applauded and thanked her for working on the bill.
The film studio bill is expected to impact next year’s elections and many of its key players are running in competitive races.
Lombardo is running for reelection. Cannizzaro is running for attorney general. Assembly Minority Leader Sandra Jauregui, who sponsored the film bill during the regular session and presented the bill during the special session, is running for lieutenant governor. Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, who announced he is not running for reelection, has not said whether he plans to run for another office.
The resistance
“There was a referendum on special interests in this building,” said Neal during her floor speech in the Senate, “and there needed to be a referendum on special interests in this building.”
Speaking to reporters later, Neal elaborated, saying she agreed with a group of Assembly members who called themselves “the resistance” and attempted to use procedural rules to kill the bill.
Assemblymember Selena La Rue Hatch, a Democrat from Reno, in the opening hours of the special session forced a surprise vote on the bill, which almost worked but fell one vote shy.
The “resistance” group questioned why two of their colleagues — both yeses on the film bill — were permitted to vote remotely. They also went against their caucus leaders’ motions to declare the film studio bill an emergency bill, delaying a full floor vote in their chamber.
Those efforts, Neal said, “made sure there was a conversation” about special interests and the group “held that line.”
“I think there’s a new set of legislators who believe in people, believe in community, and they don’t want to be beholden to big interests that come in this building and try to tell them what to do,” added Neal.
La Rue Hatch, speaking before her chamber’s full vote on Sunday, acknowledged the “unprecedented actions” taken in the first few days of the session.
“I know this has frustrated people, but this is an unprecedented bill. This is the largest corporate handout in Nevada history.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image000000-3-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-11-20 06:56:20.398912

(Photo courtesy of Blue Cross of Idaho)A major Idaho health insurer this week asked the Idaho Department of Insurance to investigate the billing practices of a new North Idaho hospital.
Blue Cross of Idaho claims that Post Falls ER & Hospital has refused offers to be part of the insurer’s network of in-network providers, and has instead relied heavily on a last-resort financial protection that lets health care providers dispute insurer payments.
Blue Cross of Idaho Chief Strategy Officer Drew Hobby said the insurer wants to protect consumers from rising health care costs.
“We have a responsibility to help Idahoans get access to high quality, affordable care. And we’re very concerned and alarmed with this process, which we would say is driving up unreasonable costs and unreasonable rates to Idahoans,” he told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview. 
The Idaho Department of Insurance is reviewing the issue, agency spokesperson Julie Robinson said in a statement. 
The Post Falls ER & Hospital opened in 2024. The facility was Nutex Health Inc.’s first micro-hospital in Idaho. 
Post Falls ER & Hospital could not be immediately reached for comment. 
Outside of the Post Falls ER & Hospital, 100% of hospitals in Idaho are in Blue Cross’s network, Hobby said. Blue Cross also asked the Department of Insurance to help get the hospital’s owners to meet with Blue Cross.

 What is the billing practice Blue Cross wants Idaho to investigate? 

In its letter to the Idaho Department of Insurance, Blue Cross asked for a probe into whether the Post Falls ER & Hospital has misused a process called independent dispute resolution.
The process, created by the federal No Surprises Act, allows health care providers to challenge denials and payments by health insurers for services that are out of network, triggering arbitration to decide the final payment. 
Each week in recent months, Blue Cross received an average of 75 dispute requests from the hospital, the insurer said in its letter. That is much more than the insurer says it received from all other health care entities in Idaho. On average each month, Hobby said Blue Cross only received 14 dispute requests from other providers in Idaho.
“Compared to the rest of providers that we work with … the volume is alarming,” Hobby said. 
The payments sought in that process are often high, Blue Cross told the Department of Insurance. One example Hobby shared was a claim for nearly $2,900 to treat a runny nose, which was well over the $376 that is the median commercial rate for nasal congestion.

Cally Younger, administrator of the Idaho Governor’s Office and Energy and Mineral Resources, said Little’s office hopes to notify and announce the members of the new Advanced Nuclear Energy Task Force in the coming weeks. 
The task force will likely include state elected officials, leadership from Idaho National Laboratory, university or education officials, private industry representatives, a Tribal representative, local officials and other partners, Younger said. 
The goal is to launch the task force in the coming weeks with an eye toward conducting the task force’s first meeting in February, Younger said. 
 What will Idaho’s nuclear energy task force focus on?

Some of the questions the task force may attempt to answer include what types of nuclear energy research and development does Idaho want, and which entities does Idaho want to fill those roles, Younger said.

The task force may also look at supply chain issues and weigh the pros and cons of data centers, which consume large amounts of energy and water, Younger said. 
In an interview Tuesday with the Idaho Capital Sun, Younger said the task force would look at government supported nuclear research, like the U.S. Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory, as well as private, commercial nuclear programs and the connections to higher education and workforce development. 
Younger said the state hopes to use the new task force to capitalize on some of the momentum building around nuclear energy. 
“There’s been a ton of excitement with nuclear in this last year,” Younger said. “People keep using the word renaissance, which some people love and some people hate. We just see a renewed interest in it.”
‘Searching for energy solutions,’ Idaho Gov. Little creates new task force to advance nuclear energy

This year, President Donald Trump issued a series of executive orders supporting nuclear energy.
Additionally Idaho National Laboratory officials told state legislators the lab is in the process of permitting and building its first new nuclear reactors in 50 years, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
Idaho National Laboratory operates an 890-square mile research complex located outside of Idaho Falls and is considered the nation’s leading nuclear research lab. 
Although Idaho National Laboratory and the state are ramping up nuclear programs, one watchdog organization is sounding a warning. 
After Idaho state officials published a request for information this fall seeking information about nuclear development opportunities, a Boise-based nonprofit organization that describes itself as Idaho’s nuclear watchdog and the champion of clean energy, the Snake River Alliance, said nuclear energy poses risks to Idaho ratepayers, public health and clean water. 
“The nuclear fuel cycle — from uranium mining to radioactive waste storage — is a chain of pollution, exorbitant cost, health impacts, and irreversible damage to our most precious resource: water,” Snake River Alliance Executive Director Leigh Ford said in a written statement. “Nuclear power does not pencil out for Idaho ratepayers or water resources.” 
 How was the Advanced Nuclear Energy Task Force created?

Little signed an executive order creating the Idaho Advanced Nuclear Energy Task Force while attending the Western Governors’ Association’s energy conference Sept. 22 at Idaho National Laboratory. 
“Idaho has been a leader in nuclear energy because of the lab for decades,” Younger said. “We are in a unique position because of our relationships with the (U.S. Department of Energy).”
Little said the new task force replaces and modernizes the Leadership in Nuclear Energy Commission, or LINE Commission, that his predecessor, former Gov. Butch Otter, created.  
Younger said she hopes the new task force is a bit smaller, more nimble and more responsive than its predecessor the LINE Commission.
“As we look at what’s going on across the country and where we are as a state, we just wanted to affirmatively say we are doing something new,” Younger said.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)When U.S Customs and Immigration Officers arrested Felipe Mendez, he was given the choice of losing his two sons to government custody if he tried fighting the deportation or leave the United States willingly.
He lost his wife and 2-year-old son when tornadoes swept through his trailer park in Nashville in 2023, dropping a neighbor’s mobile home on top of the house he shared with his family of five. Mendez described to reporters at the time he remembered hearing the cries of his wife and children, knowing she and the toddler died when they went quiet. 
He came with his family to the United States just five months before the tornadoes from a rural village in Guatemala, fleeing a country where nearly half the population lives in poverty. 
Through a translator, Mendez spoke to the Lookout, describing the lack of job opportunities in Guatemala and a desire to stay in Tennessee if he could.
“I’m very sad to be leaving,” he said.
After the tornadoes, Mendez and his sons tried to move forward. He took a job at the fast-food chain Wendy’s. He was driving home from work in May when he was pulled over by a swarm of officers with the Tennessee Highway Patrol and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
He was swept up in an immigration sting operation established on Nashville roadways heavily traveled by immigrants by state and federal law enforcement officers with the intention of finding and arresting undocumented residents. ICE announced it had made 196 arrests during the sting meant to apprehend people who “pose a threat to public safety.”
The reason for Mendez’s stop remains unknown, but he was charged with driving without a license, a misdemeanor in Tennessee. The Lookout reached out to the Tennessee Highway Patrol and ICE but neither responded.

An analysis conducted using highway patrol records by the Nashville Banner found that of 607 vehicles stopped during the May operation, 1 out of every 7 included a reason for the stop, “most often citing a non-moving violation, such as window tints, light laws or improperly displayed tags.”
When ICE officers arrested Mendez, they didn’t send him to prison and start a forced deportation process but released him with an ankle monitor when he agreed to leave the United States within five months.
“They gave him no choice but to leave,” said Ashley Warbington, a friend and translator for Mendez. 
Tennessee and ties to ICE
President Donald Trump’s administration launched an immigration crackdown nationwide soon after he returned to office in January. One of the most high-profile operations is in Chicago, where local and state government officials have pushed back against what Democratic Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker called “attacks on families” by federal agents. 
In Tennessee — a state dominated politically by a coalition of suburban and rural Republicans — the response to ICE and federal law enforcement intervention has been different. Before Trump took office, Gov. Bill Lee and state lawmakers created an immigration bureau inside the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security.
Lee has embraced the Trump administration’s federal crime task forces, which, among several controversial practices, include ramped-up immigration raids. He sent the state National Guard to Washington, D.C., to assist federal law enforcement and is trying to use it for the same purpose in Memphis.
The state safety department and the corrections department both signed agreements with ICE, known as 287(g)s, to work with the federal agency and allow it to train and potentially pay its Tennessee Highway Patrol officers and prison guards. Forty-four local law enforcement agencies also signed up in 2025.

The Trump administration has labeled its efforts as removing “the worst of the worst.”  But as the Trump administration has pressured ICE officials to ramp up their deportation efforts, as reported by Axios, caught in the net are people without permanent legal status who genuinely came to America for better opportunities.  
Kelly Chieng, who befriended Mendez after his arrest in May, said it’s been “heartbreaking” to watch people who came here to make a better life for their families leave because of the current political climate. 
“It’s about creating a culture of fear so they just leave,” Chieng said.  
Alexmary Mariño, her husband Orangel and her infant daughter came to Middle Tennessee from Venezuela looking for work. But Warbington, who met Mariño earlier this year, said  Orangel was arrested driving home from his construction job and ICE deported him back to Venezuela, leaving Mariño and her baby alone in Dickson. 
Mariño, like Mendez, started her own journey back to Venezuela in October at the Tornado Bus Company’s stop in Nashville.  
Mendez told Warbington that he made it back to Guatemala and he’s trying to make the best of the situation. His sons are enjoying hanging out with their cousins, Mendez said.
Mariño is still in the midst of her 25-day journey, which will include nearly a dozen stops in various cities as well as a boat ride. Warbington said Mariño is worried about what awaits her.
“She says there is nothing for her there,” Warbington said.

(Getty Images)Across Idaho, more than 160,000 people earn income — whether as a primary or supplemental source — through self-employment, contract work or small business ownership. They include truckers, delivery drivers, freelance creatives, child care providers and self-employed farmers and tradespeople who remain central to Idaho’s economy.
Together, they generate over $9 billion annually, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. This independent workforce reflects Idaho’s spirit of self-reliance and enterprise — yet labor policies haven’t kept pace with the way people earn a living today.
Much of Idaho’s workforce turns to self-employment because that’s how many local industries operate — from agriculture and construction to family-run services and trades.
For others, independent work offers the flexibility to manage their time, earn income on their own terms, and pursue family, education, or creative goals. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than 80 percent of independent workers prefer their current arrangement, and fewer than 9 percent say they’d rather have a traditional employee job.
But self-employment comes with tradeoffs. The same independence that defines this kind of work can also leave people without basic protections. Under current laws, self-employed workers often go without benefits like health coverage or retirement savings — and even when companies or clients want to offer them voluntarily, they’re discouraged from doing so because of legal uncertainty.
Current labor rules risk treating those arrangements as formal “employment,” triggering costly liabilities. As a result, many businesses or clients avoid offering benefits altogether. Surveys show that 81 percent of self-employed workers want portable benefits solutions — ways to access benefits while keeping the independence they’ve chosen.
That’s where portable benefits come in. Portable benefits would travel with workers as they move between jobs, clients or projects — benefits that belong to the individual rather than a single employer. Picture a truck driver, a freelance designer or a self-employed farmer who receives contributions from each company or buyer they work with — funds that accumulate in a personal benefits account they can take with them from job to job.
This reform isn’t about changing what makes self-employment appealing. It’s about expanding access to financial security while preserving the independence and initiative that define Idaho’s self-employed workforce. Lawmakers can make that possible by establishing safe harbor provisions that allow companies or buyers to voluntarily offer benefits without fear of reclassification.
With its entrepreneurial economy built on small businesses, family farms and independent trades, Idaho is uniquely positioned to lead — and modernizing its labor laws would help workers thrive on their own terms.
While other states, such as California, have moved in the opposite direction with restrictive reclassification laws like Assembly Bill 5 — leading to measurable declines in self-employment and disrupting industries such as trucking and the creative arts — Idaho can instead embrace policies that expand flexibility and opportunity.
Supporting voluntary portable benefits would reinforce Idaho’s commitment to economic freedom, entrepreneurship and individual opportunity.
Across the country, momentum for portable benefits is gaining traction. States such as Utah and Tennessee have advanced proposals to modernize labor laws and enable voluntary benefit programs for self-employed workers. In other Western states, including Nevada and Montana, similar bills have been introduced in the past year. At the federal level, proposals in Congress would create similar safe harbors, allowing innovation at scale. After years of debate about how to support nontraditional workers, policymakers are finally beginning to act.
What’s notable is that these workers aren’t asking for government mandates or subsidies. They’re asking for the freedom to participate in modern systems of security without sacrificing the independence they’ve chosen. Portable benefits meet that need — offering stronger financial security without compromising the initiative and determination that define Idaho’s workforce.
By removing outdated barriers to voluntary portable benefits, Idaho can prove that independence and security not only coexist — they make each other stronger.

Photographed  on March 11, 2025. (Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht for Tennessee Lookout)Many acres of wetlands across the vast Mississippi River basin would lose federal protection under a new rule proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
Agricultural and builders’ groups have called it a win for private property owners. Environmental groups warn that it will exacerbate costly challenges like flooding that already plague the river and its tributaries. 
The new rule, proposed Nov. 17, is the latest in a convoluted, decades-long fight over which streams and wetlands qualify as “Waters of the United States” and thus are regulated by the federal government under the Clean Water Act. Environmental advocates claim more expansive federal protections are needed to preserve the country’s natural resources, while some farmers and homebuilders argue the government is overstepping its authority to control how they use their land. 
A landmark 2023 U.S. Supreme Court case, Sackett v. EPA, used a narrow definition to determine which wetlands get federal protections. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin promised earlier this year that the agency would adjust its definitions to comply. The proposed rule delivers on that promise.
The proposal will be open for public comment for 45 days before it moves forward.
Wetland advocates are still parsing details of the proposal but say they’re concerned with the impacts it could have.
Legislation slashing development oversight of isolated wetlands heads to Gov. Bill Lee’s desk

“The EPA’s newly revised Waters of the United States definition, crafted to conform to the Sackett decision, resolves many ambiguities in a way that further reduces federal protections for wetlands,” Harpeth Conservancy CEO Grace Stranch wrote in a statement to the Tennessee Lookout. “Tennessee’s wetlands support extraordinary biodiversity and sit atop unique geology; these features require tailored, science-based solutions, not blanket rollbacks.”
In Tennessee, the majority of wetlands that could be most at risk under the proposed rule lie in the state’s western region, closest to the Mississippi River and its tributaries.
Kelly McGinnis, executive director of One Mississippi, a group that advocates for the river, said the proposed rule “does not help any of the issues the basin is facing.”
“Whether we’re talking water quality and pollution, trying to mitigate the impact of the more frequent floods and droughts we’re seeing — removing even more wetland protections … is devastating,” McGinnis said.
States along Mississippi River have varied wetlands protections
In Sackett v. EPA, a couple asked the Supreme Court to restrict federal regulations of wetlands so they could build a home on their northern Idaho property. The court ruled in their favor, saying only wetlands that have a continuous surface connection with another r protected water body — such as a permanent, navigable waterway — qualify for protections under the Clean Water Act. 
The Clean Water Act protects the “Waters of the United States” but it does not define them. That has fallen to the EPA, which has changed its definition repeatedly since the law’s passing in 1972. The murkiness and scope of the definitions has long frustrated stakeholders. 
In a news release, Zeldin said the new EPA rule follows the Sackett decision closely, granting protections only to wetlands that touch another protected water body and have visible water for at least part of the year.
Experts say a wetland is doing work even if it doesn’t usually have water in it or is isolated. The benefits of wetlands lie in their ability to relieve flooding, purify water, mitigate drought and provide wildlife habitat. Experts say in an era of increased storms, droughts and floods wrought by climate change, they’re needed now more than ever. 
Many groups have attempted to predict how many wetlands will lose protections following the Sackett decision, but the actual impact is yet to be understood. What is clear is that with more limited federal regulation, states will have different rules governing wetlands. 
Along the Mississippi River, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Tennessee and Mississippi have wetland protections that go beyond the Clean Water Act, a Mississippi River Basin Ag & Water Desk analysis found. Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky and Arkansas do not have more protective wetland laws on the books. Louisiana extends state protections to its coastal wetlands, but not inland ones.
And state laws are still moving targets. Tennessee lawmakers, for example, voted this year to roll back protections that had been in place since the 1970s requiring developers and landowners to seek state permission and pay for mitigation before draining or altering isolated wetlands. In Illinois, where researchers have estimated about 72% of the state’s remaining wetlands could lose federal protections under Sackett, lawmakers have drafted legislation beefing up their state’s regulations, though they have not passed it, yet.
There are also unanswered questions about how the Sackett decision would affect areas along the Mississippi and other rivers where the river’s main channel is separated from the floodplain by built levees — a concern Justice Brett Kavanaugh mentioned directly in his concurring opinion on the case. 
Wetland-rich Louisiana, in particular, relies on manmade flood control structures to try and hold back floodwaters from low-lying communities. State legislation passed in 2025 made wetland areas behind levees ineligible for state protection. 
Should those areas lose federal protection, it opens them up to “a ton of risky development,” said Haley Gentry, assistant director at the Tulane Institute on Water Resources Law and Policy in New Orleans. 
“The reason to not build in a wetland shouldn’t have been, ‘Oh, you have to get this pesky federal permit,’” Gentry said. “It’s that wetlands flood … this is not creating more affordable housing, if you’re building risky homes in flood zones.” 
Mississippi River basin wetlands are already in trouble
Groups like the American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Association of Manufacturers, whose members faced the potential of hefty fines if they altered federally regulated wetlands, have reacted positively to Zeldin’s proposed rule. 
The groups have complained that the previous definition, which was published in early 2023 and protected a broader swath of wetlands, left farmers confused about things like what constitutes a continuous surface connection between a wetland and a water body, said Courtney Briggs, senior director of government affairs for the American Farm Bureau Federation. 
“The fact that this administration has come in and given definitions to those terms already improves the situation significantly,” Briggs said. “It gives our farmers more confidence in using their own land.” 
Tennessee wetlands bill sees support from law firm that spearheaded national deregulation

Environmental groups, however, say that there will be consequences of the administration’s effort to make it easier for people to drain and fill wetlands for their own purposes. 
“They have, in this rule-making, completely ignored the costs of fewer wetlands and more polluted water to communities around the country,” said Mark Sabath, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center.
The Mississippi River basin is home to many different types of wetlands, from Minnesota’s peatlands to the swamps of the Gulf South. In some places, they carry economic benefits of their own — like in Arkansas, where they provide crucial habitat for waterfowl that hunters spend big money to shoot. 
According to data from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 132,000 acres of wetland across the basin were lost between 2009 and 2019, the equivalent of about 100,000 football fields. 
The last time EPA was reworking its definition of the“Waters of the United States,” in 2022, the  Mississippi River Collaborative, a consortium of environmental groups focused on the river,  wrote that the link between continued destruction of wetlands and increased nutrient pollution, a persistent problem for the Mississippi River, “is very clear.” 
“One cannot protect waters like the Illinois, Mississippi, and Ohio Rivers and the Gulf of Mexico without protecting wetlands and small streams,” they wrote.

(Photo. by Lexi Browning/ West Virginia Watch)“There is not enough money to fix the education system” is often posed as the beginning of a question when in truth those ten words are the answer to what ails institutionalized learning at all levels. 
If there was some magical infinite money stream flowing unfettered into the school system, there would be plenty of splashy headlines about how it was spent, and shiny new buildings going up, and a slew of hires, and plenty of charts and graphs of pay and benefits going up, and so the list goes. That is what hypothetical unlimited money does; it makes the wish list and ethereal accomplishments just as unlimited. And promised money in the politically charged education discourse is always unlimited in potential. 
What money does in real life is reveal. It reveals leadership, or lack thereof. It reveals human nature. It reveals systemic issues. It reveals priorities, preconceived notions, prejudices and personalization of perspective. Never in the history of ever has money fixed a human nature problem. 
There are reasons Herbert Hoover High School students are enjoying year three of excellent new facilities in Elkview, rebuilt after the 2016 flooding, while Richwood students are in year one and Summersville hasn’t even started moving dirt from the same disaster. Those reasons are not funding, but the human management of funding, the personal and local politics of education funding, the greed and mismanagement that comes from funding without competence.
Going into an election cycle, education will get the buzzword treatment by those running for office. “More pay for teachers” no matter how well meaning a sentiment has crept up the list of top oratory cliches, ranking below “God Bless America” and somewhere between “Make our communities safer” and “Go (insert relevant local sports team cheap pop here).” “School choice” the buzzword plays much better than “school choice” the complicated policy issue of sorting haves from the have-nots when not properly supervised and held accountable. “Save our school” plays much better to cheers and clicks than in-depth discussions on demographic decline that predestines the doom of any differentiated instruction if any learning is to be had at all.
More teacher pay is a fine thing, deserved in the case of in-classroom teachers, but monetary compensation can only outweigh being a cog in a dysfunctional system for so long. The hockey-stick graph of administrative pay raises and costs compared to in-classroom teacher pay and expenditures is seared in the teachers mind while the admins show no signs of wanting less pay, less compensation, or a smaller slice of the education funding pie for the greater good. More positions and spending, to manage more positions, and spending to facilitate more increases in positions and spending, is quite the racket. In any other field of endeavor such a thing would be challenged, but the “education” nomenclature apparently makes the whole enterprise immune from reason. 
Not on the policy charts is the feelings in-classroom teachers experience dealing with the human factors of students who are all individuals, who all come from different home environments, who all have various parental situations, who all are walking examples of problem personalization. And there are dozens of them per teacher. What is the fair compensation for an in-classroom teacher getting the blame on all sides when they fail to shepherd their two dozen square peg charges through the one-size-fits-all system of rounded education?
There isn’t any fair compensation for that sort of soul-crushing Sisyphusian career path. And yet the wonderful, dedicated, persevering in-classroom teachers still carry on, though even they will have limits. The data is showing the hard edges of those limits in teacher shortages, retention issues, and quality of candidates, especially in difficult school situations. 
“There will never be perfect students/teachers/schools” is the response to such realities and criticisms, and correctly so. No more than the magical, mystical funding increases that will come from… somewhere… will improve current issues without meaningful reform and change. For some reason, perhaps just out of sheer repetition and fatigue, too many just let the “more pay for teachers” or “more funding for X project” be the acceptable answer to questions that are really about population decline, government funding, public service and stewardship, and the public’s willingness to demand excellence from our education system. 
The worst run school in the land still wouldn’t accept five as the answer to “what is 2+2” on a test. But that is what we are doing collectively with the education debate in general and the education funding discourse particularly. Cliche buzzwords, vote for me, lather, rinse, repeat. Meanwhile, every year another batch of newly minted adults emerges from the 13 year process we call education, not a product of “the system” but the system we provided them by omission and commission. It is what the engineers and tech folks call non-system thinking; problem solving one quick thing tactically that makes a strategic mess of everything else because there is never a linear solution that does not affect everything else. Symptoms over causes. Quick fixes. The “fix that fails” over and over again because the answer always comes out as some gussied up version of “five”. 
We are failing them because we are — as a people — what we tolerate, and there is no amount of funding to fix that.

(Photo by Esteban Fernandez for West Virginia Watch)Cheyenne Baker became homeless while attending South Charleston High School. She had been a straight-A student, but a difficult family life forced her to leave her home.
“I had nowhere to go. I was working at a hotel during the time, just trying to get by, and they let me stay at night in one of the rooms,” said Baker, who is now 21. “I just tried to figure out what I was going to do from there. I started missing classes because I didn’t have transportation.”
There are more than 13,000 students experiencing homelessness in West Virginia, according to data from the West Virginia Department of Education. A separate document from the department said the number of homeless students for the 2024-25 school year was 15,101.
While West Virginia’s student population has plummeted over the last decade, the number of students identified as homeless by school employees has climbed. But legislation introduced for several years at the state Capitol meant to help these children has failed to make it to the governor’s desk.
“We have a lot of kids that we can help,” said Sen. Vince Deeds, R-Greenbrier. “The number is surprising, but it, unfortunately, is accurate.”
Senate Minority Leader Mike Woelfel, D-Cabell, said, “In the Senate, we get up and somebody says a prayer every day. Well, who are the least among us? I can’t think of anybody who’s more worthy of our attention than homeless children that are floating around.”
Homeless students are counted under federal guidelines known as McKinney Vento, which defines a homeless student as a child lacking “fixed, regular and adequate nighttime residence.” 
In West Virginia, some of the students are living in cars or shelters. Most are doubled up with families and friends — an unstable experience that impacts school performance and behavior. 
There are around 300 homeless students in Cabell County Schools, where Keith Thomas serves as the director of health, wellness and student support. Their homeless student population includes children living at Branches Domestic Violence Shelter in Huntington. 
“We expect kids to succeed, but it’s not fair to them when they don’t have a fixed place of living,” he said. “You just can’t focus. I’m not going to learn what four times three is if I don’t know where my next house is.”
Kristin Walter, state education department’s coordinator for the Office of Student Support and Wellness, said, school staff working closely with these students and their families often share that the children experience frequent moves and instability, a lack of basic necessities, and emotional trauma. There has been a “fear of stigma and disclosure of their living situations,” she said. 
“Rising numbers may be connected to increased training and awareness around the McKinney-Vento definition, which has led to more accurate identification and referrals for support,” Walter said. “Rising housing costs, financial instability and stronger collaboration among student support staff such as Communities In Schools and school counselors have also contributed, as these teams work together to ensure students are identified and supported appropriately.”
The thousands of identified homeless students were counted separately from the state’s nearly 6,000 foster children.
Baker said a teacher recognized she was homeless and offered to let her move into her home so she could finish school. 
“I’m convinced that she saved my life,” she said. “She pushed me to continue just showing up, and I’m pretty sure she’s the reason why I graduated high school, because I was convinced that I wasn’t going to make it during the time.”
Her school’s McKinney-Vento coordinator also offered extra support, she said. 
“I was in a constant state of, like, fight or flight mode. Even though I was staying with her, my clothes were still in a small suitcase, because I was ready for, ‘What if something were to happen?’” Baker said.
West Virginia’s federal funding for homeless students decreased
Counties split the state’s allocation of federal McKinney-Vento funds to purchase school supplies and pay for transportation and special support services for homeless students. It can also be used for other emergency assistance needs. 
West Virginia’s McKinney-Vento dollars decreased this year to $689,517 — down from $817,803 last fiscal year.
There’s no dedicated line-item funding for homeless students in West Virginia’s budget.
Thomas said that the state education department does a good job of distributing McKinney-Vento funds to districts. Churches and local community groups help his county purchase clothes for kids and make sure they have food.
“We could use more funds. Everybody could, because it’s a growing number,” he said. 
Rodd Monts is director of state policy for SchoolHouse Connection, a nonprofit focused on education-based youth homelessness policies.
“Given the changes in D.C., a lot of states are looking at ways that they can provide more funding for supportive students experiencing homelessness,” he said. “It’s a challenge … because so many states are dealing with budget deficits as well as competing priorities, including within education itself.”

Bill to help homeless students will return in 2026, but will it be funded?
At the state Capitol, recent Republican-led education reform has focused on school vouchers and improving lagging reading scores. There have been some efforts to connect kids experiencing trauma with behavioral specialists.
As far back as 2017, bills sponsored by Republicans and Democratic lawmakers have been introduced to put full-time homeless students coordinators in more schools and help these youth obtain identification documents. None of those measures have passed the Legislature.
“This is just a topic that nobody has been talking about,” Deeds said. 
With the next legislative session less than 60 days away, Deeds plans to push for a homeless students’ ID bill. He is still drafting the legislation but said it would create a process for schools to help homeless students obtain vital documents, including a birth certificate, state identification card or replacement license, at no cost.
Deeds, who works as director of Public Safety for Greenbrier County Schools, said making sure these children have ID is a safety issue. 
“There’s a lot of kids that are out here that may be couch surfing in our communities, and I’m not saying that each and every one is in danger,” Deeds said. “But I think it would be nice for our first responders, for whatever reason if they have contact with these individuals, to be able to say, ‘Hey, we realize that you’ve got an ID that says that you live in Charleston, West Virginia. But what are you doing in Morgantown at 15 years old?’”
The bill would need funding, which Deeds noted could be difficult to squeeze out of the state budget as lawmakers have focused on passing skinny budgets.
“I’ve had some conversations just trying to find a preexisting funding source that may not be utilized that much,” he said. “That’s my goal so I don’t have to worry about a fiscal note.”
Similar legislation has passed in Red states, Motts noted, including Alabama.
Sen. Mike Woelfel, D-Cabell
Woelfel introduced a bill during the 2025 legislative session that would have placed a full-time, dedicated homeless education coordinator in the state’s more urban counties to recognize and help homeless students. The bill would have required that a part-time homeless education coordinator be required in the state’s rural counties.
The bill didn’t move as the Senate’s Republican leadership selected the bills that were vetted in committees.
Woelfel has introduced similar measures during past legislative sessions and plans to reintroduce it next year. He said the state’s opioid epidemic has impacted the state’s rate of homeless students. 
“I think it’s worthwhile, but this bill never moved a bit,” Woelfel said.
Monts would like to see the legislation pass in West Virginia, connecting student homelessness to lowered academic performance and graduation rates. 
“We do understand that in many school districts around the country, liaisons are wearing multiple hats and juggling responsibilities, and as a result, being stretched pretty thin,” he said. “Being able to increase the amount of bandwidth and capacity you have to serve those students is also important too, which is one of the reasons we’d really like to see this bill move forward.”
Walter said that districts can use McKinney-Vento funds to pay for a homeless liaison, whose work would include identifying students, helping them enroll in school, connecting them with services and removing barriers to learning.

“Additional funding is always helpful, but it is equally important to ensure staff are educated and trained to be resourceful, understand the best ways to address mental health and social stigmas, and recognize that homelessness can take many forms,” she said, adding that districts also need to have processes in place to identify students experiencing homelessness and connect them with community resources.
Baker is currently attending Fairmont State University studying information systems management and Spanish.
She’d like to see more staff in schools reaching out to homeless students, offering mental support and guidance. 
“I feel very lucky that I had someone there that could help me, you know, because not a lot of people have that support, and not a lot of people were strong enough to come forward about something like that,” she said.

The North Carolina Global TransPark in Kinston was created in the 1990s as an industrial park to bring economic prosperity to a region that had lost more than its fair share of agricultural and manufacturing jobs. But nearly two decades after its launch, the TransPark had not lived up to expectations and was deemed a boondoggle, even by some supporters.
These days, however, the Global TransPark, with a renewed focus on aeronautics and more than 1,800 employees working on site at companies like Spirit AeroSystems and flyExclusive, is bustling with activity. That’s leading many to hope that the TransPark will finally produce the economic outcomes regional leaders and residents were promised. 
The park’s growth has been substantial in recent years. Last year, state, federal and local officials broke ground for the U.S. Navy’s Fleet Readiness Center East, C-130 Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul complex that will create more than 400 new jobs and generate $400 million in new investment for the region. And Lenoir Community College is building a $25 million Aviation Center of Excellence at the TransPark to offer training in aviation systems and aircraft construction, as well as an aviation academy for high school students.
According to the state’s 2025 State of Aviation report, the TransPark generates $781 million in economic output, supports nearly 3,000 jobs and contributes $43.5 million in state and local taxes. The park was created as an independent government agency within the N.C. Department of Transportation.

“I’ve seen us go through some great times and I’ve seen the bad times,” said Mark Pope, president of the N.C. Global TransPark Economic Development Region, which includes Greene, Lenoir and Wayne Counties. “I see us really inching our way back up to being a different community than what we used to be.”
But the park’s rising fortunes aren’t lifting all its neighbors equally.
East Kinston, one of the most economically depressed communities in the state, is about five miles north of the TransPark. From there, Chris Suggs, a city councilman and founder of Kinston Teens, a youth-led nonprofit devoted to community improvement, is closely monitoring the TransPark’s newfound success.
Suggs worries that residents in some of the county’s poorest communities could be left behind if intentional efforts aren’t made to include them. 
“You have this confluence of economic activity in a community where a few miles away, there is one of the poorest neighborhoods in the state,” Suggs said. “I don’t think that’s necessarily a bad thing if our leaders could actually figure out how to connect the two. Right now, neighborhoods like East Kinston and a bunch of rural communities in Lenoir County are disconnected from Global TransPark.”

A main concern, Suggs said, is the lack of adequate public transportation. Without it, he said, residents from low-wealth communities find it difficult to reach the new jobs or the community colleges where training for them takes place.
“If we make those types of investments in our civic and social infrastructure, if we make greater investments in housing so that people are able to take advantage of these jobs … I think those are some of the positives that can come from the economic boost the Global TransPark is starting to bring to this region,” Suggs said. 
Suggs said his colleagues on the city council and members of the Lenoir County Board of Commissioners have “missed the moment” when it comes to investing in quality housing and public transportation. Suggs did not seek reelection. His term on the council ends next month.
Jeremy Stroud, executive director of the Global TransPark, said the average salary at the TransPark is in the $75,000 range, compared to $48,000 for Lenoir County, where Kinston is located. 
“Our main function to help the people in Lenoir County and Kinston and the region is to work with private industry to attract more industry to the Global TransPark,” Stroud said. “In doing so, you have more technical jobs available to local residents.”

Stroud and others who spoke to NC Newsline said the path to good-paying jobs at the TransPark is through the public schools and Lenoir Community College, where many TransPark’s employees are trained. 
The TransPark has a strong relationship with Lenoir Community College and others in the regions. It also sponsors summer camps for students and offers job shadowing career days to spark interest in the high tech jobs available at the TransPark, Stroud said. 
“We try to engage with the local school systems and local community colleges routinely,” Stroud said. “I would say to a student, if you find something you’re passionate in, communicate that with your advisors and with the school systems and with the Global TransPark. We would love to expose those students to those careers.”
Lenoir County Commissioner Preston Harris believes the TransPark can be a catalyst to help lift residents out of poverty. Harris said those efforts must begin as early as elementary school. 
Harris noted that high school students also take courses at Lenoir Community College through early college programs. Students can graduate with an associate’s degree and some have “automatic jobs” with companies in the park, Harris said.

“A few of those companies, they actually have something set up in the schools where they will co-op with students so that while they’re in school and during the summer, they can actually work with those companies,” Harris said.
To better prepare the region’s future workforce, Pope said more schools need STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) programs to engage children and to get them “excited about learning how to fix things.”
Pope noted the workplace is changing, and technology and robotics skills are becoming essential to employment.  
“That’s why our STEM programs have to be so important in our elementary, our junior high, our high schools,” Pope said. “How do we train and get our kids engaged with what’s being made in their own backyard?”
Pope, the park’s executive director, wants an aviation-focused “academy or charter school” for middle school students near the TransPark that would enroll students from across Eastern North Carolina. He said he’s been talking to a lot of people about how to make that a reality. 
“I think that’s another missing piece of the puzzle,” Pope said. “If we had that, it would be a game changer for a lot of these young kids.”
As NC Newsline previously reported, Suggs returned home not long after graduating from UNC Chapel Hill in 2021. He wants more of his peers and the youth coming up now to see Kinston and Lenoir County as an option after graduating high school or college.
“It wasn’t necessarily the easiest thing for me to do,” Suggs said, referring to his decision to return to Kinston. “There are so few of us who went away to college and then came back.”
He said many of those who stayed after high school have struggled to find good jobs and stable housing.
“I want my peers, my generation, the generation coming behind us to feel like Kinston is a place that they can stay in and remain in and make a decent living and have a good quality of life,” Suggs said. “I don’t want us to be constantly losing our best and brightest to Raleigh, the Triangle or to Charlotte or anywhere else in the country.”

The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The study was conducted by Falcon Correctional and Community Services Inc. experts partnering with the Wisconsin Department of Corrections (DOC). The department said it is planning to contract with the consulting firm to create a framework to implement recommendations. 
“While the report affirms that DOC is moving in the right direction, it also shows that there is more work to be done,” Corrections Secretary Jared Hoy said in the department’s press release. 
In a statement, the advocacy group Ex-Incarcerated People Organizing (EXPO) said the report “confirms what directly impacted people and advocates have said for years: Wisconsin’s prisons are dangerously overcrowded, under-resourced and in desperate need of healing-centered reform.”
Many of the suggested changes will affect the entire correctional system, the agency said. Consultants and staff will work to “reimagine existing space, create new processes and training at five pilot sites.” 
In a letter dated July 9, 2024, Hoy told a state Assembly committee that the department planned on bringing on Falcon for an outside review. News of criminal charges against staff at Waupun Correctional Institution over prisoner deaths had broken just weeks before Hoy wrote the letter. The same day, the committee heard testimony about the toll of solitary confinement and other issues in the prison system. 
The department and Falcon signed a contract in November 2024, and the Examiner reported in January on details of the partnership obtained through public records requests. Criminal justice reform advocates expressed hope the report would be beneficial but have called for independent oversight of the Department of Corrections. Last week, the department published the 137-page final report, which lists strengths for the department to build on as well as recommendations for improvement.  
The report states that while all recommendations are made based on Falcon’s overall review of the adult prison system, “we understand that the majority of recommendations will require funding, often requiring budget approval.”
Susan Franzen of the prison reform advocacy group Ladies of SCI expressed concern about whether overcrowding and staffing shortages will affect DOC’s ability to effectively carry out recommendations. 
“Legislators need to help the DOC out by giving them a fighting chance to make these changes,” Franzen wrote in an email to the Wisconsin Examiner. 
The report states that the study involved working with DOC officials, gathering data, reviewing policies, statutes and prior studies and conducting virtual workshops with DOC experts and others, including formerly incarcerated people and advocates. 
It also included visits to 15 facilities, such as the Waupun and Green Bay prisons, and interviews with staff and incarcerated people.
Suicide watch
Preventing suicide is a pressing concern, the report states in a section that summarized information from mental health-related discussions with staff during mental health workshops and site visits.
One concern is that observation cells are typically in restrictive housing units; in addition, “individuals on observation status are not allowed therapeutic items, visits, phone calls, or recreation,” the report states.  
People who pose threats to themselves, or who pose threats to others because of mental illness, may be put on observation.
The report recommends housing people in observation in “more appropriate environments that support therapeutic care and patient safety.” 
Over the last 15 years, 59 people died by suicide in Wisconsin prisons, an average of four deaths per year. Suicide watch placements reportedly rose from 1,200 to 1,500 per year to about 2,500 in 2024. In June, the Examiner reported on Victor Garcia, who died due to an attempt to hang himself while he was on observation in a Wisconsin prison.
Psychological services staff decide what items a person can have access to while they’re on clinical observation. Department policy provides a list to use as a starting point, including items like soap, toilet paper and suicide-resistant clothing. 
The report described the list as “very limiting,” and the security mat or mattress was observed to be inadequate for most people on suicide precautions. Later on in the report, it suggests replacing small sleeping mats with suicide-resistant mattresses.
Solitary confinement
The Falcon report includes priorities and steps to take on “restrictive housing” in state prisons, where incarcerated people experience “very limited” out-of-cell programming and recreation time, such as:

Giving people in restrictive housing at least two hours of recreation and/or programming each day, not including out-of-cell time for necessary activities, such as showers 
Reviewing the status, programming and needs of people in restrictive housing every week instead of every 30 days 
Improving cleanliness and removing all graffiti 
Establishing units that are alternatives to restricted housing for people with serious mental illnesses

Incarcerated people in Wisconsin prisons can be put in restrictive housing as a punishment for a violation or when having the person live with the general population would create a serious threat. 
An average stay in disciplinary separation — a punishment for committing a violation — decreased from 39.7 days in January 2019 to 27.4 days in April 2025, the report notes. However, this varies by facility, and the latest average published online for Green Bay Correctional Institution is 48.7 days. 
The department has begun to address the number of people in restrictive housing and how long they spend there, the report states. However, the number of people placed in restrictive housing has not changed significantly over the last five years.
“High rates of substance use and mental illness among individuals placed in restrictive housing was noted, often contributing to a ‘revolving door’ for this population,” the report stated in the section about mental health insights from staff. 
Solitary confinement has potential effects of physical harm, health issues and negative effects on mental health, the report notes.
Solitary confinement is also associated with increased risk of violence towards oneself and suicide, and research shows that solitary confinement as a tool does not reduce institutional misconduct or violence or the risk of recidivism, the report states. 
There were 950 people in restrictive housing as of September, 863 of whom were placed there due to a rule violation, according to online Department of Corrections data. 
Under a policy that went into effect last May, a placement of over 120 days has to be approved by the assistant administrator for the division of adult institutions, the report noted. 
An overcrowded system
All medium and maximum-security facilities in Wisconsin except for Waupun Correctional Institution are over capacity, as of January, the report states. Facilities for men were at 130% of capacity, while women’s prisons were at 166% of capacity. People are living at security levels that don’t fit their classification — for example, a person sentenced to medium-security being held in maximum security, or a person sentenced to minimum-security being held in medium security. 
The state building commission took an initial step toward updating the aging and overcrowded prison system last month, when it agreed to create plans for a revamp. 
Inconsistency in the department 
Leaders and staff at the facility level of the agency felt a lack of autonomy in their day-to-day jobs, the report found. They believe there is “significant and often excessive and unnecessary scrutiny from outside entities.” 
But the study also found a problem with “a general lack of uniformity across facilities,” which is creating challenges relating to monitoring, oversight and accountability. It recommends “system-wide alignment” on areas including basic security practices, incident reporting and investigation processes.
The report recommends that the agency take an approach that involves both oversight and collaboration. The goal would be to carry out the strategy of DOC leadership with both efforts from leadership and “input and innovation” from frontline staff, stakeholders and incarcerated people. 
A central part of a section called “Back-to-Basics in Correctional Practices” recommends a three to five-day training for all staff about basic corrections practices, such as searches, use of force and out-of-cell time for people in restrictive housing. 
The department “has experienced a great deal of staffing changes, with a significant number of the current staff hired during or after the COVID19 pandemic,” the report found.
Strained mental health care
Mental health services were described as strained, according to the section of the report about mental health-related discussions with staff.
That section of the report suggests that an “unsustainable” number of people have been assigned to receive mental health care at least once every six months, and that this interferes with treatment for people who need more intensive care. 
Nearly half of all incarcerated people in adult prisons had been classified as needing mental health care as of May 20. It’s a much higher rate than other state correctional departments see, the report states. 
Department data shows the agency isn’t fully staffed in psychological services, with a vacancy rate of 19.7%. 
About nine in ten incarcerated women were on the mental health caseload. The report also noted that the population of maximum security facilities has a higher percentage of incarcerated people with mental health needs than medium or minimum security facilities.
Other recommendations in the report address medical practices, investigations and intelligence practices, data management and human resources and staffing.

Luis Duarte, of St. Jerome Catholic Church in Kenner, says he is cancelling events at the church in advance of the reported Border Patrol surge in the New Orleans area. (Photo by Robert Stewart/Verite News)The Rev. Luis Duarte, pastor at St. Jerome Catholic Church in Kenner, woke up Wednesday morning and took a few phone calls in his office. Then he decided to cancel all group activities at the church, other than mass, this week and the coming weeks.
He made the decision, he said, because he’s worried that rather than a place of sanctuary, his church in Kenner could soon become a target for federal immigration authorities.
As hundreds of U.S. Border Patrol agents descend on the New Orleans area by the beginning of December, Duarte said he’s concerned that the many daily activities at the church would make parishioners vulnerable to immigration enforcement operations. In this heavily Hispanic city, 80% of St. Jerome’s congregants are Hispanic, and many of them are immigrants, he said.
“I want to be with them, but I think sometimes you have to make those decisions to keep the community safe,” he said, adding that the weekend’s mass would be held in honor of all immigrants. “Remember that our Lord Jesus Christ went through that moment. So he knows what it feels to be persecuted just because of your race.”

This is the first time he’s ever had to make a call like this, he said, but after seeing the results of an immigration enforcement surge over the past few days in Charlotte, North Carolina, and after receiving several phone calls from members of the community worried about the presence of Border Patrol, he said he was forced to make a tough decision.
He said he’s also offering help to congregants who are scared of going out while the agents are deployed here. Duarte, along with some local groups that advocate for immigrants, are advising residents who could get caught in immigration enforcement operations to remain at home.
“I’m going to be attentive. If they need food or whatever, I will go to any house if they need something, because they are afraid of leaving to even buy groceries.”
On Tuesday, the Associated Press reported that some 250 Border Patrol agents will participate in what federal authorities are calling “Operation Swamp Sweep.” According to planning documents reviewed by the AP, agents will conduct immigration sweeps in communities and commercial areas in New Orleans, Jefferson, St. Tammany and St. Bernard Parishes and expand their efforts north through Baton Rouge.
This will be the third such operation in a major U.S. city in recent weeks, following operation “Midway Blitz” in Chicago and operation “Charlotte’s Web” in Charlotte.

In Chicago, federal agents focused on heavily Hispanic suburban neighborhoods near the city’s northwest side, sparking allegations of racial profiling — including of U.S. citizens of color caught up in the sweeps — and excessive use of force.
Kenner, a suburb to New Orleans’ northwest, has the highest share of Hispanic residents — largely Honduran — of anywhere in the metro area. The city of about 66,000 is 30% Hispanic and is well-known for its concentration of Hispanic-owned businesses, particularly along Williams Boulevard.
Kenner has already seen immigration enforcement operations stepped up this year, including early this month, when the city’s police department partnered with ICE, the Federal Bureau of Investigations, the Drug Enforcement Administration and Louisiana State Police for a nighttime raid at the boat launch in Laketown, which resulted in 15 immigration arrests.
In a video posted on the Kenner Police Department’s Facebook page, Kenner Police Department Chief Keith Conley said the operation was in response to years of nuisance complaints from city residents. Kenner PD was also one of the first local departments in Louisiana this year to ink a formal partnership pledging to work with federal immigration authorities.
In a phone interview with Verite News, Conley said the agency had not been briefed by their partners at ICE or anyone at U.S. Customs and Border Protection on the upcoming operation, adding that Kenner PD will work with federal immigration authorities if asked.
“From what I understand, they’re going to be operating independently. Certainly if they need our assistance for anything, we stand ready to assist and aid in their mission,” he said.
Conley said reports that fears over immigration enforcement are causing Hispanic residents to stay indoors might be overblown by social media.
“I don’t see any interruption in customers in restaurants and stores or anything like that,” Conley said. “If [residents] have any concerns or fears they’re more than welcome to call this office or to speak to any of our officers about it.”
But one business operator with locations in New Orleans and Kenner told Verite News that he is already seeing a drop in sales, even before the operation has officially begun.
“It’s a bad time,” said José Castillo, a manager at Norma’s Sweets Bakery, which is owned by his mother. “Business is down in Kenner, in New Orleans, in all our areas. … People are afraid to go out.”
Conley said Kenner PD has long been a good partner to federal immigration enforcement agencies. In March, the department signed an official agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement under the 287(g) program, which deputizes officers to carry out some ICE duties. President Donald Trump has urged departments across the country to enter into such partnerships, as has Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, a Trump ally and immigration hardliner.
The agreement allows KPD officers to draft their own “detainer” requests, authorizing local jailers to hold immigrants beyond when they might otherwise be released so that they can potentially be transferred into ICE custody.
In an investigation published in August, Verite News and Gulf States Newsroom found that Kenner PD traffic stops were creating a pipeline for immigrants from the city’s jail to federal immigration detention and even deportation. Between January and May ICE issued six times as many immigration detainer requests through Kenner PD than during the same time period in 2024.
As New Orleans area residents await the operation, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has been fairly tight-lipped about what to expect.
“Every day DHS enforces the laws of the nation across the country,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in an emailed statement. “We do not discuss future or potential operations.”
A spokesperson for Kenner Mayor Glaser did not respond to a request for comment on the operation. And Jefferson Parish President Cynthia Lee Sheng’s office said she has not been briefed on the operation.
“The Parish President has not been in contact with any other local, state or federal officials about this,” Rachel Strassel said Wednesday. “Since this is a law enforcement issue, we recommend you speak with Sheriff Joseph Lopinto and law enforcement officials in other municipalities across the parish.”
Lopinto’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
At St. Jerome’s Catholic Church people came in and out of the office doors, exchanging greetings and small talk. Gregorian chants flow on low volume from the computer from Father Duarte’s office.
With group activities cancelled, Duarte said he feels apprehensive about Sunday’s mass, because, he said, despite the fear in the community, his parishioners tell them they have faith in God.
“They know that trust in God is everything right now. He’s the only defender they have right now,” he said.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Colorado faces increasing pressure to redraw its congressional districts as other states undertake their own mid-cycle redistricting efforts.
President Donald Trump prompted those efforts with his demand to Republican-run states to ensure a MAGA majority in the U.S. House, a move that exemplifies his contempt for democracy and the will of voters. As red states obey by engaging in partisan gerrymandering, other states are left with no choice but to fight back, since fair play in a rigged game yields the biggest loser.
The debate over mid-cycle redistricting in Colorado, which is allotted eight seats in Congress, was long dominated by a seeming consensus that it couldn’t be done, since the state constitution assigns redistricting responsibility to an independent commission that’s supposed to redraw maps after the once-a-decade census.
But the conversation has shifted.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In August, a pair of Coloradans launched an effort to put on the 2026 ballot a state constitutional amendment that would allow for emergency redistricting in Colorado to restore partisan balance in Congress.
Last month, Phil Weiser, the Democratic Colorado attorney general who is running for governor in 2026, became the first statewide official to support a state constitutional amendment that would allow for emergency redistricting. Since then, the idea has earned the endorsement of other elected officials, such as Democratic U.S. Rep. Jason Crow of Aurora.
Jena Griswold, the Democratic Colorado secretary of state who is running for attorney general, told Newsline this week that she supports the idea of a ballot initiative to allow for emergency redistricting.
“I do not believe that we can allow MAGA to corruptly steal Congress through corrupt redistricting. And I do think that we should pursue, on a very limited basis, redistricting to protect the right to vote and to hold our democracy together,” Griswold said.
After voters in blue California this month adopted a ballot measure to redistrict the state as a Democratic counterbalance to newly gerrymandered Texas and other red states, Gov. Gavin Newsom challenged Colorado by name to follow California’s lead.
Growing favor for emergency redistricting in Colorado invites a close look at the options.
Unlike California, where new maps will be in place for next year’s general election, Colorado could not pursue an emergency redistricting ballot measure until November 2026, and any new maps the effort generates wouldn’t take effect until the 2028 election cycle. By that time Trumpist authoritarianism could have rendered elections themselves irrelevant.
Is there any way Colorado could redistrict in time for next year’s election?
Yes, potentially, in principle.
There is reason to think that the state Legislature, with its Democratic majority, could assert its power to redistrict on its own, without need for voter approval or a state constitutional amendment. That’s because its power comes straight from the U.S. Constitution, which assigns authority over congressional elections, including redistricting, to “the Legislature” of each state. 
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that an independent redistricting commission in Arizona was constitutional, but that was a different time for the court. As Doug Spencer, a law professor at the University of Colorado, noted in an interview with Newsline this week, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote a dissent in the Arizona case that flatly said the independent commission was unconstitutional, and today he leads a conservative majority at the court that could be open to overturning the earlier ruling.
An influential analysis from the UCLA Voting Rights Project on the California redistricting plan also highlighted the primacy of the U.S. Constitution. It distinguished between the California independent redistricting commission’s “responsibility” to redistrict and the legislature’s “power” to redistrict, which arguably remains no matter what responsibilities are delegated to other bodies.
It’s also notable that the Colorado constitution does not explicitly bar mid-cycle redistricting or redistricting by an authority other than the independent commission.
This is all theory. Now for reality.
Spencer said that while there might be a theoretical path for the Colorado Legislature to redistrict the state, too many obstacles likely stand in the way. Primary elections are in June, candidate filing deadlines are in March, and there’s almost certainly too little time for the Legislature to redistrict and sustain the plan through the inevitable court proceedings it would entail. 
“As the deadlines stand now, there’s just no way that all of those things in the courts would take place before those deadlines,” Spencer said.
Even if there were more time, Democratic members of the Legislature would have to weigh the political wisdom of reasserting their redistricting authority. So far there appears to be little appetite for it.
That’s why, even as MAGA redistricting enthusiasts suffer recent setbacks, some Colorado Democrats are coalescing around support for a long-term redistricting plan that depends on the people’s approval.
Griswold said she supported the independent redistricting commission, and a redistricting ballot measure should only be a break-glass-in-an-emergency provision. She thinks it would be worth having in place even if it takes several years.
“I do think there is value in voting on that in ’26 so that it can be used in ’28 if necessary,” she said.

(Getty Images)My sister died of cancer back about five years ago, and for her, it was a battle she bravely waged on two fronts. 
Her struggles were to first, just stay alive, and next to be able to afford having cancer in the United States of America. She knew her cancer was not curable, and she needed to stay alive long enough that hopefully something would come along that would save her, but would she be able to hold out and pay for it?
She endured years of treatments that wracked her body and her finances, and at the time, thankfully, there were provisions in the Affordable Care Act that required insurance companies to treat pre-existing conditions. 
At one of her treatments, she asked what would happen if the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare as many chose to call it, was repealed, because at that time there was a tremendous push in the U.S. Congress by the Republicans to do just that. 
She was told that she would have to pay the approximately $40,000 per month that her treatments cost. Yes, that figure was $40,000 for each monthly treatment!
My sister knew she probably would not beat her cancer, and one thing she was determined to do was leave something to her children when the time came. She did everything in her power to not have to sell her property to get by, and, thankfully, she ended up getting on Social Security Disability. This at least helped relieve her mind that she would not have to sell everything she owned just to survive.
But now, our Republican Congress and president have finally achieved their goal and have decreased the subsidies that helped keep insurance premiums affordable for families that pay for their own insurance policies. 
Another of my sisters, also impacted by cancer, now pays nearly $2,000 a month for her family policy, along with enormous out of pocket expenses. Very few people in Kentucky can afford that, but most of the people we have elected to represent us in Washington seem to think they can.
Spiraling health insurance costs stymie members of US Senate panel

Republicans have offered little that would effectively replace Affordable Care and give people like my sisters more than one-time payments or other short-term fixes. 
Our Kentucky Republican congressional delegation (minus Reps. Massie and Sen. Paul, who both cited the impact on the federal deficit as their reason) supported the bill that reduced health insurance subsidies, and they are all running for their current or higher offices. Thankfully the alarm that has been raised has some in Congress at least talking about what could be done.
Hospitals in Kentucky will be closing because Republicans are slashing Medicaid payments, and the political genius behind this is that the cuts will come after the upcoming midterm elections next year. 
Kentucky hospitals rely heavily on government payments for Medicaid recipients to stay open. There is no question that rural hospitals will close. And, if payments for private insurance policies get high enough, those people will be forced to drop their insurance and just go to hospitals and say, “Ok, treat me. I can’t pay, but I will sue you if you don’t.”
Then those hospitals will be faced with closing as well. Folks, this is the plan that our current leaders have for us.
You can say all you want about Democrats, but they try to keep health care something that the average person can afford. Think about it.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-107713154-1024x579.jpg,,,2025-11-20 05:57:46.963637

On a press call hosted by Protect Our Care, U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, underscored those stakes by recalling the day her daughter was born nine weeks early — a medical emergency she said she only survived financially because she had insurance.
“Ten years ago, my daughter Samantha was born by emergency C-section when my placenta ruptured, and we both nearly died,” McClellan said. Samantha spent six weeks in the NICU, and because she had employer-provided insurance, McClellan said she could focus on recovery “without having to worry about how I was gonna pay those costs.”
That experience, she added, is why she pushed to expand Medicaid and establish Virginia’s state-based exchange as a state legislator — to ensure that “every pregnant woman had the ability to have insurance, so that she could have a healthy pregnancy, a full-term birth, and a healthy child.”
She warned that maternal and infant health outcomes are already worsening. 
“The United States has one of the highest pre-term birth rates in the world,” she said, citing the March of Dimes 2025 scorecard, which again gave the country a D-plus and reported that 10.4% of babies were born preterm. 
Virginia’s rate rose from 9.8% to 10.1%, and “three cities in Virginia earned an F — Virginia Beach, Norfolk, and Richmond,” McClellan said. 
She emphasized that these statistics “are likely going to get worse” as millions face losing coverage from major Medicaid cuts and the expiration of ACA subsidies. If the credits lapse, McClellan said, “106,000 Virginians will drop out of the marketplace, and 47,000 are estimated to remain uninsured, because they won’t be able to get insurance for other needs.”
Families will be forced into impossible decisions, she added. Many pregnant women “will choose to forego prenatal care… because they’ll be forced to choose between health insurance, paying rent, and paying their utility bills.” 
No parent plans for a premature birth, McClellan added: “I certainly didn’t. But it can happen to anybody. We need to make sure that those families are insured. Preterm birth is preventable, but we have to make sure that moms are healthy before they get pregnant and can get the care that they need.”
 As costs rise, so do risks

The ACA’s enhanced premium tax credits have made coverage more affordable for millions since 2021. In Virginia, roughly 400,000 people use the marketplace, and as many as 100,000 could fall off their plans if the credits expire.
Health-care leaders have called the potential fallout “a bit of a tsunami,” warning that premiums could rise 30% to 50% next year.
Advocates on Wednesday’s call said the effects go far beyond monthly bills. 
Deneen Evans, a licensed clinical social worker from Roanoke County who earned a PhD, said her daughter was born prematurely with a severe brain hemorrhage requiring a shunt and months of NICU care. 
“These are lifelong challenges,” she said. Without stable insurance, “these children grow into adults with chronic medical issues.”
Kristen Clardy, a former Virginian now residing in Washington, D.C., said her son’s premature birth generated about $130,000 in medical bills — all covered by insurance. 
Later, marketplace coverage was “actually pretty affordable,” she said, until premiums began to spike. Now she faces an $800 to $900 monthly increase. “My heart breaks for moms who are having to make that choice between healthcare coverage and putting food on the table or gas and keeping their lights on,” Clardy said.
At the federal level, the question is whether to renew the enhanced ACA subsidies. President Donald Trump has urged Republicans not to extend them, arguing in a Nov. 18 Truth Social post that they “only benefit insurance companies,” Axios reported Tuesday. 
Instead, Trump and some GOP lawmakers have floated alternatives, including directing assistance to health-savings accounts or allowing cheaper, less comprehensive plans. Those concepts are currently being drafted into proposals. 
Democrats in Congress — including McClellan — and some Republicans argue the credits must be renewed before year’s end. The debate has become intertwined with broader budget negotiations that resulted in the longest federal government shutdown in the nation’s history. 
 The ripple effect in Virginia

If Congress allows the subsidies to lapse, premiums could jump sharply for families on the exchange. 
Kenda Denia, founder of Birth in Color, said the consequences would fall hardest on Black mothers. She noted Black women are more than twice as likely to die from childbirth as white women, and Black babies are 57% more likely to be born preterm. 
“Approximately 52,000 people lost health insurance between 2023 and 2024, including around 11,500 children,” she said. Without coverage, “fewer expecting moms are getting the prenatal care that they need.”
Maternal mental health advocates also warned of cascading effects. 
Amy Hammond, executive director of Postpartum Support Virginia, said pregnant people with mental health conditions are 50% more likely to give birth prematurely, and mothers of NICU babies have up to a 70% risk of postpartum depression. 
She said higher premiums “are a barrier to accessing adequate care before, during, and after pregnancy, which ultimately cost taxpayers more.”
 Families at the breaking point

For families living paycheck to paycheck, the fight in Washington translates directly into skipped appointments and strained budgets. Clardy said parents like her feel trapped between necessity and affordability. “Those are the real decisions that people are faced with right now,” she said.
Meanwhile, Virginia’s marketplace is already bracing for instability. Some insurers, including Aetna, plan to exit next year, citing uncertainty tied to the subsidies. Nationally, as many as 17 million Americans could lose coverage under Trump-aligned proposals that allow the subsidies to expire,
With the enhanced subsidies set to end Dec. 31, lawmakers say time is running short. 
“Millions more are about to see their health insurance premiums spike beyond their ability to afford when the enhanced premium tax credits under the ACA expire at the end of this year,” McClellan said. ”As a result, the cost of insurance will go up for everybody else.”

(Photo by Nathan Howard/Getty Images)Over the past decade, Virginia has become home to more than 650 data centers — the largest concentration on Earth — including roughly 150 hyperscale facilities operated by Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Meta. Loudoun County alone hosts nearly 200 operating sites, with more than 100 additional facilities in development. 
Regulators and lawmakers are now confronting soaring peak demand and rising grid costs for Virginia ratepayers.  Now is the moment for the commonwealth to adopt a straightforward, market-based solution that delivers more affordable energy and ensures data centers pay their fair share — all for only a modest contribution.
Data center growth has come at a cost. They already consume more than one-quarter of Virginia’s electricity, a share projected to approach half of statewide demand by 2030. Dominion Energy has told regulators that serving this new hyperscale load will require billions of dollars in new generation and transmission infrastructure — costs increasingly passed on to ordinary Virginians through rate hikes.
As it is, Virginia imports roughly 39% of its electricity — more than any other state — according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, buying much of that power at a premium. Options to meet that demand require five to ten or more years of development, whether new natural gas, small modular nuclear, or utility-scale solar. In contrast, small-scale rooftop and ground-mounted solar can be built and interconnected in less than a year.
Since 2010, Virginia’s sales- and use-tax exemption  has provided data-center operators with more than $2 billion in cumulative subsidies, justified as job creation. Yet most jobs were temporary construction work.
We suspected data centers were creating an energy crisis for Virginia. Now it’s official.

The Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC) reported last year that the sector supports about 74,000 jobs statewide, mostly indirect or short-term, while a typical operating facility employs only around 50 full-time workers. In FY 2023 alone, this exemption cost taxpayers $928 million.
 A modest, market-based solution

Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger said it best in her acceptance speech: “Data centers need to pay their fair share.” Virginia can take her message to heart by inviting the industry to make a small, voluntary, high-impact contribution toward the commonwealth’s clean-energy goals and local development.
Here’s the proposal: Data centers would contribute a small percentage of their avoided state sales-tax liability each year toward purchasing Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) under the distributed generation (DG) carve-out for small-scale solar projects operating in Virginia. Each SREC represents one megawatt-hour of solar generation; purchasing them helps finance projects and provides verifiable carbon offsets to the buyer.
The program would support any and all solar systems under 3 MW on public schools, hospitals, community colleges and municipal buildings — projects that lower energy bills and strengthen local economies.
With Democrats in charge, Spanberger targets lower energy bills — and higher costs for data centers

Using JLARC’s FY 2023 figure of $928 million in annual tax savings, a 5% annual contribution would yield about $46 million per year for the purchase of Virginia-generated SRECs — enough to help finance over 500 MW of distributed solar capacity annually to benefit schools and communities.
According to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Jobs and Economic Impact (JEDI) model, this voluntary program would each year:

Leverage $1.1 billion in private-sector investment in distributed solar
Generate more than $700 million in local economic activity
Create over 2,800 good-paying Virginia jobs.

All of this would be achieved without adding a single cent to ratepayer bills, while reducing taxpayer subsidies and helping stabilize Virginia’s solar industry by offsetting the abrupt and disruptive phase-down of federal investment tax credits.
 From additionality to multiplicity

For years, the technology industry has subscribed to what might be called the Gospel of Additionality — the idea that eco-virtue is earned by sourcing the largest and cheapest quantities of clean energy. This approach has sent corporate energy dollars to Texas wind farms and Arizona solar plants while companies continued to draw fossil-based power here in Virginia.
Our modest proposal offers a different creed: Multiplicity — where one small investment multiplies benefits across the commonwealth’s schools, hospitals, and communities.
By purchasing Virginia DG SRECs data-center operators could:

Lower energy costs for public schools, hospitals, and local governments at no capital cost to them
Help offset summer coincident peak demand in the Mid-Atlantic PJM grid area more quickly and affordably than any other generation option
Reduce taxpayer burden by cutting energy costs for public institutions
Avoid ratepayer-funded SREC subsidies through a voluntary, market-based mechanism
Create durable local jobs and workforce training tied to installation, operations and maintenance

A good-neighbor contribution would show that an industry running on public infrastructure can also reinvest in the communities that power it. Data-center operators could help schools, hospitals and small towns across the commonwealth generate clean, affordable solar energy — a sure and equitable way for them to pay their fair share. 
And importantly, this modest proposal is designed to complement, not replace, a longer-term, holistic strategy for meeting Virginia’s energy needs by offering a simple, fast, and low-cost way to buy the commonwealth the time it urgently needs.

RICHMOND, Va. — Advocates for women’s rights, including a state senator, are pushing back against what they deem as “misogynistic” changes to the fitness standards of the U.S. military.
Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced in late September that every job in all branches of the military would be held to the “highest male standard” of physical fitness.
These changes are part of a shift in the culture of the restyled U.S. Department of Defense, which the Trump administration prefers to call the U.S. Department of War. Congress has not acted to officially change the name yet.
Hegseth said that updating fitness standards was necessary to prepare the military to face gathering enemies and growing threats, according to the published transcript.
Hegseth expressed his respect for the contributions of female troops and said the new fitness standards are not intended to exclude women from certain roles. But, if that means no women qualify for some combat jobs, “so be it,” he said.
The Army adopted a revised fitness test, the Army Fitness Test (AFT), in June, which is set to come into effect on Jan. 1, 2026, according to the U.S. Army website. The Air Force instituted a similar new fitness program which will also start on that date, according to the Air Force website.
Kobby Hoffman, president of the Virginia chapter of the National Organization for Women, said she is old enough to remember when women were unable to have credit cards.
Opportunities and rights for women expanded in her lifetime, but the leap forward in gender equality has faced pushback, according to Hoffman.
“History shows that yes, when individuals get more rights, more opportunities, that there usually is a backlash,” Hoffman said. “And this is one big backlash. We always have to be vigilant because laws slip and slide every time a legislature meets.”
If women cannot be on the front line, they may not move up as easily through the military ranks, Hoffman said.
“My family that’s in the military, it’s more than just their upper body strength,” Hoffman said. “It’s about strategic thinking, leadership, diplomacy and avoiding war, respecting other human beings.”
Sen. Jennifer Carroll Foy, D-Prince William, served in her high school’s Junior ROTC and was among the first women to graduate from the Virginia Military Institute.
Hegseth’s speech was intentionally misogynistic and part of a wider culture war the Trump administration is waging against women, Foy said. She predicts this will be costly for America’s national security and reputation.
“I think it’s ironic that we have the least qualified person ever for defense secretary has the gall to question the qualifications of women who have actually met and oftentimes who have exceeded the standards for their job,” Foy said.
Foy noted that women still often have to be twice as good to get half as far.
“I think that that speech was very disrespectful to every person who wears and has worn a uniform,” Foy said.
Foy is using her influence as a politician to combat gender inequality. She is pushing for the U.S. National Archives to recognize Virginia as the 38th state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, which would add a rule to the U.S. Constitution making discrimination based on gender illegal.
“I also think we just have to continue to use our platform to promote the fact that when you have female soldiers who have attained Ranger status, they’ve done that by meeting the same standards as men,” Foy said.
Foy urged women not to give up hope and to fight for equality, even if it feels disheartening to see constitutional rights eroded and civil liberties undermined.
“But at the end of the day, as long as there is forward momentum, then we are winning,” Foy said. “We are making a change and the world is ever evolving and that isn’t going to stop with this administration, as long as we continue to keep our eye on the ball. And the goal is full equality.”
Army ROTC officials declined to comment, despite attempts made in person and via email.

As states strive to curb health insurers’ use of artificial intelligence, patients and doctors are arming themselves with AI tools to fight claims denials, prior authorizations and soaring medical bills.
Several businesses and nonprofits have launched AI-powered tools to help patients get their insurance claims paid and navigate byzantine medical bills, creating a robotic tug-of-war over who gets care and who foots the bill for it.
Sheer Health, a three-year-old company that helps patients and providers navigate health insurance and billing, now has an app that allows consumers to connect their health insurance account, upload medical bills and claims, and ask questions about deductibles, copays and covered benefits.
“You would think there would be some sort of technology that could explain in real English why I’m getting a bill for $1,500,” said cofounder Jeff Witten. The program uses both AI and humans to provide the answers for free, he said. Patients who want extra support in challenging a denied claim or dealing with out-of-network reimbursements can pay Sheer Health to handle those for them.
As AI enters exam rooms, states step up oversight

In North Carolina, the nonprofit Counterforce Health designed an AI assistant to help patients appeal their denied health insurance claims and fight large medical bills. The free service uses AI models to analyze a patient’s denial letter, then look through the patient’s policy and outside medical research to draft a customized appeal letter.
Other consumer-focused services use AI to catch billing errors or parse medical jargon. Some patients are even turning to AI chatbots like Grok for help.
A quarter of adults under age 30 said they used an AI chatbot at least once a month for health information or advice, according to a poll the health care research nonprofit KFF published in August 2024. But most adults said they were not confident that the health information is accurate.
State legislators on both sides of the aisle, meanwhile, are scrambling to keep pace, passing new regulations that govern how insurers, physicians and others use AI in health care. Already this year, more than a dozen states have passed laws regulating AI in health care, according to Manatt, a consulting firm.
“It doesn’t feel like a satisfying outcome to just have two robots argue back and forth over whether a patient should access a particular type of care,” said Carmel Shachar, assistant clinical professor of law and the faculty director of the Health Law and Policy Clinic at Harvard Law School.
“We don’t want to get on an AI-enabled treadmill that just speeds up.”
 A black box

Health care can feel like a black box. If your doctor says you need surgery, for example, the cost depends on a dizzying number of factors, including your health insurance provider, your specific health plan, its copayment requirements, your deductible, where you live, the facility where the surgery will be performed, whether that facility and your doctor are in-network and your specific diagnosis.
Some insurers may require prior authorization before a surgery is approved. That can entail extensive medical documentation. After a surgery, the resulting bill can be difficult to parse.
Witten, of Sheer Health, said his company has seen thousands of instances of patients whose doctors recommend a certain procedure, like surgery, and then a few days before the surgery the patient learns insurance didn’t approve it.










You would think there would be some sort of technology that could explain in real English why I’m getting a bill for $1,500.


– Sheer Health co-founder Jeff Witten 


In recent years, as more health insurance companies have turned to AI to automate claims processing and prior authorizations, the share of denied claims has risen. This year, 41% of physicians and other providers said their claims are denied more than 10% of the time, up from 30% of providers who said that three years ago, according to a September report from credit reporting company Experian.
Insurers on Affordable Care Act marketplaces denied nearly 1 in 5 in-network claims in 2023, up from 17% in 2021, and more than a third of out-of-network claims, according to the most recently available data from KFF.
Insurance giant UnitedHealth Group has come under fire in the media and from federal lawmakers for using algorithms to systematically deny care to seniors, while Humana and other insurers face lawsuits and regulatory investigations that allege they’ve used sophisticated algorithms to block or deny coverage for medical procedures.
Insurers say AI tools can improve efficiency and reduce costs by automating tasks that can involve analyzing vast amounts of data. And companies say they’re monitoring their AI to identify potential problems. A UnitedHealth representative pointed Stateline to the company’s AI Review Board, a team of clinicians, scientists and other experts that reviews its AI models for accuracy and fairness.
“Health plans are committed to responsibly using artificial intelligence to create a more seamless, real-time customer experience and to make claims management faster and more effective for patients and providers,” a spokesperson for America’s Health Insurance Plans, the national trade group representing health insurers, told Stateline.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But states are stepping up oversight.
Arizona, Maryland, Nebraska and Texas, for example, have banned insurance companies from using AI as the sole decisionmaker in prior authorization or medical necessity denials.
Dr. Arvind Venkat is an emergency room physician in the Pittsburgh area. He’s also a Democratic Pennsylvania state representative and the lead sponsor of a bipartisan bill to regulate the use of AI in health care.
He’s seen new technologies reshape health care during his 25 years in medicine, but AI feels wholly different, he said. It’s an “active player” in people’s care in a way that other technologies haven’t been.
“If we’re able to harness this technology to improve the delivery and efficiency of clinical care, that is a huge win,” said Venkat. But he’s worried about AI use without guardrails.
His legislation would force insurers and health care providers in Pennsylvania to be more transparent about how they use AI; require a human to make the final decision any time AI is used; and mandate that they show evidence of minimizing bias in their use of AI.
“In health care, where it’s so personal and the stakes are so high, we need to make sure we’re mandating in every patient’s case that we’re applying artificial intelligence in a way that looks at the individual patient,” Venkat said.
 Patient supervision

Historically, consumers rarely challenge denied claims: A KFF analysis found fewer than 1% of health coverage denials are appealed. And even when they are, patients lose more than half of those appeals.
New consumer-focused AI tools could shift that dynamic by making appeals easier to file and the process easier to understand. But there are limits; without human oversight, experts say, the AI is vulnerable to mistakes.
“It can be difficult for a layperson to understand when AI is doing good work and when it is hallucinating or giving something that isn’t quite accurate,” said Shachar, of Harvard Law School.
States try to rein in health insurers’ claim denials, with mixed results

For example, an AI tool might draft an appeals letter that a patient thinks looks impressive. But because most patients aren’t medical experts, they may not recognize if the AI misstates medical information, derailing an appeal, she said.
“The challenge is, if the patient is the one driving the process, are they going to be able to properly supervise the AI?” she said.
Earlier this year, Mathew Evins learned just 48 hours before his scheduled back surgery that his insurer wouldn’t cover it. Evins, a 68-year-old public relations executive who lives in Florida, worked with his physician to appeal, but got nowhere. He used an AI chatbot to draft a letter to his insurer, but that failed, too.
On his son’s recommendation, Evins turned to Sheer Health. He said Sheer identified a coding error in his medical records and handled communications with his insurer. The surgery was approved about three weeks later.
“It’s unfortunate that the public health system is so broken that it needs a third party to intervene on the patient’s behalf,” Evins told Stateline. But he’s grateful the technology made it possible to get life-changing surgery.
“AI in and of itself isn’t an answer,” he said. “AI, when used by a professional that understands the issues and ramifications of a particular problem, that’s a different story. Then you’ve got an effective tool.”
Most experts and lawmakers agree a human is needed to keep the robots in check.
AI has made it possible for insurance companies to rapidly assess cases and make decisions about whether to authorize surgeries or cover certain medical care. But that ability to make lightning-fast determinations should be tempered with a human, Venkat said.
“It’s why we need government regulation and why we need to make sure we mandate an individualized assessment with a human decisionmaker.”
Witten said there are situations in which AI works well, such as when it sifts through an insurance policy — which is essentially a contract between the company and the consumer — and connects the dots between the policy’s coverage and a corresponding insurance claim.
But, he said, “there are complicated cases out there AI just can’t resolve.” That’s when a human is needed to review.
“I think there’s a huge opportunity for AI to improve the patient experience and overall provider experience,” Witten said. “Where I worry is when you have insurance companies or other players using AI to completely replace customer support and human interaction.”
Furthermore, a growing body of research has found AI can reinforce bias that’s found elsewhere in medicine, discriminating against women, ethnic and racial minorities, and those with public insurance.
“The conclusions from artificial intelligence can reinforce discriminatory patterns and violate privacy in ways that we have already legislated against,” Venkat said.

(Photo courtesy of Revolution Wind)It is no surprise that after months of scapegoating renewables for high power prices, Rhode Island Energy has withdrawn from negotiations with the SouthCoast Wind project. This move prolongs our over-dependence on natural gas, which is the true driving force behind the rising energy costs in Rhode Island and all of New England.
The details of the contract negotiations are unclear and the challenges created by changing federal policies were inevitably a consideration. However, it is clear that given the opportunity, Rhode Island Energy will ignore our state’s climate goals, delay moving to a clean energy future, and keep us hooked on gas.
Rhode Island Energy breaks off contract with SouthCoast Wind amid federal uncertainty

The lack of transparency and accountability surrounding this abortive solicitation follow unfortunate but familiar patterns. While states like Maine and Massachusetts have active targets for offshore wind procurement, our state does not — despite having an ambitious target for economy-wide decarbonization under the 2030 Act on Climate. Therefore Rhode Island Energy suffers no consequences for abandoning contract negotiations. And even when we do have state targets, too often our state government simply allows the utility to ignore them — as it did during the Raimondo administration.
But while our state fails to hold Rhode Island Energy to account, offshore wind projects are being completed and coming online today that should start saving us money next winter. And while the effect is not as pronounced, we still get benefits even when our utility doesn’t have a contract with these projects.
More than half of the turbines at the Vineyard Wind offshore wind plant are already delivering power to the New England grid from the cable landing in Barnstable, Massachusetts. This plant has an average contract price of 8.4 cents per kilowatt-hour over the life of the project, nearly half of the supply price (14.8 cents per kilowatt-hour) that Rhode Island Energy’s residential customers have started to pay in the most recent billing cycle.
In Rhode Island, we won’t see the direct benefit of Vineyard Wind this year, because our power supply is bought in contracts six to 24 months in advance. But we are likely to see savings in the near future, and even more when the Revolution Wind project is complete. Revolution Wind developer Ørsted expects to start delivering power to the New England grid from its delivery point in Quonset in the second half of next year. 










While our state fails to hold Rhode Island Energy to account, offshore wind projects are being completed and coming online today that should start saving us money next winter. 


Revolution Wind’s contract price is 9.8 cents per kilowatt-hour – which is also cheaper than any 6-month spring and summer supply price that we residential customers have been paying for the last three years, and much cheaper than fall and winter supply prices.
But even simple comparisons between contract prices likely underestimate the cost savings that these offshore wind plants offer. Because offshore wind projects have no fuel, they bid into the regional electricity market to deliver power at next to zero, which means that they depress the price paid to other power plants.
Also, the output pattern of offshore wind matches our needs. Most of the power on New England’s wholesale market is sold in one-hour intervals — and these prices ultimately get passed on to us through supply contracts. Power prices are much higher in the morning, the evening, and particularly during cold spells.
Peak use times are when offshore wind delivers by preventing the most expensive power plants from coming online. According to a 2021 study by consultancy DVN-GL, offshore wind tends to generate more in the later afternoon and early evening, when power demand and power prices are rising. Additionally, it has the highest output during the coldest hours of the year.
So while we will see limited benefits this year, we can expect the steel that we are putting in the water now to drive down our power bills next winter, and in winters to come. But if we want to meet our state’s climate targets, do our part to prevent the worst of climate change, and get off the roller coaster of high power prices caused by over-dependence on gas, we will need stronger leadership at the state level. Ultimately, we need leadership to hold Rhode Island Energy to account and stand solidly behind the commitments our state has made.

“No, everybody’s not being made whole. But again, you’re getting, I don’t know what the best figure is — 20 cents, 25 cents on the dollar that you may not have gotten before, so be happy,” NHDES Commissioner Robert Scott said at the meeting.
The settlements
The $45 million discussed Nov. 17 is an initial portion of settlements with the chemical companies 3M and DuPont resulting from a nationwide class-action lawsuit. NHDES expects that these settlements and two others involving the companies Tyco Fire Products LP, Chemguard, Inc., and BASF Corporation will continue to bring remediation funding into the state. Exactly how much remains unclear, PFAS Response Administrator Amy Rousseau said at the meeting.
The companies involved manufactured PFAS, which are also known as “forever chemicals” for the thousands of years they can potentially endure in the environment without breaking down, and firefighting foams that contain either PFAS or dangerous related chemicals. Through the litigation, New Hampshire and other states are seeking damages for the harms caused by PFAS and the firefighting foam, according to a September press release from the New Hampshire Department of Justice.
The settlements will be paid out in several phases, but New Hampshire expects to receive about $56 million during the first phase, according to the release. About $45 million of that total is estimated to be available for distribution after litigation costs and attorney’s fees are paid, according to NHDES; however, NHDES and the New Hampshire Department of Justice are not set to be paid from the funds, according to information provided by NHDES Nov. 17. 
The state expects to have about $26 million in hand by the end of the year, Rousseau said at the meeting; the rest of the approximately $45 million will follow in coming years. The exact amounts of future disbursements aren’t yet clear, according to NHDES, and payments will likely come in installments. Additionally, down the line, New Hampshire could see another $6 million to $10 million from settlements still in litigation, according to the September press release. 
Private homeowners across the state have also made significant investments in water treatment systems. But these settlements deal exclusively with public water supplies and can be applied only to public systems, said Rousseau.
New Hampshire waterways, residents affected
PFAS released into the environment contaminate soils and groundwater. The chemicals have been linked to health impacts including some cancers, decreased fertility, hormonal imbalance, immune system depression, obesity, and developmental delays, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
Contamination is present at sites around New Hampshire, and concern about potential effects is, too. A type of kidney cancer previously linked to PFAS exposure is about 38% more common in Merrimack than in the rest of New Hampshire, a preliminary Dartmouth study concluded in October. That study did not assess causality, but researchers noted that PFAS are much more concentrated in the Merrimack area than in many other areas across the state. NHDES has said much of that contamination came from the former Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics plant, and legislators and advocates from the area contend that area residents suffer health consequences from the plant’s pollution. 
While research into the true extent of PFAS-related health concerns is ongoing, for two major types of PFAS chemicals called PFOA and PFOS, there is no level of exposure that does not entail at least some risk to human health, according to the EPA.
Making contaminated water safe again is costly
Water supplies where PFAS are detected must be treated to comply with EPA and state guidelines. Removing PFAS contamination from groundwater is intensive and costly. Public water system administrators around the state who have discovered PFAS in their supply have invested significantly in technology to make their water safe to drink.
In Merrimack, where water from public wells was found to contain PFAS above allowable levels, the Merrimack Village District has invested heavily in filtration systems that use activated carbon to remove the chemicals. The installation of treatment facilities for four wells has cost the district about $14.5 million, according to the district’s website; this included allocations from the district’s budget as well as state revolving funds, loans, and grants, business manager and water quality specialist Jill Lavoie said in an email. 
Distributing the funds
NHDES will consider factors including the type of water system, severity of PFAS contamination, water usage, and source capacity to determine how much of the settlement funding to award each recipient, according to a document provided at the Nov. 17 meeting.
The department broke remediation projects across the state into several categories for the purposes of designating settlement funds. 
The first group includes projects that have previously been awarded NHDES funding or are currently underway with funding from NHDES. Systems that have completed grant-funded projects will not be paid out, because they have already been funded, Rousseau said. Projects that received NHDES loans, however, will see their PFAS settlement dollars applied to the outstanding balance of their loan.
In total, this first category encompasses 47 water systems and about $18 million in projected settlement dollars, according to Rousseau. 
The second category includes public water supplies that NHDES considers likely to need remediation action in the future, based on water quality sampling data. This includes 42 community water systems that currently exceed EPA limits for PFAS, which NHDES estimates will receive about $14.7 million for remediation projects. The category also includes 38 community water systems with PFAS levels approaching EPA limits and 112 water systems that are not expected to exceed the limits; these groups together are estimated to receive about $11.2 million. 
The disbursements are not expected to cover the total amount that municipalities have expended on PFAS remediation, Scott said.
Unallocated funds can be applied to broader PFAS initiatives statewide, according to NHDES. The department has also expended more than a million dollars to collect data and prepare the claims, Scott said; when future disbursements are released, he said, the agency can be reimbursed for that expenditure.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0124-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-20 05:57:46.963637

Marjorie Taylor Greene recently apologized during a CNN interview for her role in the country's ""toxic politics.""   Greene is pictured here at a press conference this week in Washington. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)The lines that separate truth from falsehood, reality from fantasy, have become so smeared in recent years that democracy itself becomes difficult. Edgar Allen Poe, and later the Temptations, gave us the motto for our times:
“Believe half of what you see, and none of what you hear.”
But which half to believe? We’re now witnessing the introduction of high-quality, AI-driven deep-fake videos into Georgia politics, which makes it even harder to tell. 
For example, the other day I saw a clip that depicted U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene saying the following:
“I would like to say, humbly, I’m sorry for taking part in the toxic politics. It’s very bad for our country. It’s something I’ve thought about a lot, especially since Charlie Kirk was assassinated.  I’m committed, and I’ve been working on this a lot lately, to put down the knives in politics. I really just want to see people be kind to one another. As Americans, we have far more in common than we have differences, and we have to be able to respect each other in our disagreements.”
Was that real, or was it an AI deep fake? I’m told that it’s real, but I’m also told to believe none of what I hear, so ….
One way to approach that question is to first ask what we mean by “real.” If by real you mean did it actually happen, yes, it’s real. Greene actually said those words. She’s saying similar things quite a bit these days, to such an extent that she and Donald Trump are publicly exchanging charges that the other person has become a traitor.
But is it real in terms of a sudden change of heart, a transformation by Greene from vicious culture warrior to a champion of peace, love and understanding?
No. It is not. 
What we’re seeing is Greene’s reaction to being told the obvious by Trump and other top Republicans, that she has no future in politics beyond representing Georgia’s 14th Congressional District. She didn’t like to hear that, and what she now frames as enlightenment is better understood as just a different manifestation of the resentment and frustration that has fueled her entire political career.
It’s important to remember that as far back as 2023, Greene was publicly musing about her future as U.S. senator, governor or even higher. “I have a lot of things to think about,” she told a reporter back then. “Am I going to be a part of President Trump’s Cabinet if he wins? Is it possible that I’ll be VP?”
Girl, no.
Don’t get me wrong, Greene does have some gifts as a politician, chief among them her instinct for the swings and sways of popular opinion within MAGA. That’s at play here too. It’s no accident that she has dared to divorce herself from Trump at a moment when he has become vulnerable. The economy is shaky, his immigration policy is unpopular, the poll numbers are bad and his bizarre mishandling of the Epstein case has made even close allies nervous. Greene seems to sense that if a door has been slammed in her face, fate may be opening a window.
And of course, we have an actual case of deep-fake video in Georgia, created through artificial intelligence, in the U.S. Senate race between incumbent Jon Ossoff and a handful of Republican challengers. U.S. Rep. Mike Collins, the frontrunner in the race for the GOP nomination, has released a video in which a deep-fake Ossoff can be heard – and seen –telling voters that he just doesn’t care about the impact of the recent government shutdown on farmers, that his only concern is his out-of-state donors..
It looks real. It sounds real. And given the regrettable gullibility of American voters, at least some of them are likely to take it as real. The Ossoff campaign condemned the video, pledging never to produce deep fakes of its own, while Collins dismisses any such concerns. 
“It’s just new technology, a new way to campaign, and you’re going to see a lot more of that out there,” he said.
Politics has never been a particularly truthful endeavor, but even then, fake quotes and fake photos have always been considered unacceptable distortions. Like a lot of people these days, the Collins campaign appears to believe that technology voids all those rules. They are living an approach that Trump has driven home, and that MAGA has fully embraced: If the rules and the norms get in the way of victory, screw the rules and the norms, and never ever apologize for doing so. If it works, if there’s no voter backlash to Collins’ actions, then yes, we will see a lot more of it.
Down that road lies chaos, though, and I’m hopeful that the American patience for chaos is running pretty thin these days.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2247292479-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-20 05:57:46.963637

(Photo by Maine Morning Star)Arundel resident Emily Ingwersen is looking at an increase of $1,400 per month to continue her family’s health insurance coverage next year if the tax credit they receive isn’t extended by Congress. 
“It’s pretty scary no matter how you slice it,” she said of weighing the risks of a plan with less coverage or taking on the higher expense.
Ingwersen, a mother of two, and her husband receive health insurance through the state’s marketplace. Together they run Ginger Hill Design + Build, a construction company that specializes in energy efficient homes, which they’ve been able to take risks to grow because of more affordable insurance coverage, Ingwersen said. 
The expiration of the subsidies that Ingwersen, along with just over 54,000 Mainers and millions of people across the country, currently receive was the key issue behind the federal government shutdown. After 43 days, the longest shutdown in U.S. history, the government reopened, but the deal to do so did not address the tax credits. 
Democrats had held out support of a GOP stopgap measure because it didn’t address skyrocketing premiums for individual health care plans, while Republicans insisted those talks had to occur when the government was open. But seven centrist Senate Democrats and one independent, Angus King of Maine, ultimately broke with party leaders to advance a reworked spending package to end the shutdown that didn’t address health care. 
Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) has pledged to hold a vote on the subsidy the first week of December, though House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has not made such a promise. Meanwhile, the Senate Finance Committee began more broad discussions about how to address rising health care costs on Wednesday. 
Spiraling health insurance costs stymie members of US Senate panel

Back in Maine, Ingwersen and many others are seeing just how high their insurance costs could become. Currently, she pays $1,200 per month after the roughly $500 credit. Based on an estimate provided by her insurance portal, she will be paying $2,600 per month next year to maintain the same level of coverage. That change amounts to about a 117% increase. 
“It’s more than our mortgage,” Ingwersen said of the new anticipated cost. 
Health insurance marketplaces first began in 2014 after President Barack Obama passed the Affordable Care Act in an effort to make coverage more affordable. Congress provided tax credits for people making low and moderate incomes and in 2021 increased the subsidy and expanded eligibility. It’s the enhanced tax credits that will go away if Congress does not act. 
That would have a direct, immediate impact on people like Ingwersen. But eventually, policy experts say, it will impact everyone in the interconnected health insurance market. 
Weighing risks 
Andrew Volk, owner of the Portland bar Hunt & Alpine, didn’t have insurance for most of his 20s while he was working in restaurants because of high costs. 
“There just wasn’t the possibility to buy anything beyond catastrophic insurance, really anything reasonable,” Volk said of trying to afford insurance before the ACA. Eligibility for catastrophic plans are also generally limited to people who are under 30 years old. “I never was able to figure out how to buy anything until the marketplace came along.”
With that change, Volk at 29 years old was able to afford insurance, eliminating at least one of the many risks with opening a small business, he said. 
“I don’t think I would have opened the business without it,” Volk said of the marketplace. 
Shortly after the bar opened, Volk’s now-ex wife gave birth to their daughter, a process that ended up being complicated. If they hadn’t had insurance through the marketplace, Volk said, “I don’t think the business would have made it past its first year.”
Volk, now 41, said the risk he took in his 20s not having insurance worked out, but he doesn’t recommend it. Neither does Shawna Ackley, a cancer survivor who in September traveled to Washington, D.C., with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network to urge Congress to extend the subsidies. 
As she continues to write to her members of Congress urging an extension, she thinks about her own experience navigating the health care industry after discovering a lump in her breast as a 38-year-old new mom, and how different it would have been without insurance. 
Like Volk, Ackley fell into the category of people — young, otherwise healthy — who may opt to forgo health insurance given the steep premium hikes.

“If there’s these high health care costs, people are going to have to make tough decisions,” Ackley said, “and then, heaven forbid, something happens.” 
She also worries that without health care, people will miss chances for early detention or delay treatment because of costs. 
Ackley gets insurance through her husband’s job, not the marketplace, but she also cautioned that if anyone loses their health care she could eventually be impacted too. 
System impacts 
Enrollment in the marketplace has more than doubled since the introduction of the enhanced premium tax credits, with the majority of those people receiving the subsidy. If they’re not extended, “The bottom line is, and something that nobody is refuting: people are going to lose coverage,” said Anna Howard, a policy development principal specializing in health insurance plans at American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. 
Looking at it systemically, it’s also not a good idea to have a lot of people uninsured, Howard said. 
One issue has to do with a fundamental part of the U.S. health care system: risk pools. Premiums are determined based on average expected health care expenses of the entire group in the marketplace, so pooling risks together allows the higher costs of the less healthy to be offset by the lower costs of the healthy. 
“If the enhanced tax credits are allowed to go away, then you’re going to lose young, healthy people from the marketplace coverage,” Howard said. “But the people who are going to stay behind are more likely going to be the older, sicker people who are like, ‘I don’t really have a choice. I know that I need health insurance coverage because I have XYZ conditions.’”
In turn, Howard said, that would lead to increased premiums for those left in the marketplace. 
Another issue that could arise if more people are uninsured is increased reliance on emergency rooms as de facto health care settings, which would not only crowd emergency services but also increase costs for hospitals, Howard said. 
In Maine, hospitals are already strained with high debt, aging infrastructure and post-pandemic recovery challenges, with some on the brink of closure due to Medicaid cuts made through the GOP spending bill over the summer. 
Mainers are also thinking about implications for the economy. Volk no longer relies on the marketplace for insurance as he now has enough employees to get a private insurance small group plan. He said he hopes Congress extends the subsidies in part because they are a means to take care of people, but “this also helps the fundamental business underpinnings of our economy.” 
“It helped me create jobs,” he said, “and taking it away is going to worsen conditions for small business owners and job creators to do what they do best.”
The solutions Mainers want
Ackley said she wants lawmakers to fund the subsidies long-term. She worries a short-term extension, even for a year, would cause harm to current and future cancer patients because of possible disruptions to affordable health care, she said. 
“The last thing that you want to think about is how you’re going to afford insurance or having to navigate insurance [changes] when you’re in the middle of treatment,” Ackley said. 
Other Mainers who Maine Morning Star spoke with are thinking beyond the subsidies. 
Stonington resident Julie Moringello, a cancer survivor, mother and self-employed artist, gets insurance through the marketplace, but her income is low enough that the removal of the enhanced tax credits won’t impact her. 
Amid government funding battle, Mainers call on Congress to provide health care stability

Moringello pays $319 per month for coverage for herself and her daughter but that’s not a complete picture of her health care expenses. 
Moringello sees doctors several times each year for regular bloodwork and scans to make sure she hasn’t had a recurrence. Given that, Moringello said she always meets her $8,500 deductible, so she actually pays more than $12,000 per year.  
“But it really hasn’t even started paying for my care,” she said. “I mean it protects me from a disaster, if I had a recurrence or something like that, but basically that’s coming entirely out of my pocket.” 
She wants the U.S. to adopt a universal health care system. So does Ingwersen, whose husband is from Canada, which has such a system funded through taxes. 
“I think our government should just provide health care like every other developed country,” Ingwersen said.  
Ingwersen and Moringello both want Congress to address the problem at its root. 
As grateful as Moringello is for the changes that resulted from the ACA, she said it is not perfect, and that the subsidies are a Band-Aid on a broken system. 
“But at the same time, we need them,” she said, “We’re in this terrible position.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4886-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-20 04:57:18.187032

The cost-saving move also feels like state-sponsored greedflation, writes Huascar Medina. (Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)After Nov. 12, the penny will no longer be minted as a form of legal tender. The reasons cited included the reported cost to mint a single penny, which is 3.69 cents. Every time the treasury minted a penny, we lost 2.69 cents. In fiscal year 2024, the U.S. Mint produced 3.2 billion pennies. The U.S. Mint reported losing $85.3 million that year in the production of the penny.
Benjamin Franklin, who coined the phrase “a penny saved is a penny earned,” designed the original American penny, known as the Fugio Cent, in 1787. The message on the coin was “Mind Your Business,” and on the reverse side, “We are One” was encircled by a chain of 13 links, representing the original 13 colonies. “We are One” later became the motto “E Pluribus Unum” on the one-cent piece.
The first official one-cent piece was minted early in our nation’s history by the newly established U.S. Mint, located in Philadelphia, in 1793, following the passage of the Coinage Act of 1792. They originally minted over 11,000, and Thomas Jefferson oversaw the U.S. Mint until a director was appointed. The penny is a piece of U.S. history, a symbol of the establishment of our great republic, and to see it disappear so unceremoniously is a cheap way to go out.
The penny is part of popular culture. In 1936, American footwear brand G.H. Bass introduced the Weejun, considered the first penny loafer mass-marketed in the United States. The shoe became known as the “penny loafer” in the 1950s, when college students would tuck a penny into the shoe’s front strap, or “vamp,” as a fashion statement, for good luck, and supposedly as an emergency backup to make phone calls at pay phones. The price of a pay phone in the ’50s ranged from 5 to 10 cents, so a pair of penny loafers wouldn’t get you very far.
I have owned a pair of penny loafers since before I could walk. I’ve been wearing penny loafers for over 40 years. Something else I owned growing up in the 1980s were Penny Racers, miniature toy cars that you pulled back to wind up. They could perform a wheelie when released if a penny was inserted into the slot on their back while racing. The Penny Racer was initially created by the Japanese toy company Takara in 1978 under the Choro-Q brand. It made its U.S debut in 1981. They were marketed as “a different breed of speed.”
It may sound like I’m delving into nostalgia, but the loss of the penny has ramifications that extend beyond my childhood. Wishing wells are littered with the pennies from well-wishers. Wells were seen as sacred and divine gifts. Even modern water fountains have been transformed into wishing wells, an echo of an ancient tradition that spans multiple cultures, where a coin was thrown into them for a wish. In the United States, you could offer a penny in exchange for a wish — any wish you could imagine.
When we run out of pennies or hoard them into oblivion, that well is going to cost you at least a nickel per wish, which brings me to the part that I haven’t seen reported by the media, yet. Are we rounding up or down for the cost of items that are not in increments of 5 cents at businesses? Things will always cost at least 5 cents moving forward. I thought affordability was an issue, and this feels like state-sponsored greedflation.

South Euclid-Lyndhurst Schools and Westerville City Schools don’t have much in common. 
While the students in the South Euclid-Lyndhurst School District are majority Black, that’s not the case for residents, especially in Lyndhurst which is overwhelmingly white. 
Westerville is an increasingly diverse district that straddles Franklin and Delaware County. 
We both passed school levies despite constant attacks on public education from a group of powerful Ohio politicians.
Most Ohioans want the best for our state’s children – even if we don’t have any of our own. 
We understand that strong public schools keep our neighborhoods vibrant. 
We know it just doesn’t pass the smell test when politicians try to blame the property tax squeeze on public schools. 
After all, they created the problem in the first place by slashing school funding to give handouts to big corporations and their wealthy political donors.
In most years, only about half of school levies pass. This year two-thirds succeeded. 
In Westerville, 57% of Delaware County voters and two-thirds of Franklin County voters supported a 0.75% income tax to fund the district’s basic operating expenses like staff, programs and materials. 
Just last year, voters defeated Westerville’s combined capital bond and operating levy. 
In South Euclid-Lyndhurst, 58% of voters approved a 7.9 mil property tax levy to fund building repairs and day-to-day expenses.
Both campaigns had a clear message to voters: These levies are essential to fund the programs and people that prepare our children to succeed. It’s up to us to fund our schools because the state isn’t coming to save us.  
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Ohio Speaker of the House Matt Huffman and Ohio Senate President Rob McColley pushed through a 2026-27 state budget that underfunded public schools by $2.8 billion but gave a $1.68 billion tax cut to the wealthiest 20% of Ohioans and $2.5 billion to unaccountable private schools through the voucher program. 
They even handed over $600 million of our unclaimed funds to their billionaire political donors, the owners of the Cleveland Browns, for a new stadium in Brook Park.
South Euclid-Lyndhurst and Westerville were hit hard by the last state budget. 
Most lawmakers voted to abandon the Fair School Funding Plan which would have finally ensured the state contributes its fair share of what it costs to educate children in every district. 
Under the 2026-27 budget South Euclid-Lyndhurst had its funding cut by $727,941 and Westerville by $935,352. 
Under the Fair School Funding Plan, South Euclid-Lyndhurst would have received an additional $3.68 million and Westerville just over $6 million, according to Policy Matters Ohio. 
Years of state tax cuts have forced school districts to ask more of local residents.
A recent study showed that Ohio has the eighth highest property tax rates, but the 45th share of state funding for public education in the nation. 
State lawmakers are pumping out a slew of ill-informed property tax proposals — most of which would provide negligible relief to homeowners but would further defund our public schools.
Speaker Huffman and Senate President McColley hope Ohioans will blame teachers, principals, and superintendents. 
But they’re leaving out the part about how they force local communities to make up the difference by slashing public school funding so they can give kickbacks to their wealthy friends and donors.
At a time when people are collecting signatures to abolish property taxes and lawmakers are proposing one half-baked property tax bill after another — it seemed like this could be a tough election for school levies. 
Instead, it was the opposite. 
But Ohioans won’t let a few greedy politicians trick us into carrying water for their billionaire donors. 
This election we called their bluff. 
Now it’s time to demand real solutions: like full and fair funding for our public schools.

On the Democratic side, the competitors are former Pinellas County Republican U.S. Rep. David Jolly, now pursuing the Charlie Crist party-switch path; and Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings, a former police chief and sheriff.
As if those six weren’t enough, there’s an independent candidate, Miami Sen. Jason Pizzo, a former Democrat who’s announced he’s running, too.
Generally speaking, seeing seven candidates seeking the Governor’s Mansion could be a sign of how big a disaster the sitting occupant has been.
The Ron DeSantis administration is being investigated by a Leon County grand jury in the Hope Florida scandal. He’s under scrutiny for voting to give $83 million to a campaign contributor in exchange for 4 acres of Destin land nobody wanted. His proposal to build golf courses in a state park last year was so deeply unpopular that the Legislature passed a law this year to prevent him or his successors from ever trying to do it again.
Note that two of the three episodes involve DeSantis’ horrible handling of environmental issues. That’s why, I think, every chance we get in the next 12 months, we voters ought to quiz his would-be replacements about where they stand on that segment of the state’s responsibilities.
As we have seen repeatedly, the environment in Florida IS the economy. The two are as inextricably intertwined as the tangled roots of a mangrove forest.
Dirty water
When DeSantis was first elected in 2018, Florida voters were concerned about toxic algae blooms that had lasted for months. DeSantis swore he’d cure this by appointing a panel of scientists to tell him about what to do.
He appointed the panel  — but then he and the Legislature failed to follow most of its recommendations.
Now Florida is the No. 1 state for polluted lakes. A toxic algae bloom killed off so much seagrass in the Indian River Lagoon that more than 1,000 manatees starved to death. Florida’s longest river, the St. Johns, is coping with steadily increasing pollution from septic waste.

Even when the Legislature passed a law ordering special protections for our iconic springs, the agencies answering to DeSantis ignored it, noted Grant Gelhardt of the Sierra Club.
Instead of attacking pollution sources, DeSantis cut a deal to pay millions of dollars to an Israeli company that dumps a hydrogen peroxide mix into algae-tainted waterways. But then the algae comes back and the Israelis have to do it over. Even the head of the Israeli company thinks this is futile.
“DeSantis’ fight against algal blooms in Florida will fail,” he wrote on X, back when it was just plain Twitter. “There is no question that preventing raw sewage and runoffs from spilling into waterways must be addressed.”
So, the first question everyone should ask the gubernatorial candidates is: What will you do to fix Florida’s rampant water pollution problems?
Lake O woes
I had a lengthy chat about this with Gil Smart of the Vote Water organization, who pointed out that Lake Okeechobee in particular needs help.
Gil Smart via Vote Water
It was recently named the dirtiest lake in the U.S. Things have gotten so bad there that Bass Masters removed Lake O from its Top Ten Bass Lakes in the United States.
Rather than clamp down on polluters poisoning Lake O and other waterways, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection has set up a series of voluntary “basin management action plans” that all fail, Smart said.
“That’s the state’s main tool for reducing pollution and it’s not working,” he said. “At what point do we stop saying, ‘Oh, that’s a shame,’ and start doing something about it?”
The polluters tend to be big campaign contributors, which guarantees they’re left alone. But the pollution is taking an economic toll on our tourism, fishing, and other industries, so whoever takes over from DeSantis will need to make some hard choices.
Byron Donalds at his secret water summit, via Facebook with permission
Last year, Donalds convened a water summit that matched polluters with regulators — and refused to allow in either the press or the public. If he opened the meeting to everyone, Donalds argued, the poor polluters and the people regulating them would be too scared to talk honestly.
To me, “honest talk” between polluters and regulators is less important than letting the public — the people paying the tax bills and drinking the water —- know what’s going on.
But that leads to our second question for the candidates.
On the downlow
DeSantis clearly missed his calling. Instead of politics, he should’ve gone into espionage. 
He persuaded the Legislature to make his travel records a state secret, even though no governor ever sought such a Sunshine Law exemption. He held a Cabinet meeting in a foreign country, ensuring most Floridians couldn’t participate. Even worse, he’s repeatedly cut non-public deals to give away public land to private interests.
First came his attempt to allow a company to build three golf courses in Jonathan Dickinson State Park, plus hotels and pickleball courts in other parks. That blew up in his face like a hand grenade.
Then he attempted to swap land from the Withlacoochee State Forest with a Canadian golf course builder. An uproar ensued and the land went unswapped.
More recently, he wanted to give some mystery developer 600 acres from the Guana River Wildlife Management Area. Once the public found out, the developer melted back into the shadows.
Each instance of DeSantis trying to keep things on the downlow led to widespread outrage. People love Florida’s preserves, and they don’t like seeing some ploy to give them away.
That’s why I think the next question for the candidates has to be: Will you treat public land like it’s owned by the public, and not as your personal property to benefit friends?
We want to return to the days when our precious state parks, preserves,, and forests stayed public and stayed natural.
This leads to the one area where DeSantis almost came across as a good guy.
Undermining the Everglades
For 25 years, when Florida politicians wanted to fool the voters into thinking they liked the environment, they talked about restoring the Everglades.
“I pledge to spend millions on restoration of the River of Grass,” they’d promise solemnly. What they really meant was, “I’ll hand over millions in tax dollars to well-connected contractors to build what the plans call for, but I won’t do it fast and they’ll take their time, too.”
That’s why the Everglades restoration has gone billions over budget and years beyond its original deadline.
But not even the most cynical would have built a new pollution source like an immigrant detention camp in the Big Cypress National Preserve. That would undercut all the restoration work that’s already been done.
Yet DeSantis did it, and without even checking its environmental impact.
Environmental groups accused him of betraying the Glades. But DeSantis scoffed at being considered an Everglades villain, considering all the money he’d steered toward the River of Grass.
“You’re talking about the guy who’s plowed how much money into Everglades restoration?” DeSantis said.
That’s sort of like him saying, “I’ve spent a lot of money on a fancy car, so you should respect my automotive expertise — even though I’ve just dumped a bag of sugar in the gas tank.”
Lawsuits are working their way through federal court to shut this camp down.
Eve Samples via Friends of the Everglades
I contacted one of the plaintiffs: Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades, the organization co-founded by Marjory Stoneman Douglas. I asked her what she would ask the candidates to replace DeSantis. Her answer:
“Will you commit to banning all harmful development from the Everglades that undermines the billion-dollar restoration project?”
That should cover not only the prison camp known as “Alligator Alcatraz,” she said, but also a rock mine being pushed by Big Sugar and various residential and commercial developments that have been steadily chomping away at the margins.
“You can’t be an Everglades governor and allow development in the Everglades,” she said.
Which leads to the next question.
Developer-Santis
DeSantis has never met a developer he didn’t like. He’s signed every bill they supported. He’s backed controversial developments so often, I started calling him “Developer-Santis.”
Did the developers want expensive toll roads to spread urban sprawl throughout rural areas? Despite widespread objections, DeSantis said yes to that.
Even when a project would make hurricane evacuation much worse, he didn’t support saving the lives of Floridians. Instead, he voted to say yes to the developer.
And if any local government failed to kowtow to developers, he’s been eager to force them into compliance.’
The result of putting the developers in the driver’s seat is that growth is careening out of control, leaving our sewer systems overloaded, our water systems running dry and our roads crowded and crumbling.
Lots of Floridians are becoming fed up with this unwavering governmental support of sprawl-over-all. They want a change. That’s especially true in our remaining rural areas, where people like living at a slower pace.
So, the next question I would ask the candidates is: Will you stand up to developers and tell them no? Will you stick up for saving some parts of Florida as rural? Will you commit to keeping these slices of paradise the way they are?
If they do it even once, that’s better than DeSantis.
Last but not least, let’s talk about science.
The anti-scientist
While I was talking to Gerhardt of the Sierra Club, he told me, “Science should be in the forefront of any plan to protect Florida’s resources.” Who could argue with that?
Our governor would. In the future, DeSantis will be remembered as the most virulently anti-science governor ever.
During the pandemic, he became such a contrarian to the medical establishment that he actually scolded teenagers for wearing masks .  
He’s also appointed people who were anti-science, like an anti-vaxxer surgeon general. And consider his wildlife commissioners, who are so eager to shoot bears that they ignored that the science shows the bear population has declined.
He was cool with signing a new law based on the thoroughly debunked conspiracy theory about “chemtrails.” Meanwhile, even though signs of climate change are obvious everywhere in Florida, he approved legislation to remove that term from most of state law. He had the full support of Speaker Renner on that one, by the way.
Surprisingly, ignoring climate change does not make it go away. We will continue facing soaring temperatures and rising sea levels that affect everything from the intensity of hurricanes to the frequency of expensive beach renourishment.
So, I think it’s fair to ask the candidates if they believe in following what science says about solutions. Or would they prefer Florida continue relying on folk tales, internet rumors, and ancient superstitions?
I think we need to pin these guys down now. Otherwise, they’re liable to try try to top DeSantis. Look for them to start building a fire circle in front of the Capitol, dancing around and chanting gibberish to placate the angry hurricane god,

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-20 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Fiscal guardrails mask CT’s revenue needs,William Buhler,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/20/fiscal-guardrails-mask-cts-revenue-needs/,"CT has been disinvesting in housing, education and other core programs because the state has an $88 billion pension liability to pay off.","Over the last few years Connecticut had the good fortune to receive unusually high capital gains tax receipts.  This allowed Gov. Ned Lamont to put $4.1 billion into a “rainy day fund” and $8.6 billion into pension debt repayment. 
But while some celebrated, others disapproved because urgent needs to fully fund education and build affordable housing were again being shortchanged.
This spring $2.4 billion in urgent legislative funding requests were denied, requests for funding eroded by multiple years of inflation. K12 education has been losing $407 million each year since 2017 due to inflation even though the governor called current funding the “largest ever commitment.” According to Joe DeLong, CEO of the Connecticut Council of Municipalities,  these cuts in real funding have contributed to 119,000 youths who are not engaged in school or work. They have problems of mental health/addiction, poverty or homelessness and need counseling, vocational instruction and career planning to get back on their feet.
Connecticut has been disinvesting in housing, education and other core programs because the state has an $88 billion pension liability to pay off and doesn’t collect enough revenue to manage this, fully fund its core programs and invest in its future. According to Wade Gibson of the CT Voices for Children Fiscal Policy Center, “Connecticut state and local government raises and spends less per dollar of personal income than almost any other state.”
Governor Lamont often disseminates upbeat news about the state’s economy. In his 2025 State of the State Address he said “we’re doubling our commitment to housing.” That seems reassuring except that we’re around 90,000 units short of what we need to facilitate job growth. A report by Jacqueline Rabe Thomas and Alex Putterman reveals investment in state subsidized housing has declined before and during the current governor’s administration. We should have been increasing investment in housing more than a decade ago but we were too caught up with the idea of balancing the budget as an end in itself. The governor makes us feel good with his upbeat remarks, but they gloss over the depth of the state’s economic challenges.
What are those challenges? 
For one, job growth. Jobs can’t be filled because job seekers can’t find affordable places to live.  According to Don Klepper-Smith, Chief Economist for Datacore, during the last 14 years the nation’s economy expanded by 38% but Connecticut’s economy grew by only 10%.  Had we invested more in housing and other core priorities we could be enjoying substantial job growth and more revenue as a return on investment. Instead, we’ve lost ground;  An analysis by CT Voices for Children “The State of Working Connecticut 2024” notes that “The state’s disparities in GDP and job growth, in comparison to the national average, have cost Connecticut billions of dollars in unrealized tax revenue and 248,000 potential jobs since 2007.”
After receiving recent higher capital gains tax receipts, Governor Lamont denied Connecticut has a revenue problem.  Yet this particular revenue could not be used to properly fund housing, education or other core priorities due to the volatility guardrail, one of three interlocking fiscal controls. Together they slow-walk the process of raising, appropriating and spending revenue, effectively blocking efforts to raise or direct new revenue. This result aligns with the governor’s staunch opposition to seeking more revenue from top income residents.
A few years ago Massachusetts passed a 4% surtax on income over $1 million. It brought in enough revenue to offer free community college for those 25 and over, build new transportation projects, pay for road and bridge repairs, create new bicycle lanes and pay for free school lunches.
But Connecticut’s fiscal guardrails block us from following Massachusetts’ example.  The volatility guardrail funnels all revenue from capital gains taxes to the Budget Reserve fund, also known as the rainy day fund.  After filling the rainy day fund, all remaining revenue of this type is used to pay down the unfunded pension liability and other debt.
Could Connecticut raise income or sales taxes to generate more revenue? Yes, but the spending guardrail limits the growth of the budget to ”the average percent increase in personal income over the previous five years or to the previous year’s inflation.”  The impact of new revenue on the budget would accordingly be muted in any given year.
Finally, there’s a revenue guardrail which requires appropriations not to exceed the current year’s revenue forecast. Due to these three fiscal guardrails there is no way to raise significant new revenue that could be spent in any reasonable timetable unless the governor declares an emergency.
People looking for positive economic news may be encouraged that Connecticut’s economy grew 4.6% during the second quarter of 2025. There were increased profits in manufacturing, finance and insurance and personal income grew by 6.4% and 6.3% in the first two quarters. As a measure of increased value of goods and services this indicates economic growth.
Does this growth mean Connecticut’s economy is in good shape?  No, because job growth is still in a holding pattern and the income gains are not broad-based.  We’re in a K-shaped economy in which the top 20% gains income while everyone else’s wages shrink due to inflation. Recent articles describe how 40% of households are struggling to get by, how Connecticut is lagging the nation in job growth, how the cost of living here is 13% higher and how families are finding the state unaffordable.
Besides the obstacles imposed by the guardrails, inflation and the growing income gap, inequitable property tax rates reduce spendable income for a broad swath of low- and middle-income households. Property tax rates are under the sole control of municipalities, and those filled with high value properties and corresponding low mill rates have a disincentive to approve land use for affordable housing. This exclusionary dynamic has led to property tax rate disparities in which one municipalities tax rate can be several times the rate of another.
Should decisions about tax policy, revenue and spending be supplanted by rigid fiscal controls? We expect legislators and government officials to correct deficiencies in our tax system. We want them to raise sufficient revenue to pay bills, fully fund public services, make prudent investments for the state’s economic growth and put aside savings for future contingencies.  Do the fiscal guardrails allow legislators to make such decisions?  No, no and no.
While weighing the need to retain some fiscal controls, Connecticut leaders should take stock of investments needed for broad-based economic growth. The guardrails should be lifted to allow for raising new revenue and increasing budget growth.
According to the Federation of Tax Administrators in 2021, Connecticut was 35th lowest in the amount of revenue it collects as a percent of personal income. With our level of pension debt, high living costs and years of disinvestment, 35th place is not where we need to be. Connecticut can’t make the economy work for everyone by clinging to small government.

Thomson, Kit Gage",,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/11/19/burn-it-or-bury-it-montgomery-county-at-a-waste-management-crossroads-with-no-easy-answers/,"Calls to retire Montgomery County's trash incinerator at Dickerson present complex environmental, health and equity tradeoffs, write Vivian Thomson and Kit Gage, and county residents will need more facts than they have to make the right decision.","The Montgomery County Resource Recovery Facility -- the trash incinerator -- in Dickerson in a 2016 file photo. (Photo courtesy EPA Clean Air Markets)Montgomery County is at a waste management crossroads. The county has issued a request for proposals to export its 600,000 tons of annually generated waste to a landfill, probably in another state. County Executive Marc Elrich has long pushed to close the county’s trash incinerator.
This decision involves complicated environmental, public health, equity and cost tradeoffs, and the county lacks vital pieces of information. We have summarized what we know and what we don’t know in a report posted by Friends of Sligo Creek.
On the environmental and public health side of the equation, incinerators kill pathogens, but they produce carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. Still, our analysis indicates that landfilling the county’s waste could produce far more greenhouse gases than incinerating it. That’s because landfills emit methane, an especially potent greenhouse gas.
The incinerator’s air pollution controls appear to be working well. The county’s solid waste plan says, “Several health-risk assessment studies have concluded that there are no measurable influences on ambient air concentrations attributable to RRF [incinerator] source emissions” (p. 3-32). According to the Maryland Department of the Environment, the incinerator operates well within its permitted air pollution limits and, except for hydrogen chloride, within the Biden administration’s proposed stricter standards for waste incinerators.
But the incinerator’s ash, a source of toxic metals, currently goes to a Richmond, Virginia, landfill whose surrounding community is 70% African American. County staff say the ash is stabilized to remain non-hazardous and that it is tested regularly.

Nearby jurisdictions use a different ash disposal technique. Arlington County, Fairfax County and the City of Alexandria use an ash monofill, a type of facility that’s designed to prevent the release of metals.
In extending the life of their incinerator to 50 years, Arlington and Alexandria said, “it was found to be economically beneficial for both jurisdictions.” They also cited the “stellar” environmental record of the facility. Although incinerators can divert materials from recycling, Arlington and Alexandria report strong recycling rates (53%), as does Montgomery County (45%).
Landfills harbor pathogens. They produce copious amounts of air and water pollution, for decades. Landfill gases contain carcinogens like benzene and vinyl chloride. Landfill leachate (garbage “juice”) is a toxic chemical cocktail, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has said that even the best-protected landfills will eventually leak. One Virginia megalandfill identified as a potential recipient of the county’s trash generates almost 400,000 gallons of leachate per week. That landfill is in bankruptcy proceedings.
Equity is an important consideration. The area near the county’s incinerator is relatively well-off and is disproportionately white (75% white alone, versus 40% for the whole county). Many Virginia landfills are in marginalized communities. Maryland is already the leading out-of-state contributor to Virginia’s trash imports. The principles of proximity and self-sufficiency encourage the treatment of waste close to its point of origin.
Dueling estimates cloud the cost picture.
The county’s 2025 contractor report projects that, in the long term, even with needed upgrades, using the incinerator would be cheaper than landfilling. In 2024, the facility generated $24 million in revenues from sales of electricity and recovered metals. Closing the incinerator would mean losing those revenues and burying metals that, when recycled, save energy and reduce greenhouse gas pollution relative to using virgin materials.
However, county staff maintain that, in the short term, the landfill-plus-incinerator-closure option would be cheaper than continuing to operate the incinerator. They argue that the incinerator’s expenses would divert resources from efforts to decrease the county’s waste stream and that paying for landfilling on a per ton basis would incentivize waste reduction. However, the county has not estimated closure costs for the incinerator.
Some important unknowns are: The likely substantial costs for closing the county’s incinerator and remediating its site; the cost to send the incinerator’s ash to a different disposal site; and, the cost to extend the life of the incinerator, because no request for proposals has been issued to that end. For the landfill option, we don’t know what the impacts on the Derwood transfer station might be or whether the county might be liable for landfill contamination problems.
Finally, we don’t know what the county’s citizens think. The county has not scheduled a public hearing.
Council members say we must keep all options open and express deep unease with — or outright opposition to — exporting our trash. They, and the county’s citizens, deserve to see the full picture, and members of the public should have an opportunity to comment.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/52469466397_e9d1353222_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-20 06:56:20.398912

(File photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)The auditor for the state legislature is raising concerns about an increase in the number of unresolved findings as his agency reviews government operations.
More than one-third of compliance issues identified by the Office of Legislative Audits this year were findings repeated from previous audits. About 10% of those findings were included in two or more previous audits, according to a report presented Wednesday to the Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee.
“And for perspective, OLA has not seen repeat percentages this high since just prior to 2010,” Christine Timanus, deputy auditor at the Office of Legislative Audits, told committee members.
Most agencies are audited every three to four years. The majority of those reviews are for fiscal compliance.
On average, the auditor has conducted 190 reviews of state agencies annually over the last six years.
Over that time, the number of findings has decreased.
But the office reported that during that time, the percentage of repeat findings has increased from a low of 27% in 2022 and 2023 to the current 34% reported Wednesday.
Board bans individuals from state contracts over bribery charges, first debarments in eight years

Legislative Auditor Brian Tanen said the growing number of repeat findings is concerning.
“We do think that vacancy rates may have contributed at least in part to some of those things,” Tanen said.
An audit of the Social Services Administration released in September included a half-dozen repeat findings. Included in those were findings that the state agency failed to oversee local departments to which it has delegated authority. In other cases, children were going without medical and dental care, or investigations of allegations of abuse were not investigated in a timely manner.
Tanen said agencies are not implementing changes to address the audit findings.
“I don’t think it’s more auditing that’s necessary,” Tanen said. “I think it’s more fixing that’s necessary. We provide the recommendations. Ultimately, it’s the agencies that are responsible for putting the fixes in place. And I think what we’re finding is whether it’s because of a lack of adequate IT or human resources that those agencies oversee, controls those they’re just not doing it.”
Additionally, Tanen told the panel that at least 20% of the findings in the current year are related to delegated procurements. Tanen said the Departments of General Services and Budget and Management, and the Board of Public Works are not ensuring procurements are being conducted properly.
“And so, I think it becomes, at some point, we need to take a step back and say, these agencies that are responsible for controlling these activities, where do they stand to be accountable?” Tanen said.
“One of the things that may have to happen is when you delegate authority, sometimes you have to take the keys away from the child that’s not using the responsibilities that you’ve given them properly,” Tanen said. “And you know, if an agency is not procuring things properly or not handling the responsibilities they’ve been delegated properly, maybe we need to set an example, and someone needs to take that responsibility away and give it to somebody who can.”

Sears/Maryland Matters)The Board of Public Works indefinitely barred four individuals and one company Wednesday from doing business with the state after they were convicted of bribery in their previous dealings with the state.
The debarments appeared to be the first in eight years by the state,  which keeps a list of more than 80 companies and individuals who are ,prohibited from contracting with the state.
“It’s important that we uphold and strengthen the integrity of our procurement process by holding bad actors accountable,” Comptroller Brooke Lierman said during the meeting.
“Debarment is a crucial tool available to the Board of Public Works to ensure there are real consequences for companies that violate the public trust,” she wrote in a later statement. 
Of the four individuals barred, two were brothers — James and Paul DiPino — associated with the one debarred company, AB Medical LLC. 
According to board documents, James DiPino worked as a senior manager for the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, where he was responsible for selecting vendors for purchase orders. In at least two instances, he selected AB Medical — a company secretly associated with his brother — for the purchase of personal protective equipment, despite having lower offers from other vendors. There were a total of 11 purchases from the company. 
AB Medical transferred $3 million to James DiPino through two shell companies established by both brothers in September 2020 — he used the funds for a personal investment account and the purchase of a nearly $280,000 boat,according to the materials. The brothers and company were convicted of bribery in 2023. 
James Schoo, another debarred individual, was a former Department of Juvenile Services employee who took bribes from the construction company Seabolt & Sons for maintenance work at DJS facilities, the board documents said. While Maryland paid the company $1.2 million, Schoo had the company install a concrete driveway in his home, put carpets in a rental home and both his and his daughter’s homes and received wood cabinets from the company — all with no payment for work or materials. 
Schoo also used a fraudulent company to compete as a losing bidder against Seabolt & Sons. He sent state funds to that company, which he used to send money to the unemployed husband of a different vendor — later hiring the husband to an actual DJS job desite his lack of qualifications, and attending outings with the employee. Schoo was convicted of bribery, conspiracy to bribe, theft and false statements in 2020. 
The final debarred individual from Wednesday’s meeting is Mark Anthony Sykes, who paid $20,000 in bribes to state officials in exchange for using his company, Building Enterprises LLC, for the cleaning of COVID-related facilitie, board documents saids. The company received nearly $175,000 from Maryland. Sykes was convicted in Baltimore County Circuit Court of bribery in April. 
In addition to bribery, other activities that are grounds for debarment include worker misclassification, failure to meet contract rules and wage theft, according to Lierman and Rachel Hershey, general cousel to the board. 
“It is clear from our discussion about debarment during today’s Board of Public Works meeting that more effort is needed to hold companies accountable when they have engaged in illegal and fraudulent activities,” Lierman said in the statement. “Our tax dollars should never be used to support unscrupulous companies that commit fruad or mistret their workers.”
The Board of Public Works maintains a list of debarred companies and indivisuals — that Lierman noted had not been updated for eight years, before Wedmesday. Both Hershey and Board Executive Secretary John T. Gontrum said the lack of updates is a reflection of the lack of debarments over the past few years, and the recently debarred will be added to the list. 
“There’s an opportunity here for some education to those entities that are responsible for bringing education to the board,” Hershey said.
Lierman plans to review past and upcoming fraud cases with the Office of the Attorney General and with board staff. She also said in her statement that she plans to bring the issue to the attention of the Joint Enforcement Task Force on Workplace Fraud to create a debarment recommendation process for other actions that “rob the state of valuable resources.”
“I remain comitted to being a watchdog for our tax dollars and being a strong advocate for Marylanders,” Lierman said in the statement.
State approves Baltimore Banner judgment payment
The state approved a nearly a $175,000 to settle a Public Information Act claim by the Baltinore Bannern against state’s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. The bulk of the payment, $165,741, is for attorney’s fees to Venable LLP, the law firm that represented the Banner in the lawsuit. Another $8,239.94 is for litigation costs and the final $1,000 is a penalty for violating a PIA request, which will go to the Banner.
The lawsuit was filed in December 2022 after the medical examiner’s office improperly denied the Banner access to autopsy and toxicology reports, which the news organization had planned to use to report on overdoses and the opioid epidemic.
While Treasurer Dereck Davis referred to the $1,000 statutory damage as a “money grab,” the Maryland Department of Health Assistant Attorney General Nicole Lugo Clark described it as a “minute portion” of the overall settlement.

Ford/Maryland Matters)An Anne Arundel County Circuit Court judge has dismissed a lawsuit brought by unaffiliated Maryland voters, who argued that the state’s closed primary elections infringe on their voting rights.
In her ruling last week, Circuit Judge Pamela K. Alban wrote that the state’s precedent is clear, based on prior cases that affirmed political parties’ rights to exclude unaffiliated voters from their primary elections.
“While the Maryland Constitution and Declaration of Rights guarantee the right to vote in state elections, neither grants the right to vote in a political party’s primary without affiliating with that party,” Alban wrote.
An attorney for the voters who brought the suit, Boyd Rutherford, the former lieutenant governor to Gov. Larry Hogan (R), vowed to appeal Alban’s ruling.

“While we would like to have had a chance to fully brief the merits of our case in Circuit Court, our appeal will get the Constitutional questions before the Appellant Courts quicker,” Rutherford (R) said in a statement to Maryland Matters.
The Maryland Attorney General’s Office decined to comment Wedneday on the dismissal of the case.
Alban’s ruling was expected to be appealed — no matter which side she landed on. She said as much during a late-October motions hearing in Annapolis.
“I imagine no matter what I do, this may not be the end,” Alban told the courtroom then.
Maryland is one of 18 states with either completely closed or partially closed primaries, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures,
The Maryland voters filed their lawsuit challenging Maryland’s system in May, and a few months later, the Maryland State Board of Elections, represented by the state attorney general’s office, filed a motion to dismiss the case on various grounds.
During a late October hearing in Annapolis, Alban ruled partially in favor of the aggrieved voters, determining that they had legal standing to sue.
But Alban waited to rule on the merits of the case, and to determine whether the voters had stated a claim that could proceed. During her questioning, Alban hinted that she was skeptical of the voters’ case.
In their arguments, attorneys for the voters tried to make the argument that their case was distinct from two prior Maryland Supreme Court deicisohns that validated closed primaries: Hennegan v. Geartner in 1946 and Suessman v. Lamone in 2004.
But Alban disagreed.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Plaintiffs’ constitutional claims fall squarely within the scope of the holdings in Seussmann and Hennegan. They assert rights that, under Maryland law, they do not possess,” she  wrote.
Alban ruled that although the Suessman case was focused on a primary election for circuit court judge, it still applied, because the court relied on the notion that Maryland voters are not entitled to participate in partisan primaries.
In the Hennegan case, a petitioner challenged a prior version of the state’s elections code, which prohibited party changes six months before a primary. The court ruled that because the petitioner did not have a constitutional right to participate in a party primary, the state law was valid.
As such, Alban ruled that both cases prove that the precedent in Maryland is that citizens have no constitutionally protected right to vote in primaries, and Rutherford’s case should be dismissed.
“They have failed to state a legally cognizable claim that their right to vote has been infringed,” Alban wrote.

(Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)A former Cecil County deputy sheriff was sentenced Tuesday to eight years in prison with all but six months suspended for illegal searches on a police database, according to the Maryland State Prosecutor’s Office.
After Donta Odom completes his sentence, he will serve three years of supervised probation.
The sentencing by Cecil County Circuit Court Judge Paul M. Bowman comes after Odom pleaded guilty last month to four counts of misconduct in office and three counts of unauthorized access to a computer.
A statement of facts said Odom searched a law enforcement database for information on seven people who were not suspects, including his wife.
The document states Odom also searched information on romantic partners, relatives of romantic partners, a woman who worked in his building and others. Authorities said Odom had no “legitimate law enforcement reason to search” a database about any of the individuals, who are not named.
Odom worked for sheriff’s office from 2019 until he resigned in August 2025.

One of those searches Odom did between September and December 2024 on a person identified as “Victim 4.”
In December of that year, after Odom and Victim 4 went on a vacation to Ocean City, Victim 4 informed the sheriff’s office of Odom’s conduct.
Although Odom was served with a no-contact order, he continued to contact Victim 4 through social media, texts and emails. In addition, Odom secretly recorded a conversation with Victim 4 in March of this year, when they met at a secluded location, leading to a wiretapping charge.
On March 9, 2025, Odom repeatedly asked Victim 4 why she told investigators certain information. The next day, Odom texted her, “Why don’t you ask for the no contact order to be dropped” and “to delete everything.”
Odom also spoke with Victims 1 and 2 prior to and after they were interviewed by investigators.
“You have done incalculable harm to law enforcement. You have truly dishonored the badge you used to wear,” Bowman said, accordihg to a news release from the prosecutor’s office. “Your unlawful behavior while serving as a police officer will not be tolerated.”
“Law enforcement officers have access to sensitive and confidential information necessary to discharge their official duties,” Maryland State Prosecutor Charlton T. Howard III said in the statement. “Our office will continue to do our best to ensure that those officers who abuse their positions of trust and misuse their authorities for corrupt reasons are held accountable.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_7854-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-20 05:57:46.963637

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)The Ohio House has once again protected marijuana and “intoxicating” hemp policy from the Senate’s restrictions after a deal went up in smoke Wednesday night.
The Senate adjourned before the House was able to figure out if they even had enough votes.
The gavel hit for likely the last time before Ohio lawmakers take their holiday break.
And their main priority was supposed to be marijuana and hemp policy.
A deal was done to ban intoxicating hemp products with low-level THC that you can buy in gas stations and smoke shops.
Marijuana policy wasn’t going to change much, until a last-minute curveball on Wednesday.
“The Senate has dug in on adding some things to the bill that are just not acceptable to a lot of members of the House,” state Rep. Jamie Callender, R-Concord, said.
They have hit a roadblock — a Jamie Callender-sized roadblock.
The Cleveland-area Republican calls the last-minute additions to the bill “unconstitutional.”
“Some language that they took out that we had to protect from searches and stops by law enforcement based on being a ‘known user’ or a ‘known consumer,'” Callender said.
Democratic state Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, said the new provisions would make it illegal to have marijuana in your car in some instances.
The changes could also jeopardize jobs if someone tests positive for THC.
It also would not include money for expungement.
“The majority of Republicans in the House and Senate don’t care about the will of the voters, and that’s the biggest problem,” DeMora said.
But Ohio Senate President Rob McColley said that they were focused on public safety.
“Selling a lot of these products that we’ve already said are really concerning, could potentially harm kids,” McColley said in a previous gaggle.
State Rep. Tex Fischer, R-Boardman, has been working with Callender to protect access to hemp products, while also regulating them.

The duo has been pushing back against leadership for months.
The president argued that he and the Senate had done their job on the topic.
McColley said he isn’t going to air the differences out in public.
“I don’t think that’s fair to negotiations that are supposed to be in the spirit of a conference committee,” he said. “The Senate has made significant, significant concessions to get to this point. We’ve even made continued concessions three times after we thought we had a deal.”
But this isn’t the end.
“We have an if-needed session in December,” Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, said.
But for a large group of Republicans and Democrats in the House, the Senate’s requests are unreasonable.
“The Senate always has the opportunity to go back and retract, Callendar said.

Kirk, a political activist who founded Turning Point USA and often spoke about his Christian faith, was killed while speaking at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10. 
Republican state Reps. Gary Click and Mike Dovilla introduced H.B. 486 bill less than two months ago.  
The bill originally just mentioned Christianity but an amendment in the House Education Committee broadened the scope of the bill to include Judeo-Christian. 
“We’re not talking about indoctrination,” Click claimed. “We’re not talking about preaching students. We’re not talking about narrative religions. We’re not talking about a Bible course. We’re talking about the factual events in history.”  
With the Establishment and Free Exercise clauses as the first and second clauses in the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights, the U.S. Constitution stands as history’s most notable document establishing religious freedom in a nation at its founding. 
“The bill flies in the face of the First Amendment because the government has no business endorsing or promoting a particular religious tradition,” Ohio Rep. Sean Brennan, D-Parma, said.
“Never once has a teacher ever told me they were afraid to teach about the positive or negative impact of religion on American history.”
The bill outlines several examples that could be taught including the history of the pilgrims, the religious background of signers of the Declaration of Independence, the religious influence on the U.S. Constitution, Benjamin Franklin’s call for prayer at the constitutional convention, the separation of church and state, the role of the Ten Commandments “in shaping American law,” how religious influence shaped the Civil Rights movement, and the impact of evangelist Billy Graham, among others, according to the bill’s language. 
“These are examples,” Click said. “It’s not an exhaustive list, but these are examples that can help teachers understand the things that they can teach that are legal or lawful.”
History teachers already teach this in Ohio classrooms, said Brennan, a former teacher. 
“I taught many of the very documents listed in this bill,” he said. “… A teacher has nothing to fear, as long as they’re not proselytizing,” Brennan said. 
“The Constitution doesn’t prevent us from teaching about religion. It prevents us from promoting it. There’s a big difference there.”
The religions of America’s Founding Fathers had wide variation but most were Protestant. Many came from the Anglican, Presbyterian, and Congregationalist churches, with some Quakers, Lutherans, and Dutch Reformed, and some Catholics. 
A significant minority of the founders were Unitarians or Deists, believing in a supreme creator but not in divine intervention. This included Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Paine.

(Photo by Carl Payne, States Newsroom.)Ohio lawmakers voted Wednesday to shorten the deadline again for returning absentee ballots — removing any grace period and invalidating all ballots that arrive after Election Day. That measure, Ohio Senate Bill 293, is now on its way to the governor.
As recently as 2022, Ohio voters had a 10-day grace period for absentee ballots post-marked by Election Day to arrive at their local county board of elections to be officially counted. Ohio Republican lawmakers shortened that to four days for the 2024 election, and are now eliminating the grace period entirely.
Threats from the Trump administration spurred Ohio lawmakers into action.
In a March executive order, the president introduced a novel of reading of federal law and simply declared all absentee ballots arriving after Election Day should be rejected.
In recent months, the U.S. Department of Justice has been warning Ohio officials it might sue the state over the issue.

The bill’s sponsors also pointed to the U.S. Supreme Court agreeing to hear a case out of Mississippi which allows ballots to show up five days after an election.
Should the court reject absentee ballot grace periods, they argue, Ohio election officials could find themselves rushing to make sweeping changes ahead of a contentious federal election.
At the last minute, the bill picked up an amendment that critics warn will increase provisional voting “exponentially” and make it far easier to cancel a voter’s registration.
The changes direct county boards to promptly cancel a person’s registration if the secretary of state determines they aren’t a citizen.
It’s a notable departure. Typically, county boards send a confirmation notice when they find a problem with a person’s registration.
Ohio Sec. of State LaRose’s noncitizen voter registration audit sweeps in naturalized citizens

And it’s not like the secretary’s track record is perfect. Since taking office Sec. Frank LaRose has flagged hundreds of individuals as alleged noncitizens. County prosecutors and the Ohio Attorney General have largely brushed off his allegations and declined to prosecute all but a handful. Last year, LaRose’s review appeared to violate statutory requirements and wound up flagging recently naturalized citizens.
The amendment also directs the secretary to send reports to all 88 counties detailing apparent data mismatches. Voters identified in the report would receive a confirmation notice, and if they don’t provide corrected information they’d have to vote provisionally.

House floor debate
On the House floor, state Rep. Sharon Ray, R-Wadsworth, explained the bill brings Ohio’s deadline in line with 34 others around the country.
A former election board member in Medina County, Ray emphasized acting now will simplify changes at county boards, “allowing for an extensive voter awareness campaign” before the primary and ensuring “consistency” between the primary and general elections.
Rep. Adam Bird, R-New Richmond, debating on the Ohio House floor. (Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)
State Rep. Adam Bird, R-New Richmond, asked his colleagues if they want to “tighten loopholes,” “instill confidence and credibility,” and ensure “Ohio is abiding by federal election law.”
“I do,” Bird said. “I would encourage you to want that as well.”
State Rep. Allison Russo, D-Upper Arlington, blasted the suggestion that Ohio’s current system is breaking the law.
“This notion that we would be violating federal law by continuing our grace period is false,” she said. “There is no federal law that is being violated. There is a court case that is being reviewed by the Supreme Court.”
Democrats brought three different amendments on the House floor. All of them failed.
State Rep. Juanita Brent, D-Cleveland, proposed changes that would have created permanent absent voter list.
Russo offered language allowing voters to return absentee ballots at any polling location or county board of elections rather than just their county board.
State Rep. Ashley Bryant Bailey, D-Cincinnati, urged lawmakers to notify voters 60-90 days before an election if there’s a discrepancy in their records, “before they are blindsided at the polls and forced to vote provisionally.”

Bryant Bailey explained that notice matters to her because a clerical error nearly derailed her appointment to House.
She changed her name when she got married and her registration initially didn’t follow her.
“You may support this bill, or you may oppose it,” she said, “but notice isn’t partisan. It’s basic fairness.”
State Rep. Josh Williams, R-Sylvania Twp., spoke against each of the proposals before lawmakers tabled the amendments. He suggested a permanent absent voter list would open the door to family members voting on behalf of elderly, incapacitated voters. Allowing voters to turn in ballots at polling locations or other county boards would similarly “make Ohio elections less secure and open to fraud and abuse,” Williams said. Requiring notice before canceling a voter’s registration would lead to fraud, too, Williams insisted.
“If we really care about election integrity,” Williams said, “I think it’s reasonable for the Secretary of State to remove illegal immigrants from our voter rolls, even within 90 days of the election.”
For all Republicans stated concerns about complying with federal law, systematically removing voter registrations within 90 days of a federal election — as Williams suggested and as the bill would require — is barred by the National Voter Registration Act’s ‘quiet period’ provisions.
Last year, Virginia ordered just such a review that wound up removing 1,600 registrations, some of which belonged to eligible voters. A federal court and U.S. Court of Appeals sided with groups challenging those removals, but the U.S. Supreme Court allowed them to go forward without ruling on whether the process was valid.
Senate concurrence
Because of that eleventh hour amendment, the Senate had to vote to concur with the House’s changes. Wednesday evening, the Senate took up the bill.
One of the bill’s sponsors, state Sen. Theresa Gavarone, R-Bowling Green, pointed to the U.S. Supreme Court deciding to hear the case out of Mississippi. That ruling will likely arrive next summer.
“It makes more sense and will be more efficient to introduce that change now, that way there’s plenty of time to make sure every voter is aware and can make their vote on time,” she insisted.
State Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, wasn’t buying it, and called the bill an “all-out assault on democracy.”
“Why do we want to act on something before the Supreme Court of the United States makes a decision?” he asked, half exasperated.
“I mean, the Supreme Court, two years ago, basically the same members on the Court, allowed Pennsylvania voters to turn their ballots in and be counted late, even though Pennsylvania didn’t even have that on the books as a state law.”
State Sen. Willis Blackshear, D-Dayton, said the latest changes, coming on the heels of several recent election laws, will only breed confusion.
“Just in regard to the grace period,” he said, “we have changed the timeline from 10 days to four days, and now Senate Bill 293 proposes no grace period. Altogether, this bill will further that confusion and make it so more people will have to vote provisionally and risk their vote not being counted.”
State Sen. Kent Smith, D-Euclid, pointed to provisions meant to “clean up” discrepancies in the voter rolls — for instance, if an address or a driver’s license doesn’t match or a person dies.
“There are at least four Kent Smiths that live in Cuyahoga County,” he said. “One of them, I know, has passed away. Do you see what the potential problem can be?”
Senate Republicans brushed off all the objections.
One of the bill’s co-sponsors, state Sen. Andrew Brenner, R-Delaware, reminded his colleagues that voters still have several weeks of early voting and 34 other states impose the same deadline for absentee ballots.
State Sen. Terry Johnson, R-McDermott, recalled Election Day being a single day when he started voting in the 1970s and insisted “it’s so easy” to vote early or by mail.
Frustration growing, Johnson rejected the suggestion that the bill is a Republican attempt to suppress the vote.
“I can personally guarantee you, no one on this side of the aisle is trying to suppress the vote. Get a new line. It’s not true. No one believes it anymore,” he barked.
That rang a bit hollow for state Sen. Catherine Ingram, D-Cincinnati. She noted the Ohio House and Senate held several committee hearings on Election Day just a few weeks ago.

And when we treat it as a crisis—when urgency is used to silence debate or justify extreme measures—the quality of our decisions suffers. 
Massachusetts has always been at its best not when panicking, but when rising collectively to a challenge. That is the Massachusetts I want to lead. 
This principle was tested on Beacon Hill last week. Misplaced priorities were on full display when a modest, common-sense bill—one that would have provided immediate relief to Massachusetts families—was sidelined before it ever received an honest debate. 
The legislation would have replaced the binding 2030 climate mandate—requiring a 50 percent reduction in greenhouse gases from 1990 levels—with an advisory goal. It was a pragmatic step toward affordability. It would have saved Massachusetts taxpayers millions. And yet, it never had a chance. 
Instead, legislative leaders punted the proposal into the winter months—exactly when families face their highest heating bills. 
The message was unmistakable: climate ideology prevailed over affordability.  
What makes the decision even more troubling is that a bipartisan coalition has been quietly forming around this issue. Lawmakers across the political spectrum recognize that Massachusetts can do well by the environment without imposing rigid mandates that strain household budgets. 
Even The Wall Street Journal recently praised Democrat Rep. Mark Cusack for introducing a more pragmatic balance between climate goals and economic reality. 
But legislators once again bowed to one of the most powerful and well-funded special interest groups in our state: the green energy lobby. They understood that giving this proposal room for genuine debate would open a can of worms—one that might force them to answer uncomfortable questions about who actually benefits from these mandates. 
Let’s start with a truth that should guide our approach: Massachusetts is responsible for just 0.01 percent of global CO₂ emissions. Nothing in that number justifies forcing families and small businesses to absorb drastically higher electricity and heating costs for a symbolic climate goal that will have no measurable impact on the planet. 
Yet Gov. Healey has elevated climate policy above affordability, competitiveness, and basic economic common sense. She created a powerful “climate czar”—a senior adviser with the authority to review virtually every major initiative through a singular climate lens. That means proposals on housing, affordability, transportation, economic development—you name it—must pass through a partisan climate filter first. 
This is not governing. This is outsourcing priorities. 
Massachusetts now ranks among the most expensive states in America for utility bills. It’s the direct result of a governing approach that prioritizes ideology over impact—an approach that treats affordability as an afterthought and working families as collateral damage. 
And the product of deliberate choices—such as Maura Healey blocking two natural gas pipeline expansions fully aware that doing so would drive energy prices up. 
Meanwhile, other states—blue and red alike—are reassessing aggressive targets and building affordability protections into their planning. Massachusetts is moving in the opposite direction. 
Families, seniors, and small businesses—those least able to absorb financial shocks—bear the brunt of these decisions. 
I’m not here to assign motives or accuse individual lawmakers of bad faith. But I will encourage every citizen to examine OCPF records and see which green energy companies have become some of the most generous political donors. Draw your own conclusions. 
Massachusetts needs a full, independent review of all climate-related spending and mandates. 
That review must look at: 
● All tax credits, subsidies, and grants flowing to green-energy companies 
● Every regulatory mandate that directly increases utility costs 
● The full cost of state climate programs to taxpayers and ratepayers 
● The effects of climate policies on reliability and competitiveness 
This isn’t about partisanship. It’s about priorities. When nearly every family in this state is struggling with the cost of living, it is reckless—and frankly irresponsible—for Beacon Hill to ignore the financial consequences of its climate agenda. 
Massachusetts has always been at its best when we lead with innovation, pragmatism, and common sense—not when we chase symbolic victories at the expense of the people we serve. 
It’s time to bring affordability back to the center of our policymaking and move away from the crisis thinking that has driven so many extreme decisions. If the current administration won’t do it, I will.

Running concurrently is the “Shine the Light on Hunger” campaign that this year set a goal of providing 6 million meals for the Food Bank for the Heartland.
While the Holiday Lights Festival and hunger-relief drive combo is a longtime tradition, this year’s activities come as the food bank, which serves 93 counties, faces “one of the most volatile times” in its history, says Brian Barks, president and CEO.

“Even before the government shutdown and the pause in SNAP benefits, we were already seeing the highest levels of food insecurity our service area has ever experienced,” he said. “These disruptions have only deepened the strain, pushing the food bank and our pantry partners to do even more with less.”
Barks said need is growing faster than resources, and he joined Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr. and others Tuesday in announcing details of the holiday lights and food- and fund-raising campaigns.
“For more than a quarter-century, our community has come together under the glow of downtown’s holiday lights to extend warmth to those in need,” Ewing said. “This year, we shine not only light but also hope — and we invite every resident, business and organization to join us in celebrating the holidays and shining the light on hunger.”
One in five children in Nebraska and western Iowa experience food insecurity, says the Food Bank for the Heartland, which distributed more than 24 million meals during fiscal year 2025. The food bank partners with more than 500 agencies across Nebraska and western Iowa.
The Holiday Lights Festival illuminates sections of Omaha from Saturday, Nov. 29, through Thursday, Jan. 1. Nightly displays turn on in downtown throughout the Old Market and across 72 acres of The Riverfront, along the commercial corridors of North 24th Street and South 24th Street. 
Roger Dixon of the Metropolitan Entertainment & Convention Authority (MECA), which manages the downtown riverfront park system, said in a statement that the festival brings a “truly immersive holiday experience” with thousands of dazzling lights, a towering tree and dozens of seasonal events to the downtown area throughout December — free and open to the public.
The food campaign is supported by Conagra Brands, Farm Credit Services of America, WoodmenLife and Baker’s Supermarkets.
Rahul Sualy of Conagra Brands said the company created the Shine the Light on Hunger campaign to help make a tangible difference in providing food security to its neighbors. 
“Everybody deserves consistent access to nutritious food,” he said. “By helping provide millions of meals for families across the Heartland, we’re turning compassion into action this holiday season.”
Among the ways the public can support:

Free.,Trump signs bill requiring DOJ release of Epstein files,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-signs-bill-requiring-doj-release-epstein-files,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump signed into law late Wednesday a bill compelling the release of unclassified investigative files from the case against convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, with whom he shared a well-documented friendship, though Trump denies any involvement in the financier's crimes. Epstein, who surrounded himself with the rich and powerful, died in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 awaiting federal trial on sex trafficking charges.Trump signed the bill the day after the House sent it to the Senate, which agreed by unanimous consent to accept the measure.In a post on his own social media platform Truth Social, the president name-called several prominent figures in business and politics, including former President Bill Clinton.“Perhaps the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein, will soon be revealed, because I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES!” Trump wrote.In the lengthy post, Trump credits himself and Republican leaders in Congress for the legislation, though the bipartisan bill was forced to the House floor via a discharge petition. After months of loud cries to release the files, even from his base, Trump changed his position Sunday night and directed Republicans to support the measure.In July, Trump's Department of Justice issued a memo that it would not publicly release any further records about the Epstein case.The legislation overwhelmingly passed the House Tuesday in a 427-1 vote. GOP Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., was the lone no vote. The legislation compels the Justice Department to publicly disclose “all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials in its possession that relate to Epstein or (co-conspirator Ghislaine) Maxwell.” They include records related to Epstein’s detention and death; flight logs from Epstein’s planes; names of those connected with Epstein’s alleged crimes; records of civil settlements, and sealed and unsealed immunity deals and plea bargains; records pertaining to entities with ties to Epstein’s trafficking or financial networks; and internal DOJ communications “concerning decisions to investigate or charge Epstein or his associates.” The bill carves out exceptions for records containing victims’ identities, images of death or physical abuse, and information that could jeopardize a federal investigation. The bill also notes that the “DOJ may not withhold or redact records on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity.”The bill’s passage and Trump's signature came less than a week after lawmakers on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released some 20,000 pages of emails from Epstein’s estate that repeatedly mentioned Trump’s name. In one email from Epstein to convicted co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, the financier and sex offender claimed Trump “knew about the girls.”Many other names turned up in the thousands of pages of correspondence, including that of Democratic Delegate Stacey Plaskett, who represents the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein owned a residence, and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.A House Republican effort to censure Plaskett narrowly failed in the House Tuesday night. Summers announced Wednesday that he would resign from prominent board and other positions.",,,,2025-11-19 21:56:32.755507
,DC,2025-11-20 02:03:59+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,US House votes to cancel big payouts for senators’ 'Arctic Frost' phone subpoenas,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-votes-cancel-big-payouts-senators-arctic-frost-phone-subpoenas,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. House approved legislation Wednesday that would revoke part of a law Congress approved just last week, which for the first time allows senators to sue the federal government, potentially for millions of dollars, if their data is subpoenaed without their knowledge. The 426-0 vote sent the bill to the Senate, where Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., doesn’t appear inclined to put the measure on the floor for a vote, though he hasn’t entirely ruled it out. “You have an independent, co-equal branch of the government whose members were, through illegal means, having their phone records acquired, spied on if you will, through a weaponized Biden Justice Department,” Thune said. “That, to me, demands some accountability.”Thune said he understands why several Republican senators were frustrated they didn’t know the provision was added to the funding package that ended the government shutdown.“I take that as a legitimate criticism in terms of the process,” Thune said. “But I think, on the substance, I believe that you need to have some sort of accountability and consequence for that kind of weaponization against a co-equal branch of the government.”Thune declined to say if he thinks it's appropriate for senators to sue for millions in taxpayer dollars for having their phone call records pulled as part of the investigation into President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. “I don't think there's anybody that was targeted for whom the money matters,” Thune said. “I think it's more about the principle.”GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of eight senators who could benefit, said shortly after the House wrapped up debate he plans to sue Verizon as well as the Department of Justice under the new provision. “The subpoena that was issued, I think, was fatally flawed. The judicial order saying if you told me (about the subpoena) I would tamper with witnesses or tamper with evidence is legally offensive,” Graham said. “I'm not going to take this crap anymore. I am going into court, and we'll see what happens.""Dispute among RepublicansSenate Republicans’ decision to include the lawsuit provision in the stopgap spending law that ended the 43-day government shutdown represented a rare public break between GOP congressional leaders.Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said last week just after the House passed the funding law he was “very angry” the lawsuit language was added to the package without his knowledge or sign off. “I think that was way out of line. I don't think that was the smart thing to do. I don't think that was the right thing to do,” Johnson said at the time. “And the House is going to reverse it. We're going to repeal that. And I'm going to expect our colleagues in the Senate to do the same thing.”The provision, which will remain in effect unless the Senate passes the new bill and Trump signs it, allows senators who had their cell phone or other data subpoenaed without their knowledge to sue the federal government for $500,000 “for each instance of a violation.” The language is retroactive until Jan. 1, 2022, and allows the eight senators who had their cell phone call logs subpoenaed as part of the FBI’s 2023 investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election to sue for millions of dollars. The FBI reportedly obtained data for cell phone use between Jan. 4 and Jan. 7, 2021, for Graham and Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Dan Sullivan of Alaska and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, as well as Pennsylvania Rep. Mike Kelly. All are Republicans. The law allows judges to delay notification for 60 days if the information was pulled as part of a criminal investigation and if telling the senator would endanger someone’s safety or life, lead the lawmaker to flee prosecution, result in someone tampering with or destroying evidence, lead to witness intimidation, place the investigation in jeopardy, or unduly delay the trial. A judge could keep renewing that 60-day notification delay in criminal investigations if one or several of those elements continued to exist. Both parties object House debate on the two-page bill sponsored by Georgia GOP Rep. Austin Scott was broadly bipartisan, though Democrats and Republicans expressed frustration with the lawsuit language for different reasons. Administration Committee Chairman Bryan Steil, R-Wis., said the ""troubling provision” in the spending law must be stricken.“These provisions are not the right path to address the true concerns over the separation of powers,” Steil said. “Remember, Congress serves the American people, not the other way around.”Steil said the FBI pulling cell phone call records for senators as part of its investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election, known as Operation Arctic Frost, was an abuse of power that should be addressed. But he said allowing senators to sue for millions of dollars in taxpayer money was the wrong way to do that. “I’m committed to holding those involved accountable. No one benefited by the failures of the Biden administration,” Steil said. “However, that does not mean that elected officials should be financially benefiting from those failures now.”New York Rep. Joe Morelle, ranking Democrat on the committee, said those eight senators' cell phone logs were pulled because FBI agents believed the lawmakers “had knowledge of or even participated in efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Efforts that culminated in a violent attack on this very institution.”Morelle said anyone with a basic understanding of criminal investigations knows that phone records “are among the most routine tools used” to gain a better understanding of events. “They do not reveal the content of any conversations. They simply show which numbers were called, which numbers called them and when those calls were made,” Morelle said.“If these Republican senators genuinely believe that their civil liberties were violated or if they are interested in changing the law relating to subpoenas, then they are better positioned than literally anyone on planet Earth to hold hearings, draft legislation and debate proposed changes in the open,” Morelle added. “But that’s not what this is all about. This is about ensuring the law applies to every other American, just not to them.”Scott said House Republicans voted for the spending law to end the government shutdown, not because they supported the lawsuit provision, which he called “the most self-centered, self-serving piece of language that I have ever seen in any piece of legislation.”He also rebuked Sen. Graham for saying during interviews that he plans to sue the federal government. “We have one senator, one, who maintains that this provision is good and is currently saying that he is going to sue for tens of millions of dollars,” Scott said. “I believe my side did the right thing in voting to open up the government. There are a select few people that did the wrong thing in putting language in the bill that would make themselves individually wealthy.”Bombs, cows, the Postal Service and lawsuitsGraham, who was an Air Force Judge Advocate General officer before entering politics, compared having his cell phone data pulled as part of the investigation to a case he handled earlier in his career after the Air Force “dropped a bomb on a guy's barn and killed his cow. And he was able to make a claim.”Graham also compared it to someone suing the government after being hit by a U.S. Postal Service truck, when asked by a reporter what he plans to do with the millions of dollars he will likely receive if he were to win the case. “You do whatever you want to do with the money if you've been wronged,” Graham said.  In addition to filing a lawsuit, Graham hopes to broaden the language so that organizations and private individuals can file suit against the government under the Federal Tort Claims Act if they feel they’ve been wronged similarly. “I will insist on a vote in the United States Senate to expand the ability of people to make claims that may have been harmed,” Graham said, adding that would likely include the Republican Attorneys General Association, the Republican National Committee and Turning Point USA.Graham rejected criticisms of the lawsuit provision from fellow GOP lawmakers, saying it doesn't represent “self-dealing.”“I understand politics, but I'm not worried about that. I'm worried about getting the right outcome,” Graham said. “I mean, if you don't want me to sue the government, that's up to you. I'm going to sue, whether you like it or not. I'm not going to put up with this anymore, and people in my spot shouldn't have to deal with this in the future.”",,,,2025-11-19 21:56:32.755507

Both measures involve the group Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts and challenged Knudsen’s decisions to reword the ballot statement on one, while declaring the other was constitutionally deficient. And both ballot initiatives are a part of a years’ long battle over the make-up and direction of Montana’s judiciary, including whether it should be partisan or nonpartisan.
Both challenges were brought simultaneously after Knudsen’s office approved Constitutional Initiative 132, but changed the description that would describe the initiatives to voters. Knudsen then said that Ballot Initiative 6 was insufficient due to a number of legal issues, including that it violated a clause of the state’s constitution.
Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts alleged that Knudsen had interfered unlawfully by rewriting CI-132 to bend them to his office’s political will. In Montana, ballot measures must pass through reviews by the Montana Secretary of State and the Attorney General’s Office for legal sufficiency.
  Constitutional Initiative 132 

Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts proposed a ballot measure that would amend Article VII of the state’s Constitution by adding “Section 12. Nonpartisan Judicial Elections. Judicial elections shall remain nonpartisan.”
Knudsen’s office changed the proposed ballot statement that is meant to briefly explain the purpose to voters in a succinct manner. Knudsen’s office argued MNC failed to inform voters what “is meant by ‘nonpartisan.’”
Knudsen’s rewritten definition stated that “A nonpartisan election prohibits labeling candidates on the ballot according to the political party the candidate aligns with including labels like Independent.”
Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts, on the other hand, told the high court that Knudsen’s additional language would confuse voters and was unnecessary. Attorneys for the group claimed that voters didn’t need “nonpartisan” defined.
Most of the Supreme Court agreed that Knudsen’s office overstepped Montana law in the case, and rejected his changes.
“We will not invalidate a ballot statement simply because a better one could be written,” said the opinion written for the majority by Shea. “We disagree with the Attorney General that the statement requires a ‘working definition’ of ‘nonpartisan’ where the statutes pertaining to nonpartisan elections have never found it necessary to define the term and where Montana voters have ample experience with nonpartisan elections — the last 90 years of nonpartisan judicial elections being but one example.”
The justices were concerned that Knudsen’s that was injecting politics into a “straightforward proposition.”
“The Attorney General’s assertion that nonpartisan elections are ‘the policy position of the political branches’ uses many words to obscure a straightforward proposition. The term of art for ‘the policy position of political branches’ is ‘law.’ ‘Law’ is also a term of art that describes the provisions of constitutions,’” the opinion said. “Thus, the Attorney General’s statement that ‘petitioner is remiss to equate a legislative policy with a constitutional principle,’ might also be expressed as ‘Petitioner is remiss to equate law with law.’”
Chief Justice Cory Swanson concurred with the the majority in part and dissented in part, while Justice Jim Rice said he would have permitted the ballot description by Knudsen’s office.
  Ballot Issue 6 

In the other case, Ballot Issue 6 proposed two parts, amending Article VII of the Constitution to state that judicial elections would remain nonpartisan; and that any new court created after the amendment would consist of judges elected on a nonpartisan basis.
Knudsen declared the proposed measure did not pass legal scrutiny, based on a rule that ballot initiatives must involve a “single subject.”
That constitutional rule requires a proposal to only address or alter one subject. This prevents confusing the voters, or “logrolling” — the political practice of putting more than one item before the voters often so that a politically unpopular item can be carried because its paired with something more politically popular or palatable.
A unanimous Supreme Court said that while the two parts of Ballot Initiative 6 would seem to be about same subject — that judges in the state would remain nonpartisan — the justices said that how all judges are selected is different than whether they are partisan. It agreed with Knudsen, concluding that Ballot Issue 6 was “legally insufficient” and couldn’t be presented to voters.
The court said voters would really be making a choice on two distinct, if related, issues: “One to give voters the choice to require all judicial elections to be nonpartisan and one to give voters the choice to require that judges on any court created in the future must be elected.”
The court also said that while the proposal for future courts seems straightforward, in practice, it could lead to unresolved issues.
“BI-6 could have the effect of prohibiting the governor from appointing judges to fill vacancies on an interim basis until an election can be held. Or, it could affect the appointment of judges to oversee specialty courts,” the court said in its decision. “The question, however, is not how BI-6, if passed, should be interpreted, but whether the voters could readily understand the effect of (it).”
It also pointed out that not every “judicial office” in Montana is elected.
“Other statutorily created courts of limited jurisdiction, including the water court, workers’ compensation court, city courts and small claims courts have appointed judges,” the ruling said. “It is conceivable that voters may have differing opinions as to whether judicial elections should be nonpartisan and whether it should be required that courts created in the future have elected judges.”
Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts were represented by Raph Graybill and Rachel Parker of the Graybill Law Firm in Great Falls, and Alex Rate of the American Civil Liberties Union of Montana.
A nearly identical case appealed to the high court by another group proposing a nonpartisan judicial ballot initiative, CI-131, has yet to be ruled on. The attorney general similarly rewrote the ballot language on that initiative, brought by Montanans for Fair and Impartial Judges. MNC joined MFIJ in their appeal.

This story by Alex Driehaus and Liz Sauchelli was first published in the Valley News on Nov. 18, 2025.
FAIRLEE — A multi-year project to stabilize a rock ledge on Interstate 91 is expected to be completed in mid-December.
The stabilization project was scheduled to be completed by Friday of this week, but is running a few weeks behind schedule, said Bruce Martin, Vermont Agency of Transportation project manager. The $15 million project is still on budget.
“Besides a few delays, this project is going fairly well with so much that needs to be done,” Martin said.
The I-91 southbound lane between exits 15 and 16 that is nearest to the rock ledge will remain closed until the project is completed.
“We will not be shutting down the interstate entirely like we’ve had to earlier this year,” Martin said.
Workers are currently in the process of attaching wire mesh sheets to the ledge, which is 700-feet wide and is as much as 400-feet tall, Martin said.
The process of installing the steel mesh is intense and time consuming. Workers must drill holes deep into the rock ledge, then install rebar posts “20 feet — sometimes further — into the slope itself,” Martin said. Workers then fill in the holes with grout.
All that work must be done before the mesh sheets — around 40 of them — can be helicoptered in. “The steel material we’re using … it’s heavy,” Martin said, estimating that the mesh sheets are about 700 pounds each.
He noted that it is the largest rock cut in the state. “We’re trying to take care of it now so we don’t have to take care of it in the future,” Martin said. “It’s going to be stable for a very, very long time.”

Washington served up a new license plate Wednesday, honoring the state sport of pickleball.
In the works for three years, it is the second of seven specialty plates to hit the market since getting approved by lawmakers earlier this year.
“We’re thrilled to see our efforts become reality,” said Kate Van Gent, vice president of the nonprofit Seattle Metro Pickleball Association, the force behind the plate. “The goal has always been to celebrate the sport created here in Washington and enjoyed across the state.”
Pickleball is a tennis-like sport played with wooden paddles and a plastic ball. It was named the state sport under a 2022 law signed by then-Gov. Jay Inslee, in a ceremony at the Bainbridge Island home where the sport was invented in the 1960s. Today, it is one of the fastest-growing sports in the country.
Van Gent and fellow association leaders began pursuing a plate in 2023. Gathering the required 3,500 signatures on petitions was easy. Getting a law passed wasn’t. They came up short in 2023 and 2024
This year, state lawmakers included the pickleball plate in an omnibus bill pieced together and passed by overwhelming margins in each chamber. It is named “Bill’s Bill” for Sen. Bill Ramos of Issaquah, one of those leading the legislative effort, until his unexpected death a week before the session ended.
It is one of 13 specialty plates authorized in the law. Seven are getting phased in now. The timeline for the other six is tied to other factors, such as submitting signatures.
A set of pickleball plates will run $157.25, a bit more if you want to personalize them. After covering the state’s production costs, a portion of the fee will go to the sponsoring nonprofit.
Proceeds received by the association will be used for building and maintaining dedicated public pickleball courts.
In the days leading up to Wednesday’s launch, the association conducted an auction for the privilege to buy one of the first plates available. Those funds will go entirely to the association for its work to develop courts and promote the sport, Van Gent said.
Bees, a bear and a volcano
Earlier this month, the state licensing department rolled out a throwback plate design, featuring white letters and numbers on an all-black background. It had sold 177 by Nov. 4
A plate used briefly in the early 20th century had a similar design, according to the agency. Proceeds from the retro plates will go toward expanding and improving driver education.

Pollinators will star on the next new plate, though a release date isn’t set. The Washington State Beekeepers Association will use money raised for research and educational activities about honey bees. 
After that, a plate sponsored by the LeMay car museum in Tacoma is expected. Any funds generated will go toward education and job training related to automobiles. 
There is less clarity on when three other plates will become available.
A plate showcasing Mount St. Helens, Washington’s most active volcano, awaits a redesign after the first one failed testing.
The state Department of Transportation tests specialty plates to ensure they can be read by traffic cameras. Sometimes the colors or the size of the graphics can interfere. If that happens, changes are made, approved by the sponsoring organization, and the plate retested, officials said.
For two others, negotiations are taking place with the Department of Licensing and the state agencies sponsoring them.
One of those, Keep Washington Evergreen, will support the deployment of electric vehicle charging stations. Sponsored by the Department of Commerce, this plate will have green lettering on a white background similar to a design available in the 1970s. 
The other one on hold is a Smokey Bear plate, proceeds from which will be directed into wildfire prevention programs. This comes from the Department of Natural Resources, where former public lands commissioner Hilary Franz first championed it. 
Plates issued under the state’s new law will join the nearly 70 different special license plates in Washington recognizing the military, sports teams, colleges, farmers, orcas, lighthouses, square dancers and wine. Fees vary, with the money generally going to causes tied to each plate.
The 13 new plates will be the last for a while. The law, Senate Bill 5444, imposes a moratorium on the state Department of Licensing processing applications for additional plates until 2029. 
Six plates in the pipeline
Other specialty plates in the works include:

A working forests plate to support the Washington Tree Farm Program. That program helps certify small landowners who practice sustainable forestry.
A nautical northwest plate to celebrate Whidbey Island’s maritime communities. Money raised would go to Whidbey Island Maritime Heritage Foundation and Historic Whidbey.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-20 01:20:34+00:00,CT Mirror,"Judge remands gas rate case to PURA, refers state attorneys to ethics committee",John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/19/pura-marissa-gillett-rate-case-avangrid-remand/,New Britain Superior Court judge referred two attorneys representing PURA to the Statewide Grievance Committee to assess whether they misled the court.,"A judge overseeing the tumultuous legal battle between the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority and two Connecticut gas companies on Wednesday agreed to allow a do-over of the companies’ most recent rate case after regulators admitted to a series of longstanding procedural errors by PURA’s former leader, Marissa Gillett.
At the same time the judge, Matthew Budzik of the New Britain Superior Court, referred two attorneys representing PURA to the Statewide Grievance Committee to determine whether they misled the court earlier this year during an effort to uncover Gillett’s personal phone records.
The decision was only a partial victory for the gas companies, Southern Connecticut Gas and Connecticut Natural Gas, which are both owned by Orange-based Avangrid. 
The lawsuit began as an appeal of PURA’s decision last year to slash the companies’ revenues by a combined $35 million, but it has since evolved to focus largely on Gillett and the actions she took while running PURA between 2019 and her resignation in October. In particular, Avangrid’s attorneys were looking into whether Gillett played any role in drafting a controversial op-ed last year accusing utilities of spreading “propaganda” — and whether she lied about her involvement.
After Gillett stepped down, PURA offered to resolve the lawsuit by reconsidering the companies’ request for a rate increase. But Avangrid sought to continue looking into allegations involving Gillett. 
During a hearing last week, Perry Rowthorn, an attorney representing the company, said, “all of these issues remain in play, and we need to get to the bottom of it.”
Budzik, the judge in the case, was more skeptical of that argument.
By sending the case back to PURA for new proceedings in the underlying rate case — this time with a new cast of commissioners recently appointed by Gov. Ned Lamont — Budzik said questions about the former chair’s alleged bias were moot.
His decision also quashed efforts by Avangrid’s attorneys to depose the two authors of the op-ed: state Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-Westport, and state Sen. Norm Needleman, D-Essex.
“The court does not have a roving commission to authorize investigations into matters that may be of interest to the parties, or to the public,” Budzik wrote in his opinion. 
In a statement Wednesday, Avangrid spokeswoman Sarah Wall Fliotsos said Budzik’s ruling was “unequivocal.”
“Under former Chair Gillett, PURA violated state law in order to achieve the outcome they wanted, one that exacted severe financial and reputational consequences for our companies, risked our customers’ experience of safe and reliable service, and harmed the public interest,” Fliotsos said. “Nor are these consequences limited to this rate case appeal alone, but they have permeated cases since 2023: it is clear from this decision that PURA must now fix them all.”
Budzik did say further investigation was warranted to look into the actions of two state attorneys involved in the case: PURA General Counsel Scott Muska and Assistant Attorney General Seth Hollander. 
The judge’s concerns arose from statements those attorneys made about their efforts to recover text messages from Gillett’s phone that she exchanged with the authors of the op-ed.
A spokeswoman for PURA didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday evening.
Attorneys for the utilities first sought access to those texts in February, after several exchanges between Gillett and Steinberg discussing an op-ed were published by the Hartford Courant.
In their initial responses to those requests, attorneys for PURA said they could not find copies of the text messages. In an affidavit on June 6, Muska said he had asked both Gillett and her chief of staff to search their phones in an unsuccessful effort to locate copies of the text messages.
It was not until a hearing on June 23 that Hollander acknowledged to the court that Gillett had an auto-delete function on her phone rendering the sought-after texts irrecoverable.
“Moreover, and even more troubling, is that the circumstances of this case indicate that PURA actively sought to conceal the fact of the auto-delete function from opposing counsel and from the court,” Budzik said. “Attorney Hollander admitted that PURA was aware of the auto-delete function when it provided its initial discovery responses on May 1, 2025, and that someone at PURA chose to omit the fact of the auto-delete function from PURA’s initial discovery responses.”
Budzik went on to say that he had concluded Muska had intended to mislead both the court and opposing counsel in his June 6 affidavit. He added that he had no reason to believe that Hollander was personally aware of the deletion of texts, but he “ought to have made more reasonable and diligent inquiry of his client.”
In an phone interview with the Connecticut Mirror on Wednesday, Muska said that he first found out about Gillett’s auto-delete functions in mid-May, at which point he relayed his findings to Attorney General William Tong’s office. It was only after “much discussion” within that office, Muska said, that the decision was made not to reveal the auto-delete function to the court.
Asked why he did not mention his findings in his sworn affidavit, Muska said he was “tailoring” the affidavit based on cues he received from the attorney general’s office.
“The judge does not have, or does not appear to have, a full factual record of the case,” Muska said. 
A spokesperson for the attorney general’s office declined to comment on Budzik’s order Wednesday. Told later of Muska’s comments, the spokesperson, Elizabeth Benton, referred to a letter Tong sent earlier this month defending Hollander from criticisms from Senate Republicans.
“Assistant Attorney General Hollander is a dedicated public servant who has distinguished himself over many years by providing vigorous and diligent representation to his agency clients, including in many appeals where he has defended decisions by PURA to reject the utility companies’ requested rate hikes,” the letter read.
“Like many experienced attorneys, Mr. Hollander does his very best to represent his client agency in often complex and difficult matters, and he must advise his clients and represent their interests zealously, even when his clients have been accused of doing something wrong. It is highly inappropriate and unfair to hold Mr. Hollander responsible for the alleged actions of his clients, and to second guess his actions as a lawyer and an advocate.”
The Statewide Grievance Committee is a branch of the state’s judiciary established to review and adjudicate ethics complaints against attorneys. 
Steinberg, the lawmaker who was one of the authors of the op-ed, reiterated his previous assertions Wednesday that he had not discussed the op-ed with Gillett prior to its publication in the Connecticut Mirror on Dec. 19. However, he said he did not know whether she discussed it with his co-author, Needleman.
Needleman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. Gillett has repeatedly denied, including under oath, they she helped to draft the piece. 
Steinberg said he was relieved by the judge’s ruling, which he said he hoped would “close this chapter” and allow PURA to return its focus on other pressing issues, such as Connecticut’s high cost of electricity and investment’s in the region’s power grid.
“It’s really a shame that we’re so distracted when there’s do much work to be done,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1027_SR_Pura_042-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-19 20:57:47.943561

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)The Ohio House passed a bill that would require Ohio public schools to show a video produced by an anti-abortion group about fetal development to students during Wednesday’s House session. 
Ohio House Bill 485, also known as the “Enact Baby Olivia Act,” would require schools to show either the ‘Baby Olivia’ video or a similar video to students every year starting in fifth grade all the way up through twelfth grade beginning with the 2026-27 school year.

The bill, which now heads to the Ohio Senate, would also require showing students an ultrasound video at least three minutes long. 
All Ohio House Democrats present at Wednesday’s session voted against the bill. 
Ohio State Rep. Melanie Miller, R–Ashland, introduced the bill less than two months ago. 
There is an opt-out portion of the bill allowing parents to request in writing that their child be excused from watching the video. 
“This legislation strengthens science education in Ohio’s public schools by giving students a clear, age appropriate and factual understanding of early human development,” Miller claimed.
“The development of human life is truly beautiful. It is science. It is complex. It’s intricate, and it’s worthy of being taught.” 
The three-minute “Meet Baby Olivia” video was produced by Live Action, which advocates against abortion, and it shows fertilization and fetal growth.
Planned Parenthood calls the “Baby Olivia” video “inaccurate, misleading, and manipulative.” 
Planned Parenthood notes that the video counts the embryo’s age from conception, which doctors do not do; claims a fetal heartbeat can be detected at six weeks despite there not being a heart formed and this sound actually an electrical flutter where the heart will later form; and inaccurately displays the look of the embryo, mischaracterizes its activity, and leaves out critical information about at what point it can survive outside the womb. 
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has issues with the bill, saying the video shows gestational age two weeks earlier than stars and shows fetal development as more advanced than it is. 
A medical student and a doctor questioned the scientific accuracy of the Baby Olivia video during testimony. 
Ohio State Rep. Beryl Brown Piccolantonio, D-Gahanna, proposed an amendment that would have restricted showing the video only to high school students, but it was not added to the bill.
“It will limit it to grades 9-12, so that our students would at least have the ability and maturity to properly contextualize watching a video that was created by CGI and that is not medically accurate,” she said. 
Ohio Right to Life celebrated the House passing the bill. 
“Showing students how a baby grows in the womb isn’t and shouldn’t be controversial,” Ohio Right to Life Executive Director Carrie Snyder said. “It’s simply science.”
Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio condemned the Ohio House for passing Ohio H.B. 485. 
“H.B. 485 does nothing to address Ohio’s high teen birth rate and STI rates, and instead forces school children to watch false medical information about sex education that is inappropriate at any age or grade, especially for elementary students,” Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio Executive Director Lauren Blauvelt said. 
Ohio is one of a handful of states without comprehensive sex education standards taught in schools.
Ohio’s curriculum stresses abstinence as a general policy and requires some instruction about sexually transmitted infections, according to the Ohio Revised Code. 
“I think the first step is establishing what through science we want to make sure we’re teaching our children,” state Rep. Phil Robinson, D-Solon, said. 
Similar bills have been introduced in more than 20 other states so far this session and Idaho, Kansas, North Dakota, Tennessee, Iowa, and Indiana have enacted similar bills into law. 
Abortion is legal in Ohio up until fetal viability as determined by a patient’s physician. Ohio voters passed an amendment to the Ohio Constitution in 2023 that added protections to abortion care and reproductive rights to the state’s constitution.

(Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)Alaskans who qualify for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program received half of their benefits nearly a week late as a result of the federal government shutdown this month. Their full benefits were two weeks late, even though the state had emergency funds to prevent that.
Officials say the state never used the $5 million per week it set aside to keep people from waiting for food benefits because the state’s system had to be reconfigured to use state money rather than its usual federal funding source. SNAP is a federal food assistance program that is run by the state.
Division Director Deb Etheridge said the state is now prepared to react quickly if a similar situation arises in the future.
“We went through all the steps we needed to create an opportunity for a state-only benefit to be issued through our EBT contractor,” she said. “So in the event that anything like this happens again, we can move swiftly to issue that state-only benefit.”
Gov. Mike Dunleavy signed an emergency order declaration on Nov. 3, following a request by state legislators and similar action by other states. 
Etheridge said information technology and system operations teams had to scramble to come up with solutions, but by the time they found a way to get money to Alaskans, the federal government had begun to partially fulfill its obligations. 
She said the state was closing in on a solution when the federal government released 50% of the money for benefits on Nov. 4. She said that money was processed and ready for Alaskans to spend by Nov. 6.
Etheridge said the eligibility technicians that process benefits were not excessively burdened by the shutdown.
“Eligibility workers were doing business as usual, processing cases and managing, obviously, increased phone calls — people wanted to know where their benefits were,” she said. “The pressure came on our system operations and our IT.”
The shutdown delayed service in a state division with a history of slowdowns in recent years. The DPA has battled long backlogs in processing food benefit applications as a result of staff shortages and technology issues since 2022. The division made progress against its backlog before slipping again in 2023. Paperwork slowdowns kept thousands waiting again earlier this year.
Etheridge says the division is currently working to make sure people displaced by the October storms in Western Alaska continue to receive benefits, even if they have lost access to critical paperwork.

Former department employees said the videos, recorded in 2018, were shared widely on an encrypted WhatsApp group chat. The footage provides a deeper look into the culture of the jail, where a recent investigation by Mississippi Today and The New York Times revealed that guards and jail administrators routinely beat inmates.
In one video, Larry Buckhalter stands before the camera in his prison jumpsuit and a party hat and sings “Happy Birthday” to “Barry,” an apparent reference to Barry Vaughn, the former head of the jail who is now undersheriff.
In the second video, someone off camera instructs Buckhalter to “tell him you love him.” 
“I love you, Barry!” he says, and gleefully announces it is his last day in jail. 
As he speaks, a man in uniform standing behind him slams a plastic sign to the floor. Startled, Buckhalter jumps and screams as people off camera laugh.
The videos were created days after Buckhalter had asked jail guards for a Coke in October 2018. Shortly after his request, the guards strapped him into an electrified vest, intended to keep violent inmates under control. Then they filmed him screaming and convulsing while they shocked him.  
“Now you get a Coke!” a female guard says at the end of the video. “It’s all over! I’m so proud of you, Larry!”

In an email, department attorney Jason Dare said that Buckhalter, who died in 2021, had a crack cocaine problem, but was “never found to be mentally incompetent by a court or health care professional.” 
“Larry celebrated countless birthdays and life achievements at the Rankin County Jail,” Dare wrote. “He never went hungry and was never brutalized, both of which he claimed were regular occurrences in the free world.”
Dare continued: “Although Larry could not give his side of the story for your article, these videos perfectly show his genuine affection for the RCSD. The fact you try to spin it as mockery is shameful.”
Laquanda Anderson and Derrick Shoto, Buckhalter’s niece and nephew, reviewed the videos and Dare’s response. They said their uncle lived with an obvious intellectual disability.
“Everybody knew he had a mental issue,” Anderson said. “And when people find that out, they take advantage of it.”
Buckhalter never mentioned these incidents, they said, but he told them he was afraid to return to the jail, saying that guards there called him “Crying Larry.” 
“He hated it at the jail,” Shoto said, adding that in the videos, “they’re clearly treating him like a puppet.”
Last week, Sean Tindell, commissioner of the Mississippi Department of Public Safety, called the video of Buckhalter being shocked “appalling and utterly unacceptable.”
Mississippi Bureau of Investigation agents have been assigned to investigate the incident, he said.
Last week, The New York Times and Mississippi Today revealed that for years, jail officials had beaten and whipped inmates who broke jail rules or inconvenienced guards. 
More than 70 former inmates, along with former deputies and jail guards, described experiencing, witnessing or participating in the violence. Their allegations were supported by medical records, photos of injuries and department reports along with the cellphone recording of guards shocking Buckhalter.
After seeing the video of Buckhalter that accompanied the original investigation, two former deputies told reporters that additional videos of guards mocking Buckhalter had circulated over encrypted group messages. 
“They made the rounds,” said one of the two former deputies, Christian Dedmon.
Dedmon was one of five former Rankin County deputies and a local police officer — some of whom were part of a patrol shift called the “Goon Squad”— who were sentenced to federal prison last year for torturing three men. 
A 2023 investigation by Mississippi Today and The Times revealed that nearly two dozen residents experienced similar brutality from deputies during drug raids over nearly two decades.
Last year, reporters also uncovered an encrypted WhatsApp group chat where members of the Goon Squad shift traded pictures of rotting corpses and joked about rape and shocking people with Tasers.
One former Rankin deputy, who requested to remain anonymous because they feared retaliation from the department, shared the two new recordings of Buckhalter with reporters.
That former deputy, along with two former guards, said the video showing Buckhalter being shocked and the video of him singing Happy Birthday were both filmed in the office of Amanda Thompson, who was a jail lieutenant at the time and still works at the department. 
The former employees also said the third video was filmed in the office of Kristi Pennington, Sheriff Bailey’s wife, who also works at the department.

Deb Fisher in 2024.,"Dan Osborn speaking at the Omaha Education Association building while accepting the endorsement of the Nebraska State Education Association on Nov. 19, 2025. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — The former labor leader running for U.S. Senate in Nebraska got endorsed by the state’s largest teachers union. 
The Nebraska State Education Association endorsed registered nonpartisan Dan Osborn in his Senate bid against Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts. 
The endorsement comes months earlier than the last time Osborn ran for Congress against GOP U.S. Sen. Deb Fisher in 2024, which happened in the run up to the general election. NSEA President Tim Royers said it was “very important” for the union to lay “a marker down early” for a candidate who cares about public education.
“It’s really become clear to us how important these federal races are … candidly, it wasn’t something that we felt in the last election cycle,” Royers said. “The biggest thing is there’s a very clear contrast in candidates in this race.”
Royers said NSEA members have shown their ability to mobilize voters in communities of varying size — pointing to ballot measures that they helped organize and can help Osborn “move the needle in a demonstrably positive way.” Osborn called the endorsement “huge.”

Osborn, a former Omaha labor leader, said he hoped local union members could knock on some doors for his campaign in the summer and help get his political message out across the state. 
He lost to Fischer by six percentage points, but his bid made him a national political name. His style of populism — focused on the working class, union organizing and kitchen table issues — has been copied by other independents seeking office in other states.
The Osborn-Ricketts race has been heated, with both spending much of the campaign criticizing one another.  That continued Wednesday, with Osborn criticizing Ricketts voting for Trump’s tax and spending bill for a provision that allowed the state to opt into a federal tax credit program for donating to scholarship-granting organizations for private K-12 schools — an idea Osborn called a “national school voucher scheme.” Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen opted into the program this year. 
“Our teachers deserve better support, better compensation and the respect that comes from doing the most important job in our society,” Osborn said. “My support for public schools means listening to the people who do the work every single day.” 
Ricketts and groups tied to the Senate GOP have spent much of the race so far trying to characterize Osborn as a Democrat. The Ricketts campaign had no immediate comment on the endorsement. The U.S. Senate general election is Nov. 3.

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)GOLDSBORO, N.C. — State Auditor Dave Boliek said Wednesday he wants his office and other statewide elected offices to have more input in North Carolina’s hurricane recovery efforts for the ongoing Helene rebuild and future disasters.
Boliek, a Republican, said he was recommending a “partnership” between lawmakers and all 10 elected statewide offices to revamp the state’s long-term response to natural disasters.
“I do think the entire Council of State needs to be brought in, along with legislative leadership, to assist in this,” Boliek said.
The auditor’s comments came during a press conference after his office released a report on ReBuild NC — the state’s long-embattled recovery program for eastern North Carolina established under former Gov. Roy Cooper, also known as the North Carolina Office of Recovery and Resiliency or NCORR — that has experienced a budget deficit, untracked spending and years-long homebuilding delays.
His office detailed extensive bureaucracy errors within ReBuild NC that delayed construction, did not properly track payments to contractors and left survivors waiting in temporary housing and hotels for years. Those issues have been the subject of extensive reporting by NC Newsline and Inside Climate News.
In his recommendations and public remarks, Boliek called for broader changes to how North Carolina recovers from all disasters — changes that would involve input from his office and the rest of the Council of State, which includes five Republicans and five Democrats.
“I’m standing here as an elected official, telling you I’m willing to move this ball down the field and move it forward on behalf of the people of North Carolina,” he told reporters Wednesday. “And I have a real conviction and belief that the other members of the Council of State will step right up to the plate and join in, along with our legislative leadership.”
That could mean taking measures like establishing “key performance indicators,” or measurable metrics, to track government contractors, he said.
Boliek said he believes those changes need to start “immediately” as the state recovers from Hurricane Helene in western North Carolina. A new, separate homebuilding program, called Renew NC, is repairing and rebuilding homes in the mountains, and will use up to $1.4 billion in federal money.
Officials leading Helene recovery efforts have repeatedly said the state has learned from mistakes made by ReBuild NC in eastern North Carolina. As of Wednesday evening, the western rebuilding effort, Renew NC, has 4,700 active applications; five homes have been completed and six others are under construction.
Lawmakers have pushed officials to speed along the process, which state officials say has been complicated by slow federal approval.
“We don’t want to stand up here eight years from now and give a similar report about how an agency failed the people of North Carolina because they didn’t have their financial house straight,” Boliek said.
Boliek did not, however, commit to a similar investigation into the Helene operation, saying it would be “unfair” to do so early on.
“We’ll give them a chance, make sure that they can get some results,” Boliek said.
The auditor’s office, which has seen a boost in funding and staffing from GOP lawmakers since Boliek’s election, has already sought to play more of a role in disaster oversight, creating an online dashboard that tracks Helene spending.
Other members of the Council of State have roles to play during disaster recovery, including agricultural aid, insurance assistance and stopping price gouging. But under the current structure of state government, the governor’s office and executive branch control much of the day-to-day recovery process.
“Since taking office in January, Gov. Stein has been committed to completing NCORR’s mission and getting people back into their homes,” a spokesperson for Stein’s office said in a statement to NC Newsline. “We are reviewing the report and will continue to work with NCORR to implement any needed improvements.”
Auditor’s report on ReBuild NC: A ‘logistical nightmare’
Boliek’s report tread on largely the same ground as prior news reporting and findings by legislators, outlining a program that he described as “a disaster from the start” and a “logistical nightmare.”
Applicants took an average of 936 days to get through just one of eight steps under the program, he said, and some families remained in temporary housing for more than 1,400 days.
Boliek focused in particular on contracts and line items for software and technology, like $25 million for a Salesforce platform that “really didn’t do the job for them,” he said. And while he believes that the state needs to continue partnering with the private sector, he said, “you can’t outsource governance.”
“We have to have management from the state level,” he said, calling for “reasonable expectations” with contractors.
During its investigation into ReBuild NC, Boliek said his office consulted with Craig Fugate, who led FEMA under the Obama administration. Fugate said ReBuild NC “spent a tremendous amount of time on process, when their job was swinging hammers.”
The head of ReBuild NC, in a letter to the auditor’s office dated Monday, said the agency had “significantly improved” its financial management and other processes, and has “actively shared lessons learned” with those leading Helene recovery efforts.
“NCORR continues to implement process improvements with regards to strengthening vendor management, local governments and construction vendors,” wrote Pryor Gibson, a longtime Cooper advisor and former Democratic lawmaker who now leads ReBuild NC.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)One of South Dakota’s top lawmakers said Wednesday that it may be time to move beyond financial incentives and consider new regulations on agriculture to address the state’s polluted rivers and lakes.
“I think it takes more than the carrot to address this,” said State Senate President Pro Tempore Chris Karr, R-Sioux Falls.
Karr said he doubts the problem will be appropriately addressed “until we get serious about some different types of regulations.”
“And that’s pretty scary for folks, especially for those that are in the community that starts with the letter ‘A’ and ends with ‘G,’” Karr said. “We can sit here and talk about it, and dance around it all day. I think you can have some incentives, but we’re going to have to look at some restrictions as well, and regulate.”
He made the comments during a meeting of the Legislature’s Executive Board at the Capitol in Pierre.
The board had requested a report from the Legislative Research Council on surface water quality in South Dakota. Council analyst Lance Nixon presented the memo to the board. It says that over three-quarters of monitored river and stream miles in the state fail to fully support at least one of their intended uses — such as swimming, fishing or boating — with similar problems in many lakes.
80% of tested surface water in South Dakota fails to meet state standards

House Majority Leader Scott Odenbach, R-Spearfish, pointed to long-running concerns such as high bacteria levels in surface water and the draining of wetlands. He said the state’s approach feels a century out of date, and he urged his colleagues to consider a more in-depth, future study on water quality.
Nixon’s memo highlights pollutants including sediment from highly erodible soils, fertilizers and chemicals from farm fields, mercury that falls from coal power plant emissions, and bacteria from livestock waste. It also flags emerging concerns about Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS, aka “forever chemicals”), the potential loss of federal environmental funding, and a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that makes it easier to drain wetlands.
Sen. Liz Larson, D-Sioux Falls, said the report proves what she has observed for years on the Big Sioux River. She cited E. coli levels above safe thresholds in the river, noting that much of the problem stems from livestock waste entering the river upstream.
“It’s been a problem for a long time, and I’ve not seen anybody interested in doing anything about it,” Larson said.
Karr referenced a bill he successfully sponsored in 2021. It allocated $3 million to help landowners contain livestock waste and plant buffer strips along streams that filter polluted runoff and reduce erosion. A recent final report on that program said it resulted in 67 buffer projects spanning 83 linear miles under 10-year contracts. The buffers prevent an estimated 1,500 pounds of phosphorus, 6,500 pounds of nitrogen and 1,000 tons of sediment from entering the Big Sioux River watershed each year.
Jay Gilbertson is the manager of the East Dakota Water Development District. In an interview with South Dakota Searchlight, he acknowledged the buffer program’s success but said he worries about what will happen when the contracts expire.
“I don’t know that we can sustainably keep giving out bigger carrots to the landowners who have participated,” Gilbertson said.
During the public comment section of Wednesday’s meeting, several people urged legislators to take Black Hills water issues seriously, warning that things like degraded streams and low summer flows are undermining water quality and trout fisheries. Hans Stephenson, who owns Dakota Angler and Outfitter in Rapid City, said he hopes lawmakers treat watersheds as “critical infrastructure” worth restoring.

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)A federal judge on Wednesday issued a preliminary injunction that blocks the enforcement of several direct democracy-related laws against Arkansas groups collecting signatures to qualify proposed ballot measures for the 2026 ballot.
The League of Women Voters of Arkansas and ballot question committee Save AR Democracy filed the original lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the laws against Secretary of State Cole Jester in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas in April.
Judge delays decision in lawsuit affecting Arkansas direct democracy 

U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks allowed two other ballot question committees, Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids, to intervene in the case in July. Both sets of plaintiffs filed motions for a preliminary injunction, and the court held a hearing on the motions in late September. 
Opponents of the laws, which govern the state’s petition and referendum process, argue they make it too difficult for citizen-led initiatives to qualify for the ballot and violate the First Amendment. Supporters of the laws have said they help maintain the process’ integrity and avert fraud. 
In Wednesday’s 77-page ruling, Brooks granted in part and denied in part the motions for a preliminary injunction. “Because the claim against him is moot,” Brooks also dismissed Attorney General Tim Griffin who intervened as a defendant in the case. 
“We’re reviewing the order and considering our next steps,” Griffin’s spokesperson, Jeff LeMaster, said in a text message Wednesday evening. 
Brooks preliminarily enjoined, pending a final disposition on the merits, the secretary of state, who is responsible for overseeing elections, and his officers from:

Disclosing or facilitating disclosure to any member of the public any information provided by Plaintiffs or Intervenor-Plaintiffs pursuant to the Pre-Collection Disclosure Requirements of Arkansas Code § 7-9-601 
Enforcing Act 602 against Protect AR Rights, including by finding its petition insufficient based on the reading level of the petition’s ballot title 
Enforcing Act 241 and 453 against Plaintiffs, including by invalidating signatures, finding petitions insufficient, or pursuing criminal charges based on noncompliance
Enforcing Acts 218, 240, and 274 against Plaintiffs or Intervenor-Plaintiffs, including by invalidating signatures, finding petitions insufficient, or pursuing criminal charges based on noncompliance.

“In the General Assembly’s book, high rates of signature invalidation under the existing, highly regulated petition validation system are only evidence that the system has failed, not that the system has worked,” Brooks wrote. “These high rates of invalidation are used to justify more regulation, which will inevitably result in even higher rates of invalidation, justifying even more regulation and steadily chipping away at the right to direct democracy enshrined in the Arkansas Constitution.” 
Although the U.S. Constitution does not guarantee direct democracy, it does safeguard a person’s right to participate in public debate through politics, and many of the laws challenged in the lawsuit “likely infringe on this right,” Brooks wrote. 
“We’re delighted that the judge agrees with us that these laws are unconstitutional on their face,” said Bill Kopsky, Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids treasurer. “We think we can prove that as the case goes on, and this gives us the ability to collect signatures without these unconstitutional laws preventing Arkansas citizens from exercising their rights.” 
Brooks’ ruling blocks new state laws, for now, that prohibit ballot titles from being written above an eighth-grade reading level; require canvassers to file a “true affidavit” certifying they complied with the Arkansas Constitution and state laws related to petition signature procurement; and require paid canvassers to be permanent residents of Arkansas.
Additional laws subject to the injunction include two that require canvassers to inform potential signers that petition fraud is a criminal offense and request a photo ID from them, and one that requires potential signers to read a petition’s ballot title or have it read to them.

(Photo by Petty Officer 2nd Class Holly Hugunin/U.S. Coast Guard)The recent Alaska Beacon op-ed, “Alaska’s coastal communities deserve a say in geoengineering of our oceans,” offers exactly the kind of leadership and perspective the world needs right now. Alaska’s coastal and Indigenous communities are reminding us that the ocean is not an inexhaustible resource—it’s home. 
Alaska sits squarely on the front lines of a changing ocean, where declining Arctic sea ice, increasingly frequent harmful algal blooms, and the devastation of storms like Typhoon Halong show how rapidly life defined by the sea is being reshaped. With their wealth of local knowledge, coastal Alaskan communities can offer valuable insights as to whether a method of marine carbon dioxide removal, or mCDR, which leverages natural ocean processes to remove a key greenhouse gas from the atmosphere, is feasible or futile. 
The scientific rationale for exploration of mCDR as part of a comprehensive effort to address a changing climate is clear. The ocean already absorbs about one-third of human-caused carbon dioxide and more than 90% of the excess heat trapped by greenhouse gases. Microscopic phytoplankton take up much of that carbon dioxide and produce roughly half of Earth’s oxygen through photosynthesis. They also form the foundation of marine food webs, sending large amounts of organic carbon into the deep ocean where it can remain stored for centuries.
In many regions, however, phytoplankton growth is limited by a lack of iron. That’s why scientists, including those involved in the Exploring Ocean Iron Studies group known as ExOIS, are investigating the impacts of adding small amounts of iron to stimulate blooms that might capture and sink carbon. Early experiments have hinted at promise—potentially hundreds of tons of organic carbon removed for each ton of iron added—but left critical questions unanswered about how long that carbon remains stored, and what harmful or beneficial ecological effects could follow.
Today, robotic floats, autonomous vehicles, satellites, and advanced biogeochemical models allow scientists to study these processes with unprecedented precision. We can now begin to test whether ocean-based carbon removal can work safely and durably at scale. But technology alone isn’t enough. Before carbon markets and industrial actors become more influential, we must build a three-legged stool of science, community engagement, and sustainable governance—each essential, none sufficient on its own.
That’s why the Community Leaders and mCDR, or CLaM, project is such a vital and timely step. By establishing a framework for local and Indigenous governments to participate directly in ocean-climate research, CLaM ensures that those closest to the coast have both a voice and a seat at the table. It recognizes that community input is not a procedural hurdle but the foundation of trust.
The scientific community is beginning to reflect that same ethic. Our consortium at ExOIS is advancing cautiously and transparently, guided by principles rooted in the Asilomar International Conference on Climate Intervention Technologies, which emphasized openness, public oversight, and a readiness to stop if risks outweigh potential benefits. By doing so, ExOIS demonstrates that scientific rigor and social responsibility can reinforce each other rather than compete.
Together, CLaMS and ExOIS show how this field can mature responsibly–and it is growing rapidly. Commercial demand for ocean-based carbon removal is surging, with credit sales already reaching 795,000 tons in mid-2025. As ventures race toward the billion-ton scale, financial incentives will inevitably favor speed over transparency, accountability, sustainability, and community input. If global market demand outpaces sound governance, it will be too late to retrofit trust.
Fishing communities and marine scientists in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest carry a special weight. They built a globally respected model of careful marine-resource management. They are also living the reality of ocean change. Their voices—and their leadership—are urgently needed now. As ocean climate solutions come of age, the science-based guardrails and ocean management institutions of the North Pacific—deliberative bodies that include people who depend on and steward these waters—are essential guides to shape future governance of a fast-growing new ocean industry.

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/19/jeffrey-beckham-opm-step-down-josh-wojcik/,"Gov. Ned Lamont to tap Josh Wojcik, key health policy leader in the state comptroller’s office, to lead the Office of Policy and Management.","State Office of Policy and Management Secretary Jeffrey Beckham of Tolland, a veteran fiscal policy administrator who stabilized Gov. Ned Lamont’s budget agency three years ago following a bribery and extortion scandal, will step down from the post before year’s end, according to a source.
Lamont is expected Thursday to name Josh Wojcik of Brooklyn, a key health policy leader in the state comptroller’s office, to succeed Beckham at the helm of OPM, the executive branch’s chief fiscal and policy planning agency.
A fiscal conservative, Beckham has been one of Lamont’s chief allies in defending the state budget caps that helped reverse years of deficits while eliminating a huge portion of Connecticut’s hefty pension debt.
Since Lamont took office in January 2019, Connecticut has dedicated $10 billion in surplus funds to its pensions for state workers and municipal teachers and another $3.3 billion to help build one of the largest rainy day funds in the nation.
Beckham joined the Lamont administration in April 2019 as OPM’s undersecretary for legislative affairs. 
But his career in state policy development and administration spans more than three decades and involves all three branches of government.
He served as staff counsel and director of communications in the Department of Administration from 2011 through 2019.
Beckham’s first stint at OPM ran from 2007 through 2010 under then-Gov. M. Jodi Rell, when he also served as undersecretary for legislative affairs. He also was a managing attorney at the state Department of Public Works from 2005 to 2007.
Prior to serving in the executive branch, Beckham spent 14 years as an attorney in the nonpartisan Legislative Commissioners’ Office, helping to draft legislation related to environmental, energy, commerce and fiscal issues. And he began his state service in the judicial branch as a temporary assistant clerk in superior court.
Lamont appointed Beckham as OPM secretary on March 11, 2022, shortly after the governor’s first budget director, Melissa McCaw departed to become East Hartford’s finance director.
McCaw, Connecticut’s first Black OPM secretary resigned more than three years ago shortly after news reports that the FBI had subpoenaed records of construction projects and grants overseen by her former deputy, Konstantinos Diamantis.
A federal jury last month found Diamantis guilty of using his former position overseeing Connecticut’s school construction financing program to enrich himself and his family.
The jury specifically found Diamantis, 69, guilty of 21 counts of bribery, extortion, conspiracy and lying to federal investigators.
Wojcik is a veteran of the comptroller’s office since 2019. 
He has led the Health Policy and Benefits Services Division since 2022, overseeing benefits for more than 270,000 public sector workers, retirees, dependents and other individuals. The division manages a $2 billion health and welfare benefits budget.
Wojcik was a key figure behind several prescription drug benefit reforms and negotiations to secure major savings in pharmaceutical and other health care costs.
He also led efforts to develop Open CT, the state’s online portal to promote easy public access to fiscal data.
Wojcik, who served as a policy and budget analyst for the state Senate Democratic Caucus prior to his tenure in the comptroller’s office, holds a bachelor’s degree in international relations and a master’s of public administration from the University of Connecticut.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0205_SR_BudgetDay098-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-19 19:56:33.665005
,California,2025-11-19 23:48:59+00:00,CalMatters,UC continues annual tuition hikes despite student appeals. Here’s how much it will increase,Mikhail Zinshteyn,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/11/uc-tuition/,"The model regents approved allows the system to increase undergraduate tuition and systemwide fees by as much as 5% annually, depending on inflation, and locks in that rate for students enrolling that year for up to six years.","In summary
The model regents approved allows the system to increase undergraduate tuition and systemwide fees by as much as 5% annually, depending on inflation, and locks in that rate for students enrolling that year for up to six years. 


The University of California has renewed its policy of annual tuition hikes today after the UC Board of Regents voted 13 to 3 to approve the measure, despite fierce opposition from undergraduates.Broadly, what undergraduates will expect to pay for tuition doesn’t change once they enroll. The model regents approved still allows the system to increase undergraduate tuition and systemwide fees by as much as 5% annually, depending on inflation, and locks in that rate for students enrolling that year for up to six years.  
Each cohort of incoming students pays the same tuition, but what they pay is more than the previous year’s cohort, and less than what the next cohort will pay. This means that current undergraduate students would see no change to their tuition. Graduate students, however, would continue to see annual increases because they’re not on the cohort model.The revised plan begins in 2026-27.This “stability” plan is a way to ensure UC can collect more revenue to finance the ever-increasing costs of educating students that signals consistency and predictability to students and their families, UC officials contend. The approach is a departure from a boom-and-bust cycle at UC in which tuition stays flat for several years until recessions and state cutbacks prompt double-digit tuition spikes in consecutive years. That happened during the 2007 Great Recession. After six years, tuition had doubled.
The regents first adopted this cohort tuition model in 2021 and it took effect in 2022. Since 2021, tuition for entering undergraduates has risen from $12,570 to $14,934 this year. UC first began charging tuition in 1970 — the enrollment fees were $450.Students were livid in 2021 and remained so today.“Students should not be fighting for our lives,” said Diego Emilio Bollo, president of the undergraduate student association at UCLA. He spoke at a rally today with dozens of students opposing the tuition plan and said the UC should look elsewhere for money. “The UC should be fighting in Sacramento and in Washington, DC. And the students are not the UC’s backup budget plan.”
UC says 98% of California students with household incomes below $60,000 and who applied for financial aid don’t pay tuition, though student advocates say some undergraduates still fall through the cracks.
Regent Michael Cohen, who helped to secure more financial aid for UC students when the board voted to launch the cohort plan in 2021, said he supported the model today because tuition stays flat for individual students for up to six years after they see a tuition hike once. To him, that means students get an increasing discount, as tuition stays flat while inflation rises.Cohen added that the revenue from the tuition increases allowed the UC to enroll 15,000 more new California undergraduates. “That’s remarkable,” he said. State aid alone couldn’t have given more Californians access to the UC, he noted.
But Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis vehemently opposed the continuation of the tuition increases. She said these decisions should be reviewed at least annually, not left alone for years at a time. “Our students sleep in their cars. Our students go to food banks in order to be able to eat,” she said. “I think that any time we raise tuition, we should be going back and understanding whether or not we’ve done every other possible thing to avoid raising tuition.”The original plan proposed today would have led to endless ongoing tuition increases. But students and some regents were critical of the cohort model continuing without end, so the board voted to revisit the model in seven years.Guided by UC Office of the President officials, the board also lowered from 45% to 40% the share of new tuition revenue that flows to undergraduate financial aid. When regents installed this tuition hike plan, the return-to-aid figure was 33%.Counterintuitively, this means that low- and moderate-income students got thousands more in financial aid to cover tuition and additional living costs under these tuition increases than they would have had the UC not increased tuition. On the other hand, higher-income students, those from families with incomes above $120,000, generally paid hundreds of dollars more for their cost of attendance because they get less financial aid, median data from UC show. UC projections show that those trends will continue through the end of the decade.Still, some higher-income students receive UC grants from return-to-aid. For example, a quarter of students whose families make between $147,000 and $184,000 received a UC grant in 2023-24. Students receive financial aid based on a federal formula that takes into account household income, money in certain financial accounts and untaxed income, such as life insurance payouts and inheritances.About half of in-state undergraduate students at UC live in households with incomes below $120,000, UC data show.Funneling a portion of tuition increases to financial aid has resulted in an extra roughly $1 billion in financial aid for students, a UC finance official said today. Overall, 35% of UC undergraduates from California take out loans to attend the system and the average debt has been constant at about $17,000, said Shawn Brick, who heads financial aid, at the regents meeting. 
UC budget struggles
The drop in return-to-aid is a way to route more funding to campuses that have been rocked by federal cutbacks tied up in legal battles and state support that is less than Gov. Gavin Newsom and the state Legislature had indicated the UC would receive in past years.Already, the UC is enrolling about 4,000 more California students than the state is giving them money for. Because of this, UC reported that it brings in less money per student to educate them than the system collected four years ago — down to $28,000 from $30,000.Nearly 800 employees have been laid off across the UC system this year, UC President James B. Milliken said. “These layoffs reflect the seriousness of the financial pressures we are navigating,” he said this morning. 
UC has also fought to recover 1,600 federal research grants that the Trump administration suspended or terminated. While many have been restored through court orders, 400 are still defunded, totalling $230 million, Milliken said. Meanwhile the UC has sued to halt Trump from changing a formula for how much campuses receive in grant funds to maintain labs. At stake is another half-billion dollars. That money supports jobs and regional economies; the UC is the state’s second-largest employer.
UC officials persuaded the regents to make other technical changes that increase the odds that tuition for the next cohort would rise more than it has so far, but tuition increases would still be capped at 5%.One allows UC to defer the financial impact if inflation exceeds 5%. In that case, the percent that is above 5% would be applied to a future year when the inflation rate is lower. 
 Had this plan been in place since 2022, tuition would have risen by 1.5% more than it did this year, UC finance staff said.
The UC Regents also agreed to include another one-percentage-point increase in cohort tuition that would be dedicated to building maintenance or another campus need. Still, tuition increases wouldn’t exceed 5%. The system regularly asks for hundreds of millions in money but often gets much less. The system is able to issue bonds for new construction, but the amount is limited. 
In the original plan today, the additional revenue from this 1% bump would have been limited to structures that service students. Now, the extra 1% can be used by campus chancellors for other spending priorities. The system has a deferred maintenance backlog of $9 billion, UC officials said today.The UC student association said capital projects shouldn’t be paid for with tuition dollars. “We urge the Board to reject the proposed 1% step increase, or commit to dedicating a portion of the revenue to go to vital student supports, such as basic needs, retention programs and health services,” the group wrote in a public letter. 
Some students fall through the cracks
Even with generous financial aid, some California students at UC still incur hardship and a bureaucratic runaround. 
Joshua Mata entered UC Berkeley in 2019 intent on taking on no debt. He arranged to pay a friend $300 to use the parking spot in her apartment building to park a used van he bought  to sleep in. The friend provided him with a key to her apartment so he could bathe.He was no stranger to residing in cars — housing stability was sporadic after he moved to California to attend community college. A year into his studies, he received in-state tuition status. His story is unusual: He lived with his father in China, who taught English, until Mata graduated from high school and moved back to the U.S. to live with his grandmother for a year in Texas before driving to California.  
After three years at community college, he transferred to California’s top public university, thinking he’d retain his in-state residency status and the much lower tuition bill, with financial aid to both cover his enrollment fees and some extra money for living costs. A half-semester later, he dropped out: The campus rejected his in-state claim and froze his financial aid, leaving him with a roughly $40,000 bill, he recalled.He wishes the campus gave him more of a heads up during the summer so he could have cleared the issue before school started. “Maybe I’d have a degree by now,” he said.Though he re-enrolled in 2023, students with unique financial issues such as Mata must also be looked out for, said Alexis Zaragoza during public comments today. Zaragoza was a UC student regent when the UC board approved the cohort tuition model. While she opposed it, she led board members in increasing how much new tuition revenue flows to financial aid.
“Dozens of those students go through residency and income appeals, but those processes take months– sometimes up to 6 or 7 months, to be resolved. For low-income and even homeless students– those months are crucial. Many students drop out to avoid $30,000-plus charges, but are still charged them,” she said.Asked whether the additional revenue from tuition would flow toward more student services positions such as financial aid staff or those that deal with residency disputes, UC spokesperson Omar Rodriguez wrote in an email that “any new funding generated for operating support will be used at the discretion of each location to meet their local needs.”
A few dozen students briefly shut down the meeting on the vote today after they shouted prewritten slogans at regents condemning the ongoing tuition increases. The regents asked UC police to declare an unlawful assembly and a row of police clutching batons and wearing helmets with facial shields assembled as the students left the meeting chamber. There was no confrontation between police and protesters.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111925-UC-Students-Tuition-Hike-March-MZ-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-19 18:57:50.630980

Cory Mills for numerous allegations, including violations of campaign finance laws and sexual misconduct or dating violence.The investigative subcommittee will look into six different possible rule violations, including that Mills: Didn’t disclose required information to the House.Violated campaign finance laws in 2022 and 2024.Improperly requested or received gifts related to official travel sponsored by a private group.“Received special favors by virtue of his position.”Committed sexual misconduct or dating violence.“Misused congressional resources or status.” Mills, first elected in 2022 to represent the state’s 7th Congressional District, has previously denied many of the allegations made against him during his brief time in Congress. The committee noted that the formation of an investigative subcommittee “does not itself indicate that any violation has occurred.”Rep. Mace seeks censureThe Ethics Committee’s launch of an investigation came just hours after South Carolina Republican Rep. Nancy Mace introduced a censure resolution against Mills on the floor. The House voting to formally censure Mills would not remove him from Congress but would strip him of his assignments on the Armed Services and Foreign Affairs committees. Mace said during a floor speech her censure resolution addressed elements in an Office of Congressional Ethics investigation into Mills that included several allegations, including that the companies he owns hold contracts with the federal government while he remains a member of Congress. Mace’s censure resolution rebuked Mills for saying he holds a Bronze Star for heroism related to his time in Iraq, stating that “Retired Brigadier General Arnold N. Gordon-Bray has stated he did not personally write, read, or sign the Department of the Army Form 638 recommending Representative Cory Mills for a Bronze Star.”The resolution goes on to state that “five people who served with Representative Cory Mills, including two men who were reported as having been personally saved by Representative Cory Mills at great risk to his own life as a basis for the recommendation for his Bronze Star in the Department of the Army Form 638, disputed that Representative Cory Mills was involved in their rescue or provided life-saving care.”The censure resolution also references instances of alleged dating violence by Mills, including a judge issuing a protective order.Mills did not directly defend himself from the allegations made by the Ethics Committee or in the censure resolution but posted a statement on social media from his chief of staff and general counsel, Catherine Treadwell. “General Bray authorized and approved this award and any assertion that I signed General Bray’s paperwork without authorization is at best uninformed and at worst is offensive slander,” Treadwell wrote.The House Ethics Committee doesn't issue timelines for concluding its investigations, which often take months or even years.",,,,2025-11-19 18:57:50.630980

Full benefits for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, were issued Monday, according to the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services.
November benefits were delayed by the government shutdown that ended last week. Some of North Dakota’s 56,000 SNAP recipients received partial benefits before Congress reached a deal to fund the government.

Stacie Loegering, executive director of the Emergency Food Pantry in Fargo, said the interruption forced some people to find money for food elsewhere, leaving some bills unpaid. She said getting back on track financially will be a challenge for people with little wiggle room. 
“This is going to last for months,” Loegering said. 
She said the food distribution center on Nov. 3 set a one-day record for the number of people it helped with groceries. That Monday, 180 people received food. And in that first week of November, the pantry served twice as many people as normal, she said. 
The government shutdown began Oct. 1. As it lingered, Loegering said the pantry stocked up, anticipating increased demand. She said the public also helped, with increased donations at grocery stores. 
“People were hearing the need,” Loegering said. 
Community donations accounted for 59% of the pantry’s food in 2024, according to its annual report.

Great Plains Food Bank spokesperson Darby Njos said last week the nonprofit that supports food pantries across the state expects to distribute 60% more food in November and December than normal. 
The deal to end the government shutdown included funding for SNAP and children’s nutrition programs, including school meals, and the availability of food during summer school breaks.
But there is some uncertainty about SNAP eligibility. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has said recipients will need to reapply for the program to keep receiving benefits. 
North Dakota Health and Human Services Director of Economic Assistance Michele Gee said in an email Wednesday that the agency is aware of discussions about reenrollment for SNAP participants, but there has been no confirmation or guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The state agency has information about SNAP eligibility on its website.
People can also contact the agency by email at applyforhelp@nd.gov or by phone Monday-Friday, 8 a.m to 5 p.m. Central Time at 866-614-6005 or 701-328-1000. People can also contact a local human service zone office.

(Photo via Getty Images)The Iowa Board of Education is taking public feedback as it crafts rules for implementing several state education laws signed in 2025 — including one addressing fetal development education.
The board took several actions during its meeting Wednesday on rulemaking as directed by the Legislature earlier this year. This included beginning a period of public comments for rules on two laws signed by Gov. Kim Reynolds, Senate File 175 on fetal development education, and House File 295 on community college accreditation.
Democrats had opposed both measures during the legislative session. The law on fetal development instruction was modeled after laws in other states that directly reference the “Meet Baby Olivia” video made by the anti-abortion group Live Action. Iowa’s law requires human growth and development classes for students in grades 5-12 include visuals, such as ultrasound video or computer-generated renderings or animations that depict “the humanity of the unborn child by showing prenatal human development, starting at fertilization.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The measure also includes a ban on showing materials about fetal development from entities that perform or “promote” abortions, or which contracts, affiliates, or makes referrals to providers that perform or promote abortions.
Democrats and reproductive health care advocates say the law is a means to promote anti-abortion material in public schools, and could lead to the distribution of medically inaccurate information. These concerns were heightened by the ban on materials from institutions that perform or refer patients for abortion care, as the law does not exclude information from organizations that provide abortions when medically necessary or allowed under the state’s six-week abortion ban.
Thomas Mayes, general counsel for the Iowa Department of Education, introduced the proposal to amend parts of Iowa Code to implement these requirements — as well as making a clarification that the state’s ban on materials with descriptions or depictions of sex acts in K-12 schools does not conflict with the fetal development instruction requirements.
Mayes said in its current form, the rulemaking proposal is “strictly in line with the statute,” and does not contain any “elaboration” on parts of the law that could be in question.
“If there should be some elaboration, that would be have to be generated through public comment,” Mayes said. “So the proposal before you is to put this out for public comment, to allow folks to react to it — is the rule the third bowl of porridge, is it too hot, too cold or just right? And if it’s too hot or too cold, how should it be corrected, consistent with the underlying statute?”
Law limits accrediting agencies
The other law posted for intended rulemaking action was on state universities and community colleges, and accrediting bodies’ ability to take action against community colleges for following certain state laws. The measure states accreditors cannot take adverse actions against Iowa higher education institutions for following or refusing to break state law — and states that if a public higher education institute is “negatively affected by adverse action” for such a violation, the state attorney general can authorize bringing a civil action against the accrediting agency in question.
The rulemaking change would allow more accrediting agencies to sanction public higher education institutes. Under previous Iowa law and rules, the Higher Learning Commission was the only named agency able to perform this duty. The proposed change “broadens the menu of accreditors to any federally recognized accreditor that (the board) in the future may have approved,” Mayes said.
Both of the rulemaking proposals are open for public feedback before implementation. Public hearings will be held Dec. 30 at the Grimes State Office Building, in addition to having video conferences available. Public comments can also be emailed to Mayes.

Federal prosecutors have formally put a former Stowe man charged in the 2023 fatal shootings of two Massachusetts men in Vermont on notice that they are seeking the death penalty against him.
The prosecutors had said during a hearing in Theodore Bland’s case last month in federal court in Burlington that they had received approval from U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi to pursue the death penalty.
On Tuesday afternoon, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Vermont formally filed their notice in court that they would be seeking Bland’s execution, if he were to be convicted of the capital crimes he is facing.

The three-page filing alleged that Bland, 30, committed each of the killings “in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner in that it involved torture or serious physical abuse to the victim.” Charging documents also stated that Bland carried out the killings during drug trafficking crimes. 
The filing comes a little more than two years after authorities found the bodies of Jahim Solomon and Eric White in the woods of Eden, about a mile apart, on Oct 25, 2023. Both men had been shot in the head. 
The last time an execution took place in Vermont was in 1954. The state has since done away with its death penalty statute but Bland’s case was brought under federal law, which permits capital punishment for certain crimes. 
The families of Solomon, 21, of Pittsfield, Massachusetts, and White, 21, of Chicopee, Massachusetts, had reported them missing days earlier saying they had traveled to Vermont. 
Prosecutors in Bland’s federal case alleged that the killings occurred Oct. 12, 2023, when “Bland’s firearm discharges caused the deaths” of both men “in relation to a drug trafficking crime.” 
Attorneys Bruce Koffsky and David Sleigh, who both represent Bland, declined comment Wednesday on the latest filing by prosecutors.
Bland’s is the second case in which federal prosecutors in Vermont are seeking the death penalty against a defendant since President Donald Trump took office in January and lifted a moratorium on the death penalty in federal cases. In August, federal prosecutors in Vermont filed capital charges against 21-year-old Teresa Youngblut, formerly of Washington state, who has been charged in the shooting of a border patrol agent in northern Vermont in January.
Both Youngblut and Bland are in custody as the cases against them are pending.

Amid the final dismantling of the state's motel program in July, 69A became a safe space for all in need of shelter and community. Now, the community space's landlord has other plans for the property.

This story by Virginia Ray was first published in The Commons on Nov. 18, 2025.
BRATTLEBORO — Come Dec. 6 when the lease runs out, the community art space on Elliot Street known as 69A will be closing. “We absolutely love our landlords, they’re amazing people,” said 69A Director Lisa Marie, about building co-owner Ashok Kumar. “Our lease is up and they have plans for this space, and the building’s for sale.”
The building at 69–71 Elliot St. went on the market in May and is listed for $1.15 million through the Southern Vermont Realty Group of West Dover. Lister records show the building has been owned by Kumar and Amrik Singh, under A&S Realty Trust, since 2008.
A caring place during a time of need
69A has certainly blossomed since artist Katie Bachler and her husband, Scott Berzofsky took out a one-year lease to make a community space.
Bachler and Berzofsky tapped into their savings to rent the space last winter in the aftermath of the national election and last year’s contentious local debate over “acceptable community conduct.” Without knowing the exact contours of how the space would actually be used, the former owners of Avenue Grocery did know they wanted to restore a community gathering place in the same spirit of the community convenience store that they briefly ran on Western Avenue in 2017 and 2018.
“We thought something was missing, a place for new ways of being to emerge, to care for each other, [to] provide something else, something emergent,” Bachler told The Commons at the time. “Like a space that could be an alternative to the behavior ordinance. Like a space to organize different ways of being, to learn from each other.”
She and Berzofsky started slow with a loose group of community members organizing events — book clubs and art shows at first — with the intention not to “over-prescribe what 69A was going to be.” Marie eventually opened the “10 to 4” program, referencing the hours 69A is open. The initiative offered two meals a day, a free store, and advocated “for people to get what they need.” 
Amid the final dismantling of the state’s motel program in July for those who were unsheltered and the already acute homelessness epidemic in the region, 69A became a safe space for all, offering free coffee, tea, water, Wi-Fi access, various gear and supplies (including tents, sleeping bags, flashlights, and clothing), restrooms, music and a social milieu.
The number of folks served varies from day to day. On Nov. 17, about 73 folks stopped in for various needs. Last week, the facility served 130 people in one day. About 50% of the people who use the facility are housed, and the other half are homeless. Ages range from infants to about 80.
The program has occasionally been controversial, with critics concerned that it was attempting to provide social services to a clientele its volunteers were not trained to treat. Others were concerned about altercations that required police help to address, and the space became a concern at several Selectboard meetings this summer.
Marie says 69A is not a shelter. “We’re not even technically a drop-in [place],” she said. “We’re just a community center” — just without the basketball hoop.
Lots to do, but where to do it?
As organizers begin the search for a new home, Marie also has eye on the present. 
“Winter’s coming and it’s really cold, and people are sleeping on pavements and benches and doing everything to survive,” Marie said. “And we’re going to do the best we can to provide what they need to make that happen.”
She is training overnight hosts for the new winter shelter, which will open at the Beloved Community Church in Brattleboro on Dec. 1. And until the group has to move, organizers will endeavor to keep regular hours weekdays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
“We’re looking for a space and have had meetings with potential landlords, so we’ll see,” Marie said, adding that if a new location isn’t found before Dec. 6, she and others will do what they can to help by car and foot. “Just ’cause the doors on 69A Elliot St. are closing doesn’t mean that we’re done.”
One person has already died from the cold this winter, Marie said. “People dying because they’re homeless is an absolute crime. Whether it’s not being able to pay a bill, or having an addiction, or running from a domestic situation, none of it deserves death in the end.”
Selectboard member Isaac Evans-Frantz attends meetings at 69A and does what he can to bring concerns back to the town. “I’m deeply concerned for the well-being of the people who have found community and warmth at 69A Elliot St. over the past several months,” Evans-Frantz said. “There are hundreds of unhoused people living in Brattleboro, including many who do not have adequate, safe shelter.”
Evans-Frantz said the town as a whole can make a start by minimizing harm against unhoused community members.
“I’ve requested that the issues of no-trespass orders and removal of homeless encampments be placed on selectboard meeting agendas this fall,” he said. “At a time of federal cruelty against people living paycheck to paycheck, and against people in extreme poverty, Brattleboro must do better.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)With some lawmakers again accusing the Utah Supreme Court of “legislating from the bench,” a legislative committee on Wednesday advanced a bill meant to fix a government immunity issue that its sponsor blamed on “judicial incompetence.” 
In its last committee meeting before the Utah Legislature’s 2026 general session in January, the Government Operations Interim Committee voted unanimously to endorse a draft bill being sponsored by a member of House Republican leadership, House Majority Leader Casey Snider, R-Paradise. 
Snider, who has worked as a firefighter, is running the bill meant to make clear in Utah law that government employees including first responders like firefighters and paramedics have broad government immunity from lawsuits while providing emergency medical services. 
Snider said it’s been long understood that the state’s existing government immunity laws already widely protected first responders giving medical assistance — but he said the Utah Supreme Court turned that precedent on its head when earlier this year it issued a unanimous opinion in August remanding a lawsuit over a response to a 911 call, Armenta v. Unified Fire Authority, back to district court. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Snider and others supporting the bill — including attorneys for the Utah League of Cities and Towns and local fire chiefs — said that ruling now leaves paramedics, firefighters and other first responders vulnerable to “frivolous” lawsuits. 
The Utah Supreme Court, “out of some sort of unanimous malfeasance, I would say,” Snider said, found that “somehow now Unified Fire and all firefighters and all EMTs and all paramedics in the state are now liable for damages as they pursue protecting our communities.” 
“Let me be totally clear. Our Supreme Court has made our communities less safe,” Snider said. 
Having worked as a firefighter and emergency medical technician for 15 years, Snider said he and other first responders now worry that, because of the Utah Supreme Court’s ruling, they have to “operate under the assumption that even if I do everything right I am still somehow liable.” 
“Now that is in the back of the minds of every firefighter and every EMT in this state,” Snider said. 
Jared Tingey, legal director for the Utah League of Cities and Towns, said the league “fully supports” Snider’s bill. 
“We think the Supreme Court got it dead wrong and this fixes those changes,” he said. 
Armenta v. Unified Fire Authority
The court case at the center of Snider’s bill and his complaints with the Utah Supreme Court was filed by a plaintiff named Jorge Armenta against the Unified Fire Authority, Utah’s largest fire agency that serves more than a dozen cities and unincorporated areas.
Armenta sued after medical technicians with Unified Fire Authority responded to a 911 call from his wife, who called dispatchers after Armenta experienced shortness of breath and chest pain. The first responders evaluated Armenta and told him his condition appeared normal, suggesting he had experienced a panic attack and that he didn’t need to go to the emergency room. 
But a week later, Armenta was hospitalized for a “massive heart attack,” according to court documents. During surgery, doctors found a “100% blockage of Armenta’s right coronary artery,” the Utah Supreme Court opinion said, and Armenta believed that his injuries “will likely lead to heart failure and early death” unless he gets a heart transplant. 
Armenta sued Unified Fire Authority for negligence, alleging the damage to his heart would have been avoided if the authority’s medical technicians had “properly and timely diagnosed and cared for him.” 










Let me be totally clear. Our Supreme Court has made our communities less safe.


– House Majority Leader Casey Snider, R-Paradise


Unified Fire asked the court to dismiss the case, arguing that Utah’s governmental immunity law protected it from being sued for giving Armenta emergency medical aid. The trial court agreed and dismissed the case. 
Armenta appealed to the Utah Supreme Court, asking it to decide whether Utah’s governmental immunity law protected Unified Fire from being sued for providing Armenta emergency medical assistance. 
In August, the Utah Supreme Court unanimously decided that the district court’s interpretation of “emergency medical assistance” was incorrect, having only looked at dictionary definitions of each word rather than looking at all of the words within the overall structure and context of the statute. 
Using a latin legal principle called “noscitur a sociis,” meaning “it is known from its associates,” the Utah Supreme Court determined that because the Legislature placed the term “emergency medical assistance” in a list with other activities like fighting fires and responding to natural disasters, the law says governments are protected when they provide “emergency medical assistance” during those types of listed emergencies. 
Redistricting ruling: Utah judge picks plaintiffs’ congressional map, blocks Legislature’s

The court also determined that the “constitutional avoidance principle” supported its conclusion, and that under that principle, the court presumed the Legislature did not intend for statutes to raise constitutional doubts. The court determined that if “emergency medical assistance” meant a response to a 911 call, that could raise questions about citizens’ access to open courts, which is a right guaranteed by the Utah Constitution. 
The court ultimately agreed with Armenta and reversed his case’s previous dismissal, remanding it back to district court for further proceedings. 
Snider and other lawmakers sitting on the Government Operations Interim Committee — including Sen. Brady Brammer, R-Pleasant Grove — argued the Utah Supreme Court should have simply relied on the historical public record to determine the Legislature’s intent when it first passed the government immunity law decades ago. 
“Sometimes it’s not that complicated. It’s either clear in the language or it’s clear in the legislative intent, and it’s written in the legislative intent,” Brammer said. 
He argued the court did “mental gymnastics” to arrive at its conclusion. “I don’t know how they got here. It’s bizarre to me,” he said. “I’d love to ask them about it.”
Brammer — who has been critical of the state’s judiciary in the past — also said he’s concerned that “this was missed by five justices and they opined on it unanimously.” 
“That’s a big red flag on our Supreme Court,” Brammer said, “and whether they’re actually interpreting statute or just starting out with lip service and then doing what they want.” 
Another lawmaker, Rep. Matt MacPherson, R-West Valley City, raised concerns about what would happen without Snider’s bill and if lawmakers let the Utah Supreme Court’s interpretation stand. He worried that it could not only create a chilling effect on emergency responders in their day-to-day work, but also lead to increased costs to local governments and taxpayers. 
No Democrats sitting on the committee voiced any opposition to Snider’s bill and they all voted along with Republicans to endorse it for the 2026 legislative session, teeing it up for quicker consideration through the legislative process when lawmakers convene Jan. 20. 
Ongoing feud with the judiciary
Snider’s bill comes amid Utah lawmakers’ ongoing feud with the state’s judicial branch. It addresses another ruling multiple Republican lawmakers have disagreed with, criticizing the court’s interpretation of the law and arguing that the Utah Supreme Court’s five justices are ignoring “plain language” in Utah law or the Utah Constitution and are instead creatively misinterpreting it. 
Utah judge faces impeachment threats after ordering congressional map with 1 Democratic seat

In recent months, conservative legislators have been outraged by a series of court rulings, most recently in the state’s yearslong redistricting legal battle. Last week, 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson sided with the plaintiffs in that lawsuit, rejecting a congressional map submitted by the GOP-controlled Utah Legislature and instead picking an alternative map drawn by the plaintiffs that creates a Democratic-leaning congressional district in northern Salt Lake County. 
At least one Republican legislator, Rep. Matt MacPherson, has said he plans to pursue articles of impeachment against Gibson, alleging she ignored a provision in the Utah Constitution that says that the Legislature “shall” redistrict. 
However, Gibson’s ruling was largely based on a previous, unanimous Utah Supreme Court decision last year that remanded the case back to her courtroom. That ruling made clear that the Utah Legislature’s powers have limits when it comes to altering or repealing “government reform” ballot initiatives. 
Utah’s redistricting court case largely revolves around Proposition 4, a ballot initiative narrowly passed by Utah voters in 2018, which established an independent redistricting process meant to guard against gerrymandering. 
Based on the Utah Supreme Court’s ruling, Gibson in August ruled that the Legislature overstepped when it turned Proposition 4’s independent redistricting commission into an advisory body that lawmakers could ultimately ignore. 
She also ordered a “remedial” court process to pick a new map to replace the 2021 congressional map she voided as the result of an unconstitutional process. When Gibson picked one of the plaintiffs’ maps, she ruled the Utah Legislature’s preferred map failed to adhere to Proposition 4 to the greatest extent practicable. 
Utah judiciary issues rare statement addressing threats against judge in redistricting case

Since Gibson’s ruling — which legislative attorneys have said they intend to appeal back to the Utah Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary — Utah’s Republican legislators and the Utah Republican Party have been accusing Gibson of “judicial activism” and violating the separation of powers between the legislative and judicial branches. 
Some have also questioned whether her actions could amount to “malfeasance,” which under Utah law is an impeachable offense. 
The political rhetoric has become increasingly heated. Earlier this week the Utah judiciary issued a rare statement saying Gibson has received violent threats. That statement also urged Utahns to respect existing avenues to appeal judges’ rulings and encouraged support of the institution and its public servants. 
“Utah’s courts provide a structured and transparent system for reviewing decisions and correcting potential errors, reinforcing public confidence in the integrity of the judicial process,” the judiciary said. “We encourage all Utahns to stand with the Judiciary in protecting the safety of our judges and employees and protecting the fair and impartial administration of justice.”

County commissioners passed a resolution to oppose nuclear waste storage, and in support of putting the issue to a statewide vote.
The post Energy-rich Campbell County wants nuclear, but not its radioactive waste appeared first on WyoFile .","Top officials in one of the nation’s most energy-prolific counties — home to uranium mining, oil, natural gas and the most productive coal-mining district in North America — are cautiously supportive of the nuclear energy industry’s burgeoning interest in northeast Wyoming. 
But they don’t want its radioactive waste.
The Campbell County Board of Commissioners passed a resolution Tuesday stating the body will not support storing nuclear waste locally. That’s in line with state law, which currently prohibits nuclear waste storage. In anticipation that could change, the Campbell County resolution urges state lawmakers to allow “citizens to vote on the matter of high-level nuclear waste storage.” 
The five-member commission voted 4-1 in favor of the position, with Commissioner Jim Ford casting the single “no” vote. The county solicited public input on the matter for several weeks and redrafted the resolution multiple times, most recently during a Nov. 13 workshop. Commissioner Jerry Means said he proposed the resolution amid growing interest in Wyoming from nuclear energy companies, as well as often intense public debate about nuclear energy’s risks and benefits.

Opponents of the resolution, before and after Tuesday’s vote, warned it may send a signal to the industry, and to BWXT in particular, that it is not welcome in the community. While the company’s proposal to build a nuclear fuel manufacturing plant in Campbell County does not involve radioactive waste or storing such materials, nuclear energy companies are sensitive to local opposition, according to Gillette-based L&H Industrial President Mike Wandler. He’s frequently credited for the industry’s recent interest in setting up manufacturing shops in Wyoming.
“So any resolutions against nuclear, they’re going to take very seriously,” Wandler recently told WyoFile. “They’re just going to go away and find someplace else to bring those jobs and to bring that revenue.”Wandler and other nuclear energy industry supporters note that people sometimes conflate BWXT’s plans in Campbell County with a different proposal in Natrona County. Radiant Industries, unlike BWXT, did include storing spent nuclear fuel, but the California-based company scrapped its plans to build a nuclear microreactor manufacturing facility in October. The company cited a lack of “regulatory certainty” about whether the state would further loosen its ban on nuclear fuel waste storage — a key change in law needed to accommodate Radiant’s plan to store spent fuel from its microreactors at a campus outside the town of Bar Nunn.


Wyoming nuclear waste ban
Wyoming has flirted with the prospect of nuclear fuel waste storage for several decades and, so far, has stuck with a ban on storage — with one exception. Lawmakers passed House Bill 131, “Nuclear power generation and storage-amendments,” in 2022 to accommodate TerraPower’s Natrium nuclear plant being built near Kemmerer. That exception allows nuclear power plants operating in the state to “temporarily” store their own radioactive waste. But it doesn’t allow waste from nuclear power plants outside the state.Lawmakers have considered loosening the ban further.
House Bill 16, “Used nuclear fuel storage-amendments,” would have potentially opened Wyoming’s doors to decades of nuclear waste that’s been accumulating at the nation’s nuclear power plants. That measure was rejected earlier this year along with Senate File 186, “​​Advanced nuclear reactor manufacturers-fuel storage,” which would have accommodated Radiant’s proposal. An attempt to revive similar legislation between sessions this year was tabled.


Reached for comment after the resolution was passed, BWXT said it isn’t shying away from Campbell County.
“The resolution does not impact our proposed plans for a TRISO fuel fabrication facility in Gillette as our facility will neither create nor store high-level nuclear waste or spent nuclear fuel,” BWXT Advanced Nuclear Fuels Senior Director Josh Parker told WyoFile via email.
Meantime, some in favor of the resolution noted previous legislative attempts to allow spent nuclear fuel waste in Wyoming. Industry skeptics have also expressed fears that the federal government might force either an interim or permanent storage facility in a community that doesn’t want it.
“We all know laws can be changed every year,” Means said. “So this is basically getting out ahead of what I see for the future for Campbell County, because I do see people in our county, right here, [who] think that maybe we need to accept nuclear waste.”
The resolution
The commission’s 2-page resolution declared adherence to “the following guidelines regarding nuclear waste storage in Campbell County.”

No interim nuclear storage — domestically produced or relocated; 
No consolidated interim storage — domestically produced or relocated; 
No deep geological repository (caverns); 
No deep geological repository (bore hole); 
No exemptions granted for interim or consolidated storage, or geological repositories.

But what authorities or policy tools the county might use to enforce the guidelines are unclear.

According to the resolution, the commission “supports the development and siting of the nuclear industry in Campbell County, if such facilities do not produce, receive, or store nuclear waste, except what is currently permitted by Wyoming law as of the date of this resolution.” 
“We can’t override the state or the federal government,” Means told WyoFile. “It basically lets the community know that, as commissioners, we choose not to accept nuclear waste and spent fuel from [the nation’s] legacy waste. It really has no [legal] backbone.” 
It also notes that “current Wyoming law does not allow for the people to vote on the specific issue of nuclear waste storage,” and resolves that “the Campbell County Board of Commissioners supports any change in state law that would allow citizens to vote on the matter of high-level nuclear waste storage.”
Though several Wyoming lawmakers suspect there will be another attempt in the upcoming budget session to crack the door open wider for nuclear waste storage, it’s unclear whether there might be forthcoming legislation to allow for some kind of public referendum on the issue.

“Our resolution essentially says that, ‘Yeah, the Legislature should change the law to allow the citizens to vote on the issue,'” Commissioner Scott Clem, a former Wyoming representative, told WyoFile.
Radiant fallout
While opponents cheered Radiant’s pullout from Natrona County, the move shook many in the business community, particularly at the state level.
Gov. Mark Gordon pinned the blame on the far right of the Wyoming GOP.
“Members of the Freedom Caucus inspired ‘Club No’ convinced Radiant that Wyoming isn’t about leadership and problem solving,” Gordon said in a prepared statement in October. “‘Club No,’” he continued, “has ushered in a new culture of no matter who began or who commenced it, we’re against it. That is not the way Wyoming became the great state it is.”
Though it was not directly part of the Governor’s Business Forum agenda last week in Laramie, Radiant’s exit was a topic of discussion in the hallways and sometimes on the stage.
Many attendees “[are] mad about a certain project in the Natrona County area,” Wyoming Business Council Chief Executive Officer Josh Dorrell told the audience of about 500. “Why did we lose that? Because the vocal minority.”
For its part, the business council is ramping up efforts to garner support for nuclear energy development in Wyoming, according to Dorrell, both in general and for BWXT’s project in Campbell County, in particular. 
The state is putting its financial might behind the project as well. 
The Wyoming Energy Authority has recommended a $100 million state grant to support BWXT’s TRISO fuel manufacturing project. The grant, if approved by Gordon, would be the first and sole recipient of Wyoming’s Large Project Energy Matching Fund, created in 2024. 
The agency is accepting public comment on the grant recommendation through Nov. 25. Public comments can be sent to wea@wyo.gov.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)TAMPA — Legislation signed into Florida law in 2022 that changed how long juveniles can be held in pre-trial detention before adjudicatory hearings has led to a “drastic reduction” in crimes such as auto robberies, a top law enforcement official said Wednesday.
“There were kids 13, 14, 15-years-old prolifically across Florida who were out stealing cars, breaking into cars, breaking into cars taking guns, and it’s a big problem,” said Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, speaking during the Florida Association of Counties legislative conference in Tampa. 
Previously, Gualtieri said, there were “no consequences” for misbehaving juveniles regarding such crimes, because the longest that a judge could hold them in custody was 21 days. “That’s it. The court lost jurisdiction. They could not hold a kid from the time the kid was arrested and trial was two years down the road,” he said. “Those kids didn’t care. … They got out and they just committed more robberies or more burglaries.”
That’s all changed following the passage of HB 7029 in 2022, he continued. That law allows courts to extend the detention period for juveniles in 21-day increments for serious offenses, although with the requirement that separate hearings be held to determine the need to continue those detentions.
“It was a sea change,” Gualtieri said, praising former Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Secretary Eric Hall for his work on the legislation. (Hall left the agency earlier this year to become president of Pasco-Hernando State College).
No push for a school safety package in 2026
Gualtieri, legislative committee chair for the Florida Sheriffs Association (FSA) and chair of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission, said that this will likely be the first year since the Parkland school shooting in 2018 that there won’t be a push for a major school safety package when the Legislature begins its regular session in January.
“The schools in Florida today are much safer than they were in 2018,” he declared.
Gualtieri mentioned other proposals that the FSA will advocate for in the legislative session.
One would allow law enforcement officers to access a specific legal database to determine whether a citizen is disqualified from legally possessing or carrying a concealed firearm because of mental health or substance use problems as adjudicated by a court.
A second proposal would add the tranquilizer called Xylazine (also known as “tranq), a non-opioid sedative increasingly being found in the illegal drug supply and linked to overdose deaths, to the state’s trafficking statute.
A similar measure easily passed both chambers during the 2025 session but ultimately withdrawn from consideration. (In August, Attorney General James Uthemier reclassified Xylazine as a Schedule 1 controlled substance while providing an exemption for the drug for agricultural use.)
Another proposal would regard sex offenders. Florida law bans individuals convicted of certain sex offenses from residing within 1,000 feet of any school, child care facility, park, or playground. However, the law is silent on sex offenders visiting those locations. “We need to eliminate that,” Gualtieri said.
Property tax issue
The sheriff weighed in on the discussion about the potential constitutional amendment reducing or eliminating property taxes that could go before voters in November 2026.
Noting that the proposed resolutions in the Florida House include a carveout to protect law enforcement, Gualtieri said, “All that’s going to do is create a really bad sandwich with us in the middle. You [local governments] on one side, the state on the other. It’s not healthy, it’s not good.”
He expressed concerns about the flexibility of such a measure in law enforcement agencies’ budgets going forward.
“You’re going to have increased costs every year, and so what’s  going to happen with that? We’re all concerned about it.”

Castillo, in the company of his attorney, Frank Riccio, turned himself in at Troop G in Bridgeport. Castillo was released on a written promise to appear in court on Friday. 
Riccio said Wednesday that Castillo will plead not guilty and that the charges will likely be rolled into all the others that he is already facing.
Castillo is already facing more than 30 criminal charges involving abuse of the state’s absentee ballot system.
The first three complaints were related to the 2019 and 2023 Democratic primary elections in Bridgeport. 
The arrest warrant supporting the latest charge alleges that Castillo visited Angela King in her East Washington Avenue apartment, told her whom to vote for in the most recent municipal election and took her absentee ballot away with him.
King told investigators a “Spanish man” told her that he was doing “the voting thing.” She said he wrote down her name, address and phone number and told her an absentee ballot would come in the mail.
King said when the ballot came in the mail, the man returned and helped her fill out her ballot at the kitchen table. 
When investigators asked King “Did you vote for who you wanted to or did he tell you who to vote for?” she replied, “He told me,” the affidavit states.
She said the man then took her ballot and said he would mail it for her. The ballot was mailed to the city clerk’s office, according to the affidavit. 
Investigators showed King a photo of Castillo, and she identified him as the person who had come to her door, saying, “100 percent he took my ballot,” the affidavit states.
The affidavit also states Castillo appeared on video footage from inside Harborview Towers, where the woman lived, knocking on her door, in mid-October. 
Investigators weren’t as fortunate in the identification process with Anne Rodriguez, who lived in an apartment at the same address as King. 
Roidriguez told investigators that a “chubby” man asked her if she had received anything in the mail. She produced an absentee ballot, and the man told her whom to vote for, the affidavit states. She told investigators she did not know whom she voted for because she followed his instructions.
But when investigators showed her eight photos, she did not pick out Castillo’s, the affidavit states. Instead, she picked out a photo of a man who had died in April of 2020, records show. 
The new case was referred to the Chief State’s Attorney’s office by the State Elections Enforcement Commission.
SEEC has referred cases against 11 different defendants for election fraud from the 2019 and 2023 elections. All of those cases are pending except for that of Josephine Edmonds, who pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three years suspended, with three years of probation. 
Several of the remaining defendants, including Castillo and Wanda Geter-Pataky, are due in court on Dec. 11.
Riccio said that the state’s attorney’s office has been meeting with defendants.
“The state is beginning to make offers to people,” Riccio said, adding he expects some of the people to get deal offers, but not those “in the top tier” like Geter-Pataky and Castillo.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025_0909_SR_BridgeportBallotHearing_041-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-19 18:57:50.630980

Summer nuclear site near Fairfield. (Photo courtesy of S.C. Nuclear Advisory Council)A federal judge signed off Tuesday on a $34 million legal settlement between former owners of stock in South Carolina’s now-defunct SCANA Corp. and the auditing firm tasked with monitoring the utility company’s books amid the V.C. Summer nuclear expansion.
The deal, which comes more than eight years after SCANA and state-owned utility company Santee Copper abandoned the project in rural Fairfield County, holds accounting giant Deloitte & Touche LLP responsible for its failure to alert shareholders to the fraud associated with the multibillion-dollar project’s failure.
The payout is on top of a $192 million legal settlement between shareholders and Dominion Energy, the company that bought out SCANA. A judge signed off on that deal in 2020.
The total number of shareholders in line for a share of the funds is still unknown, according to Laura Posner, the court-appointed attorney from the firm Cohen Milstein who represented shareholders. She expects the number of beneficiaries to be largely the same in both cases.
Investors accused the accounting firm of shirking its duties as a gatekeeper and issuing misleading audit reports about the progress of the nuclear project, which never came to fruition.
By giving the company’s books a “clean” bill of health, Deloitte led investors to believe SCANA would complete the project in time to qualify for $1.4 billion in nuclear tax credits.
Shareholders claim Deloitte knew by November 2015, based on a report from an engineering firm hired by SCANA, that the project could not possibly have been operational by the 2021 deadline for the tax credits. The accounting firm continued to receive documents throughout 2016 and early 2017 that further warned of the project’s delay, shareholders’ attorneys claimed.
Posner also pointed to a memo from a Deloitte employee, penned after a SCANA accountant had sounded the alarm on cost overruns and delays, saying Deloitte should have done more to investigate the whistleblower’s claims.
Had Deloitte alerted investors, they “would not have purchased their SCANA shares, and certainly not at the prices they paid,” according to a statement from Cohen Milstein.
Instead, shareholders’ lawyers say their clients saw the stock price decline from $76.12 per share on July 6, 2016, to $37.39 per share as news of the fraud became public.
SC’s state utility enters negotiations on deal to restart failed nuclear project

Deloitte, in a statement last month to the Financial Times, said it “stands behind the quality of its audit work and is participating in this settlement to avoid the ongoing cost and distraction of extended litigation.”
The judge is expected to finalize the settlement at a hearing on Feb. 26, 2026. After that, it will likely be a year before each shareholder’s portion of the money shows up in their accounts.
In the meantime, Santee Cooper is in the process of working out a deal to offload the partially built reactors.
The utility company’s governing board voted unanimously to allow management to negotiate with Brookfield Asset Management, a New York investment firm with $1 trillion in assets. Talks are expected to continue through early December.
Santee Cooper has not made public the potential terms of the deal, expected to be valued in the billions. But the utility will use any cash proceeds it may earn from the agreement to pay down debts still owed on the abandoned nuclear facility, CEO Jimmy Staton said last month.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_2264-1024x705.jpg,,,2025-11-19 18:57:50.630980

(Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources)Republicans in the Wisconsin Legislature are trying once again to establish a sandhill crane hunting season in the state and once again the issue has caused a heated debate. 
At a public hearing on a bill to establish a crane hunt Wednesday morning, Democrats and conservation groups complained that the proposal was a solution in search of a problem while hunters repeatedly insisted the only way to manage the crane population is through a hunt. 
The bill is the product of a Joint Legislative Council study committee convened last year — which spent months trying to find a compromise solution that would satisfy farmers concerned about the more than $1.5 million in crop damage the birds cause each year, hunting groups dead set on establishing a hunt and bird conservationists worried a hunt could damage a population that the state spent decades working to reestablish. 
Sandhill cranes were once gone from the Wisconsin environment, but years of careful work have reestablished the birds. However, many of the wetland habitats that originally served as the bird’s nesting sites have been replaced with farmland and the birds like to eat the corn seeds out of those fields. 
The compromise proposal barely eked through the study committee — which was divided along similar lines as Wednesday’s hearing. 
In the version of the bill under consideration now, a number of proposals meant to help farmers with the crop damage problem have been stripped out, including a program that would subsidize part of the cost for pre-treating corn seeds with a chemical that makes them unappetizing to the birds. 
Dave Considine, a retired state representative whose former district includes the Baraboo-based International Crane Foundation, said at the hearing it was a “travesty” that aid for farmers has been left out of the bill. 
“I thought we had a really decent compromise [in the study committee]. Now I come here to testify and we have given farmers no help, nothing,” Considine said. “Matter of fact, most of the science in the committee meeting, spoke of the fact that if anything [a hunt] may increase damage.”
Plus, a number of anti-hunt advocates questioned how holding a hunt in the fall is meant to deter crop damage, which largely happens in the spring before the seeds have sprouted. 
A number of pro-hunt speakers at the hearing pointed to Alabama, Kentucky and Tennessee, as well as the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec, which hold or are preparing to start sandhill crane hunting seasons. 
The difference, conservationists argued, is that the sandhill cranes that migrate through the eastern flyway (the region of North America of which Wisconsin is a part), use Wisconsin as their annual nesting ground. 
“Cranes are long-lived, and slow to breed one or two young annually,” said Ann Lacy, director of North American eastern flyway programs at the International Crane Foundation. “They do not have the same biology as ducks or geese; therefore, they cannot be managed similarly. They have unique biological considerations, especially in Wisconsin. What happens to these birds in Wisconsin has an effect on the Eastern Population as a whole.”
Despite all those concerns, hunting advocates refused to budge, even as several experts testified explaining the scientific reasons why a hunt won’t help the crop damage problem. For example, sandhill cranes mate for life and are extremely territorial but most of the damage in the state every year comes from single birds moving in larger flocks. If one or both members of a mated pair are killed in a hunt, that only opens up the pair’s territory to be taken over by an unruly group of unmated birds. 
“[We’ve] heard several times that hunting is not a tool that will help us against agricultural damage,” Todd Schaller, a member of the Wisconsin Waterfowl Association board said in response to the expert testimony. “I’m going to say, in my pragmatic thinking, that’s false.”
In 2021, Republicans in the Legislature proposed a similar bill to start a crane hunt. When announcing that bill, conservative rock musician Ted Nugent appeared at a press conference in which he called the birds “ribeyes in the sky.” On Wednesday, Tim Andryk of Wisconsin Ducks Unlimited argued people would be less squeamish about having a crane hunt in Wisconsin if they tasted the meat. 
“They’re just amazing when it comes to eating them,” Andryk said. “They’re a delicate, dark red meat … they’re such good eating that people that are opposed to hunting them, once they’ve eaten one, I don’t think they would be opposed to hunting.”

(Photo illustration via Getty Images; logo courtesy of the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing) A physician assistant facing criminal charges for allegedly sexually assaulting female patients claims the state’s rationale for suspending his license is contradicted by the evidence.
Late last year, the Iowa Board of Physician Assistants issued an emergency order suspending the license of James Haag, who was practicing occupational medicine at MercyOne’s Bluebell Road Family Medicine in Cedar Falls.
In its order, the board cited Haag’s “predatory actions towards his patients (that) constitute a threat to public health.” The board alleged Haag “sexually assaulted multiple patients in his care” and that he posed “an immediate danger to the public health, safety and welfare.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In April, after a disciplinary hearing, the board concluded Haag’s conduct warranted a three-year suspension of his license.
Haag was also criminally charged in connection with the alleged assaults, and is currently facing two counts of third-degree sexual abuse, two counts of assault with intent to commit sexual abuse, and three counts of simple assault. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges, and a trial is now set for April 28, 2026.
With the criminal case still pending, Haag is seeking judicial review of the board’s decision to suspend his license. Responding to the board’s recent claims that there is “ample evidence Haag inappropriately touched four of his patients in sexual manner,” Haag’s attorney, Trent Nelson, has argued to the court that the issue isn’t what evidence the board relied upon, but whether the board’s stated findings are supported by that evidence.
Statements that the board attributed to the hearing witnesses as a basis for its decision are “inconsistent with the testimony provided under oath during hearing,” Nelson says in a brief filed with the court.
Among the alleged inconsistencies in the testimony and the board’s findings, as described by Nelson:
— Chaperone: The board found that a particular patient was not offered a chaperone, although the woman testified she was offered a chaperone.
— Gown: The board found that one patient’s gown was completely untied, although she testified it was not.
— Haag’s hand: The board found that Haag placed his hand under a patient’s gown, although she testified he had not.
— Timing: The board found that Haag moved his hands away from a patient’s groin when the chaperone entered the room, although the patient testified the chaperone did not come into the room until after the exam was over.
— Clothing: The board found that Haag put his fingers beneath one patient’s underwear, although the patient testified to the contrary.
“The Iowa Board of Physician Assistants found, in a published ruling, that Mr. Haag committed actions — alleged sexual abuse — to which the witnesses themselves testified, under oath, did not occur,” Nelson argues. “This cannot be tolerated.”
In his brief, Nelson also noted that in court filings made on behalf of the board, the state’s attorneys have alleged that Haag admitted to the police during the investigation he had no reason to think the alleged victims were working in coordination with each other, telling investigators, “I’ve got no indication that these guys are working in cahoots — because, like I said, I can’t find any connection.”
Nelson asserts the state’s lawyers have misattributed that comment to Haag when the evidence indicates it was made by a police officer.
The board has alleged that even if all of the factual discrepancies or contradictions in the case were settled in Haag’s favor, “his misconduct would still have been substantiated, and his license would still be suspended for three years.”
Board records show that as part of his work at Bluebell Road Family Medicine, Haag performed job-related physicals for individuals who worked at a local business.
The licensing board alleges that in July 2024, Haag examined four patients for purposes of their employment and in some cases “pressed his fully clothed pelvic area into the patient’s genitals or backside” and made “inappropriate contact with multiple patients’ breasts.”

(File photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)South Carolina’s parole board on Wednesday approved releasing a Greenwood mother who’s spent nearly six years in prison for killing her abuser.
The 4-2 vote to parole Tiffany Janae Carroll followed a years-long effort by her family, her second grade teacher, and two GOP legislators. Backing their request, again, were the law enforcement offices that put Carroll in prison, which Rep. John McCravy said illustrates the rarity of the situation.
“If anyone ever needed to get paroled, it’s her,” said the Greenwood Republican, who noted “I’ve never advocated for anyone to get out on parole in my life except her.”
For the 38-year-old mother, the fourth time was the charm. Last year’s hearing ended one vote shy of the supermajority needed.
Her release could be days away — potentially in time to spend Thanksgiving with her five children, who range in age from 6 to 18. That’s the hope anyway, said her attorney, Rep. Travis Moore.
SC woman who killed her abuser again denied parole after nearly 5 years in prison

“She’s looking forward to seeing her kids,” said Moore, R-Roebuck, a former prosecutor who took on his first parole case for free.
Carroll and Moore again appeared before the parole board virtually from the women’s prison in Columbia.
For the fourth time, no one attended to oppose her release, McCravy said.
Technically, Carroll was granted “conditional parole.” Before she’s released, local parole officers must verify that she has a suitable home and employment lined up. Moore provided address options, including the homes of her sister, and an aunt and uncle. A catering business has offered her a job. If that falls through, McCravy told the board, he’ll hire her at his law office.
The parole board was left with no excuses, said Moore, who lives in Spartanburg County but has family in Greenwood.
Whether Carroll killed her then-partner, 27-year-old William Jamal Johnson, was never in question. She pleaded guilty but mentally ill to manslaughter in December 2019 for fatally stabbing him. But her supporters contend her 15-year sentence represented injustice, considering the abuse she endured.
Law enforcement officers responded to their home eight times between May 2016, a month before their son was born, and Johnson’s death, court records show.
Accounts vary on exactly what happened that day in September 2017, after the couple started arguing. At her first parole hearing, she told the board she was trying to leave “when he leaped out at me and hit me again.” She’s said she doesn’t remember what happened next.
What’s not disputed in the legal record is that Carroll at some point got a knife from the kitchen, cut him on the arm and ankle and stabbed him in the chest. After realizing what she’d done, she tried to save his life, applying pressure to his wounds. He died at the local hospital.
A manslaughter conviction usually requires inmates to serve at least a third of their sentence before coming up for parole. But at sentencing, then-Circuit Court Judge Verdin (now a state Supreme Court justice) permitted Carroll to be eligible after serving 25% of her 15-year sentence. That’s why she first came up for parole in 2021.
While in prison, Carroll has “availed herself to every program and opportunity to better herself,” Moore said.
That includes taking virtual classes through Claflin University, earning several work certificates, and working at the prison laundry. Her record shows no discipline problems.
Still, South Carolina’s parole board very rarely approves early release for any inmate.
People who sent letters of support again included the police chief of the department that charged her and solicitor who prosecuted her case.
“Mrs. Carroll’s case exemplifies someone who deserves another chance,” Greenwood Police Chief TJ Chaudoin wrote in a Sept. 9 letter to the parole board, echoing what he wrote last year.
Solicitor David Stumbo, who’s running for attorney general in 2026, maintains his office made the right decisions: Johnson’s death did not legally support a self-defense argument, despite the couple’s history and Carroll being a victim in the past. And the guilty-but-mentally-ill plea to manslaughter, down from the original murder charge, was “proper under the facts of the case,” he wrote in a separate letter to the board dated Sept. 9.
However, “we are confident that this incident of violence was isolated to Ms. Carroll’s particular situation at the time as a battered woman, and she is not the type of offender that would pose a danger to our community at large,” wrote the chief prosecutor for Abbeville, Greenwood, Newberry and Laurens counties.
Based on the outpouring of community support and the “unique circumstances that her case presents … I strongly support her application for parole,” he concluded in a repeat of what he wrote last year.
Asked what made the difference, McCravy gave credit to God.
“I think the Lord did. I think prayer did,” he said. “Our whole community was praying.”

(Photo by Mark Makela/Getty Images)Florida election supervisors are again asking state lawmakers to change state law to make it easier for Floridians to vote by mail, but whether the GOP-controlled Legislature will act on the request is questionable, since they ignored a similar request earlier this year.
David Ramba, representing the Florida Supervisors of Elections, told the Senate Ethics and Elections Committee on Wednesday that supervisors in the state want lawmakers to reinstate the checkbox on mail-in ballot envelopes, an item wiped away by a 2021 election law that requires voters to renew their vote-by-mail (VBM) ballots requests every two years instead of every four years.
As election officials told lawmakers in a similar committee meeting before the 2025 legislative session, the results from two special elections held earlier this year put in stark relief how voters are still not used to the change in law.
Referring to the Congressional District 1 election in the Panhandle, Ramba said there were 98,000 plus VBM requests on file in November 2024, when then-GOP U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz was running for re-election. After Gaetz resigned from the seat and a special primary election was held in January 2025, there were just over 12,000 VBM requests.
Ramba said the same situation took place in Florida’s Sixth Congressional District, where a special election was held earlier this year after Mike Waltz stepped down to serve as Donald Trump’s national security adviser. (He’s now U.N. ambassador.)
“It is a huge expense for our supervisors to go out and then solicit people who want to vote by mail,” Ramba said.
“When they do vote by mail, and we receive your ballot in the November ’24 general election VBM, we are confirming your personal information. We know your address. We sent you that ballot. We do not send ballots out to people who did not ask for them. We have confirmed your signature. We have counted your ballot. We believe there should be the opportunity for that valid voter to — we call it ‘check the box’ — to be able to ask to continue to be on that vote-by-mail list.”
Sen. Tina Polsky, a Democrat representing parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties, said it’s become obvious that the law making it incumbent for voters to request a vote-by-mail ballot every two years after an election simply isn’t working.
“It’s not helping the electorate. The supervisors of elections have told us that. The numbers tell us that. All of our constituents tell us that. Every meeting I go to with constituents I end it by saying, ‘You must renew your vote-by-mail ballot,’ because people don’t know,” she said.
“And so we should — we in this committee should look at the data and say, ‘This didn’t work. This was a failed experiment.’ Let’s go back to how it was before with checking the box, because there was no fraud associated with checking the box because of the excellent list maintenance and everything that they do and all of the laws that have been implemented since that time and take a look at that.”
The request was one of just seven that the organization representing Florida’s 67 supervisors of elections made Wednesday to the committee.
Other requests included:

Exempt from public records personal information of election workers as “Critical Infrastructure Assets.”
Have the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles automatically provide the election supervisors the new numbers assigned to the voters who receive a new driver’s license or identification card (the issue stems from a 2024 law that could affect voters’ ability to vote by mail or have their signature on a petition ballot be counted).
Allow a voter now deemed “inactive” to become an “active” voter if he or she signs a ballot petition form.
Give supervisors of election the flexibility to choose different early voting location sites when the the main office is not suitable for early voting.
Eliminating the requirement to place a ballot cast in a provisional ballot envelope if polling hours are extended by the governor beyond 7 p.m. on election night.
Expand the list of offenses involving “critical infrastructure” to include the theft or tampering of election equipment and/or ballots.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)A new report finds Rhode Island’s bus network is out of compliance with the state’s transparency law for quasi-public agencies, including failing to publish online reports for the last five years detailing payments to third-party contractors.
The Office of Internal Audit and Program Integrity found the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) lacked formalized project management standards in an 11-page report published Nov. 7. The report is required to happen every five years under the state law governing quasi-governmental agencies. The latest evaluation uncovered three major issues at the cash-strapped bus agency.
1. A lack of management policy and standards
The report notes auditors had planned to review that RIPTA has not formally adopted procedures for initiating and managing capital and infrastructure projects. The only manuals provided to auditors were drafts.
“This lack of standardized monitoring practices and documentation increases the risk of project delays, cost overruns, inconsistent oversight, and noncompliance with state and federal expectations for capital project management,” Andrew Manca, the state’s chief of internal audits, wrote in the report.
The report offers no comment on the drafted policies, but agency spokesperson Cristy Raposo Perry said in an email Wednesday auditors found no issues with what they read.
“Our conversations with auditors have suggested that this draft policy is exactly the approach to be taken to comply with best practices,” she said.
The anticipated completion date for that formal adoption is Feb. 1, 2026, according to the audit report.
2. Inadequate project performance monitoring 
Auditors reviewed financial documents for eight capital projects and found RIPTA had incomplete files.
“Documentation was missing or incomplete, including project charters, baseline schedules, performance metrics, budget tracking reports, and evidence of ongoing performance evaluation or corrective action,” Manca wrote.
The main way RIPTA keeps track of performance of its capital projects is via a dashboard maintained through Microsoft Excel, the report notes. While this dashboard is intended to serve as a centralized tool for oversight, auditors observed that it is “highly manual in nature” and contained several data gaps. 
The report includes a response from RIPTA management stating that its project tracker spreadsheet will be updated to include “detailed logs,” along with automatically calculating performance indicators with checkboxes or completing key steps in a given project.
3. Incomplete and outdated contracting reports
RIPTA did not follow the state law requiring agencies to post online an annual report listing third-party vendors who provided at least $150,000 worth of services no later than Dec. 1. 
That included the contractor responsible for the efficiency report that was initially due to state leaders in March but wasn’t completed until Aug. 1. Documentation on the agency’s use of public money and its performance was the major reason state leaders refused to fully fund all of RIPTA’s operations in the fiscal 2026 budget. A multimillion deficit forced the agency to enact sweeping service reductions impacting 46 of its 67 routes.
At the time of the audit, the most recent report available on RIPTA’s website was from the first quarter of 2020.
“No additional reports have been made available to the public in more than five years,” Manca wrote. “As a result, information regarding high-value contracts, vendor compensation, and outsourced services has not been available for public review, limiting the transparency intended by the statute.” 
RIPTA has since added its last five years worth of contractor reports and promised to post all future ones on an annual basis, according to the report.
“This was an oversight,” Raposo Perry said, referring to the reports being absent online. She added that contracting reports have been submitted to the Secretary of State’s office on an annual basis.
Asked to comment on the overall findings of the report, Raposo Perry declined. “We cannot speak to decisions made in prior years,” she said.“However, under new leadership, we are prioritizing stronger policy frameworks to strengthen our business practices going forward.”
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson have yet to thoroughly review the audit report.
“But at first glance it appears that the agency is taking positive steps to remedy the project management policy and transparency compliance issues that had been identified,” they said in a joint statement to Rhode Island Current.
The legislative leaders added they will meet with RIPTA CEO Christopher Durand “in the coming weeks” to formally discuss the audit.

(Photo by Natalie Behring/Getty Images)A bill regulating certain medications, which could include medication abortion drugs, was passed out of an Ohio House committee on Wednesday, on its way to a full House vote.
Though there were a several testimonies submitted opposing Ohio House Bill 324, the House Health Committee didn’t take long to approve the measure.
An amendment brought by one of the sponsors of the bill, Republican state Rep. Meredith Craig set out to clarify that the medications in the measure wouldn’t be prohibited outright, an amendment she said was encouraged by the Ohio Council of Retail Merchants.
In a previous hearing, Lora Miller, director of governmental affairs for the council, said the “extremely broad definitions” in the bill could impact access to things like blood thinners and antibiotics, causing unnecessary costs and delays in care for Ohioans.
The bill is an overarching drug regulation bill that would task the Ohio Department of Health with identifying medications that have “severe adverse effects” in more than 5% of users.
The data would be collected through insurance claims, FDA information, and reports from patients.
If a drug is determined to have severe effects in more than 5% of users, the drug would need to be prescribed through an in-person process, rather than through mail-order or telehealth means.
A follow-up appointment would also be required under the bill.

Opponents of the bill say the accessibility of some drugs, including the medication abortion drugs, could be stifled by research that was not peer-reviewed, and was self-published by special interest groups who may have biased opinions that seep into the research.
Two amendments brought by the Democratic members of the committee were swiftly tabled without explanation by committee chair Rep. Jean Schmidt, R-Loveland.
One would have required that any medical studies cited to determine severe adverse effects of drugs be peer-reviewed, evidence-based, and from a medical journal or academic institution.
Another tabled amendment would have exempted drugs that are already classified by the FDA from going through state scrutiny as well.
All testimony was accepted as written, and no one spoke in committee on Wednesday. The statements included 12 in opposition, one in support from Dayton Right to Life, and two “interested party” submissions.
Margie Christie, policy director for the Dayton anti-abortion group, specifically mentioned medication abortion drugs in her testimony supporting the bill.
She said the bill would provide “necessary safeguards” for medication abortion pills and the complications they can have.
Mifepristone and misoprostol, the common two-drug combination used for medication abortions, have been approved by the FDA for use for decades.
The safety of the drugs has been studied in research also spanning decades, showing statistically rare instances of severe complications.
This research was cited by medical professionals and academics who spoke out in opposition to the bill in a previous hearing.
The medication was the target of a different bill heard in a Wednesday hearing.
Ohio Senate Bill 309 would require medical providers to give a statement that would be signed by any patient before they are prescribed mifepristone.
The statement informs patients that they are able to bring legal action against doctors, medical facilities and others if complications arise from the use of the drug and a patient was not informed.
Bill sponsor Sen. Kyle Koehler, R-Springfield, said the evolution of the FDA approvals of the drug to include less in-person requirements shows the need for more laws requiring doctors to inform patients of their rights.
In 2021, the FDA allowed the medication abortion drugs to be distributed through telehealth visits, something state legislators tried to prohibit in the state, but which is currently ongoing as a lawsuit goes forward.
While Koehler denied that the bill infringed on the right to access the medication, he said the legislation was “an opportunity for abortion pill providers to ensure their patients are properly informed and reevaluate their desire to be held legally liable in offering this drug.”
“Any drug that I take comes with warnings and information on what it can do when it’s trying to help me get better, this is a drug that’s used in a different context,” Koehler told the Senate Health Committee.
“I think people still need to know that complications can come from it.”
Medical professionals have argued the bill is unnecessary because patients are already required to hear the potential risks to any medication as part of medical training.
According to some experts, the bill may have a chilling effect on the doctor-patient relationship, and make doctors wary of prescribing the medication, therefore impacting access.
Committee member state Rep. Beth Liston, D-Columbus, asked if Koehler had any peer-reviewed evidence on the dangers of the medication, “given that you’re basically contradicting what medical providers are otherwise doing.”
Koehler said more medical research would come as the bill continues to work its way through the legislative process.

Ohio’s public schools will be required to display at least some of the documents on the list in each classroom of each school, according to Ohio Senate Bill 34.
Other documents on the list include the U.S. Constitution, the Articles of Confederation, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, the Northwest Ordinance, the Magna Carta, and the mottos for Ohio and the United States.
Bill sponsor state Sen. Terry Johnson, R-McDermott, said in an earlier committee hearing on the bill that students would see documents that have “served as the backbone of our legal and moral traditions as a people.”
In Tuesday’s hearing of the Senate Education Committee chair Sen. Andrew Brenner, R-Delaware, doubled down on that argument after the leading Democrat on the committee, Sen. Catherine Ingram, introduced an amendment to remove the Ten Commandments as one of the allowed documents in the bill.
“I personally don’t understand the reason for (removing the document), because many of our founders in fact relied on the Ten Commandments,” Brenner said, adding that there were “other influences there that were brought in using the principles of the Ten Commandments.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Ingram said the text shouldn’t be included for a host of reasons, most significantly that the document is not a “founding” document, no matter its impact on the state and national founders.
“When you start talking about the founding documents, the Ten Commandments may have been, when you went to church, you went home and you did those things with your own religious beliefs,” Ingram said.
“But that is not considered a founding document, despite the fact that (John) Adams or whomever used that for their own rationale as to what their beliefs were.”
She pointed to testimony against the inclusion of the Ten Commandments that has come in the months since the measure was introduced.
Rabbi Megan Doherty, of the National Council of Jewish Women, testified against the bill in March, saying “treating this sacred scripture as just another item up on the wall in the classroom of a secular school, as S.B. 34 would, demeans and trivializes a text that is holy to many and will inevitably exclude students of minority faiths.”
Dr. Christina Collins, executive director of advocacy group Honesty for Ohio Education, submitted testimony on Tuesday, opposing the bill as well.
She said it “is not responding to any demonstrated problem.”
“While the Ten Commandments hold deep personal significance for many individuals and faith traditions, their placement in public classrooms crosses a constitutional boundary,” Collins wrote.
“Public schools must never be pressured, directly or indirectly, into religious endorsement or indoctrination.”
The bill has the support of D.C.-based evangelical non-profit The Family Research Council, The Christian Business Partnership, and the Ohio Christian Alliance, all of whom previously submitted testimony approving of the bill.
Brenner said the Ten Commandments is just one of the documents on the list, and may not be chosen by any school districts to be one of the documents displayed in classrooms.
Ingram said by including the religious text as if it were a historical document, “here again, we are doing that indoctrination that we cry so much about.”
The attempt to remove the Ten Commandments from the list was tabled along party lines in the committee, as was another effort by Ingram to amend the bill.
The other amendment would have required local school boards to have three public hearings on the selection of the documents, to allow public input before the decision is made, she said.
Brenner said local school boards can decide for themselves if they’d like public input.
“This is going to go to the local school boards anyway, they’re going to be able to determine which ones are going to be on display,” Brenner said. “It’s up to those local school boards how they want to conduct it.”
The bill will now move on for a vote of the full Ohio Senate before moving on to the Ohio House.

(Washington State Parks)Sales of Washington’s pass to access state parks and other recreation areas fell after an Oct. 1 price hike, but fee collections increased.
Figures presented to the state Parks and Recreation Commission on Wednesday show a 23% drop in the number of annual Discover Pass sales in October, compared to last year. Revenue from the passes climbed 16% year-over-year. Day pass sales and revenue slipped 2%.
The decline in annual pass sales was anticipated. Even with fewer sales, the state expects to bring in more money with this fall’s $15 price increase.
“Definitely in the annual pass, we did well for revenue,” said Laura Holmes, State Parks’ administrative services director, told the commission. “We’re right on track with projections.”
Lawmakers during this year’s legislative session approved raising the price of the annual state public lands pass to $45 from $30. Transaction fees can apply too, including a $5 charge for online sales. It was the first price increase since the pass system was established in 2011.
Discover Passes are required for motor vehicle access to state parks and other recreation sites. Combined with camping fees, revenue from the passes makes up about three-quarters of Washington State Parks’ income for the fiscal year that began July 1.
The agency predicts that Discover Pass sales will fall by an average of about 15% over the current two-year budget cycle.
Holmes noted the dip in October came after more people purchased passes in September, before prices went up.
“We were significantly over projections there,” she said, referring to September sales.
State Parks’ operating budget is about $258 million, and its construction budget is around $148 million. So far, the agency’s revenue is about $1.1 million, or 2%, ahead of expectations for this budget biennium, which runs through June 2027. 
The agency saw its operating budget trimmed by nearly $15 million as lawmakers bridged a budget gap this year. Officials said that the cuts would not result in significant reductions in services or access for visitors to state-run park and recreation sites.
Some Discover Pass revenue also goes to the Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Department of Natural Resources. But Washington State Parks receives the lion’s share. The figures in Wednesday’s report reflect overall revenue and sales for the passes, not just the portion going to State Parks.
The state park system is on track to have about 40 million annual visitors through the end of 2025, about a 1% increase over last year. State parks are separate from national parks and other federally-managed land open to recreational visitors in Washington.
Last week, State Parks announced 12 days in 2026 when visiting state recreation lands will be free, with no Discover Pass required. The first is New Year’s Day.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ParadisePoint_Campground.jpg,,,2025-11-19 17:58:21.145190

The deployment, which is expected to begin in earnest on Dec. 1, marks the latest escalation in a series of rapid-fire immigration crackdowns unfolding nationwide — from Chicago to Los Angeles to Charlotte, North Carolina — as the Trump administration moves aggressively to fulfill the president’s campaign promise of mass deportations.
In Louisiana, the operation is unfolding on the home turf of Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, a close Trump ally who has moved to align state policy with the White House’s enforcement agenda. But, as seen in other blue cities situated in Republican-led states, increased federal enforcement presence could set up a collision with officials in liberal New Orleans who have long resisted federal sweeps.
Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol commander tapped to run the Louisiana sweep, has become the administration’s go-to architect for large-scale immigration crackdowns — and a magnet for criticism over the tactics used in them. His selection to oversee “Swamp Sweep” signals that the administration views Louisiana as a major enforcement priority for the Trump administration.
The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment on the operation. “For the safety and security of law enforcement we’re not going to telegraph potential operations,” spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said.
In Chicago, Bovino drew a rare public rebuke from a federal judge who said he misled the court about the threats posed by protesters and deployed tear gas and pepper balls without justification during a chaotic confrontation downtown. His teams also oversaw aggressive arrest operations in Los Angeles and more recently in Charlotte, where Border Patrol officials have touted dozens of arrests across North Carolina this week after a surging immigration crackdown that has included federal agents scouring churches, grocery stores and apartment complexes.
Planning documents reviewed by the AP show Border Patrol teams preparing to fan out across neighborhoods and commercial hubs throughout southeast Louisiana, stretching from New Orleans through Jefferson, St. Bernard and St. Tammany parishes and as far north as Baton Rouge, with additional activity planned in southeastern Mississippi.
Agents are expected to arrive in New Orleans on Friday to begin staging equipment and vehicles before the Thanksgiving holiday, according to the people familiar with the operation. They are scheduled to return toward the end of the month, with the full sweep beginning in early December. The people familiar with the matter could not publicly discuss details of the operation and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.
To support an operation of that scale, federal officials are securing a network of staging sites: A portion of the FBI’s New Orleans field office has been designated as a command post, while a naval base five miles south of the city will store vehicles, equipment and thousands of pounds of “less lethal” munitions like tear gas and pepper balls, the people said. Homeland Security has also asked to use the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base New Orleans for up to 90 days beginning this weekend, according to documents reviewed by the AP.
Once “Swamp Sweep” begins, Louisiana will become a major testing ground for the administration’s expanding deportation strategy, and a focal point in the widening rift between federal authorities intent on carrying out large-scale arrests and city officials who have long resisted them.

(Getty Images)The Arkansas Natural Resources Commission on Wednesday approved $153.9 million in loans and grants to dozens of sewerage and water systems across the state, the governor’s office announced.
The majority of the funds come from the Clean Water Revolving Loan Fund, a pot of federal money used for wastewater system improvements. Systems ranging in size from Little Rock’s Water Reclamation Authority, which serves more than 200,000 people, to a wastewater system serving 150 people in Blevins will receive a total $81.3 million in loans, according to Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
Arkansas approves $13 million for water projects

Nearly $55 million in loans will come out of the Clean Drinking Water Revolving Loan Fund, which similarly funds drinking water system improvements.
State funding will be used for roughly $16.8 million in loans and grants, while $1.1 million in grants will be paid out by the Small, Underserved and Disadvantaged Communities Grant Program.
In the announcement, Sanders touted efforts by her administration to strengthen Arkansas’ water and wastewater infrastructure using $2.7 billion in federal and state funds. Funding for the two revolving loan funds increased in recent years as a result of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021.
“Everywhere you look, Arkansas’ communities are expanding and demanding more from our infrastructure,” Sanders said. “That’s why my administration is committed to providing funding for these latest projects, ensuring Arkansas’ water systems can keep up with demand so every Arkansan has clean water to drink and wastewater systems that work.”
Most of the loans from the two revolving funds come with principal forgiveness, meaning the borrower will not have to repay the loan in most instances.

Commissioner Murray Sagsveen during a Wednesday commission meeting proposed adding the penalty as part of a larger update to the commission’s rule process.
“I’ve heard many legislators and others complain about weaponizing the system,” Sagsveen said.
If the executive director determines that a complaint was filed to “harass or impugn the reputation of the respondent” or was otherwise filed for a deceptive purpose, the director will notify the commission, according to his proposal. The commission may then order the complaint filer to demonstrate that the complaint is legitimate.
The filer may respond in writing or request a hearing in front of commission, the amendment says.

If commissioners conclude that the complaint was filed in bad faith, the amendment would permit them to hand down a penalty. The commission could fine the filer up to $500 for first offense and up to $1,000 for each additional offense. The commission could also include a “non-monetary directive” as part of the penalty, it says.
Commissioner Ron Goodman questioned how other state government agencies would respond if the commission moved forward with the proposal. He noted that executive branch officials, including the Attorney General’s Office, have openly questioned the scope of the commission’s ability to impose penalties.
“I realize there’s a risk in adopting this, but I believe that there is a positive public purpose in adopting a rule like this,” Sagsveen said.
The commission approved adding the penalty to a larger list of proposed changes to its complaint rule, but held off on adopting the changes Wednesday. The commission indicated it would take up the matter again during its December meeting.
Ethics Commissioner does not have the support to keep serving, governor argues

Also Wednesday, the commission set a special meeting for next week to consider finalizing a letter to the Attorney General’s Office responding to several comments the agency made alleging that the commission had overstepped its authority.
The commission also discussed a request for a legal opinion the Secretary of State’s Office submitted to the Attorney General’s Office seeking clarity on the Ethics Commission’s jurisdiction related to issuing advisory opinions. 
Commission Chair Cynthia Lindquist said she was disappointed that the Secretary of State’s Office did not notify the commission it was requesting the opinion.
“We’re at odds, and we should not be,” Lindquist said during Wednesday’s meeting. “I’m still trying to figure out, how do we get to the table? Well I don’t know, is there a table anymore?”
Wednesday may have been Sagveen’s last Ethics Commission meeting. 
Sagsveen’s term expired in August, but he has continued serving on the board while Gov. Kelly Armstrong and the Senate majority and minority leaders debate whether to reappoint him. The legislators support reappointing Sagsveen, but Armstrong does not.
Armstrong in a letter late Wednesday told Sagsveen he “no longer has consensus” from all three officials to serve past his expired term.

The health care apocalypse has arrived. 


In the past month, many of the 30,000 Vermonters who get their health insurance through Vermont Health Connect — part of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare as it’s popularly known — are experiencing sticker shock. Average health insurance premiums on Vermont Health Connect are projected to more than double, the highest rate increases countrywide.
This is a disaster foretold. Democrats in Congress have warned for months that unless pandemic-era health insurance subsidies were extended, the 24 million Americans who get their health insurance through ACA marketplaces would see astronomical price hikes. Yet, despite a 43 day government shutdown, Republicans in Congress and President Trump refused to extend subsidies. 
The price tag for inaction has just arrived.

Vermonters are now faced with excruciating choices. Middle-income participants are facing additional premiums of $10,000 per year for individuals and $32,000 for a family of four. Others are considering going without insurance all together. 
“We can’t take out a second mortgage on our house to afford one year of health insurance,” said Arica Bronz, a pilates instructor from Winooski, where she lives with her husband, a primary care physician, and their two daughters. 
Bronz’s monthly family premium will rise from $1,100 to $2,700 per month in 2026. After factoring in a $15,000 annual deductible, she said that in case of a serious medical event, her family will pay $47,000 before their insurance kicks in. 
Bronz feels she has no choice. She is going to cancel health care coverage for her family.  “We’re trying to get all the scans done and just make sure we’re tip-top healthy before we make the leap. I can’t tell you how much sleep I’ve lost considering what it’s like to jump in this day and age to no health care for a family.”
If too many people drop health care coverage, experts warn that Vermont’s struggling health care financing system could enter a death spiral. 
“I have a tremendous fear that what we are watching before us is the undoing, the dismantling of our healthcare financing system,” said Michael Fisher, Vermont’s chief health care advocate. “This is devastating and it’s self-inflicted. And the majority in Congress think it’s the right thing to do.”
Fisher nevertheless said that those whose income falls within 400% of the federal poverty level — around $130,000 for a family of four — may still qualify for subsidized health care premiums.
As Arica Bronz contemplates a future without health insurance, she said, “We don’t have a safety net. Hopefully that will inspire us to just be really thoughtful and careful. … It’s kinda terrifying.”

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo / New Jersey Monitor)Advocates fighting soaring hospital costs renewed their calls Wednesday for New Jersey lawmakers to pass legislation that would require price transparency, cap price hikes and bolster oversight of medical providers.
Legislators have less than two months to act on the bill, with the current legislative session set to end in January. Union leaders and other bill supporters gathered at the New Jersey League of Municipalities’ annual conference in Atlantic City to demand action.
“Hospital pricing is the fastest growing portion of the health care industry, outpacing even pharmaceuticals,” said Deborah Cornavaca of the New Jersey Education Association. “They far outpace the rate of inflation and certainly our wages. At this current trajectory, only the wealthiest will be able to afford health care in our nation. We do not accept that future.”
Under legislation introduced in February, hospitals and health care entities that ignore transparency requirements and yearly cost caps would have to follow a corrective action plan — or face civil penalties of $10 a day per bed and be barred from collecting medical debt from patients.
Advocates pointed to a settlement New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin announced last week with Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield as proof of why such accountability is overdue. The insurer will have to pay the state $100 million to resolve claims that it made false statements to win a contract managing the state’s public worker health plans and then ignored a contractual provision so it could overcharge the public plans.
“On the heels of this announcement, it is clear that we need to take action now to create a health care system in New Jersey that is affordable, transparent and accountable,” said Ana Maria Hill, New Jersey state director and vice president of the 32BJ SEIU union. “Even when the state did its best to protect consumers and establish cost-saving measures, Horizon blatantly disregarded their contractual obligation.”
Cornavaca also cited Gov. Phil Murphy’s medical debt relief initiative as evidence of a need for change. More than 780,000 New Jersey residents have had over $1.3 billion in medical debt forgiven in a partnership between the state and the national nonprofit Undue Medical Debt, according to an October announcement.
Plainfield Mayor Adrian Mapp, who heads the New Jersey Urban Mayors Association, threw his support behind the bill too, saying exorbitant medical costs strain municipal budgets.
“As the mayor of Plainfield, budgeting is an important part of my job,” Mapp said. “We are putting the health care system on a budget.”
The New Jersey Hospital Association opposes the legislation and has blamed insurers for driving up medical costs.

Kristen McDonald Rivet called on Congress to extend enhanced tax credits for the Affordable Care Act in a press conference with advocacy group Protect Our Care on Wednesday. 
In the press conference, the Bay City Democrat said that “we are very quickly arriving at a place where we will have two separate countries” in regards to affordability, including health care affordability. 
She criticized Republican leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives for “ignoring” health care, saying, “We are finally back in session, and there’s not a single bill on the floor for consideration or in committee for consideration that deals with this problem.”
She emphasized how this would impact Michiganders in her district, from small business owners to parents. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Most moms have had that experience where you wake up at 2:00 in the morning, with the kid with the high temperature and the croupy cough, and you’re worried, and you’re just waiting for your doctor’s office to open,” she continued. “Imagine how many people are going to drop their health insurance because they simply can’t afford it, who will know that they cannot take their child to the doctor’s office in the morning.”
Jim Milanowski, the president and CEO of the Genesee Health Plan, and Amber Bellazaire, a senior policy analyst at the Michigan League for Public Policy, both explained that if health care costs increase, people will choose to decrease their health insurance coverage or eliminate it entirely. 
“When premiums rise this dramatically, people are forced to make really hard decisions,” Bellazaire said. “Some might downgrade to plans that have sky high deductibles, and others will just go without insurance entirely.”
Milanowski noted that people going without insurance could actually increase health care costs for everyone, regardless of insurance, as uncompensated care would increase. 
Bellazaire also noted that, ahead of the hard deadline of Jan. 15 to enroll in the ACA marketplace, the question of whether or not tax credits will be extended has “created significant uncertainty for families planning their 2026 coverage.”
“Americans do not want President Trump and Republicans to take away their health care. 64% of Americans support the Affordable Care Act,” said Dianne Byrum, director of Protect Our Care Michigan. “Eight in 10 Michiganders want Medicaid left alone or even strengthened.” 
McDonald Rivet, throughout the call, urged her fellow lawmakers to take up the issue before that January deadline and to extend the tax credits to prevent the price hikes from going into effect.

Let’s Grow Kids focused efforts simultaneously on all levels of the state’s child care system for a decade, an approach CEO Aly Richards called a “full-court press” that other advocates are beginning to model. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  After a decade, Vermont’s child care ‘juggernaut’ passes the torch.","One of Vermont’s most influential advocacy groups closed its doors for the last time at the end of October — but its work will continue.
Let’s Grow Kids, an organization that pushed for and guided public funding for child care in Vermont over the past decade, was designed to shut down this year. The cornerstone achievement of the campaign — according to the organization’s leadership — was Act 76, Vermont’s 2023 landmark child care law. 
That legislation established a new 0.44% payroll tax and directed the revenue, along with annual earmarked state funds — roughly $125 million each year — toward income-based child care subsidies. Now, households earning up to 575% of the federal poverty level qualify for tuition assistance from the state, making child care free or close to it for lower-income households and more affordable for higher earners. The new funding also guarantees higher and more stable revenue for local providers.

The new influx of funding is transforming Vermont’s child care industry, both advocates and providers say. 
Jocelyn York, a teacher who has held leadership positions at several Vermont child care centers, said the law has allowed centers like hers “to be able to continue to exist.” Equally, the tuition assistance has provided “a lot more peace of mind for families,” she said, as the cost of high-quality child care continues to rise.
Since the law passed, more Vermont child care centers have opened than closed each quarter, reversing a longstanding trend in the other direction, according to the Let’s Grow Kids 2025 impact report. As over 100 new providers launched, more than 1,700 new slots have been created in the system, and thousands more kids have been enrolled in the expanded tuition subsidy program.
Nonetheless, Aly Richards, the nonprofit’s former CEO, said the work is far from over.

“We’re a catalyst for systemic policy change,” she said, adding that Act 76 merely “set the conditions for the full fix.”
As Let’s Grow Kids sunsets, aspects of its work will be taken up and extended by other early childhood education-focused organizations across the state. Building Bright Futures, the state’s independent early childhood advisory body, will continue providing data-driven evaluations and policy recommendations to the Statehouse. Vermont’s chapter of First Children’s Finance and the Vermont Association for the Education of Young Children, both led by former Let’s Grow Kids staffers, will help support the state’s providers through financial and workforce challenges.
The Let’s Grow Kids Action Network, a leaner and more tightly focused nonprofit that has been supplementing the larger organization’s work since 2020, will also continue its political advocacy with a much smaller team.
The time-limited nature of the Let’s Grow Kids campaign has been essential to its success in both fundraising and advocacy, according to Richards. Her team, she said, “put ourselves out of business on deadline.”
Indeed, the organization’s model was so effective that other leaders around the state — and the country — are eyeing the Let’s Grow Kids model and record of results.
Earlier this year, a group of advocates and business leaders launched a new housing advocacy campaign called Let’s Build Homes. Among them are former Burlington mayor Miro Weinberger, who serves as executive chair, and Vermont Housing Finance Agency Executive Director Maura Collins. 
Weinberger said the branding of his organization “alluded” to that of Let’s Grow Kids. He even met with Richards and other leadership to get their blessing.
“The kind of action … inspired by the name, was appealing to us,” Weinberger said. “We do see ourselves as trying to do for housing what they did for child care, in the sense of elevating and inspiring collective action on a key Vermont issue.”
Though Let’s Build Homes is not tied to a specific closure date, part of their initial pitch cited a Vermont Housing Finance Agency report saying that Vermont needs roughly 30,000 more homes within the next five years. 
“We’re serious about that,” Weinberger said. “We think that that is achievable.”
It’s the kind of confident optimism, and willingness to take on “the single most achievable but ambitious goal,” that Richards said other states, and other political projects, might learn from Let’s Grow Kids.
A ‘full-court press’
Let’s Grow Kids began with Rick Davis, who in 2000 co-founded the organization’s precursor: the Permanent Fund for Vermont’s Children. Davis said that Buzz Schmidt — an early supporter of the movement in Vermont and founder of GuideStar International, a database tracking the effectiveness of nonprofits and charitable organizations — provided the crucial framework of a time-limited campaign.

Davis said the idea struck him as “brilliant.” With his board’s approval, he transitioned his Permanent Fund into Let’s Grow Kids, and hired Richards, then a deputy chief of staff for Gov. Peter Shumlin, to lead the campaign. 
As the nonprofit winds down, remaining assets from its various forms are being redistributed, some as grants to providers and advocacy organizations, and some in the form of a legacy fund operated by the Vermont Community Foundation.
Richards said in an interview last month that her role in the child care reform effort has been as “a believer.”  She had already been focused on early childhood education for Shumlin following a realization that the issue was “upstream” of many of the state’s most pressing issues — demographic balance, workforce development and the opioid crisis, among others. 
From the statehouse, she noticed a disconnect between lawmakers and Vermont’s network of early childhood educators. There was not a stable channel of communication between lawmakers and the troubled system they were working to fix.
“We can’t get organized if … we haven’t built trust,” she said.
Richards and her team of staff, powered by the 501(c)(3) nonprofit’s nearly $80 million in total private and public funding over the course of its lifetime, acquired a reputation for effectiveness as the years went by. Let’s Grow Kids organized public and private support for its new focus on child care, and in Richards’ words sought to “ready the system for investment,” which meant increasing Vermont’s care capacity, and connecting local providers with grants and technical assistance.
Financial records show that Let’s Grow Kids used its resources boldly, outspending its reported revenue by millions of dollars most years and dipping into considerable but dwindling assets from its frontloaded capital campaigns. At its peak, the nonprofit employed nearly 40 people.
The Let’s Grow Kids Action Network, as a financially separate 501(c)(4), could be even more politically directed in its approach, lobbying sitting officials and endorsing candidates in statewide races.

It was a simultaneous effort at all levels of the state’s child care system, Richards said — a “full-court press.” 
“Are we doing good work? That’s nice,” she recalled reflecting sardonically as the years went by. The real question, she said, was always: “Are we on track to win by 2025?” 
It was this all-out approach, according to former CEO of Bennington’s Global-Z International and fellow child care advocate Dimitri Garder, that powered the movement and made it attractive to crucial donors, particularly in the business community. Such supporters are able to make big contributions but are wary of perceived waste — planning to close down on a specific date in advance inspired confidence, he said. 
That didn’t mean the campaign was always popular in its forcefulness, Garder added — he had heard some lawmakers describe the group’s lobbying as heavy-handed.
“They were a juggernaut, you know?” he said. “Not everybody loved that.”
Noah Futterman, a spokesperson for the Action Network, said the campaign had sometimes needed to push hard for what it wanted — but that was the nature of the work.
“Effective advocacy movements need to be relentless and unapologetically focused on their mission,” he said in a text message. “Real systems-change is hard.”
‘An investment in our children’
When Act 76 finally passed in the 2023 legislative session, it did so through bipartisan support that powered an override of Gov. Phil Scott’s veto.
Let’s Grow Kids’ leadership said supporters — in the statehouse and elsewhere — came to the issue with widely varying priorities for desired outcomes of Act 76.
Studies have shown that access to high-quality child care has far-reaching beneficial impacts on a number of economic and public health metrics, including developmental outcomes for children and workforce participation, especially for mothers.
Davis said for him, the work of child care advocacy had begun with a focus on social equity for kids. But as compelling as that argument might be emotionally, he said, getting the Legislature  to approve a new source of revenue required demonstrating that an investment of this size would also create a return on investment for the state.
Garder agreed. Coming to the issue via the Vermont Business Roundtable, a body of business leaders in the state that was deeply involved with advocacy for child care, he said it was unusual for a bill involving a hike in taxes to gain such broad support among his colleagues.
Rep. Michael Marcotte, R-Coventry, one of the bill’s sponsors, was among the Republicans who supported the changes against the governor’s wishes. 
For Marcotte, who chairs the House Committee on Commerce and Economic Development, the proposal wasn’t just throwing money at the problem — studies and testimonies had forecast a relatively immediate boost for the state’s finances. The Rand Corporation, in a commissioned report, predicted that the new tax revenue would likely not cause significant hardship, but might boost the state’s gross product by up to $280 million each year.
“I think that people see it as a future investment in the economy of the state, and an investment in our children,” Marcotte said.
Richards said for her, the various justifications for progress on child care don’t need to exist in the same hierarchy for everyone.
“Tell me what you care about, and I’ll tell you why child care is your thing,” she said. “This is the right thing to do for kids.”
‘Feasible’: A new era for child care
Act 76 brought a level of investment that requires ongoing attention, Richards said. While her organization is shuttering, other players in Vermont’s child care industry will continue to advise and support the state’s implementation of new policies.
“We’ve left an ecosystem behind,” Richards said of her partner organizations. “They are in great shape.”
First Children’s Finance Vermont, directed by former Let’s Grow Kids staffer Erin Roche, will lead the business side of the effort. The newer organization, which Roche founded three years ago, offers loans and grants, financial analysis services and hiring consultations to the state’s child care providers.
Roche said workforce issues remain a major outstanding problem in the state’s child care industry — a labor shortage, relatively low wages, and scant benefits have made it difficult to keep pace with the publicly funded boom. Roche is looking to help providers navigate the workforce issue, along with former Let’s Grow Kids colleague Sharron Harrington, who runs the Vermont Association for the Education of Young Children.
Futterman said the Let’s Grow Kids Action Network will be supporting the passage of S.119, a bill that seeks to implement a state-controlled process for licensing early childhood educators, among efforts to further increase child care access and affordability this legislative session.
Richards herself will stay on as an adviser and board chair for the Action Network, and several former Let’s Grow Kids staff occupy the nonprofit’s three other positions. 
It’s not surprising to Roche that ex-Let’s Grow Kids staff are in a number of such leadership positions around the state. “They invested so much in the leadership abilities of their staff,” Roche said of Richards and her team.
The emphasis on data-driven reports, and close tracking of the new legislation’s impact, will continue through Building Bright Futures, the state’s independent advisory organization for services to kids from birth through age eight.
Morgan Crossman, the nonprofit’s executive director, said her organization’s Early Childhood Data and Policy Center aims to continue bringing reports to legislators that “help them understand the impact of the law.”
“(Let’s Grow Kids’) absence will be a significant shift in the field and across the state,” Crossman said, but she is confident in the network of organizations the nonprofit is leaving behind.
Building Bright Futures released its five-year strategic plan for Vermont’s early childhood education system last month. Among its priorities are workforce development, support for parents in the workplace and ensuring quality of care.
For many providers, however, Act 76 has already been a lifeline.
Before Jocelyn York became co-executive director of Turtle Island Children’s Center in Montpelier, she worked at the Neighborhood Schoolhouse, an early childhood education center in Brattleboro. Both organizations, she said, were on a “rocky road” prior to the passage of Act 76.
The end of pandemic-era assistance for child care was abrupt, she said, and the cost of tuition was rising fast due to inflation, among other factors.
“Lots of people are struggling to pay,” she said, “and so we weren’t really sure what we could budget for every month.”
York said that throughout the uncertainty surrounding public funding and when providers could expect to see it arrive, Let’s Grow Kids was “so amazing” in its communication and attentiveness to providers. 
While gaps remain in the state’s support of the child care industry — particularly for infant and toddler care, York said — the new tuition assistance has been transformative.
“It was feasible to think about moving forward,” York said. “It’s not fixed for everyone, but it’s much better.”
Turtle Island just moved into a new space, and is licensed to enroll up to 77 kids, York said. 
York’s experience is par for the course among Vermont’s child care centers, according to advocates. Providers across the state have told VTDigger that Act 76 allowed them to open or expand their business, or stopped it from closing.
Let’s Grow Kids, and the change they pushed through, “made a huge change for the landscape of early childhood (education), particularly in Vermont, but also … creating a model for the rest of the country,” York said.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)A Latino civil rights organization hoping to prevent the Trump administration from denying in-state college tuition rates to some immigrants can intervene in a lawsuit challenging a Kentucky policy, a judge ruled Wednesday. 
The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) sought to intervene in the lawsuit on behalf of Kentucky Students for Affordable Tuition (KSAT). The group is an unincorporated association of college students who are immigrants living in Kentucky without permanent legal status who under current Kentucky policy qualify for in-state tuition. In-state tuition is much cheaper than rates charged non-Kentucky residents.
The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed the challenge to Kentucky’s tuition policy earlier this year, suing Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear and Kentucky education officials. The department argued the policy discriminates against U.S. citizens. The case is in the U.S. District Court of Eastern Kentucky. 
The DOJ and the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education (CPE) had reached a tentative settlement to enjoin the state policy, pending a decision on MALDEF’s request to intervene. 
“The Department is in the process of reviewing the court’s opinion and will continue efforts to ensure U.S. students are not treated like second-class citizens,” a DOJ spokesperson told the Kentucky Lantern on Wednesday. 
CPE is reviewing the order but did not have a comment on Wednesday, a CPE spokesperson said. 
In his order allowing MALDEF to intervene, U.S. District Judge Gregory Van Tatenhove wrote that the student group had asserted it was not aware that state officials “did not represent KSAT’s interests until the parties moved for entry of a consent judgment enjoining the enforcement” of the state policy. 
MALDEF’s motion had said if the Kentucky regulation is overturned, the students’ tuition could increase up to 152%. Some of the students’ rates will increase from $446 to $897 per semester credit hour. The students represented had attended or planned to attend Kentucky public colleges and universities this fall.
Kentucky Republicans have criticized Beshear for not stopping the state regulation on tuition. Earlier this year, Republican state Rep. T.J Roberts, of Burlington, filed a bill to undo the Kentucky policy. It didn’t get a committee hearing in the GOP-controlled state legislature.
The DOJ has made similar challenges in other states in recent months.

,DC,2025-11-19 22:07:34+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Contempt investigation over Trump deportation flights to resume,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/contempt-investigation-over-trump-deportation-flights-resume,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. District Judge James Boasberg said Wednesday he will proceed with his inquiry on whether there is sufficient evidence to charge officials in the Trump administration with contempt for violating his order to return deportation flights to the United States.Following an appeals ruling last week, Boasberg has the ability to resume a contempt investigation against the Trump administration relating to his March 15 order, which required several deportation planes that contained hundreds of Venezuelan men removed under an obscure wartime law to return to the U.S. Instead, the planes landed in El Salvador, and 137 men were detained at the mega-prison known as CECOT.“I certainly intend to find out what happened that day,” Boasberg said.He ordered the Department of Justice and the American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the suit against the government, to submit by Monday filings on how to proceed with the inquiry, such as potential witnesses and hearings as well as sworn declarations to the court. An attorney on behalf of the Department of Justice, Tiberius T. Davis said the Trump administration doesn’t believe Boasberg should move forward with the inquiry.Boasberg cited several appellate judges who have ruled that he has the ability and jurisdiction to continue his fact-finding inquiry into the events of March 15.“Justice requires me to move promptly,” he said.Boasberg told Davis that he wants to get to the bottom of which official, or officials, gave the order to ignore his temporary restraining order to turn the planes back toward U.S. soil while they were in the air. Removals challengedAdditionally, Boasberg heard arguments from ACLU lead attorney Lee Gelernt on a request to require the Trump administration to give the 137 Venezuelan men the opportunity to challenge their removal under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The men removed under the law remained at CECOT for several months until they were returned to Venezuela in a prisoner exchange. Gelernt said that a majority of that group want the opportunity to challenge their removal under the wartime law, in the form of a habeas petition, which immigrants use to challenge their detention. He said the ACLU has been able to reach about one-third of the group members and they wish to pursue their claims either back in the U.S. or through a virtual hearing. “They are still very, very traumatized about what happened,” Gelernt said, adding that many fear being returned to CECOT if they come back to the U.S.Remote hearings?Davis argued that if the men want to continue with their habeas claim, then they would have to be detained in the U.S., rather than make the challenge virtually. “To fulfill a habeas, they have to be in our custody one way or another,” Davis said. He said they would likely be taken to the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, but said that was not definite. Gelernt said the federal government should provide a plan in order for the men to make their due process claim.  “Some may want to know if there is a remote option, if they found a sufficiently safe hiding place within Venezuela,” Gelernt said.Boasberg agreed, and said the U.S. Supreme Court also agreed when it ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of the wrongly deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia as part of a due process case. Abrego Garcia was also taken to CECOT and detailed the physical and psychological torture he experienced there.",,,,2025-11-19 17:58:21.145190

The […]","The Cabell-Huntington Health Department will close the syringe services portion of its harm reduction program on Dec. 16, officials say. (The Herald-Dispatch file photo)The agency that distributed nearly half of all clean syringes provided to drug users in West Virginia last year will end its syringe service program next month, officials confirmed to West Virginia Watch on Wednesday.
The Cabell-Huntington Health Department will stop distributing syringes as a part of its harm reduction program on Dec. 16. The halt in services will be the latest in a years-long string of syringe program closures across West Virginia due to politics and policy changes.
Dr. Michael Kilkenny, chief executive officer and health officer of the Cabell-Huntington Health Department
Dr. Michael Kilkenny, health officer and chief executive officer of the health department, said the closure was due to “several forces,” most recently an executive order from the Trump administration and waning support of philanthropists.
The Cabell-Huntington Health Department started offering syringe services in September of 2015 in an effort to address disease spread as the heroin epidemic raged. It was the first of its kind in the state. 
The health department’s harm reduction program — which includes the syringe distribution — gets federal funding through a grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The health department has not used federal, state or local funding to purchase syringes, Kilkenny said. For syringes, the program depended on donations. 
“The philanthropists are not willing to invest money in an effort that has such apparent political volatility,” Kilkenny said. “So rather than use their money to purchase syringes for something that could be closed at any minute, they are not offering us any support for syringes, so we can’t buy syringes.”
Trump issued the “Ending Crime and Disorder on America’s Streets” executive order on July 24. The executive order directs the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services to prevent discretionary grants issued by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration not to fund harm reduction programs or safe consumption sites, which the order says are “[efforts] that only facilitate illegal drug use and its attendant harm.”
Trump’s executive order comes after years of fights over science and against stigma when it comes to confronting drug addiction in West Virginia. Since 2018, lawmakers both locally and statewide have imposed restrictions on syringe programs that health officials say only harm the people who need them most.
Syringe services programs offer people who use injection drugs sterile syringes, as well as safe disposal of syringes and screening and care for other diseases. According to the CDC, the programs play an important role in reducing the transmission of viral hepatitis, HIV and other infections. They also are shown to reduce needle litter in communities and increase the likelihood of someone who uses drugs entering a recovery program.
Last year, according to information provided to West Virginia Watch, the Cabell-Huntington Health Department distributed more than 363,500 clean syringes to people in the region. That was more than 45% of all clean syringes distributed in the state and the highest distribution rate of any syringe service program operating.
Several years ago, an HIV cluster tied to drug use hit Cabell County hard. Kilkenny said rapid expansion of that outbreak was controlled within a year largely because of the syringe service program.
“We have much fewer cases than we did in 2019, 2020, but we still have ongoing transmission, and yes, [an uptick is] a deep concern of ours, as far as taking this tool away from the response and trying to then bolster the response in every other way that we can,” Kilkenny said. 
As of Nov. 2, Cabell County reports 16 new HIV diagnoses in 2025, with 12 of those tied to IV drug use. That’s higher than the 14 total cases reported last year, according to the state Office of Epidemiology and Prevention Services.
In recent years, health experts have repeatedly urged caution when looking at the state’s HIV numbers. They question how adequate the state’s testing infrastructure is and what efforts are being made to ensure high-risk populations in particular are being surveyed.
Kilkenny said most of the program’s clients have been “generally disappointed” when they’re told of the closure, but they’re also aware of the political reality. 
“They are not necessarily surprised, but disappointed,” Kilkenny said. “We’ve tried to maintain the highest level of prevention that we could sustain, and it looks like we’re going to lose this tool.”
Kilkenny said the health department will continue to offer other harm reduction services, including distributing naloxone and testing for HIV and sexually transmitted infections and referral to treatment. 
“We are going to continue, and we’ve always had a very strong presence of linkage to care, so that if someone wants to stop using drugs, we can get them into a program immediately” he said. “So we’re going to continue offering support towards recovery.”
He said the health department is looking to enhance its clinical services so that more HIV cases are virally suppressed in order to prevent transmission of the disease. 
“We’re going to continue to work very diligently. We’re going to use every tool we can use to prevent infection,” Kilkenny said. “One of the ways to do that is to make people aware of their infection and then get them treated to where they’re not infectious. That’s a good thing about HIV, in particular. When you’re adequately treated, you don’t infect other people.”
Kilkenny said health officials are disappointed the program will close, but the department has to adapt to shifting policies. 
“We have to be as effective as we can be, using everything we’ve got available,” he said. “So we’re going to keep on serving these clients. We’re going to keep on helping people, and we’re going to hope for the best.”

They suggest more rollbacks of regulations that could lead to development in Louisiana and across the country in areas that have long been shielded.,"Plant life of an inland wetland in Cameron Parish, Louisiana. (Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)The Environmental Protection Agency wants to take away federal protections for millions of acres of wetlands in Louisiana and the rest of the country, allowing them to be polluted or developed without the need for permits under a new set of proposed regulations the agency unveiled Monday. 
The EPA’s long-awaited proposed rules would change what counts as federally protected waters in the United States. They suggest more rollbacks of regulations that could lead to development in Louisiana and across the country in areas that have long been shielded. 
The draft regulations cover what are called the Waters of the United States, or WOTUS. They include new definitions for what counts as a wetland that falls under the protection of the Clean Water Act.
In short, the proposed updates require wetlands to touch permanent bodies of water — such as lakes, rivers or streams — and have visible surface water for at least part of the year in order for federal safeguards to apply.
Most at risk in Louisiana are the non-coastal, inland swamps that make up about 59% of the state’s wetlands area, according to an analysis from the Environmental Law Institute. 
Environmental advocates argue the rules would put important ecosystems, flood control measures and pollution management at risk, while legal experts worry the definitions will only add more confusion to an already complex topic.  
The public will have 45 days to submit a comment on the proposed WOTUS rules once they are officially published in the Federal Register on Thursday. The EPA will then consider whether any comment warrants revisions in the proposed regulations, which would be incorporated into the final version. The Trump administration has not laid out a timeline for putting the new rules into effect.
“I think it’s a big alarm for pretty much wherever you are, that federal oversight over wetlands is drastically limited, and there is not a backup plan to deal with this,” said Haley Gentry, assistant director of the Tulane Institute on Water Resources Law and Policy. 
“It’s going to create a lot of … problems for states and local communities going forward who have relied on federal oversight and the mitigation for wetlands and development,” she added. “There will be confusion.”
The removal of certain federal wetlands protections follows the 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Sackett v. EPA, which pared back federal authority to enforce the Clean Water Act. An Idaho couple successfully challenged the agency when it stopped them from developing their property, with justices interpreting the definition of Waters of the United States to mean “’only those relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing.”
The proposed rule raises questions in Louisiana as to whether future construction could disqualify even more wetlands from Clean Water Act protection, said Matt Rota, senior policy director for Healthy Gulf, a Louisiana-based environmental advocacy group.   
Central to whether or not a wetland is protected is whether or not it touches a lake, river or bayou on which a boat can navigate. 
“In Louisiana, that can get a little squishy,” Rota said.
The Louisiana Legislature passed a law earlier this year that defines wetlands separated from surface water connections by manmade levees as “fastlands,” excluding them from state protections. With the newly proposed federal WOTUS definitions following the same deregulatory lines as Louisiana, certain wetlands here would no longer have any safeguards against development, advocates say. 
Plus, Louisiana now allows future construction of levees and berms to disqualify wetlands from state protection. Even if an area has coverage under the law today, it could lose it if a levee is built around it in the future, Rota said. 
State Sen.“Big Mike” Fesi, R-Houma, who authored the legislation, said this is an area in which revisions to the proposed WOTUS rule are necessary. 
“In public comment, they can go through all of those and get some good answers for stuff like that,” said Fesi. “I don’t want to go fill up a swamp that’s full of cypress trees.”
Fesi added that he is “excited” about the proposed rules and believes current building codes are adequate to address concerns over building in flood-prone areas. 
“I think there’s been a lot of rules put in place that protects against some of the problems” with flooding, he said. “Some of it just went too far, and so they’re cutting back.”
Some Louisiana wetlands will still have protections in place against development. For example, any area that touches the navigable waters of the Gulf of Mexico falls under the Clean Water Act, and the state’s coastal zone construction restrictions protect other areas.
More at risk are the state’s inland wetlands, which have no added barriers to development without the Clean Water Act. These areas would need to meet the federal definition of having surface water at least during the wet season as well as continually touch a waterway like a lake, river, stream or bayou. 
“Hopefully this will not have a huge impact on coastal restoration activities and protecting our coastal wetlands,” Rota said. “But our coastal wetlands are only as healthy as our internal wetlands and internal waterways that are feeding them.”
“Whenever you remove some of these more upland wetlands or ephemeral streams that supply either fresh water, nutrients … it could still have an impact,” he added.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_9859-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-19 16:57:42.130671

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services paid over $900,000 in fines as a result of noncompliance with a competency restoration consent decree. 
Under the federal consent decree, the agency is subject to fines based on their ability to reduce the waitlist for competency restoration services on a set timeline. 
The fines began accruing Oct. 1, and the agency paid $928,400 on Nov. 10 with funds appropriated by the Legislature for this purpose, said Maria Chaverri, an agency spokesperson. 
The consent decree settled a 2023 lawsuit that alleged the Mental Health Department violated the rights of mostly indigent defendants who had been declared incompetent to stand trial by failing to provide timely court-ordered competency restoration treatment. The Legislature approved the settlement in March. 
It’s expected to cost between $26 million and $45 million over three to five years, depending on the agency’s ability to provide competency restoration services on a set timeline, as required. 
“Much of our foundational work has focused on training and centralizing data, crucial to untangling a complex system and preparing for improvements,” Chaverri said in a statement. “This will be a long process, and we’re committed to completing it.”
The fines are based on the number of people on the waitlist and how long individuals have been awaiting mental health services. 
Seven months after the settlement’s approval, the Mental Health Department was supposed to reduce the wait time to 60 days. As of Oct. 22, the average wait time for admissions to Oklahoma Forensic Center was reduced from 214 days to 79 days, an agency spokesperson said.
After 16 months, the agency is required to reduce the waitlist to 21 days, according to the consent decree. The settlement includes other benchmarks between seven and 16 months. 
The daily fines range from $100 to $500 per individual on the waitlist, depending on how long the person has spent awaiting services beyond the “maximum allowable” wait time, according to the consent decree. 
The lowest tier fine costs the Mental Health Department $100 per day for each individual on the waitlist for one to seven days longer than allowed. The fine can reach $500 per day per individual that waits more than 60 days beyond the allowed wait time. 
Court-appointed consultants previously released reports in June and September that found that while the Mental Health Department has made changes to improve services and comply, but hasn’t done enough to meet the required benchmarks of the settlement. 
Plaintiffs had sought additional, separate monetary sanctions against the Mental Health Department for noncompliance following these reports, but a judge declined to issue an order doing so. 
The state agency requested $17 million from the Legislature for the upcoming fiscal year to implement a court agreement to fix the state’s competency restoration system and to cover any related fines for noncompliance.

Members of the House Judiciary Committee voted 15-1 to approve HB 6003, which would revamp Florida’s wrongful death laws in two ways: Parents of single, childless, adult children 25 and older could file wrongful death lawsuits arising from alleged medical malpractice; and adult children could pursue claims for single parents who die from medical malpractice.
In wrongful death suits, plaintiffs can recover economic damages and non-economic damages such as lost income and services, mental pain and suffering, and loss of companionship.
State Rep. Dana Trabulsy via Florida House
Fort Pierce Republican and bill sponsor Rep. Dana Trabulsy made an impassioned plea Wednesday afternoon for committee members to support the bill.
“It’s really important that while I have this opportunity in the Florida House, whether it’s for medical malpractice or any other piece of legislation that I file and run or vote for, that I know that I have fought for people that can’t fight for themselves. That is the only way I’ll be able to rest my head on my pillow when I leave is knowing that I can account for my own actions,” she said. 
“And so I want each of you to account for yours, too. And when you vote on this bill  today, if you can look at these families and let them know that their loved ones’ lives matter with a yes [vote] or didn’t with a no [vote].”
Gov. Ron DeSantis vetoed identical legislation last year but the action hasn’t seemed to dissuade the House from pursing the changes again this year.

Lobbyists, lawsuits, and caps
The legislation has attracted scores of lobbyists on both sides of the the debate, from insurance interests to organized medicine to AARP Florida.
Proponents of HB 6003 say it fixes Florida’s “free kill” law, a moniker coined to describe the different legal protections in Florida statute based on someone’s age, family, and marital status. Conversely, opponents, including the governor, argue the bill would increase the number of lawsuits and result in higher medical malpractice premiums. They have coined their own name for the proposal: “jackpot justice.”
Some opponents, though, say they could be swayed to support the measure with an amendment to limit damages that can be recovered for all medical malpractice cases, not just the newly expanded class of litigants in HB 6003.

Florida has not had caps on pain and suffering awards in medical malpractice lawsuits since 2017, when the Florida Supreme Court ruled that they are unconstitutional. But the makeup of the court has changed since then. DeSantis has appointed five of the seven justices and business and medical interests are eager to put the matter to a new test.
While House Speaker Daniel Perez, R-Miami, has been steadfast in its opposition to capping damages, Senate President Ben Albritton, R-Wauchula, has been more open to the idea. An attempt to place a $1 million cap for medical malpractice and wrongful death failed by a one-vote margin in the Senate earlier this year. The Senate ultimately voted to pass the legislation without the caps but the governor vetoed it.
DeSantis referred to caps on damages (and attorney fees) as “safeguards” in his veto message.
“Any approach to medical negligence reform without including proper safeguards is a risk for Floridians because it would make the legal landscape ripe for predatory trial attorneys. I encourage any future legislative action to include regulatory reforms and these safeguards, striking a balance between providing relief and accountability, while preserving quality access and care for Floridians,” the veto letter notes.
Public testimony
Members of the House Judiciary Committee listened to about an hour of public testimony before voting to advance the bill. Only Miami Lakes Republican Rep. Tom Fabricio voted against the bill.
Florida Hospital Association General Counsel Kristen Dobson told committee members that Florida is in the midst of a medical malpractice insurance crisis and the legislation would only make the situation worse.
“Escalating insurance rates make it increasingly difficult for health care providers, particularly those practicing in key specialties like obstetrics, family medicine, emergency medicine, and orthopedics, to secure affordable and adequate coverage. This is not hyperbole,” she said, adding that a “major hospital” in south Florida recently saw its reinsurance costs increase by 73%. She did not name the hospital.
“To be clear, escalating insurance costs are not indicative of some sort of quality issue. They are because of Florida’s highly litigious medical malpractice environment,” she said.
Dobson and Florida Justice Reform representative Andy Bollen, a defense attorney, both testified that since DeSantis’ veto of the bill this spring there have been “nuclear verdicts” in Florida medical malpractice cases. The phrase, Dobson said, describes jury awards exceeding $10 million. Two months ago, a Tampa Bay jury awarded $70 million in a malpractice case,  Dobson said. Nearly 73% of the verdict was for noneconomic damages.
Bollen discussed another large medical malpractice verdict in Orlando in which a jury awarded three plaintiffs $15 million each.
But committee member Rep. Michael Gottlieb, a criminal defense attorney and Democrat from Davie, wasn’t shocked by the jury awards.
“You know what I hear when I hear ‘nuclear verdict?’ I hear gross negligence. The reason a jury is awarding somebody $15 million is somebody made a huge mistake, something that was blatantly obvious, and somebody made it a huge mistake. That’s why you have a nuclear verdict. That’s why a jury says you need to pay more than anybody else should pay, because you breached the standard of care. Your causation was so high and you committed a huge harm. That’s why we have nuclear verdicts, not because people’s mentality is changing.”
Retired Ocala obstetrician and Florida Medical Association representative Dr. Douglas Murphy also hammered away at the recent nuclear verdicts and the potential damage the bill could do to the health care delivery system. Murphy criticized the advocates’ description of the legal system as “free kill.”
“I’ve heard the devastating stories of adult children who have died due to poor care and the inability of their parents to sue on their behalf, and my heart truly breaks for those people. Malpractice unfortunately occurs, and yet, I have never met any physician who intentionally tries to harm or kill a patient. Referring to this bill as the “free kill” bill is both insulting and misleading, he insisted
Kristy Meadows is a proponent of the legislation but also struggles with the “free kill” description.
Her father, Teddy Meadows, died on April 6 after being discharged from a south Florida hospital.
“They dismissed his symptoms. They dismissed his test results, and he was discharged without a diagnosis, without any treatment. And he died days later,”  she told the committee.
“I hate that it’s called free kill. I hate that someone can refer to my dad as a free kill. But sadly, I think that name effectively describes what this law does. I think it discriminates against unmarried adults with no minor children, and it denies equal rights under the law based on age and marital status. It also allows medical negligence to occur just against these particular persons in Florida, and it allows medical negligence to occur without consequences, and that inherently decreases the overall quality of health care. ”

(Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)NEWARK — Immigration enforcement and federal officials surrounded a seafood market in Newark Wednesday and detained workers in the second raid conducted at the warehouse this year. 
It’s unknown how many Ocean Seafood Depot workers were detained during the raid that started around 8 a.m. at the market on the corner of Adams and Delancey Streets. Advocates who conduct rapid responses to raids across the state said they are starting to hear from family members who are looking for their loved ones. 
“We’re trying to confirm how many workers, if they have a case — I think everybody’s going to be checking in with their folks,” said Li Adorno of Movimiento Cosecha. “We’re going to start to piece the answers together.” 
About 40 masked agents from different federal agencies — some wearing tactical gear and holding rifles — shut down the block of Adams Street to conduct the raid. Several workers were pulled out of the depot and given red wristbands to denote they were not detained. 
Jenny Garcia, a longtime immigration activist who responded to the raid Wednesday morning, said she spoke to people who said they were zip tied before being asked about their immigration status by Homeland Security Investigation and Federal Bureau of Investigations officials. 
“We’re seeing this pattern of this dehumanizing marking on who is allowed to leave the raid and who is going to be taken,” she said. 
About 12:30 p.m. the last agents pulled away in white vans and black SUVs as activists gathered on the sidewalk yelled at them to leave. 
Christine Cuttita, a spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said Homeland Security agents “executed a court-authorized search warrant as part of an active criminal investigation involving labor operations at Ocean Seafood.” 
She declined to comment further, citing an ongoing investigation. U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond for comment. 
Federal officials had a warrant to conduct the Wednesday raid, unlike the first enforcement episode in January. During that raid in the first few days of President Donald Trump’s second term, several people, including a U.S. military veteran, were detained. 
Since then, immigration officials have been actively conducting raids across the state. Twenty-nine people were arrested during an August raid in Edison, and, two weeks ago, enforcement officials arrested 46 workers at an Avenel warehouse. Several of those detainees are still being held at Delaney Hall, a federal immigration jail in Newark. 
Workers waiting outside the market declined to speak with reporters Wednesday. The scene was tense between activists and some workers who said they voted for Trump and supported ICE raids at their workplace. One woman, who said her friend was taken, cried on the sidewalk as she hugged friends. 
Adorno noted there was “a lot more ICE presence this time around.” And he added that, this being the second raid at the seafood depot, some people are aware of the risk, but immigrant workers without legal status may still be taking jobs here. 
“If you may run the risk of being detained, you’re going to try to avoid any place where a raid has happened,” he said. “But the reality is that people are struggling. People need to work.” 
Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a staunch advocate for immigrants who was arrested and charged with trespassing at Delaney Hall earlier this year, did not immediately respond for comment. His charges were later dropped. 
Rep. LaMonica McIver, who is facing trial over alleged assault during the scuffle outside the jail during Baraka’s arrest, said the Trump administration is “using fear as a tool.” 
“They have been doing so since Jan. 23 when they raided this same Newark market. We owe it to our neighbors to stand up for them,” she said on social media. “That’s exactly what I’ll keep doing.”

John Arch of La Vista, speaker of the Nebraska Legislature. Oct. 30, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska lawmakers will begin their 60-day legislative session in January with a larger projected deficit than the hole they just filled during the 90-day session this year.
The new projected deficit stands at roughly $471 million, as confirmed by Legislative Fiscal Analyst Keisha Patent during a meeting Thursday of the Nebraska Legislature’s Tax Rate Review Committee.
“I wish it was rosier, but we’ll figure it out,” said State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, the committee’s chair, at the end of the meeting.
Lawmakers this spring grappled with a fluctuating deficit that at one point grew to $432 million. After some cuts, they ended the session with a projected surplus of about $4 million by the end of the biennium in 2027.
However, state senators left a structural deficit that would have grown to about $129 million by the end of the following biennium in 2029.
Shortly after the session ended, new estimates and revenue numbers pushed the current two-year budget back into a projected shortfall of about $95 million at the previous Tax Rate Review Committee meeting in July. That meeting also grew the next biennium’s projected deficit to $218 million.
Then, at Nebraska’s Economic Forecasting Advisory Board’s latest meeting Oct. 31, board members lowered predictions for expected state revenues by roughly $367 million over the next two fiscal years.
Those adjustments alone grew the shortfall to about $451 million. In addition, higher-than-expected obligations for community college aid and special education reimbursements brought the projected deficit to $471 million.
The next biennium’s projected deficit grew to at least $690 million, but Patent said it could be up to $1 billion more based on the forecasting board’s latest projections. She said she calculated the out-year deficit based on Nebraska’s historical revenue growth, which typically ebbs and flows every few years.
The state’s monthly tax receipts for 2025 have been a mixed bag, but overall monthly revenues have fallen below past forecasts. The latest receipts for October show a net gain of $311 million, which Patent said was modestly above the projections for that month.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Speaker of the Legislature John Arch of La Vista, who serves on the committee, noted that the state’s current trend of lower revenues can be explained in part by the Legislature’s decision in 2023 to gradually lower individual and corporate income tax rates, which subsequently lowered the state’s annual revenues. These reductions are slated to halt at 3.99% in 2027, at which point Arch said he expects to see more growth in Nebraska’s economy.
“It’s kind of a reset over a period of years as you lower the rates,” Patent said. “So that’s anticipated that we’d get back on trend with the economy.”
Another contributor to the deficit is the “One Big Beautiful Bill” Congress passed this summer. Nebraska’s Department of Revenue released a report in September estimating that the bill would cost Nebraska’s state government about $216 million over the next two fiscal years, which was factored into the latest forecast.
Patent’s report outlined an avenue for lawmakers to potentially lower the projected shortfall to about $311 million, based on state agencies’ mid-biennium budget requests. A majority of agencies requested budget reductions, which would total roughly $160 million in additional general fund dollars over both years, if lawmakers approve the requests as written.
Typically, Patent said she calculates for an extra $5 million in general fund spending through mid-biennium adjustments.
Appropriations Committee Chair State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, said he was surprised by a few of the budget requests asking for higher appropriations. The largest of these would cover the state’s Medicaid shortfall, with the Department of Health and Human Services requesting an extra $56.5 million for the current fiscal year, and $77.1 million for fiscal year 2026-27. Patent said the increase is linked to higher-than-expected utilization of the service.

U.S. District Judge Stephen Limbaugh entered the verdict in March after China did not defend itself in the lawsuit. Speaking to reporters at her office Wednesday, Hanaway said she is working to compile a list of properties and other assets owned by government agencies named in the lawsuit.
“It’s been a long process for us to be able to enforce that judgment, but now we’ll enforce that judgment, much like any other judgment in this area,” Hanaway said.
The state will not try to take assets from companies owned by Chinese citizens or businesses, she said.
That would put the Smithfield Hog Production operation in north Missouri, previously known as Premium Standard Farms, off-limits. The farm is owned by China-based WH Group and is one of the most valuable Chinese-owned assets in the state.
“We can’t go after Chinese individuals or companies necessarily,” Hanaway said. “I might be proven wrong over time, but my belief is that we’ve got to go after those assets actually owned by China.”
In his ruling, Limbaugh wrote that China concealed the true nature of COVID-19 so it could stockpile protective gear that could limit spread of the virus.
“China’s pattern of actions strongly suggests that it had knowledge of the existence and human-to-human transmission of the COVID-19 virus as early as September 2019,” Limbaugh wrote. “China’s actions also suggest that China engaged in a deliberate campaign to suppress information about the COVID-19 pandemic in order to support its campaign to hoard PPE from Missouri and an unsuspecting world.”
Limbaugh found that Missouri lost tax revenue due to the pandemic and will experience a long-term loss of revenue as well, accepting the $8.04 billion estimate for the period 2020 to 2051. He added the state’s increased cost for protective gear, estimated at $123 million, due to the hoarding and tripled the amount to set the final judgment.
The judgment is against the Chinese government, the Communist Party of China, several national agencies, provincial and local governments around Wuhan and the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
The case was first filed by Eric Schmitt, who is now a U.S. Senator, and continued by Andrew Bailey, now co-deputy director of the FBI. Hanaway was appointed attorney general in September.
The Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C., did not respond to a request for comment from The Independent. 
In a statement to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said China would retaliate if assets are seized. The lawsuit is “purely malicious…. with extremely sinister intentions. China firmly opposes them and will not accept any so-called default judgments. We demand that the US return to rationality and correct its mistakes.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2302-e1755617763363.jpg,,,2025-11-19 16:57:42.130671

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer).Kentucky’s utility regulator and the Kentucky attorney general will appeal the dismissal of a complaint they brought before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) that alleged Kentucky Power customers were unfairly covering costs of transmission projects in other states. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last week dismissed the complaint brought this year by the Kentucky Public Service Commission (PSC) and Republican Kentucky Attorney General Russel Coleman against American Electric Power and its subsidiaries including Kentucky Power, which serves 160,000 customers in 20 Eastern Kentucky counties. 
The state utility regulator and Coleman had argued in a complaint filed in March that Kentucky Power customers were subsidizing — to the tune of $66 million from 2017 through 2022 — electricity transmission projects “hundreds of miles away” because of a cost-sharing arrangement for such investments across seven states. The arrangement included various AEP subsidiary utilities that are part of the PJM regional power grid. Kentucky Power customers pay among the highest average residential utility bills in the state, as both the Kentucky PSC and attorney general noted.
The transmission projects under scrutiny are referred to as supplemental or self-planned projects, or local transmission upgrades or investments that utilities individually plan within their own footprint. Critics have argued in recent years such projects lack proper oversight from state regulators and FERC to determine their necessity and cost-effectiveness.
FERC, which regulates interstate transmission and wholesale electricity markets, in its order dismissed the complaint because the attorney general and the state regulator failed to establish the cost-sharing arrangement for supplemental projects was “in a manner that is unjust and unreasonable or unduly discriminatory or preferential.” 
Kentucky Public Service Commission Chair Angie Hatton and AG Coleman told the Lantern both parties plan to appeal the dismissal. 
“Because we perceive a need to protect Kentucky Power ratepayers from longstanding unfair transmission costs, we do plan to file a motion for rehearing at FERC,” Hatton said in a statement to the Lantern. 
Coleman in a statement through a spokesperson, said, “We’ll keep fighting this unfair system that has taken advantage of Kentucky families for far too long. My responsibility as Attorney General is to promote affordable and reliable energy for Kentuckians, and that’s exactly what we’ll continue to do.” 
Emails and a call to a press office for American Electric Power asking about the complaint dismissal were not returned.
Claire Wayner, a senior associate at the nonpartisan think tank RMI that focuses on energy policy, co-wrote a report last year that targeted the “regulatory gap” among state utility regulators, FERC and regional power grid operators that allow such supplemental projects to receive little oversight. 
Wayner told the Lantern the complaint from Kentucky officials is an example of how “a state is trying to take action to close the regulatory gap.” 
“They can make one-off complaints to FERC,” Wayner said. “What I would like to see to really comprehensively close the regulatory gap is for PJM and its transmission owners and its states collectively to take actions to implement regional-first planning and ensure that these supplemental projects are really fully being integrated” to benefit ratepayers.
She said such “regional-first planning” would have utilities submit local transmission infrastructure needs to regional power grid operators such as PJM with such operators identifying what local projects are needed in a region. She pointed to a regional power grid operator in New England that will independently review utilities’ proposed local projects. 
“States can feel more confident in either issuing permits for these projects or denying permits for these projects based on information they get from the independent reviewer on things like the prudence of these investments, cost estimates, whether these assets actually need to be replaced or could have been designed in a more efficient manner — that sort of thing,” Wayner said.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_0033-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-19 16:57:42.130671

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Researchers and public health advocates said Wednesday that water quality and land use continue to be modifiable elements impacting public health, and in particular cancer, in Iowa. 
The experts spoke to a crowded conference room in the Olmsted Center at Drake University during the 2025 Iowa Nature Summit that touched on policies, practices and programs impacting a variety of Iowa’s natural elements.
Panelists at a session titled, “Nature and Public Health: Cancer, Water Quality and More” agreed that there is enough research demonstrating the link between agricultural practices, like fertilizer and pesticide application, in Iowa and adverse public health outcomes. 
“We know enough,” Audrey Tran Lam said. “I think what’s needed is more of a change in our level of acceptance of the evidence that’s out there.” 
Tran Lam, the environmental health program director at the University of Northern Iowa, said the public health field looks for “upstream solutions to downstream problems.”

A pressing “downstream problem” in Iowa is the rate of new cancer incidents, which is the second-highest in the nation, according to the latest Cancer in Iowa report. The state is also one of just two states with rising rates of new cancers. 
Dr. Richard Deming, the medical director of MercyOne’s Richard Deming Cancer Center in Des Moines, said these trends mean Iowa will soon have the highest rates of new cancers in the nation. 
Deming said there are a variety of factors that can contribute to developing cancer, many of which are not unique to Iowa. Two factors he said are unique to Iowa are radon exposure and environmental exposures. 
Radon is a naturally occurring, radioactive gas that seeps into houses through cracks in the foundation, or other openings, as soil and rock break down. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency shows that all counties in Iowa have a high potential of elevated indoor radon levels. 
The same EPA map shows other states also have high radon levels. 
Deming said pesticide and chemical application in Iowa, however, is “vastly different” than that of other states. 
“We have more pounds, if not tons of chemicals per square mile, and that is different,” Deming said. 
He said it’s not “realistic” that research will be able to find “exactly which combination” of the hundreds of agricultural chemicals cause which cancers to the same extent that cigarette smoke can be linked to lung cancer.
“But it’s not that we don’t have evidence,” Deming said. 
According to Deming, there are already a “number” of scientific reviews that show links of pesticides and nitrate contamination to certain types of cancers. 
“We have enough research to show the association, next we need to have public health policy … to help modify behavior,” Deming said. 
In the meantime, Deming’s top recommendations for Iowans are to test and mitigate for radon and to filter drinking water. 
The environmental correlation to cancer was also the focus of a series of listening sessions led by Iowa Environmental Council, the Harkin Institute for Public Policy & Citizen Engagement and Iowa Farmers Union. The sessions are part of a broader study of the correlation between cancer and the environment which is set to release in January. 
What’s happening upstream? 
Tran Lam said Iowa’s landscape is currently about 85% farmland, primarily in corn and soybean rotations. She said less than 1% of the state is dedicated to organic production. The state also leads in hog and egg production in the country, which Food & Water Watch estimates generates 109 billion pounds of waste each year. 
Tran Lam said it takes a “firehose” of synthetic inputs to “prop up” this landscape. She cited a 2023 USDA figure that found Iowa farmers applied 53 million pounds of herbicides to cropland that year. 
“This 53 million pounds number does not encapsulate the entire chemical burden that goes into conventional farming practices,” Tran Lam said, noting that pesticides, fertilizers and fungicides are also part of the “burden.” 
According to Tran Lam, research continues to emerge that shows low doses, or “environmentally relevant” doses of these chemicals are showing up in human bodies. 
She said nitrate pollution in public drinking water continues to be a problem in Iowa, which is also the “easiest point of public intervention for public health professionals to wrap their heads around.”  
Nitrate contamination was a topic of wide discussion in central Iowa this summer as elevated nitrate concentrations in the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers led Central Iowa Water Works to issue a lawn watering ban for its more than 600,000 customers. 
Later in the summer, a multiyear study commissioned by Polk County found that agriculture was the top contributor to central Iowa’s elevated nitrate levels. 
Tran Lam said while the EPA limits nitrates in drinking water to 10 milligrams per liter, “the epidemiology is there” to show that exposure to lower concentrations can also cause adverse health outcomes like: colorectal cancer, thyroid disease and neural tube defects. 
She said crop diversity — “even if it’s not an organic, regenerative system,” — is key to solving some of these problems. Rotating in some small grains to a traditional crop rotation can help reduce the inputs put onto the landscape in Iowa, she said.
Adam Shriver, director of nutrition and wellness policy at the Harkin Institute, suggested more public-health oriented policies as a solution moving forward. 
“It’s not whether it’s being covered in the media or not, whether people in this room are talking about it, but whether the people who are making decisions and making policy are doing things to address that issue,” Shriver said. 
Shriver suggested the state do things like fund a water monitoring network across the state that previously lost funding, modernize manure management plans, develop a map of drainage tile systems across the state and change policies to incentivize farmers to avoid planting crops on marginalized land. 
The other panelists agreed that policy, rather than voluntary action, will be necessary to mitigate some of these environmental factors. 
“We already know of policies that would be beneficial, and if we just leave everything as voluntary, we probably won’t get much done,” Deming said. “Let’s get the experts in agriculture together and then figure out how to use incentives and penalties to drive behavior that we know will reduce the chemicals getting into the water.”
Water quality was the topic of several other sessions at the summit Wednesday, including one on the economic impacts of Iowa’s water trails, one that called water quality Iowa’s “newest civil rights issue” and another that advocated for citizen water quality monitoring with programs like the Nitrate Watch at Izaak Walton League of America.

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado awarded nearly $1 million across seven cities to spur construction of accessory dwelling units, the state Department of Local Affairs announced Wednesday.
The grants are meant to reduce barriers in ADU construction, which the state has heavily promoted as a method to increase affordable housing units across the state. An ADU is a secondary and usually smaller residential space that shares a lot with a primary home. A 2024 law that went into effect this summer requires many municipalities in the state to allow ADU construction wherever zoning already allows for single-family homes.
“Colorado is leading the way on the freedom to build an accessory dwelling unit on your own property, and these grants will cut through red tape to help more Coloradans build and access these opportunities,” Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, said in a statement.

The grants include from $325,000 for Grand Junction’s ADU production program, $105,000 for a fee waiver program in Larimer County and $37,500 in Longmont for an ADU pre-approved plan update.
“Colorado families and communities are desperate for solutions to help address the housing crisis and build more homes for working Coloradans,” Sen. Kyle Mullica, a Thornton Democrat who sponsored the 2024 law, said in a statement. “These grants will help homeowners build an ADU on their property, making life more affordable and allowing more Coloradans to age in place.”
A little over 80% of the municipalities subject to the 2024 law are compliant, according to the governor’s office. Twelve are not compliant, which affects their consideration for various state grants from DOLA, the Office of Economic Development and International Trade, the Colorado Energy Office, and the Colorado Department of Transportation.
A handful of cities — Arvada, Aurora, Glendale, Lafayette, Greenwood Village and Westminster — sued the Polis administration in May over his threat to withhold funding if they do not adhere to recently-passed housing laws, including the ADU policy. They argue that their status as home-rule cities gives them a level of autonomy over land use codes. That lawsuit is still pending.
The second round of ADU grant applications will open in February.

They’ve lingered outside a laundromat leaving people afraid to leave a nearby church. Vested agents and unmarked cars went to a tortilla bake shop and then a grocery store. 
For two weekends in a row, and the second time in seven years, they shattered the calm in what one Forest resident said has always been “a peaceful place full of Hispanic people.”
Starting Nov. 2, residents saw Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officers wearing lettered vests stating “Police ICE” and “ERO” – Enforcement and Removal Operations. Unmarked cars accompanied them, and at least two ICE officers were present, according to photos taken of the agents that were circulated within the community through social media. 
Zully Lopez, who has lived in Forest for three years and grew up in nearby Morton, first became aware of ICE’s presence while she was at church Nov. 2. Members were talking about photos circulating of a sighting of agents near a laundromat on Hill Street. 
Then Lopez heard from a family member at Iglesia El Buen Pastor, a church on Pine Street whose parking lot entrance and exit are located near the laundromat. Over the phone, the family member said some people didn’t feel safe leaving, so they waited inside for an hour. Church officials could not be reached for comment.

Immigration agents detained a person from the laundromat, and then their van pulled into the church parking lot, blocking it for a few minutes. Later, Lopez said she and other members of the community learned that ICE went to a tortilla bake shop on Hill Street and detained a woman there. 
“Why stop there? Were you trying to intimidate?” asked Lopez, who is an American citizen. “That’s what you were trying to do, trying to intimidate good Christians of Missisisppi of that church and people who were trying to wash their clothes.” 
The next week, ICE officers returned. Residents reported seeing them on U.S. 80 where they stopped a truck and talked to the driver. Lopez said the area is near a Guatemalan grocery store. That Sunday, Enforcement and Removal Operations officers parked outside a Mexican grocery store, La Moreliana. It’s not clear whether anyone was detained.

A spokesperson from the Department of Homeland Security was not available for comment Tuesday or Wednesday about the presence of ICE officers and detention of people in Forest. 
Nationally, as of mid September, nearly 60,000 people have been detained by ICE and Customs and Border Protection, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse immigration data by Syracuse University. 
The Associated Press reported Tuesday that the Department of Homeland Security is preparing to deploy roughly 250 federal border agents to Louisiana and Mississippi in an initiative dubbed “Swamp Sweep” aimed at arresting nearly 5,000 people in the two states. Citing internal documents and people familiar with the operation, AP reported the initiative would heavily focus on southeastern Louisiana with additional enforcement in southeastern Mississippi.
Lopez said the immigrants in Forest have done nothing but work hard and came to the United States to pursue a better future for their children, which is what her parents did for her. 
Jeremy Litton, an immigration attorney who represents people from around the state, said guidance from the agency and a Board of Immigration Appeals decision have created a situation where people are being detained indefinitely without options for bond.

Even though she is an American citizen, Lopez said she feels targeted in Forest because of her skin color. 
A couple of weeks ago, Mississippi Highway Patrol stopped her family at a roadblock. Her husband was driving and she was in the backseat with their baby. They are Latino and have brown skin. 
A trooper asked if they have legal immigration status and if they were from there. Yes, Lopez’s husband replied. Then the trooper asked for his Social Security number, but before Lopez’s husband could provide it, the other said he didn’t have to because he spoke English well enough. 
The troopers let them go, but Lopez said she doesn’t feel safe anymore. 
A spokesperson from the Department of Public Safety, which oversees the highway patrol, did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday. 
In September, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled federal immigration officers can stop people without reasonable suspicion based on their apparent race or ethnicity, if they speak in Spanish or accented English, if they are in a place where immigrants are known to gather and if they work in specific jobs that immigrants are known to work. 
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who is Latina, wrote in her dissent that such a decision has enabled the Trump administration to declare all Latinos, regardless of U.S. citizenship, as “fair game to be seized at any time” if they fit the criteria. 
Lopez lived through the 2019 raids across poultry plants in central Mississippi. 
That morning in August 2019 was the first day of her sophomore year at Morton High School. Then came a call from her father saying immigration agents were at PH Food where her mother worked. Lopez remembers going to the principal to say that students needed to be informed because some of their parents worked at the plant. 
Lopez headed to PH Food while her father picked up her younger siblings from school. At the plant, she saw the buses loading people up and others handcuffed. Her mother was on one of the buses, and Lopez said that was when she realized immigration officers could take her, even though she had work authorization. Her mother was let go once ICE determined she had a Social Security number. 
She remembers seeing classmates distraught about their parents and some children who had to spend time at churches because their parents had been taken away. Lopez said she helped take a group of children to a church and heard a young girl ask if her mother was gone because she was working overtime. 
Since the raid, her mother was able to obtain legal permanent residency, commonly known as a green card. But her father, who entered the country without authorization decades ago, was deported to Mexico in August. He will have to wait 10 years before he can come to the United States because of his prior entry. 
That 2019 experience also changed the trajectory of Lopez’s life. She had worked at a bank and saw herself becoming a certified public accountant. But she felt called to help people navigate immigration matters. 
Lopez connected with an immigration nonprofit organization and went on to receive a bachelor’s degree in paralegal studies at Mississippi College. She now works at Litton’s law firm.

Roughly one third of the graduates, or six trainees, are headed to the Alaska State Troopers, in wildlife or state trooper roles. The state law enforcement agency has struggled with vacancies in recent years, which leaders have said has limited its ability to address time-sensitive criminal investigations. 
“We’re getting better. The vacancies are certainly higher than we would like them to be now, which I think is the case, not only across Alaska, but across the country. We would like to see those vacancies a lot lower than they are,” said Austin McDaniel, the department’s director of communications. 
With the new recruits, there are currently 55 commissioned officer vacancies out of 411 funded positions, about a 13 percent vacancy rate, which McDaniel said is an improvement for the department. 
“It’s very promising to see our vacancies in the fifties, that’s a great place. We’ve seen them in the upper seventies and even low eighties here over the last five years,” he said.
McDaniel said the vacancies are not currently impacting the state troopers responsiveness to the public and calls for service. But he said certain operations can be limited, depending on the department and region.
“One of the big impacts we’ll see is less, maybe, proactive policing, less troopers out looking for crime, especially public impact crime that might be occurring, less traffic enforcement, things like that,” he said. “We’ll still be able to, and still do today, respond to calls for service from the public, whether it’s a 911 call or a nonemergency call.” 
McDaniel said while some vacancies are standard due to turnover and the length of hiring and training times, the department is continuing to work on recruitment, hiring and training. 
At the law enforcement training academy, based in Sitka, new recruits completed 17 weeks and 1,000 hours of basic law enforcement training, including classroom and hands-on training. Trainees were instructed in use of force and de-esclation tactics, physical fitness, driving, and firearms, as well as exposed to pepper spray and shot by a Taser. Recruits were recognized at a Nov. 14 graduation ceremony, where some also received awards for physical fitness, firearm use, driving and overall performance as valedictorian. 
Some graduates are headed to local police departments in Kodiak, Kotzebue, Petersburg, Sitka and Juneau, as well as to the Anchorage Airport Police and Fire unit. One recruit will go to a village public safety officer post with the Association of Village Council Presidents in Western Alaska. 
“We are honored to welcome these new officers into Alaska law enforcement,” said James Cockrell, the commissioner for the Alaska Department of Public Safety in a prepared statement. “They should be proud of all the hard work they put in during the rigorous training at the academy. I am confident they will uphold the highest standards of professionalism and integrity while they serve the people of our great state.”
McDaniel explained new recruits are hired through respective departments, and after completing basic training they will return and continue several weeks of field training and evaluation, in a typical one year probationary period. 
For state troopers, McDaniel said recruits first go through a several week hiring process. “That includes a very intensive background check, a polygraph examination, a psychological examination, an oral board interview, a medical evaluation, and a physical fitness test. They have to complete all of those steps, and then they’re offered a hire date,” he said.
The Department of Public Safety began a new program last year for early hires to begin four to six weeks of training before the academy, McDaniel said, doing ride-alongs, working on physical fitness and learning about the department. “They’re able to go through and really familiarize themselves with the department, and recruits that participate in that have an exponentially higher likelihood of completing the training academy,” he said.
This year, about one quarter of recruits, or six trainees, did not complete the academy training program, he said, for a variety of reasons. “It’s a challenging profession, especially in a place like Alaska,” he said. “It’s not a job everyone can do.”
Upon graduation, state trooper graduates continue to their first duty assignments in Fairbanks, Soldotna or the Matanuska-Susitna Valley Borough, for two years. “We do our training in those communities because of the volume of calls we get there. New troopers are able to get exposure to a lot of different things that they can then bring on to other areas of their career,” McDaniel said. From there, Troopers can elect to transfer to other communities around the state.
Average pay for a new trooper with no experience in their first full year is $127,000, McDaniel said. The state offers a base pay of $93,000 per year, plus various incentives such as bonuses for certain shifts and rural posts, as well as offers for subsidized housing, retirement benefits, moving expenses and a patrol vehicle.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)A group of Black New Jersey leaders called on legislators to pass a series of criminal justice and voting reform bills before the end of this year’s lame duck session and urged Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill to look to the state’s Black leaders when staffing her administration.
They said lawmakers should reject bills that would end the attorney general’s supervision of the New Jersey State Police and lower the bar to charge minors accused of certain crimes as adults.
“The easy part is over. We already elected somebody. Now, we’ve got to get down to it,” Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who ran against Sherrill in the Democratic gubernatorial primary, said during a speech at St. James AME Church in Atlantic City.
They urged additional assistance for Black first-time homebuyers and increased public contracting opportunities for Black-owned businesses, as well as action to close the state’s racial wealth gap.
And they called on legislators to pass, and Gov. Phil Murphy to sign, bills that would create a state-level Voting Rights Act, codify use-of-force policies issued by the Attorney General’s Office, allow for the early release of some seniors serving jail sentences, and end New Jersey’s lifetime jury duty ban to those with felony convictions.
“Our state in New Jersey is worse than Alabama’s. It’s a permanent disqualification on jury service of folks who have been convicted of a crime. That’s a population of more than 500,000 people. Nearly a quarter of them are Black,” said Ryan Haygood, president and CEO of the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice.
And they said Sherrill’s cabinet appointments and judicial nominations should reflect New Jersey’s diverse population, arguing the state’s non-white voters delivered her a 14-point victory on Election Day.
The state’s white voters narrowly backed former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli (D-Somerset) at the polls this month, chiefly due to support among white men, but Sherrill won non-white voters’ support by broad, sometimes overwhelming margins.
“This is why we are here today to correct the narrative that has largely ignored this truth: Black people delivered,” said Rev. Charles Boyer, the founder of Salvation and Social Justice.
The speakers praised Sherrill’s selection of Centenary University President Dale Caldwell, who is Black, to run on her ticket as lieutenant governor but warned the administration against turning him into a clearinghouse for issues affecting the state’s Black communities.
“Dale Caldwell’s responsibilities are vast and overwhelming. One of them is not the be the Black whisperer,” said Haygood, adding, “He works on the inside to effectuate the vision that she has because we hold her accountable to it, not that he carries it all, because as you all know, that’s a setup.”

,DC,2025-11-19 21:22:29+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Stock trading by members of Congress could be banned in bipartisan push,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/stock-trading-members-congress-could-be-banned-bipartisan-push,,"WASHINGTON — At least 25 bills have been introduced this Congress to further limit lawmakers and their family members from trading individual stocks, and representatives across the aisle renewed pressure Wednesday on U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson to take up the issue.Their contention is members of Congress hold a serious advantage over everyday Americans when buying and selling stocks because of their access to information on Capitol Hill.The House Committee on Administration convened Wednesday morning to hear how existing guardrails laid out in the 2012 STOCK Act fall short and consider the options to revamp it.The Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, shortened to the STOCK Act, codified that members of Congress, congressional employees and other federal officials are not exempt from federal insider trading laws. The law also required that lawmakers and certain congressional staffers must disclose stock transactions that amount to over $1,000 within 45 days.The law built upon the late 1970s-era Ethics in Government Act that established financial disclosure requirements for officials in all three branches of government.“While rules already govern how public officials trade stocks, stronger restrictions may be necessary to restore trust and ensure officials are not profiting from their positions,” said Chair Bryan Steil, R-Wis.Ranking member Joe Morelle, D-N.Y., said that he “unequivocally” supports a ban on members of Congress trading individual stocks and “that ban should extend to the co-equal branches of government as well.”Law seen as ineffectivePolicy experts before the committee poked holes in the protective measures already on the books.“Despite allegations of improper conduct, no member of Congress has ever been prosecuted under the (STOCK) Act, nor do any public records exist indicating that officials have ever paid statutory fines for STOCK Act disclosure errors,” said James Copland, senior fellow and director of legal policy at the conservative Manhattan Institute. Trust in lawmakers and government officials to self-police is eroding, argued the experts and several committee members. Roughly 86% of the public across party lines wants to ban members of Congress from trading individual stocks, according to a 2023 survey from the University of Maryland School of Public Policy.Dan Savickas, vice president of policy and government affairs for the advocacy group Taxpayers Protection Alliance, said data collected by stock activity trackers and journalists reveals Congress’ sticky entanglement with the market. According to a January 2024 report from Unusual Whales, a platform that monitors lawmakers’ stock transactions, dozens of members who traded in 2023 outperformed the S&P 500 Index. A New York Times investigation published in 2022 found 3,700 stock transactions by members of Congress from both parties from 2019 to 2021 “posed potential conflicts between their public responsibilities and private finances.” Savickas said a number of issues exist in the law’s current form, not least of which is that the STOCK Act “does not prevent conflicted trading by members of Congress, but merely requires them to report when and if they do so.”Plus, many report them late without consequence, he added. Additionally, a violation is only subject to a $200 penalty and enforcement is left up to the executive branch, leaving it vulnerable to subjectivity and politics, Savickas said.Some members of the committee questioned how lawmakers would be taxed should they be forced to divest, and how to navigate specific family investments. That included Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Va., whose family owns 20% of a community swimming pool he and his family have long used.“How do we make sure that we're not eliminating me or making me sell something that I feel strongly about? This has been part of my childhood, part of all my kids’ childhoods,” Griffith said, adding that his son coached the local swim team to the championships last year.“How do we protect that while curing the ills of people who are trying to do bad things?”‘As crooked as a dog’s leg’During a press conference ahead of the hearing, Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., said “this place is as crooked as a dog’s leg, and it needs to stop.”Burchett joined Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., and Seth Magaziner, D-R.I., in urging Johnson to bring to the floor the Restore Trust in Congress Act, a bill joining together several members’ proposals from this year.The bill would prohibit Congress members, their spouses, and any dependent children and trustees from owning, buying or selling securities, commodities, futures and certain other assets. If enacted, a lawmaker and their family members would have 180 days to divest. Those newly elected would have a 90-day timeline to do so. The ban would not apply to diversified funds.“Everybody standing here along with a number of others have been working on this issue for some time,” Magaziner told reporters. “We all worked together over the course of the summer to come up with a single, unified bill. So we have one bill, one strategy, and now it is on leadership to get this done and give us a vote,” he continued.Other leaders on the issue who’ve signed onto the joint effort include Reps.  Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., Chip Roy, R-Texas, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Joe Neguse, D-Colo. Nearly 80 others signed as cosponsors in addition to the 16 original names.Fitzpatrick said lawmakers “have to get this done, we will get this done this Congress.”“Mark my words, this bill, or a bill, will come to the floor, hopefully through an open amendment process where we can make this better,” Fitzpatrick told reporters.“If we are all willing to accept the premise, and I hope everyone is, that members of Congress unequivocally have access to inside information — we do — if you accept that premise then we have to do something on the stock trading front,” he continued.Johnson timeline for actionWhen asked by States Newsroom if Johnson has a timeline for bringing any of the proposals to the floor, a spokesperson responded in an email, “We’ll defer to House Admin (committee) for the time being whether they plan to markup a bill etc.”Johnson told Punchbowl News in September that a stock trading ban bill is “a tough issue.”In May, Johnson said he worried whether a ban would affect who could serve in Congress because salaries haven’t risen in several years.“But on balance, my view is we probably should do that because I think it’s been abused in the past and I think, sadly, a few bad actors discolor it for everyone,” he said.",,,,2025-11-19 16:57:42.130671
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-19 21:20:43+00:00,CT Mirror,CT United Way seeks donations for homelessness prevention fund,Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/19/ct-cash-assistance-united-way-homelessness/,The United Way of Central and Northeastern CT is seeking donations for a cash assistance fund to prevent people from becoming homeless.,"Residents of most towns in northeastern and central Connecticut will be eligible again for direct cash assistance, a push to keep people housed during colder months that officials said Wednesday has become more urgent over the past several months.
For the first time, the United Way of Central and Northeastern Connecticut is asking for individual donations for its Rapid Response Fund for Homelessness and Housing. The organization is putting $100,000 into the program to get it started.
This is the third year that the United Way has offered cash assistance. Residents in its 56-town service area can contact their town human services department to access the program. Most aid is around $300, although each request is considered individually, officials said.
“This is a preventative measure. We do not want people to fall into the shelter system. We want them to be warm and housed this coming season,” said Eric Harrison, president and chief executive officer of the United Way of Central and Northeastern Connecticut.
State officials, including Gov. Ned Lamont, gathered at the State Capitol on Wednesday to urge Connecticut residents to donate to the fund. The announcement came as homelessness service providers worry over potential federal cuts to their funding. Lamont said while he thinks the state has made progress, the number of people experiencing homelessness is rising.
“It’s now getting dodgy. You’ve seen some numbers have picked up in terms of homeless,” he said, adding that the state is trying to increase rental vouchers and shelter beds. “It’s not easy. The federal government is yanking back [money] all the time.”
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development plans to change the way it allocates funding by focusing more on treatment programs and less on a program called rapid rehousing that aims to get people into housing as quickly as possible. It also limits funds for organizations that aid people who are transgender or nonbinary and rewards groups for asking about people’s immigration status.
It also encourages homeless service providers to involuntarily commit people experiencing homelessness to psychiatric facilities if they consider they may be ‘a danger to themselves or others.’
“This action comes at a time when Connecticut is already experiencing a severe rental shortage, historic increases in homelessness, and a statewide public health crisis declaration related to homelessness,” says a Nov. 14 letter that organizations representing homeless service providers sent to state lawmakers.
The changes represent “the most significant federal withdrawal from homelessness housing in decades. It dismantles the core of Connecticut’s system and places thousands of our most vulnerable residents at immediate risk,” the letter says.
Lamont said the administration is looking at the issue. Connecticut Department of Housing Commissioner Seila Mosquera-Bruno said the department may have additional funding to supplement the money that service providers need.
Lawmakers last week approved a $500 million flexible fund to allow Lamont to make up for federal cuts.
“We will take a look at that, but you’ve got to remember that every week, we get another brutal threatened cut from the federal government,” Lamont said. He pointed to recent problems with SNAP funding as an example.
“Now there’s some threats in terms of housing cuts,” Lamont said. “We do have a $500 million reserve there to take care of the most vulnerable in need, to make sure that nobody is sitting outside, can’t get a place to stay in January if it’s due to the fact that the feds have cut back on things.”
Mosquera-Bruno pointed to numerous programs DOH has in place to help people experiencing homelessness including cold weather funding to add 985 shelter beds.
While the state won’t add money to the United Way fund, officials encouraged individuals to donate.
“The activation of this fund is truly a lifeline for families,” said Lt. Governor Susan Bysiewicz.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_9019-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-19 16:57:42.130671

Mora County residents are grappling with newly detected metal contamination in private wells, which the state Health Department alerted the public to on Nov. 14, 2025. (Patrick Lohmann/SourceNM)  As fear ripples across the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire burn scar about newly discovered  toxic metals in Mora County groundwater, elected officials and residents are increasingly wondering whether a federal office overseeing a multi-billion-dollar wildfire compensation fund will step in to help. 
On Friday, the New Mexico Department of Health issued an alert to Mora County residents telling them to test their private wells following the discovery that high levels of dangerous metals like antinomy, arsenic and uranium in the groundwater exceeded federal safe drinking water limits. In the meantime, health officials recommended those with private wells drink bottled water. 
NMDOH also noted the metals are found in suppressant materials used to fight wildfires like Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire that burned through a 534-square-mile area in 2022, including much of Mora County.
But even though state officials and New Mexico Democratic U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández  — as well as the independent geologist who discovered the elevated levels — are pointing to the wildfire as the likely culprit for the contamination, whether federal officials will release some of a huge compensation fund to help test private wells or provide water filters is an open question, they told Source New Mexico this week. 
NM officials issue warning over high metals in Mora County groundwater

Leger Fernández, in an interview with Source New Mexico on Tuesday, called on the Federal Emergency Management Agency to quickly review evidence presented about the role of fire suppressants in causing the contamination. The agency is overseeing a claims office with a $5.45 billion fund Congress created to compensate victims of the fire, which the Forest Service accidentally ignited in botched prescribed burns in early 2022.
“If [the metals] are a consequence of the fire, it is my belief that they should be covered by the Hermits Peak money that I secured for these claims,” she said. “And we need to make sure that FEMA reads the report to understand that this is not naturally occurring contamination and that they are heavy metals that come from the fire suppression efforts.”
Dianne Segura, a FEMA spokesperson, told Source New Mexico on Wednesday the agency was working on a response to Source’s questions about the contamination. Source will update this story with the agency’s response when it’s received.
FEMA to appeal ‘noneconomic’ damages ruling for Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire victims

According to attendees, FEMA officials didn’t attend a packed, emergency meeting Wednesday morning at the Veterans of Foreign Wars hall in Mora, where state and local officials described the contamination and their options for next steps. Segura told Source on Tuesday that the agency had not received a “formal invitation” to the meeting and didn’t know whether agency officials would attend.
At the meeting Wednesday, state Environment Department officials collected names of people seeking private well tests. They also described results from recent tests showing the metals were not at elevated levels in the public drinking water system.
Recent delays on ‘cascading events’
The latest environmental crisis in Mora County resurfaced frustration with FEMA’s Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Claims Office, which has so far paid out about $3.24 billion of the fund, according to an update the office posted Tuesday on Facebook. 
Much of the recent frustration centers on how the office handles claims from fire victims who suffered damage from post-fire flooding and debris flows, which the agency refers to as “cascading events” caused by the wildfire.
Even though federal officials committed to covering claims for post-fire flooding, victims have told Source in recent weeks that the office has either not approved their requests to reopen their claims for compensation or has not responded.
In early November, Leger Fernández and other members of the New Mexico congressional delegation criticized the agency in a letter for failing to keep its promise to honor “cascading event” claims. 
State and local officials told Source this week that they believe the newly discovered contamination constitutes another “cascading event” that the funds should cover. They are calling on the claims office to pay for private well tests and water filters.
Leger Fernández told Source on Tuesday that the agency had not responded to the delegation’s recent letter, and that she’s concerned FEMA will continue to ignore requests for reopened claims for the metal contamination. 
“We need to use this process to address this as a ‘cascading event’ if it is a consequence of the fire,” she said. “And it looks like it is.”
Mora County Commissioner Veronica Serna told Source she tried to confront FEMA officials on Monday in-person at the claims office headquarters in Santa Fe, but was unable to find the office’s director, and left even more frustrated, she said. 
She says she’s also sent about a dozen letters to FEMA in recent weeks from different fire victims who have not received compensation for “cascading events.” That doesn’t bode well for the agency’s response to the contamination, she said. 
“I’m not sure what’s going on with this claims office, and I really feel bad for people,” she said.

‘I’d rather have a burned mountain’
Geologist Kate Zeigler, who runs an independent geologic consulting firm, has been testing private wells in Mora County each summer since 2023, and found no concerning levels of contaminants in 2023 and 2024, she said. But the results of her latest round of testing from this summer were “so concerning,” she told Source in an email, that she quickly summed up findings into a report that she sent to state agencies, which then issued the alert Friday. 
Zeigler’s four-page report dated Oct. 4 said tests of 55 private wells in the summer of 2025 detected a sudden increase in a range of metals beyond levels the Environmental Protection Agency deems safe for human consumption. 
The report also cited a 2024 study of California watersheds that linked increased heavy metal levels to fire suppression materials used in fires across the West between 2009 and 2021. The study concludes that fire suppressants contributed approximately 380,000 kilograms of toxic metals to the environment in that period.

Zeigler elaborated on her findings during the Wednesday meeting, showing maps of 55 well sites where tests detected elevated levels of antimony, arsenic, manganese, cadmium and uranium, a subset of which were beyond EPA limits.
The news of the contamination has been deeply distressing to Paula Garcia, a lifelong Mora-area resident who also directs the New Mexico Acequia Association, she said at the meeting Wednesday. She called on the Forest Service to share with the public details of how much fire suppression it dumped on mountainsides to fight the blaze, and she fears the ensuing contamination will imperil drinking water for years to come.

(Photo by Kevin Mohatt for Colorado Newsline)A panel that recommends adjustments to how much Colorado covers Medicaid costs presented a plan to lawmakers on Tuesday that is vastly different, and more expensive, than the one the governor’s office wants to see implemented, leaving lawmakers to question the role of that panel overall.
Members of the Medicaid Provider Rate Review Advisory Committee made the presentation at the Capitol in Denver to the state Legislature’s Joint Budget Committee, which is in charge of crafting the state’s budget. The governor’s plan came through the Department of Health Care Policy and Financing.
The discussion comes at a time when Medicaid, the joint federal and state health care insurance program for certain low-income residents, faces cuts from new federal policy, and the state is heading into another fiscal year with a revenue shortfall.
“I think (the advisory committee) was set up so we can have an understanding of where these rates should be set if we could, in a perfect world, meet our budgetary needs at this moment and ensure we are adequately paying providers,” Joint Budget Committee Chair Rep. Emily Sirota, a Denver Democrat, said. “But how are we to understand and interpret what MPRRAC is presenting us and then what the department is presenting us?”

Tuesday’s presentation was a first step in a long process of writing their spending plan.
The state considers Medicaid provider rates — the amount it reimburses medical providers — on a three-year cycle, and this year’s review includes physician services, dialysis, physical and occupational therapies and prosthetics, among other services. The advisory committee was formed a decade ago to help the Department of Health Care Policy and Financing, or HCPF, review provider rates, which are generally tied to a percentage of what the federal government pays for Medicare services, the health insurance program for older adults. The committee takes into account stakeholder feedback and care access when forming its recommendations for provider rates.
But the state does not have to go with the advisory committee’s suggestion, and typically does not.
“This is the third time I’ve been through this, and the recommendation is not what we end up using, and I’m puzzled why we continue this process,” Rep. Rick Taggart, a Grand Junction Republican, said.
In his budget proposal, Gov. Jared Polis suggested an across-the-board rate for Medicaid services at 85% of the Medicare benchmark. The national average is about 75% of that benchmark. Medicaid, which is administered by HCPF, is one of the fastest growing parts of the already-strained state budget. Polis wants to slow that growth, starting with next year’s budget.
“The biggest challenge with an across-the-board cut is that it doesn’t allow us to be thoughtful about what areas are going to be most impactful for the individuals in our state. It also makes it very hard for providers of care to make predictable decisions,” Megan Adamson, chair of the advisory committee, told JBC members.
“We heard a fair amount of feedback around the impacts on sustaining a practice and offering sustainable wages,” she said.
The advisory committee recommended different rates for each service it considered, and pulled all rates up to at least 80%. For some highly-used services, such as dental work for people with intellectual disabilities, it recommended a 150% rate.
Those rates would reflect the difficulty in providing those types of services, Adamson said.
The advisory committee’s plan would cost about $26 million, including $9 million from the state’s general fund. HCPF’s plan would save the state $8 million and $2.3 million from the general fund.
“In a budget cut year where it is difficult and we do have to offer reductions to rates, it becomes a question of where do you pick and choose those reductions? And this year, as we’ve done historically, the department generally opted for an across the board approach,” said Josh Block, the HCPF deputy chief financial officer.
“We’re constantly trying to find a balance, understanding what the fiscal realities of the state are and knowing the challenges we face today and will face in the future — the overall sustainability of Medicaid, and what can we do to make sure that providers keep their doors open?” he said.
About 100 people rallied on the steps of the state Capitol in Denver on Tuesday after the provider rate discussion, calling on the state to reject funding cuts for behavioral therapy and treatment for children with autism. Advocates argue that the governor’s proposed provider rate could jeopardize access to services like applied behavior analysis, which helps with communication and social skills.
“We’re asking the administration to find another solution that doesn’t balance the budget on the backs of kids with autism,” said Will Martin, a provider with Soar Autism Center.

(Screenshot from Arkansas Legislature live feed)The Arkansas Board of Corrections voted to pay the attorney it hired to sue over legislation watering down its authority just over $300,000 during its Tuesday meeting.
The corrections board will pay the Hall Booth Smith law firm $307,193.55 from the Department of Corrections’ general revenue funds for Abtin Mehdizadegan’s legal representation in lawsuits related to Acts 185 and 659 of 2023, which shifted authority to hire and fire the department’s secretary and the directors of two of its divisions from the board to Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
The board sued Sanders and the secretary of the department — which was Joe Profiri at the time and is now Lindsay Wallace — almost two years ago, arguing that the laws improperly shifted power reserved to the corrections board under the Arkansas Constitution to the governor.
Pulaski County Circuit Judge Patricia James sided with BOC Chair Benny Magness and the board earlier this month, declaring both laws unconstitutional in a summary judgment.
“Amendment 33 is unambiguous,” James wrote in her ruling, vesting control over the state corrections system — including the leaders of it — with the Board of Corrections. She ruled further that the board was entitled to its attorney and issued an injunction preventing Attorney General Tim Griffin or other state officials from interfering with the board’s ability to pay Mehdizadegan. Griffin had filed his own lawsuit and asked the court to stop the board from paying Mehdizadegan.
Judge says Arkansas corrections secretary serves at pleasure of Board of Corrections, not governor

The corrections board’s complaint against the governor and the corrections secretary came after months of increasing tensions in 2023 between board members and Sanders and Profiri as they sparred over Profiri’s push to add more prison beds despite the department’s ongoing staffing issues.
The situation erupted into a bitter legal fight when the board abruptly suspended Profiri in December 2023, then filed a legal challenge against the two laws when the now-former corrections secretary said he would continue to show up to work anyway because he reported to Sanders. The board fired Profiri in January 2024.
Sanders quickly hired Profiri as an adviser — where he continues to make his previous salary and is paid more than Wallace and Sanders’ own chief of staff.
Griffin sued the board over its hiring of Mehdizadegan the day after it sued Sanders, alleging the body had flouted Arkansas’ open meetings law and that it didn’t have the authority to hire outside counsel. That case is still awaiting a judgment in circuit court.
In the case filed by the board, James rejected a motion to disqualify Mehdizadegan from representing the board, and the state Supreme Court ruled James’ decision was not reviewable when Griffin appealed. Griffin asked the justices to rehear the appeal, but they declined to do so in September, setting up James’ ruling this month..
Griffin has appealed James’ summary judgment ruling.
Board member Lee Watson said the state could try to claw back the money paid if it succeeds in its appeal, but that it would have to be done via a court order.
“As we learned yesterday, even the governor complies with court orders when they’re repeated,” Watson said, apparently in reference to Sanders’ reluctant compliance with two court orders in cases regarding her scheduling of special elections.
Mehdizadegan will continue representing the board in Griffin’s appeal and in the lawsuit the attorney general filed against it, which is still before a circuit court.
“We are proud of the work we performed on behalf of the Board of Corrections and are gratified by the Court’s ruling,” Mehdizadegan wrote in a statement. “We appreciate the Board’s unanimous decision to authorize payment for the services we provided. Our hope is that future counsel will approach constitutional conflicts of this nature with the same respect for the rule of law that guided our representation.”

Two alleged whistleblowers are suing Farm Bureau Property & Casualty Insurance Co. and its affiliates for alleged racketeering, wrongful termination and concealment of information from state regulators.
The lawsuit alleges Farm Bureau officials repeatedly concealed from regulators in Iowa and other states instances of fraudulent activity committed by company agents or employees. The defendants’ conduct in the matter amounts to racketeering, obstruction of justice, and mail fraud or wire fraud, the lawsuit claims.
The lawsuit was filed by James Newton and Brent Meskimen, former police officers who later became special investigators for Farm Bureau. They are suing Farm Bureau Property & Casualty Insurance Co., FBL Financial Group, Farm Bureau Financial Services, and the West Des Moines law firm of Wickham & Geadelmann in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. Also named as defendants in the case are several Farm Bureau executives and attorneys.
The lawsuit claims Farm Bureau officials “engaged in a scheme to defraud insurance policyholders, insurance and other governmental regulatory authorities, and other participants in the insurance industry who are complying with their mandatory duty of reporting fraud and other fraudulent or other illegal acts.”
It also claims the defendants violated Iowa’s law on the wrongful discharge of employees in violation of public policy. That law prohibits the termination of employees for refusing to participate in illegal conduct or for acting as whistleblowers by reporting or objecting to illegal conduct.
The defendants in the case have yet to file a response to the lawsuit. Calls to Farm Bureau, Farm Bureau Financial Services and the law firm of Wickham & Geadelmann were not immediately returned Wednesday.
Break-in at policyholder’s residence
The lawsuit claims that as far back as 2011, Farm Bureau officials failed to report to state regulators evidence of fraudulent activity within the company, but the “straw that broke the camel’s back” was an insurance adjuster’s alleged break-in on a policyholder’s property.
According to the lawsuit, a residential fire occurred at the policyholder’s Nebraska residence on May 5, 2023, and the policyholder immediately filed a claim for losses.
In the course of investigating the claim, Farm Bureau’s Special Investigation Unit learned that an adjuster working for the company had used a credit card to pick the lock of the policyholder’s garage near the scene of the fire to determine whether it contained items the insured claimed as being lost in the fire, the lawsuit alleges.
Newton and Meskimen allegedly met with Farm Bureau’s general counsel, Wickham, and advised him Farm Bureau had an obligation to inform the policyholder of the illegal access to their garage.
According to the lawsuit, the company’s assistant general counsel, Karl Olson, “eventually agreed” to allow Meskimen and Newton to meet with the policyholder and inform them of the illegal garage entry by the adjuster, but barred Meskimen and Newton from disclosing that two third-party vendors hired to investigate the claim had also been inside the garage.
The lawsuit claims Olson and Property Casualty Claims Vice President Anthony Kimmi then agreed that all “poisonous” documentation pertaining to the illegal entry, including photographs, should be placed in a separate file using a canceled insurance policy associated with a Minnesota policyholder who had no association at all with Nebraska fire.
After the new file was created for information about the garage, efforts were made to “lock down” the file to ensure limited access to its contents, and Kimmi directed the staff to suppress all printout capabilities from the file, the lawsuit alleges.
On June 9, 2023, Newton and Meskimen allegedly met with Wickham, the general counsel, at the Farm Bureau home office in West Des Moines and reported that they “could no longer in good conscience be associated with this file,” the lawsuit claims, telling Wickham “it was wrong ethically and that it violated state statutes, claims best practices, Farm Bureau core values, doing what’s right, and that it could very well be criminal and could potentially violate privacy rights.”
According to the lawsuit, Wickham responded by saying he’d speak to Farm Bureau leadership “to make sure this never happens again,” to which Meskimen allegedly said the directive to create the file “came straight from General Counsel Wickham’s own assistant general counsel, Olson.”
After Newton, Meskimen and the Special Investigations Unit concluded fraud had been committed by the company, the findings were allegedly relayed to Paul Swinton, a vice president and assistant general counsel of property and casualty at FBL Financial Group, according to the lawsuit.
The lawsuit claims Swinton refused to forward “the significant majority of the findings” to regulators in Iowa and Nebraska for their review and investigation, despite mandatory-reporting requirements.
Lawsuit: State regulators kept in the dark
According to the lawsuit, the 2023 incident was not the first time Swinton and Newton clashed over information that wasn’t being shared with state regulators.
“Newton and Meskimen were often and continually directed not to make mandatory referrals to the appropriate Departments of Insurance for review and investigation by the appropriate insurance regulators in states where FBL Financial Group was operating and conducting business, including Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico,” the lawsuit alleges.
Among the alleged examples cited in the lawsuit:
— Forged signatures: In the spring of 2023, a Farm Bureau agent in Kansas admitted he had forged the signatures of approximately 50 of his policyholders, without their permission, over a period of three to four years, and that the forms contained false and misleading information to support of the clients’ insurance policy applications. Farm Bureau “refused to allow Newton and/or Meskimen to submit this admitted fraudulent conduct to the Kansas Department of Insurance,” the lawsuit alleges, despite a state law requiring such reporting.
— Two fired agents: In 2022, Swinton refused to share information with regulators about two fired Farm Bureau agents. In one of the two cases, a Kansas agent admitted to having forged at least 900 various documents with clients’ signatures, allegedly with the clients’ consent, and another 100 documents without the clients’ consent. Swinton allegedly refused to share information with regulators about the two firings. The lawsuit claims that after Newton wrote in an annual report that he had concerns with such matters going unreported, Wickham “was furious” and instructed him to never put anything in writing like that again.
— Fraudulent claim: In 2023, after a Farm Bureau agent was fired for filing a fraudulent claim on his own home in Utah, Swinton or others within the company refused to allow Newton and Meskimen to submit information on the agent’s conduct to the Utah Department of Insurance, despite a state law requiring such a referral.
— Father’s altered policy: In 2018, the company’s Special Investigations Unit determined an Iowa agent had altered a customer’s policy after a fire so that the policy included a Ford Mustang that was consumed in the blaze. The customer was the agent’s father and a retired Farm Bureau agent. The lawsuit claims Swinton barred the unit from referring the incident to the Iowa Department of Insurance.
Newton and Meskimen are fired
The lawsuit alleges that while the unreported instances of fraudulent activity date back to 2011, it was the May 2023 garage break-in that “the tipping point for Newton and Meskimen.”
The lawsuit alleges that on Aug. 30, 2023, Newton had an in-person meeting with Wickham and insisted the information related to that case needed to be referred to the Nebraska Department of Insurance. “Wickham responded by telling Newton that if he made that referral his career would be over,” the lawsuit claims.
On Nov. 9, 2023, Newton and Meskimen allegedly met with Karen Rieck, the vice president of human resources for Farm Bureau Financial Services, and voiced their concerns about the lack of referrals to state regulators.
A week later, Newton received a phone call from Wickham and Rieck, in which Wickham said Newton had “essentially resigned” by refusing to report directly to Swinton. The lawsuit alleges Newton indicated he had no problem reporting to Swinton but that if Swinton was not going to make the mandatory referrals related to fraud, he would do so himself.
“As a result, Newton was fired,” the lawsuit claims. Meskimen was allegedly fired five days later after telling his superiors that he, too, would make such referrals if they were required by law.
The lawsuit claims that shortly before the two men were fired they each were given positive performance reviews, with Newton described by his superiors as “one of the most well-respected employees in the organization” and Meskimen described as a trusted leader whose “integrity is beyond reproach.”
In addition to Swinton, Olson, Kimmi and Wickham, the named defendants in the lawsuit include Daniel Pitcher, chief executive officer of FBL Financial Group and Farm Bureau Financial Services, and Ronald Mead Jr., the chief operating officer for property casualty of FBL Financial Group and Farm Bureau Financial Services.

In their letter to the Michigan Strategic Fund Board, the Michigan Environmental Council, Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club, and Citizens Utility Board of Michigan said the fund’s guidelines for the state’s new sales and use tax exemptions for data centers improperly characterize the law’s clean energy requirements, thus incorrectly authorizing enterprise data centers to claim exemptions they are not eligible for. 
In order to qualify for these exemptions, data centers must procure at least 90% of their annual forecasted energy from clean energy sources within six years. According to the law, they can either generate clean energy on site; contract with an electrical utility, energy cooperative, or municipal utility in the area where the data center is located, or participate in an energy provider’s voluntary green energy pricing program. 
However, the coalition of environmental groups said the strategic fund’s guidelines incorrectly state that a data center can meet those requirements simply by contracting with a utility provider that is subject to Michigan’s clean energy regulatory framework, as energy providers are not required to meet any clean energy standard until 2035. 
While the law that created the exemption also requires the Michigan Strategic Fund to deny or revoke an applicant’s tax-exempt status if they do not comply with the clean energy requirements, the letter’s authors argue that under these guidelines, companies would be allowed to claim exemptions even if they fail to meet the 90% standard.
“By allowing enterprise data centers to claim tax exemptions in violation of the Tax Acts, [the Michigan Strategic Fund] is undermining the Legislature’s clear intent to mitigate the environmental harms of data centers,” the letter states. 
In a statement, Charlotte Jameson, the chief policy officer for the Michigan Environmental Council warned that data centers across the country are prolonging the life of fossil fuel power plants, and sparking the construction of more. 
“Michigan’s legislature clearly recognized the threat of energy intensive data centers to our climate and acted to ensure the onus was on data centers to power their operations with 90% clean energy,” Jameson said. “Being good corporate citizens in Michigan requires data centers to do their fair share to transition the state to clean, affordable energy. We urge the Strategic Fund Board to correct their guidance, which currently renders the law’s 90% clean energy requirement meaningless and undermines Michigan’s clean energy future.”
Danielle Emerson, the public relations manager for the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, which administers the Michigan Strategic Fund’s programs, confirmed that the board had received the letter. 
“It will be included in the packet for their next public meeting in December, just as all written communications to the Board are,” Emerson said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2158463644-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-11-19 16:57:42.130671

Malone, a medical doctor, rose to prominence in 2021 for amplifying false information about the COVID-19 vaccines. His fabricated claims include linking the death of a high school athlete to the vaccine in 2021, although the teen had died in 2013. Malone also blamed the vaccine for “causing a form of AIDS,” the Associated Press reported. 
Malone has also echoed the conspiracy theory that the COVID-19 pandemic was a plot by the Central Intelligence Agency. 
Major health organizations, the vast majority of health professionals and government officials consider the COVID-19 vaccines to be both safe and effective. 
Malone’s social media posts also promote a variety of other falsehoods, including that there is a connection between pedophilia and the “trans movement.” He has also shared an AI-generated video of Anthony Fauci, the face of the federal government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, transforming into a humanoid reptile, a reference to conspiracy theory that shapeshifting reptilian aliens have infiltrated high-level government positions to influence human society. 
“Gradually, gradually recovering from five years of being defamed, gaslit and blacklisted for speaking truth to power,” Malone wrote of his Pennington appointment in a social media post on X, the platform previously known as Twitter. 
Pennington spokesman Ernie Ballard said Malone’s appointment is gratis, meaning he will not be paid. Pennington is an academic, health-focused research center known for its work in nutrition, though it also studies other health topics, including epidemiology. 
“Over time, Pennington Biomedical has had adjunct appointments with hundreds of faculty from across the globe,” Ballard said. “These gratis (unpaid) appointments help facilitate research collaborations. Dr. Robert Malone’s adjunct appointment will focus on providing insights into the current federal landscape in Washington, D.C.”
Malone is closely affiliated with U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., another prominent vaccine skeptic and source of health misinformation. In June, Kennedy appointed him to the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, an independent panel key to vaccine policy and access in America. 
In 2021, Gov. Jeff Landry invited Kennedy and Malone to appear at a state legislative hearing on requiring the COVID-19 vaccine for K-12 school attendance, which Landry, then the attorney general, opposed.
Malone was banned from Twitter for spreading false information about the pandemic, though he was restored to the platform in 2022 when it was acquired by Elon Musk, who has also spread health misinformation.

It is “critical” for lawmakers to rein in spending and increase revenues long term, he said.","In summary
California’s independent legislative analyst is warning that the state faces a nearly $18 billion deficit. It is “critical” for lawmakers to rein in spending and increase revenues long term, he said. 


California will face a nearly $18 billion budget deficit in the new fiscal year due to higher than expected spending, despite an economic boon largely driven by AI enthusiasm and strong revenue, the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office said Wednesday.
To make things worse, the $17.7 billion shortfall could balloon to an annual $35 billion by fiscal year 2027-28, as spending continues to grow and debts come due, the office warned in its annual fiscal outlook.
The gloomy forecast is a refreshed look at California’s financial future since June, when the state Department of Finance projected a $17.4 billion deficit for the upcoming fiscal year. The widened budget gap could undercut the legacy of Gov. Gavin Newsom, as he will likely be forced  to make tough budget choices in his last year as governor. 
It also means that for the fourth year in a row in his tenure, California is projected to have a deficit despite revenue growth. 
“Today’s fiscal outlook underscores the challenging decisions ahead,” said Assembly Budget chair Jesse Gabriel of Encino. He said the committee “remains committed to crafting a responsible budget that prioritizes essential services, uplifts working families and protects our most vulnerable communities.” 
But state Sen. Roger Niello of Roseville, the Republican vice chair of the Senate Budget Committee, attributed the structural deficit to Democrats’ “unstoppable spending problems.”
“The state must assess the effectiveness and sustainability of the programs that were created during the surplus and make necessary corrections,” he said in a statement. 
Since June, the state has witnessed stronger-than-expected tax revenues, raking in $6 billion more than projected between July and October. But the revenue gains in the new fiscal year will “almost entirely” go toward K-12 schools, community colleges and state reserves by constitutional requirements, the office projected. 
Additionally, the fiscal challenges California faces have also persisted, if not deepened, due to steep federal cuts to health care and housing and homelessness services, as well as growing stock market uncertainties driven in part by Trump’s drastic tariff shifts. It raises a major question as to if, and how, the state can absorb the costs of those policies.
Spending outpacing revenues
The state is projected to spend $6 billion more than previously anticipated next year, including $1.3 billion implementing Trump’s budget, which is expected to kick millions of Californians off Medi-Cal, hike health care premiums and shift much of the cost for programs such as food stamps onto the state, the LAO said. The increase is largely because the state must now shoulder a larger share of the cost to continue to provide benefits, said Carolyn Chu, chief deputy analyst with LAO.  
The added cost of the federal cuts to health care will grow to $5 billion annually by fiscal year 2029-30, the office projected. 
California also stands to lose hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for permanent housing under new policies the Trump administration rolled out last week, just as some counties are starting to see drops in their homeless population. Homelessness agencies warn that thousands of Californians could be kicked out of their subsidized housing and back on the streets.
The loss of federal funding could put more pressure on the state to step in with financial assistance — at a time when Newsom has expressed no interest in releasing more homelessness dollars to cities and counties. 
Blaming local officials for stagnant progress on homelessness, Newsom in January proposed zero dollars for the Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention program, the main source of homelessness funding for local governments. The Legislature later successfully negotiated a $500 million investment — half what it used to be — and delayed the funds until next year with virtually no guarantee they will continue.
Graham Knaus, CEO of the California State Association of Counties, told CalMatters he expects the state to follow through on its funding commitment.
“We are now facing a federal government that is eviscerating the same funding at the federal level, so we should expect a substantial increase in homelessness,” he said. “And our only chance is for the state to stand with us … and protect those that are the most vulnerable.”
Fourth fiscal year in a row of deficits
The annual forecast by the nonpartisan fiscal adviser is a mere snapshot of California’s fiscal future and can be drastically different from the state finance department’s own projection, which is expected in January. In January 2024, Newsom’s office projected a $38 billion deficit for fiscal year 2024-25 — roughly half the $68 billion budget shortfall the LAO had projected a month before.  
Earlier this year, California’s Democratic leaders scrambled to plug a $12 billion budget hole in fiscal year 2025-26, relying on internal borrowing, dipping into state reserves and halting new Medi-Cal enrollment for undocumented immigrants to avoid other deep cuts to social services. They largely blamed Trump for the shortfall, arguing the threat of sweeping tariffs and federal funding loss plunged the state into “deep uncertainty.”

But even before Trump retook office, California already faced a structural money problem, in part due to the state’s heavy reliance on wealthy earners’ income tax and capital gains, which rise and fall with the stock market.
The last time California faced a $35 billion money problem was in 2011, when then-Gov. Jerry Brown declared a “wall of debt” consisting of loans and deferred payments. But that was as California recovered from the Great Recession, said Legislative Analyst Gabriel Petek.
“This wall of debt (today) is being accumulated in the absence of a recession,” he told reporters during a press conference Wednesday.
The state for three years used “temporary fixes,” such as internal borrowing, spending down reserves and suspending tax credits to plug multibillion-dollar budget holes, but now it’s “critical” for state lawmakers to reduce spending, raise revenues, or both, the legislative analyst warned. 
“California’s budget is undeniably less prepared for downturns,” the analysts noted in their report.
“Continuing to use temporary tools — like budgetary borrowing — would only defer the problem and, ultimately, leave the state ill‑equipped to respond to a recession or downturn in the stock market.”
How sustainable is the AI-driven economy?
While all signs point to high uncertainty and low consumer confidence in the state economy, tech companies’ investment in AI has propelled the stock market to a “record high” and boosted tech workers’ income — the “lone bright spot” in the state’s economic outlook, Petek said.
But how sustainable will it be? Petek is cautious. 
The stock market appears to be “overly exuberant,” as some investors are borrowing more to buy high-cost stocks, a sign of a stock market downturn, the report notes. Even if the market holds, lawmakers should treat it as a temporary or unsustainable gain, Petek said.
And there’s no guarantee that revenue gains from the stock market would be enough to fill a deficit of $30 billion to $35 billion, which the state is projected to hit in a few years. Since the state is constitutionally required to spend roughly half of any excess revenue gains on schools and reserves, it would need $60 billion in revenue higher than anticipated to close a budget gap that big, Petek said.
“Our view is that that’s highly unlikely to occur,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051425_Newsom-May-Budget_FG_CM_08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-19 15:58:01.551757

Leaders of 11 different ballot question campaigns told CommonWealth Beacon they believe they have collected and filed enough signatures to keep their proposals in the mix, clearing the steepest hurdle en route to the 2026 election.
Several steps still need to happen before any of those questions are a lock, but if organizers maintain their current course, voters will be empowered with a suite of monumental policy decisions about slashing the state’s income tax rate by one-fifth, mandating rent control statewide, recriminalizing recreational marijuana, and more. 
There’s a solid chance that 2026 becomes a historic election. The record for most statewide questions on the ballot in a single year is nine, which has happened three times – in 1994, 1976, and 1972 — according to Secretary of State William Galvin’s office. 
In an interview, Galvin said the field is shaping up to “represent a high tide of ballot questions” — a fact he thinks reflects widespread discontent with the slow pace of lawmaking on Beacon Hill. 
“There’s a unanimity of opinion among groups who don’t agree on much else that they’re not going to get anything done in the Legislature, so they’re going to go to the people,” he said. 
One question is already guaranteed to go before voters next year. Opponents of the state’s sweeping new law have already successfully petitioned to put a repeal question before voters, using a different avenue than the initiative petition process all other proposals took. However, because the law was enacted late in the term, the repeal question was ineligible for the 2024 ballot and will instead appear in 2026. 
If all 11 other questions still in the mix make it before voters, the total at next year’s election could reach an even dozen. 
Proponents of each new measure (not the gun law repeal) must gather at least 74,574 signatures from registered voters and file them with local election officials for certification by the end of the day Wednesday. 
Crossing the required threshold does not automatically guarantee a spot on the ballot. Signatures can be invalidated over technical issues, like improper marks on the form, and no more than one-quarter of the total haul can come from a single county. 
Galvin will not officially announce which measures collected enough signatures until next month — once certification is done, campaigns must refile signatures with his office by December 3 — and several additional requirements will follow that. 
But public announcements and on-the-ground intel so far offer an early glimpse at what’s still in play. 
Here are the campaigns whose leaders feel confident about hitting the initial signature requirement and moving forward: 
Rent control revival 
The “Keep Massachusetts Home” campaign, led by advocacy group Homes for All, announced Tuesday that it gathered more than 124,000 signatures. 
Their proposal would reverse the 1994 state ban on rent control — narrowly implemented by a ballot question — and in its place impose a statewide cap on rents at annual inflation or 5 percent, whichever is lower. 
It would be one of the strictest rent control policies in the country and apply to all of Massachusetts, not just cities and towns that have expressed an interest in the idea. That big swing has triggered difficult decisions among progressives. 
Income tax rate cut 
A business-backed coalition called the Massachusetts Opportunity Alliance is confident it’s on track to ask voters whether to slash the state’s income tax from 5 percent to 4 percent over a three-year period. 
Chris Anderson, president of the Massachusetts High Technology Council, said the push gathered more than 87,000 signatures. He argued that cutting the income tax by one-fifth could relieve voters from the state’s notoriously high cost of living. 
“People who leave Massachusetts cite high costs, and taxes are the top of that list,” Anderson said. 
But the proposal could also create massive headaches on Beacon Hill. Reducing the income tax rate by a percentage point could cut tax revenues by roughly $5 billion, experts say, at a time when elected officials are already grappling with budget pressures stemming from the federal government. 
The question of whether to reduce the flat income tax rate could appear before voters just four years after passage of another ballot question that imposed a 4 percent surtax on the state’s highest earners. 
Mandatory tax rebates 
Another question the Mass. Opportunity Alliance is pushing would overhaul the state tax collection cap, a law known as Chapter 62F. 
Anderson is also confident the measure is poised to advance after supporters collected more than 86,000 signatures. 
The proposal would tweak a law enacted by voters in 1986, which requires the state to return money to taxpayers when revenues surpass a certain threshold. Under the question, Beacon Hill would be more likely to bump into that cap, limiting the amount of money the state can expect to collect and forcing more frequent rebates. 
Chapter 62F had become largely forgotten until it burst back into the spotlight in 2022, when the state had to refund nearly $3 billion. 
Recriminalize recreational marijuana 
A decade after nearly 54 percent of voters supported legalizing recreational cannabis use, they might be asked whether to reverse course. 
Organizers are “confident” they have submitted enough signatures to put a question on the 2026 ballot that would ask “if recreational marijuana should be repealed,” according to Wendy Wakeman, a spokesperson for the campaign. 
“The rollout of marijuana sales in Massachusetts has been rife with corruption,” Wakeman said. “The results of legalized marijuana have been higher traffic incidents and problematic experiences of parents, employers, and mental-health professionals. Medical marijuana under our question would remain unchanged, but it’s time to take another look at the unfettered sale of a controversial product.” 
Recreational marijuana has been popular among Bay Staters since it launched, but oversight of the industry has been marked by disruption and upheaval. Lawmakers are moving toward an overhaul of the Cannabis Control Commission. 
Subject the governor’s office and Legislature to the public records law 
Massachusetts and Michigan are the only two states where the Legislature and the governor’s office both consider themselves exempt from their public records laws. 
Amid a sustained period of scrutiny on Beacon Hill, voters might be asked to change that through a ballot question that would require the governor’s office, the House, and the Senate to open up access to their records. (The question would not affect the judiciary, which is also exempt.) 
Auditor Diana DiZoglio, a transparency crusader who took over leading the campaign, said Wednesday that supporters submitted more than 100,000 signatures. 
“The people have had enough of the corrupt actions by top Massachusetts officials who fancy themselves above the law and hide public records regarding basics like financial data and state contracting information,” DiZoglio said.

Rein in legislative stipends 
Transparency and good-government reformers also want to force the Legislature to curtail the use of stipend pay, and they say they submitted more than 90,000 signatures behind their question. 
Under current policy, lawmakers can earn thousands of dollars more per year in “stipends” for holding positions in party leadership or atop legislative committees. Skeptics argue that system encourages representatives and senators to rubber-stamp what legislative leaders require, or risk getting low-paying assignments as retribution for stepping out of line. 
“A legislator should work for the people, not for legislative leadership,” said Scotia Hille, executive director of Act on Mass. “Right now, the incentives are very much shifted in favor of legislative leadership.” 
The proposal would significantly overhaul the stipend system and limit how many stipends a single lawmaker could earn. 
House Speaker Ron Mariano has argued that legislative leaders are best equipped to determine which lawmakers should be awarded more responsibility and the pay that comes with it. 
“Every organization, the longer you’re involved, the more work you do, and the higher responsibility you have, you get increases in pay,” he said in August, according to the State House News Service. “And I think it’s one of the ways to keep people thinking about this job as a potential career.” 
All-party primaries 
Another campaign is pushing a question that would replace the state’s partisan primary elections with an “all-party primary” system, in which all candidates would appear on a single primary ballot and the top two vote-getters would advance to the general election, even if they are from the same party. 
Jesse Littlewood, the campaign manager, said organizers submitted about 98,000 signatures and so far have seen a high rate of validation. He said he’s “confident” the measure will advance. 
Massachusetts has notoriously uncompetitive state elections, and Littlewood said more than half of contests here over the past decade have had just a single candidate. An all-party primary system, he argued, would encourage more people to run. 
“A lack of competition slows down the process of hearing from voters, communicating and working with elected officials, and making sure that voters’ preferences are taken into account,” Littlewood said. “More competition means more responsiveness, that no votes are taken for granted, and that elected officials understand what their constituents really want to accomplish and are there to deliver for them.” 
Election Day voter registration 
Like the other activists who decided to pursue ballot questions, Galvin, the state’s top elections official, got tired of waiting for the Legislature to act on his push for Election Day voter registration. 
So the secretary launched a campaign to circumvent Beacon Hill and go directly to the public with his proposal, which would allow eligible prospective voters to register at their polling place on Election Day. 
Under current law, no one can newly register to vote, change their registration, or change their party affiliation in the 10 days before an election. Galvin said that deadline forces “literally tens of thousands of people in Massachusetts” to submit provisional ballots that are ultimately rejected every cycle.  
“I am convinced the resistance in the Legislature is too great, and there’s still a gap we have in our electoral process,” he told CommonWealth Beacon. “It disproportionately affects poorer people who are tenants and move around [and] people of color.” 
CPCS collective bargaining 
Labor groups pushing a measure on behalf of public defenders say they’ve gathered more than 110,000 signatures. 
The question, backed by SEIU Local 888 and the National Association of Government Employees, would clear the way for workers at the Committee for Public Counsel Services to collectively bargain. 
SEIU Local 888 president Tom McKeever said the proposal could affect hundreds of attorneys and support staff at CPCS, which is aggressively staffing up using new state funding. 
“These folks are doing yeoman’s work, and they want to be able to have the same rights as every other state employee in the Commonwealth,” McKeever said. “One hundred and eighty other state agencies have the right to collectively bargain, and CPCS does not.” 
The question would not affect private bar advocates, whose pay dispute earlier this year created upheaval in the courts. 
Starter home zoning 
One question filed by Pioneer Institute senior housing fellow Andrew Mikula takes aim at the state’s housing crunch with a zoning reform.   
Mikula said the campaign submitted about 103,000 signatures on the measure, which would prohibit municipalities from requiring minimum lot sizes for single-family homes to be greater than 5,000 square feet or to have at least 50 feet of frontage. 
Supporters dubbed their campaign “Legalize Starter Homes,” and Mikula said the effort would clear the way for more development of smaller homes. 
“Massachusetts is in the throes of a harrowing housing shortage that has raised prices and contributed to a lot of outmigration, especially among young people who are trying to form families for the first time,” he said. “By allowing homes to be built on smaller lots, academic research shows that facilitates the construction of smaller, lower-cost homes and also more homes.” 
Land and water conservation fund 
Rounding out the field, proponents say they gathered more than 100,000 signatures on a question that would redirect revenue from the state’s sales tax on sporting goods toward water and land conservation. 
The “Protect Water and Nature” campaign said the measure could steer $100 million per year toward creating outdoor recreational spaces, preserving natural areas, and protecting drinking water. 
“It’s clear that voters want to prioritize and protect our rivers, lakes, forests, farms, and other natural areas, especially as federal funding for land and water conservation is under threat,” said campaign supporter Andrew Sharpe. “With this ballot question, we can deliver clean water, healthy forests, more trails and parks, and access to the outdoors and nature for everyone in Massachusetts — all without raising taxes.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0531-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-19 15:58:01.551757

(Photo: Getty Images/Antonio Hugo)The Wake County Public School System released data Wednesday showing how student enrollment has been affected by the federal immigration crackdown that began in the Triangle Tuesday.
While no immigration enforcement activities were reported at any of its campuses, the system recorded 19,471 absences on Nov. 18. That means nearly 11% of students in the district opted not to attend school on Tuesday, an increase of 7,841 absences above baseline data the school district examined. That represents a 67% jump in absences over an average day.
More than 110 schools in the district reported an absence rate above 10% on Tuesday, according to Lisa Luten, the chief communications officer for Wake County Schools.
Raleigh’s Baileywick Elementary School saw one of the steepest declines in attendance, dropping from nearly 91% on Monday to 68% on Tuesday with 161 children absent.
School administrators, teachers, and support teams are now actively reaching out to families across the district to ensure students stay connected to their classrooms, Luten said.
Anxious NC students ask how to respond
The news forced parent Amanda Paoloni to have a difficult conversation with her 14-year-old daughter this week. The 8th grader had seen stories about the U.S. Border Patrol crisscrossing North Carolina. She asked what she should do if her best friend were approached or taken by unidentifiable armed and masked men.
Paoloni said she knew her daughter’s best friend is of Mexican descent, but never once thought about her immigration status or that of her parents.
“What I do know is, she is kind. Quick with a smile, encourages my daughter to read, and laughs at her jokes,” Paoloni said at the Wake County School Board meeting Tuesday evening.

Paoloni said she did her best to explain in simple terms that a teenager would grasp how to best manage her fear and adrenaline while being the most help in the moment.
But her daughter had so many other questions.
How do we know these people are ICE?
Why aren’t they identifying themselves?
What happens if they aren’t ICE?
How is this legal?
When the teenager said there was no way she would let an unidentified masked man take her best friend without a fight, Paoloni was scared.
“I looked at her and I said, ‘If you enter a physical altercation, you will lose,'” she told the school board.
Paoloni said this was not a conversation about learning, but rather a conversation about survival.

“Children cannot learn when they are in survival mode. Fear destroys the conditions required for student achievement: focus, memory, emotional regulation and a sense of safety,” said Paoloni.
Board member Christina Gordon, who has three children in Wake County’s public schools, acknowledged having a similar conversation with her own boys about the fear created by the threat of ICE enforcement.
“When fear enters our classrooms, it disrupts everything for everyone,” said Gordon, who has taught in both Wake and Durham County public schools. “I want to be clear, our commitment is to students, not to systems that destabilize their wellbeing.”
School board member Lynn Edmonds called the presence of masked federal agents a form of domestic terrorism.
“The presence of ICE, whether it’s here in Wake County or elsewhere, causes real, unnecessary and long-term trauma,” said Edmonds.
No one during Tuesday’s open comment period spoke publicly in support of the stepped up enforcement effort.
Immigration raids and learning loss
Long before the border patrol enforcement, Wake County’s school leaders made improving consistent attendance a top goal. Missing just two days a month can add up to more than two weeks of lost learning each year, according to information on the school district’s website.

A recent study by Stanford University finds immigration raids in communities with large immigrant populations have resulted in increased student absenteeism. The study found that even when the raids lasted just a few days, school absenteeism remained elevated for several weeks.
Irene Godinez, executive director of Poder NC Action, a nonprofit group advocating for immigrant rights, is the mother of a nine-year-old student in the Wake school system. She said the toxic stress caused by these unpredictable, unannounced raids goes well beyond learning loss.
“One in four children in the U.S. live in mixed-status families. Even U.S. citizens and children carry the constant fear that a parent may be taken from them,” she cautioned.
Godinez pointed to the case of a Durham 13-year-old who died by suicide in late February after being bullied about her family’s immigration status.
Godinez also urged school board members to adopt a non-punitive attendance policy during this immigration enforcement surge.
“Realistically, families experiencing terror cannot be burdened with proactively advocating for their child to be excused from class, not when they are protecting themselves from being hunted,” Godinez said.
Superintendent Robert P. Taylor has said the school district honors all laws protecting the privacy of Wake children and will remain focused on the well-being and education of every student, regardless of their background.

Skiers, snowboarders and snowmobilers encourage a backcountry safety mindset — to reduce fatalities — at the annual Wyoming Snow and Avalanche Safety Workshop in Jackson. 
The post What is ski cutting and why is it controversial? appeared first on WyoFile .","Among ski professionals, “ski cutting” can be a taboo subject. Talking about it can feel like navigating a conversation with a teenager about safe sex.
“We all know it’s happening,” said Brenden Cronin, borrowing the analogy from a recent article in The Avalanche Review. “Why aren’t we potentially teaching people to do it safely?”
That’s the question a panel of ski and snowmobile professionals tackled during the Wyoming Snow and Avalanche Workshop in Jackson this past weekend. Some 500 people — both professionals and recreationalists — attended the two-day workshop, featuring experts from across the nation and Canada who spoke about snow and avalanche safety and how human behavior factors into the equation.

Professionals use ski cutting to test snow stability and remove unstable snow before avalanches get bigger or less experienced skiers venture onto the slope. 
A skier traverses the top of a slope, often making an aggressive turn, hoping to release loose snow below, but it requires special considerations and expertise. It’s only appropriate for certain kinds of snowpack and when no one is at risk of being buried lower on the slope. It requires properly identifying and using safe zones since practitioners who ski cut slopes are in danger of becoming entrained in avalanches they provoke. As more and more recreationists are using the technique, professionals are considering whether to discourage the practice or teach its proper use.
Professionals use ski cutting to lessen avalanche hazards at ski resorts, above highways, at industrial sites and for backcountry skiing clients. Panelist Mark Stanley now mitigates avalanche risks for a remote gold mine in northern British Columbia, where more than a hundred avalanche paths cross the access road. But before moving to the industrial sector, Stanley worked as a Canadian ski guide and routinely ski cut slopes, sometimes with big results. 
“For me, ski cutting is a passion,” Stanley said, causing the crowd to burst into laughter. “I’m not joking guys. It’s been an invaluable part of my progression in the world of being an avalanche professional. Without ski cutting, I don’t think I would be here. I’ve saved my own life doing it, and I’ve saved other people’s lives.”
“I do think it is one of the more dangerous ways that we mitigate avalanche hazard because you’re using your body to start an avalanche.”Chrissie Oken, Ski Patroller
Ski cutting came with the job of guiding clients exploring terrain from helicopters, snowcats and backcountry lodges. 
“I did it to protect the people that were paying me to take them skiing. I was there to deliver a product, and I took people skiing down things where there was no other option,” Stanley said. “I had to ski cut a slope to get out of there.” 
Times have changed, he said, and he doesn’t think it’s “necessarily the cowboy show” today that he once experienced. Still, ski cutting remains a valuable tool, but deciding when to use it can be tricky.
“I think there’s so much that goes into deciding, when is too much,” he said. “Personal risk tolerances, company risk tolerances and so much about the actual feature and the snowpack… goes into it.”
Chrissie Oken has worked as a ski patroller at Vail, Colorado, since 2015. She also worked for the Lander-based National Outdoor Leadership School for a decade as a mountaineering, backcountry skiing and avalanche instructor in Alaska, the Tetons, New Zealand and the Himalaya. When working as a ski patroller, she ski cuts in a “conscientious manner,” she said, because “I do think it is one of the more dangerous ways that we mitigate avalanche hazard because you’re using your body to start an avalanche.”
Oken urged caution in teaching the technique to recreationalists. She worried about “risk creep” and people getting a false sense of control.
But panelist Lisa Van Sciver, who has worked as a ski patroller, avalanche forecaster and ski guide in the Tetons, pushed for showing more people how to ski cut properly because they’re choosing to ski risky slopes regardless and having one more tool might help reduce harm.
Whether or not recreational skiers plan to ski cut a slope, they need to know about it, Cronin told WyoFile after the panel discussion. 

Brenden Cronin has worked as a highway avalanche forecaster, ski patroller, avalanche educator, heli and snowcat ski guide, snowmaker and contract avalanche forecaster.
“I think that’s one of the underlying concerns for everybody that was up there on that stage. It is out there. You can see YouTube videos about it,” Cronin said, adding that a local guide service is now marketing it as a technique being taught to clients in the mountains.
Cronin has worked as a highway avalanche forecaster, ski patroller, avalanche educator, heli and snowcat ski guide, snowmaker and contract avalanche forecaster. He recently started his own business selling and servicing Remote Avalanche Control Systems. How does he define ski cutting? 
“You start from a safe zone, usually a pile of rocks or tucked in the trees, and you generate speed as you go out and across the starting zone of the avalanche path and you make a really, really hard aggressive turn,” Cronin said. “You’re really trying to put all of your weight into it with the complete intention of triggering an avalanche.”
While the panel coalesced in favor of at least broaching what can be a taboo topic outside of professional circles, Cronin cautioned that more discussion is needed around setting parameters for when it’s appropriate before recreationalists start doing it.
Some parameters did surface during the panel. For one, never ski cut a “hard slab.”
“That’s a big one,” Cronin said. How do you know it’s a hard slab? There’s a snowpit test that involves pressing a fist, then four fingers, one finger, a pencil and a knife into the wall of the pit to assess the hardness of layers in the snowpack. When skiing, Cronin said, hard slab feels “like trying to edge across styrofoam.”
With a hard slab, the avalanche can break above the skier or snowmobiler, and it tends to break in large, dense blocks that can step down to deeper layers, he said. “It’s not forgiving.”
He also sees some consensus around not ski cutting when more than 30 centimeters of new snow has fallen and not ski cutting above a persistent weak layer. But there are gray zones. Still, he’d like to see the ski community work on defining best practices.
“Just like sex education, right, like it’s evolved over time,” Cronin said. “Maybe we’re going to have some things that we teach that aren’t the best way to present it. But we have to keep trying and eventually, maybe we’ll find a good formula.”
During the panel, one audience member asked about ski cutting while on belay, which means the skier is attached to a rope.
“I have never, never used protection,” Stanley said, getting a chuckle from the crowd, given some of the afternoon’s innuendos. Seriously, though, he said, if “in order to trigger it, the potential of you getting swept down the slope is so high you need a rope then, to me, you should not be there. That’s just not something you should be playing with.”
Professional backcountry snowmobiler Duncan Lee joined experts on a ski cutting panel during the 2025 Wyoming Snow and Avalanche Workshop in Jackson. Lee also gave a presentation contrasting how he applies avalanche education depending on whether he’s out snowboarding or snowmobiling in the backcountry. Ten years ago, avalanche education wasn’t made for motorized users, Lee said, so he had to adapt it for how people ride.  (Duncan Lee)
Triggering unstable snow is not just a consideration for skiers. Now in its eleventh year, WYSAW also put extra emphasis this year on including education tailored for snowmobiles and motorized snow bikes. A professional backcountry athlete for FXR Racing, Duncan Lee talked about his experience as both a snowboarder and a sledder and how he applies avalanche education differently depending on whether his trip is human-powered or motorized. Lee also participated in the ski cutting panel. 
“On a machine, if you get into avalanche terrain, so we’re talking steeper slopes, it’s much harder to actually turn a sled on edge and get over to an island of safety or out of the start zone,” Lee said. “So actually, fundamentally in my eyes, a ski cut is generally not used on a snowmobile.”
Alternatively, Lee said he does test the snowpack’s reactivity by playing on small, inconsequential features with his sled. Panelists encouraged skiers to follow that playful approach to learn more about how snow reacts by hopping on small features like a wind lip, where there’s no risk of being buried, to see what happens.
Panelists also talked about being aware of people possibly traversing below and getting visual confirmation that the coast is clear before ski cutting a slope. Whether motorized or human-powered, backcountry enthusiasts should avoid stopping and congregating beneath avalanche paths, where human triggers or natural conditions could set off a slide, speakers stressed. 
People share avalanche observations on the Briger-Teton Avalanche Center website, and Cronin sees reports showing people either don’t understand ski cutting or were caught in a slide while skiing and use the term “ski cutting” to cover their tracks. 
If nothing else, Cronin wants backcountry enthusiasts to drop the shaming and be more open about their mistakes so the community can learn from those experiences. He praised Jackson filmmaker Chris Kitchen for sharing his story about being in a group of seven people caught in a large avalanche in the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort backcountry in February 2025. Kitchen described for the audience how his group fell into traps identified by experts at WYSAW. 
They had let their guard down after skiing all day and not seeing signs of instability. They put away their radios. They deviated from their original plan of what to ski. As communication broke down, Kitchen ended up clustered with other skiers on a small rock that wasn’t a safe zone. 
Luckily, no one was hurt. A key takeaway for Kitchen was to always follow the protocol of one person on the slope at a time.
“It doesn’t matter if there’s a hundred tracks in Rock Springs or if there’s one,” he said, “but I certainly won’t be on that traverse or any traverse with a bunch of people ever again.”
The annual educational workshop, modeled after other SAW’s held around the Western U.S., aims to make backcountry safety a top community priority to eliminate fatalities as part of Teton County’s Backcountry Zero initiative.
“The wheels were really set in motion in 2015, and then picked up steam after the accident that spring on Mount Moran that took the lives of Luke Lynch and Stephen Adamson Jr.,” said Matt Hansen, communications director for the Teton County Search and Rescue Foundation. At the time, Adamson was on the foundation’s board and an early champion of Backcountry Zero. 
“We’ve seen how tragedy can devastate a community,” Hansen said. “We understand how accidents happen, but it’s up to all of us to make sure we do everything possible to prevent such tragedies from occurring.”

Connecticut was not the third, but the fourth state with the highest residential electricity rates in the U.S. as of August 2025, according to the latest data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
The average price of electricity in the state was 30.29 cents per kilowatt-hour, behind Hawaii, California and Massachusetts. 
Connecticut draws much of its power from natural gas from power plants connected to a network of pipelines that stretches across several states. That gas is also used to heat homes and power stoves, hot water heaters and local industries, increasing demand and prices.
Customers in Connecticut pay more than $200 per month for electricity, or more than twice as much as customers in states such as New Mexico and Utah.

As a result, there has been an uptick in aggressive immigration enforcement.Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said officers should arrest 3,000 people per day on suspicion of being in the country without legal authorization. Bardo confirmed that policy in court Wednesday, but said the figure was a goal. Questioned by Howell, he said the quota was not leading to unlawful arrests and that officers were properly trained. Profiling policyA policy that allows officers to target people based on factors like ethnicity and accent has also swept up U.S. citizens and legal residents. Groups challenged the policy, and the U.S. Supreme Court eventually heard it. Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in a 6-3 decision temporarily allowing profiling based on ethnicity that citizens face few problems in having their immigration status verified if federal agents apprehend them.The four individual plaintiffs in the case in Howell’s court are immigrants who have some form of legal status such as a pending asylum case or temporary protections but were arrested by federal officers. They argue they were targeted because of their ethnicity and fear they will continue to be targeted because they are Latino. They have moved for class certification.One plaintiff, B.S.R., said in his declaration he was arrested twice by officers in the district, despite having a pending asylum claim.Another plaintiff, N.S., said in his declaration that was leaving a Home Depot after buying supplies and was arrested by officers, even after he showed his documentation showing he had Temporary Protected Status for Venezuela. He was transferred to several ICE facilities across the country and detained for 28 days before he was released and able to return to his family in the district.A third, R.S.M., has a pending application for a visa category for victims of a crime who are helpful to law enforcement in cases. In her declaration, R.S.M. said that during her arrest, officers scanned her husband's face, and found he was not the person they were looking for. “For a moment, I was relieved and thought they would not arrest us, but one officer said it did not matter that my husband didn’t match the person they were looking for, and the officer decided to arrest us anyway,” she said, adding that only one officer out of the seven who arrested them was in clothing that identified them as law enforcement.R.S.M. said she was released and given an ankle monitor, but her husband is still detained.‘Like being kidnapped’In a declaration submitted to the court, the lead plaintiff, José Eliseo Escobar Molina, detailed how he was detained by federal immigration officials. Escobar Molina came to the U.S. in 1998 and obtained Temporary Protected Status in 2001. The status is granted when the Department of Homeland Security deems a national’s home country too dangerous to return to due to violence, natural disaster or other unstable environments.He lives in the district neighborhood of Mount Pleasant, which has a large Salvadoran immigrant population, with his significant other and their two sons, both U.S. citizens. Escobar Molina, who works in construction as a scaffolder, said he was getting in his truck to head to work.“Officers dressed in plainclothes got out of the vehicles,” he said in his declaration. “First, two of them grabbed me by the arms and immediately handcuffed me, and then the two officers from the other Suburban came over and grabbed me by the legs.”Escobar Molina said the officers didn’t identify themselves and he tried to inform them of his legal documentation, which he said was in his wallet.“I felt like I was being kidnapped,” he said. “Once in the car, I told them again that I had papers. The driver of the car, who was one of the officers that handcuffed me, told me, ‘Shut up b–-h! You’re illegal.’ After he yelled at me, I stayed silent. I did not try to resist arrest or to flee.”Escobar Molina said he was asked no questions from any law enforcement officer before being transferred to a facility in Chantilly, Virginia. He said that during his 23-hour detention, all he was given was “one small bean burrito, something sweet, and a glass of water.” Officer mistakeEscobar Molina said while at Chantilly, Virginia, one of the officers at Homeland Security said his TPS “doesn’t count as being legal here,” and he was then transferred to Richmond, Virginia. TPS for El Salvador is still valid, and DHS extended the status earlier this year. Escobar Molina said once he was at Richmond, an ICE supervisor realized the mistake and said he was free to leave.  “He said to me, ‘Sorry you had to live through this. These are new officers. They do not know what they are doing,’” Escobar Molina said, recounting his interaction with the ICE supervisor. “He gave me a copy of my TPS approval notice and told me to carry it with me so I could show it if officers stopped me again.” Escobar Molina said when he was arrested in the summer, it was the first time he had been arrested since being in the U.S. for more than 20 years. “I fear the same for my sons because even though they are U.S. citizens, they are Hispanic just like me,” he said. “I told them to carry their U.S. passports with them at all times just to be safe.”",,,,2025-11-19 15:58:01.551757

The deficit stays.","In the four months since the Legislature and Gov. Gavin Newsom enacted a new state budget, revenues – primarily from personal income taxes — have outstripped expectations by several billion dollars.
The uptick has buoyed hopes within the Capitol that California’s chronic budget deficits might disappear if the revenue surge continues. That would spare Newsom and legislators from having to dream up more accounting gimmicks, deferrals and loans to cover the gap between income and outgo.
However, the Legislature’s fiscal advisor, Legislative Analyst Gabe Petek, threw cold water on those rosy scenarios Wednesday. He sees recent revenue gains as a spike driven by an artificial intelligence boomlet in Silicon Valley that’s likely to implode, as have previous tech-related bubbles.
“With so much exuberance surrounding AI, it now appears time to take seriously the notion that the stock market has become overheated,” Petek says in his annual fiscal overview, which predates the governor’s introduction of a new budget. “History suggests that the stock market is prone to overreact to major technological advances, even if the technology itself turns out to be revolutionary.”
Instead of savoring a surge in revenues that would erase what officials are calling a “structural deficit” that is somewhere in the $10-20 billion range, officials should anticipate a larger gap, Petek says.
“Under our revenue and spending estimates, the Legislature faces an almost $18 billion budget problem in 2026‑27,” Petek says. “This is about $5 billion larger than the budget problem anticipated by the administration in June, despite improvements in revenue.”
The analyst notes that California’s constitution requires the state put money toward public schools and reserves, which will  “almost entirely offset revenue gains,” and toward other spending that’s running about $6 billion over the current budget’s estimates.
“Starting in 2027‑28, we estimate structural deficits to grow to about $35 billion annually due to spending growth continuing to outstrip revenue growth,” Petek says.
It should be noted, not for the first time, that California’s chronic deficit is not caused by an economic downturn, which has occurred in the past, but rather by an enormous error by Newsom and his budget advisors three years ago.
In 2022, they projected a permanent increase in revenues, based on a one-time spike, leading Newsom to declare a $97.5 billion budget surplus, boasting “No other state in American history has ever experienced a surplus as large as this.”
Confident that the money would be there, Newsom and lawmakers fattened up the spending side of the budget, only to learn that the supposed surplus was based on what was later acknowledged to be a $165 billion overstatement of revenues over four years.
Ever since, revenues have failed to cover the elevated spending, and Newsom and lawmakers have covered the gaps with the aforementioned gimmicks. They have incurred more than $20 billion in internal loans from special funds that must be repaid. They also have drawn down reserves that were supposed to cover genuine emergencies, not political shortsightedness.
Newsom and his staff are now in the final throes of drafting an initial 2026-27 budget that will be his last as governor and will be unveiled in January. The question is whether he will face the fiscal music and finally write a truly balanced budget or employ more short-term fixes and dump the problem on his successor.
That would mean either making real cuts in spending or raising taxes, both of which would take some courage. The past has not been encouraging.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/091824_Dreamforce_FM_CM_05.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-19 15:58:01.551757

If the high court throws out the […],"Denise Lieberman of the Missouri Voter Protection Coalition, center, speaks Wednesday about the Supreme Court hearings on laws requiring a government-issued voter ID and barring paid voter registration solicitors (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).The Missouri Supreme Court must decide if voters need government-issued ID cards and whether people trying to register new voters can be paid.
The judges on Wednesday heard a pair of cases arising from a 2022 law that also established two weeks of early voting before each election. If the high court throws out the voter ID portion of the law, it would trigger a provision that also scuttles the early voting period.
The Missouri NAACP and the League of Women Voters filed both lawsuits and got a split result at the trial court level in Cole County. Circuit Judge Jon Beetem ruled the photo ID requirements were “everyday burdens” that did not violate voter rights but that the limitations on individuals and organizations running voter registration campaigns “chill speech and advocacy related to voting and decrease participation in elections.”
Together, the outcome of the two cases will determine whether Republicans have finally succeeded in goals they have sought for years — stricter limits on acceptable voting identification and higher obstacles for organizations engaged in voter registration campaigns.
Opponents of the voter ID requirements aren’t arguing that there should be no requirement for identification, Jason Orr of the ACLU of Missouri told the court Wednesday. It is the limited list of acceptable identification that violates voter rights, he said.
To vote under the 2022 law, a person must present a Missouri drivers license, non-driver identification or another identification card issued by Missouri or the federal government with a photo, birthdate and expiration date.
“This type of state photo ID requirement does not pass muster under the Missouri Constitution,” Orr said.
Beetem’s ruling misses the mark, Orr said, because people with mobility issues who cannot obtain documents such as a birth certificate or who have misspellings on their documents have far more trouble than others getting identification issued.
The burdens “certainly are not shared by majority citizens, but they are real, and they frustrate the ability of some Missourians to exercise this right,” Orr said.

Missouri Republicans have been trying since 2006 to enact the photo ID requirement. Prior to the 2022 law, every attempt had been rebuffed by the courts. Before the law took effect, acceptable identification included a school ID, a voter card issued by their county clerk or a utility bill in their name at their voting address.
The photo ID requirement protects the integrity of elections and there is little evidence it has prevented Missourians from voting, said Lou Capozzi, state solicitor general.
People without ID can cast provisional ballots that will be counted if their signature matches the one on file, he said. In 2022, he said, only 116 ballots were not counted.
In his ruling, Beetem decided that the individual plaintiffs named in the lawsuit had not shown sufficient injury to sue and neither had the NAACP or the league as organizations. Capozzi noted that in his arguments.
“They could present the court with a single person unable to vote under the law,” he said.
At a news conference after the hearing, Attorney General Catherine Hanaway said 116 “is not a lot of votes” and it shows the law is working as intended.
“The goal is that anybody who is trying to vote  who shouldn’t be voting because they’re an illegal immigrant, because they don’t live in Missouri, because they’re trying to vote more than once, doesn’t get that opportunity,” Hanaway said.
Denise Lieberman of the Missouri Voter Protection Coalition said she sees 116 votes not being counted as a violation of all Missourians’ rights. The inclusion of both the voter ID requirements and limitations on signing up new voters in the same bill shows the intent to make it harder, not easier, to vote, she said at a news conference.
“The burdens to voters of a strict photo ID requirement to vote, the burdens on political speech of the voter registration and absentee ballot solicitations, are not academic,” Lieberman said. “They are not simply a matter of constitutional debate. These affect real voters here in the state of Missouri.”
The voter registration provisions bar paid voter registration solicitors, require anyone working to register voters to be a registered Missouri voter at least 18 years old and to file paperwork with the secretary of state’s office. The law also banned the practice of paying people to collect absentee ballots on behalf of homebound voters.
Arguing to overturn Beetem’s ruling, Deputy Solicitor General Michael Patton said the lower court ruling accepted too broad a definition of soliciting. Organizations can engage in voter registration drives that direct people to sign up through official government websites, he said, but cannot have individuals fill out cards that are turned in by the group.
Judge Paul Wilson was skeptical. He asked where else the limited definition would be acceptable.
“Should we apply that in a soliciting sex case, saying that if it does not result in a completed transaction, it isn’t soliciting?” Wilson asked.
Patton said the intent to receive sexual activity is what qualifies the act as soliciting. 
And if a person working for a voter registration drive does not intend to personally collect registration forms, he said, it would not violate the law.
“Unless there is an exchange of a completed application, we do not believe that is soliciting,” Patton said.
The law includes criminal penalties for people who violate the restrictions on registering new voters. That has a chilling impact on free speech because it is open to interpretation, Kristen Mulvey of the Missouri ACLU told the judges.
The state has been unable to provide a consistent definition, Mulvey said. That will lead local law enforcement to make its own interpretations, she added.
“It is not the secretary of state,” Mulvey said, “but each of the 115 prosecutors who are also defendants in this case, who are tasked with enforcing the criminal provisions.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Lieberman-Chapel-II-11192025-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-19 15:58:01.551757
,DC,2025-11-19 20:07:37+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Spiraling health insurance costs stymie members of US Senate panel,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/spiraling-health-insurance-costs-stymie-members-us-senate-panel,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. senators began debating how to reduce health care costs for Americans during a hearing Wednesday, where experts’ varied recommendations and comments from lawmakers previewed the rocky and potentially long path ahead. Republicans on the Finance Committee argued the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, has led to a spike in health insurance costs for individuals  that shouldn't be offset by tax credits any longer. Democrats urged their colleagues to extend the enhanced subsidies for at least another year to give Congress more time to address larger, more complex issues within the country’s health insurance and health care systems. Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, said the hearing marked “the first step in building the foundation for” health care reform.“We need both short-term and long-term solutions,” Crapo said. “In the short term, we cannot simply throw good money after bad policy. If we keep advancing a system that drives up premiums, we will make this problem even harder to solve.”“Instead, we should set the groundwork for giving Americans more control over their health care choices,” Crapo added. “Rather than accepting the current system of giving billions of taxpayer dollars to insurers, we should consider providing financial assistance directly to consumers through health savings accounts, which are now available on the Obamacare exchanges through a provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill.”Such tax-advantaged accounts are used to save money to pay for medical expenses and generally are used in conjunction with a high-deductible insurance plan, but an HSA “is a trust/custodial account and is not health insurance,” according to the Congressional Research Service.The ACA, signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010, overhauled the U.S. health care system with the intent of reducing high rates of uninsured people and ending insurance industry practices such as exclusions based on pre-existing conditions and the sale of policies with high costs and skimpy coverage. The law also expanded Medicaid and, for individual coverage, introduced the health insurance exchanges, or marketplaces, that now are at issue.According to the health organization KFF, the number of uninsured Americans fell from about 14% to 16% in the years preceding passage of the law to a record low of 7.7% in 2023.Pessimism about health care actionOregon Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the panel, rebuked Republicans for focusing on other policy areas throughout the year instead of making improvements to health care.“Sitting on your hands has consequences,” he said. Wyden doesn’t see a way for Congress to extend the enhanced tax credits set to expire at the end of the year for people who get their health insurance from the ACA marketplace, despite Democrats pressing for that during the 43-day government shutdown that ended in mid-November. Wyden expressed support for working with Republican senators to address health insurance companies’ structure, though he said he is “skeptical” his GOP colleagues will actually approve legislation on that particular issue in the months ahead. “Now if they are serious about taking on the crooks that dominate big insurance, like UnitedHealthcare, I’m all in,” Wyden said. “In my view that starts with a laser focus on lower costs for consumers, going after fraud where it truly exists, and cracking down on middlemen.”‘Very little that this Congress can do’Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president at the center-right American Action Forum and former chief economist at the Council for Economic Advisers during the President George W. Bush administration, told the committee the structure of the Affordable Care Act poses problems. “As a piece of health policy, economic policy and budget policy, the ACA has always been a troubling construct,” Holtz-Eakin said, later adding there is “very little that this Congress can do to change the outlook” for 2026. Holtz-Eakin testified that Congress is long “overdue for a real rethinking of health care policy at the federal level” that he believes should focus on two primary areas. The first is to “rationalize the insurance subsidies” and the second is to address what he referred to as “high-value care,” which he said should include Medicare, the health program that covers 69 million Americans over 65 and some people with disabilities. “Medicare is a great budgetary threat, and so I encourage the committee and the Congress as a whole to take a hard look at that and make some progress toward better health care outcomes and better budgetary outcomes,” Holtz-Eakin said.  Jason Levitis, senior fellow of the Health Policy Division at the left-leaning Urban Institute and a Treasury employee who led the ACA implementation at the department during the Obama administration, urged lawmakers to address the “too complicated and segmented” health insurance marketplace. Levitis said the best short-term option for Congress would be to extend the enhanced tax credits for ACA enrollees during 2026, despite the time crunch. “At this point the only feasible option is a clean extension of the existing enhancements,” Levitis said. “The marketplaces have already built that option and have been preparing for months for the possibility of an extension.” Former Trump adviser says ACA ‘failed’Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute and a former special assistant to President Donald Trump at the White House National Economic Council, said bluntly that the Affordable Care Act has “failed.”“The law entrenched an inefficient insurance-dominated health sector with massive subsidies flowing straight from the Treasury to health companies,” Blase said. The subsidies for ACA marketplace plans, he said, were “ill-designed and inflationary,” urging lawmakers not to extend them for another year.  “The enrollee share of the premium is capped regardless of the total premium. When enrollees pay only a small slice of the premium or no premium at all, insurers face almost no price discipline,” Blase said. “Insurers can raise premiums knowing the taxpayers will absorb almost all of the increase.”Blase said he believes the ACA’s regulations on health insurance companies are one of the reasons costs have spiked. “For example, under the medical loss ratio, insurers must spend a minimum share of premium revenue on medical claims. In other words, to increase profits, insurers must increase premiums,” Blase said. “The ACA’s essential health benefits require plans to cover the same set of services regardless of what people want or need. These rules increase premiums and wasteful spending.”The medical loss ratio was included in the ACA in response to insurers who spent “a substantial portion” of premiums on administrative costs and profits, including executive salaries, overhead and marketing, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.‘We all believe we need to reform’Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters separately from the hearing the debate over how to restructure health insurance to bring down costs has highlighted the “differences of opinion” among GOP lawmakers. “We've got a lot of people who have strong views, but the one thing that unites us is we all believe we need to reform, and we've got to do something to drive health care costs down,” Thune said. GOP leaders, he added, are “looking for solutions that will lower health care premiums, not increase them. And what we see today is just constant inflationary impacts from some of these policies of the past.”Trump, who would need to support any health care overhaul bill for it to move through Congress, wrote in a social media post Tuesday that he wants lawmakers to send money straight to Americans, without detail on how that would work. “THE ONLY HEALTHCARE I WILL SUPPORT OR APPROVE IS SENDING THE MONEY DIRECTLY BACK TO THE PEOPLE, WITH NOTHING GOING TO THE BIG, FAT, RICH INSURANCE COMPANIES, WHO HAVE MADE $TRILLIONS, AND RIPPED OFF AMERICA LONG ENOUGH,” Trump wrote. “THE PEOPLE WILL BE ALLOWED TO NEGOTIATE AND BUY THEIR OWN, MUCH BETTER, INSURANCE. POWER TO THE PEOPLE! Congress, do not waste your time and energy on anything else. This is the only way to have great Healthcare in America!!! GET IT DONE, NOW.

If not, they may have to tap into other funds to cover the program in case of a severe recession.
Traditionally, if the economy declines, the federal government offers to cover a larger portion of Medicaid to give states a breather while they experience revenue difficulties. But, Utah economists are afraid that with the current federal deficit levels, the federal government may become unable to offer that option during a future downturn.
“This is not like a hair-on-fire thing, but it’s also not fake, it’s real,” Jonathan Ball, legislative fiscal analyst, told the Executive Appropriations Committee. “It’s something we should be thinking about, and over the long term, we should be building contingencies.”

Currently, the state’s two accounts that work specifically as buffers to cover Medicaid expenses have $449.2 million in total. The Medicaid Affordable Care Act fund, which currently has $342 million, will be enough to cover all Medicaid expansion costs in the worst economic case scenario, Noah Hansen, economist at the Office of the Legislative Fiscal Analyst said in a presentation.
In 2025 the federal government funded 64.4% of the traditional Medicaid program in Utah, not counting the expansion. But, the economists are making projections for a future in which the federal government covers 50% of the program, its lowest-possible contribution. 
A restricted account for the traditional Medicaid program, which currently has $107.2 million in it, would be insufficient, Hansen said. Additionally, that Medicaid rainy day fund can only be used if the cost of the program grows over 8% a year, Ball added. However, the way that’s calculated is unclear in statute. 
“Is that 8% growth just natural growth of cost, or would a declining (Federal Medical Assistance Percentage) rate qualify as cost growth?” Ball said, advising lawmakers to start thinking about an answer to that question in the next few years.
General rainy day funds, since they are designed to create a buffer to economic risk, and not to tighten the gap in the case of losing federal funds, are “way insufficient,” Ball said. 
Something else to consider, he said, is the extent of uses for the Medicaid Affordable Care Act fund, which was created for the full Medicaid expansion approved through a citizen initiative. 



Let us know what you think...


 


“Do you have the ability to modify that statute so that it could be used outside the (Medicaid expansion) population?” Ball asked. 
But, if the Legislature were to consider that option, it could likely spark a constitutional question, since like Proposition 4, the ballot measure that established an independent commission to draw Utah’s congressional maps, the Medicaid expansion was approved by a citizen initiative. 
And, according to a Utah Supreme Court decision on the redistricting legal fight, “the people’s right to alter or reform the government through an initiative is constitutionally protected from government infringement, including legislative amendment, repeal, or replacement of the initiative in a manner that impairs the reform enacted by the people.”
However, these “stress tests” of Medicaid are not taking big changes into account — one of them is a new work requirement passed this year in Congress’ spending package widely known as the “big, beautiful bill.” In Utah approximately 7,900 people who now have to start working, or show proof of job applications in order to remain eligible for the federal program.
“That’s a significant change,” said Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City. “You’ll have thousands of Utahns dropping out of the program, so that should be also accounted for.”
But, beyond that, Escamilla said, the state may also have to consider conducting other stress tests derived from the potential loss of health care for thousands of Utahns. 
“We’re going to have thousands of Utahns with no health care coverage. I mean, are we stress testing our emergency rooms?” she said. “I don’t know. Maybe we should start considering a stress test on our emergency room capacity to take people who are going to be completely uninsured.”

The orchestra consists of conspiracy theorists, bigots, anarchistic libertarians, fascists, misogynists, evangelicals, gun fanatics, anti-environmentalists, nativists, and ultra-capitalists, and each makes their contribution to our 21st-century national anthem of dissonance.
In New Hampshire, where Republicans control the House, Senate, governor’s office, and Executive Council, that frenzied composition scores our days. From the opening pomp of privatized public education, through the “Ride of the Valkyries” inspired assault on immigrants, civil rights, and programs that support social progress and services, every misanthropic stanza follows the downshift beat of our defining anti-tax lunacy and the geographic, social, and economic inequality it faithfully delivers. 
While each individual player is largely focused just on the sound of their own instrument, with some horn blasts more blatantly hateful than others, the invisible hand conducting this monstrosity understands the true power of the collective disharmony. The performance is a benefit concert for the modern robber barons, for whom there is no sweeter melody than the battle cry of an electorate at war with each other instead of them.
In isolation, every note is sour. Consider, for example, New Hampshire Republicans’ reignited crusade, in all of its low-information glory, against the state’s Office of Health Access.
Early this year, Rep. Mike Belcher, a Wakefield Republican, proposed legislation targeting what was then known as the Office of Health Equity, among other civil rights programs that Belcher and his band of Republican co-sponsors labeled DEI and therefore “evil.”
One of Belcher’s sympathetic House colleagues, Rep. Jess Edwards, of Auburn, said he had the same initial reaction but then learned that the state Department of Health and Human Services had merely chosen a regrettable name for the office. Edwards said that as it turns out, and much to his own amazement, the office was actually just trying to “remove barriers to make sure we all have an equal access to care.” You know, like equity. 
There was also the little detail, bewildered state officials said at the time, that the services provided by the Office of Health Equity — including for refugees and people with disabilities — are required under federal law.
In a rare moment of conservative sanity, a compromise was eventually reached and the office was preserved, albeit under the less-woke letterhead of “Office of Health Access.” 
A happy-ish ending? Well, not so fast. Republicans are wise to DEI trickery, they say, so last week they launched another assault on that old office with the new name. On Nov. 12, the House Health and Human Services Committee advanced legislation, despite the bill being “problematic,” to once and for all eliminate the Office of Health Access, federal requirements be damned.
Why would Republican lawmakers waste so much time trying to destroy programs that the state Department of Health and Human Services would just have to recreate elsewhere? Because DEI. 
To understand why Belcher and others in his tinhorn section believe DEI is so evil, I suppose you have to consider the definitions behind the acronym. Merriam-Webster says “diversity” means “the state or practice of including people of different races, cultures, etc. in a group or organization.” Equity means “fairness or justice in the way people are treated.” And inclusion means, simply, “the act of including.”
Apparently it’s not enough that Republicans are rewriting the past; they’re also coming for the dictionaries. In the new lexicon, diversity, equity, and inclusion are synonymous with evil. A truly just and equal society, the conservatives argue, would be “morally reprehensible.”
That’s the kind of up-is-down, black-is-white moment we’re stuck in.
There was a time, as discordant as our national history may be, when such moral backwardness would have gotten you remanded to silence at the farthest political fringe.
Not anymore. Now you get a primo chair on the Republican stage, where no measure is too absurd to be amplified.

Indiana Farm Bureau’s annual “market basket survey” found the cost of a 10-person Thanksgiving dinner averages $53.62, up 0.6% from 2024. That compares to a national average price this year of $55.18.
The expected cost of $21.09 for a 16-pound turkey is virtually the same as last year, with produce prices the driver of the slight overall increase, according to Indiana Farm Bureau Chief Economist Todd Davis.
Those higher prices are seen in carrots and celery for a veggie tray (43 cent increase), sweet potatoes (30 cent increase), pumpkin pie filling (24 cent increase) and peas (14 cent increase). 
“Fresh produce markets can be very volatile, and many of these items saw an increase in wholesale and retail prices nationally,” Davis said. “Those retail prices reflect an increase in factors beyond the farm gate, including transportation, labor, fuel, packaging and more that contribute to the overall increased cost of the product.” 
The survey’s price calculation includes the 16-pound turkey, stuffing, sweet potatoes, rolls, peas, a carrot and celery veggie tray, whole milk, cranberries, whipping cream, ingredients for pumpkin pie and miscellaneous baking items.
The Farm Bureau says its market survey was conducted in early November by volunteer shoppers across Indiana who search for the best prices at their local grocery stores while not using coupons or special promotions.
With the turkey making up 39% of the total dinner cost, the Farm Bureau points to Indiana ranking fourth in national turkey production as helping the state’s turkey price being about 2% less than the national average.
“The concentration of turkey production in this region provides lower processing and marketing costs, which gets the turkey from the farm to the Thanksgiving table efficiently,” Davis said.
Still, a Thanksgiving meal in Indiana costs about 25% more than it did in 2019, reflecting a trend of post-COVID-19 pandemic inflation that’s still affecting grocery prices.
The Thanksgiving meal survey found a cost of $42.66 in 2019, but it has fallen about 12% since hitting a peak of $61 in 2022. 
The Indiana Farm Bureau pointed to U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics showing that only 15.9 cents of every retail food dollar can be attributed to farm production. The rest is for food processing, packaging, transportation, wholesale and retail distribution and food service preparation.
“Many consumers don’t realize that farmers are price-takers, just like them,” said Janis Highley, the Indiana Farm Bureau’s 2nd vice president. “We don’t set the prices, and the amount farmers are being paid doesn’t cover the increase of their input expenses.”
President Donald Trump earlier this month boasted that prices are falling under his administration — pointing to the cost of WalMart’s Thanksgiving bundle being 25% less. But this year’s package contains less food than in 2024.

Multiple lawmakers referenced the alleged crimes committed by two Lancaster Country Day School students in 2023, where investigators found they used AI to generate nude images of 48 female classmates and 12 others who were acquaintances of the students. Administrators reportedly didn’t report the content because of the gap in state law. The case has not yet gone to trial.

“That situation underscored how quickly technology can be weaponized against children by bad actors and how unprepared the current law is to respond,” Sen. Tracy Pennycuick (R-Montgomery) said.
Pennycuick called the creation of AI-generated child sexual abuse material “one of the most disturbing trends,” adding that adults and children alike used the technology to craft explicit content. 
A committee amendment incorporated portions of a similar proposal from Sen. James Malone (D-Lancaster), adding minor dissemination of sexually explicit material of another child to the state’s definition of child-on-child abuse.
“When it comes to protecting kids, there should be no sides. The bill represents a strong, collaborative effort to protect our kids in an ever-changing technological landscape that is being reshaped by AI,” Malone said. 
Pennycuick described the measure as an extension of her previous work with her cosponsors and a coalition of child protection advocates “to safeguard children in an era where technology changes faster than our statutes can keep up.”

One of those cosponsors, Sen. Scott Martin (R-Lancaster), echoed lawmakers’ commitment to legislating in the fast-changing world of AI, adding a message for impacted families. 
“I don’t only ask my colleagues for an affirmative vote, but I want to say, ‘Thank you,’ to those victims and those families,” said Baker. “Throughout the pain that they endured, going through these horrendous cases of seeing their daughters online in compromising positions or nude positions, it absolutely took courage to come forward.
“Not only to remedy this system, to do the right thing, but, more importantly, protect kids in the future.”

The Alabama Department of Mental Health (ADMH) told a group of lawmakers and first responder representatives Tuesday that the department has resources to help first responders find treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
ADMH Commissioner Kimberly Boswell told the Interim Study Commission on PTSD in First Responders that the department’s app Connect Alabama can be used to help first responders locate resources to treat PTSD. 
“First responders and public safety officers can access the most up to date information about what resources are available in the community. It does have a services locator tool,” Boswell said.

The commission is tasked with using existing funding, likely from ADMH, to help first responders with PTSD. At its meeting in October, the commission discussed what first responders need. Through a survey, the commission found that a lack of education on PTSD resources and stigmas around mental health were big issues.
“We need to make sure that we keep in mind how reporting PTSD to a supervisor, whatever may be, ensures that these men and women serving in emergency services are not going to be chastised for reporting these things,” Rep. Phillip Rigsby, R-Huntsville, said via Zoom. 
According to a 2023 study on data from 2015-2017, about 1% of all suicides in the United States were first responders. Most of them were law enforcement officers, followed by firefighters.
“It’s not a personal failure or weakness, it’s a natural psychological response to traumatic events,” Boswell said. “Getting that message out is one of the things that I think this committee could do that is really important to getting folks to understand that this is not a personal failure.”
ADMH has created a flyer targeted at first responders. The flyer includes the 988 national suicide hotline, a QR code for the Connect Alabama app and a QR code for crisis centers located across the state. Another app, VitAL, is similar to Connect Alabama and specifically for veterans and first responders.
“Anyone who’s in a behavioral crisis in our state can call that number and receive help 24/7. It is operated by the Department of Mental Health through crisis call centers in our state,” Boswell said.
The local answer rate for the 988 hotline was 90.7% in October, according to ADMH. When a call is not answered locally, callers are often told to call 911 for local assistance, Boswell said.
According to the Mayo Clinic, both the symptoms of PTSD and when they arise can vary from person to person. Typically, symptoms appear within the first three months of the traumatic event, but it could also take years and last for a year, or more. Symptoms are grouped into four categories, according to the Clinic: intrusive memories, avoidance, negative changes in thinking and mood, and changes in physical and emotional reactions.
The commission is made up of representatives from the Alabama Fire College, ADMH, legislators, the Legislative Services Agency, the Association of County Commissions of Alabama (ACCA), the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency (ALEA) and the Alabama League of Municipalities. 
April Turner, the state head injury coordinator for Alabama Department of Rehabilitation Services, told the commission how traumatic brain injuries (TBI) roughly doubles PTSD risk. But many first responders are not diagnosed because of the “invisible” symptoms of a mild TBI, also known as a concussion.
“First responders’ culture, like the military, promotes loyalty, selflessness and courage, which can help and harm their mental health and reaching out for help when they need it themselves,” Turner said. “It is crucial that we address traumatic brain injury alongside PTSD.”
Rep. Allen Treadaway, R-Morris, chair of the commission, said connecting first responders to existing resources is the commission’s goal, and the flyer will be crucial to that goal.
“I would hope the League of Municipalities will make sure that this is a priority, that this hangs in every one of their municipalities, and that the various groups with associations do the same,” he said. “Especially all those that have all these resources in this app.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/AL_Re_CC_070323-1-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-11-19 14:58:13.932357

Jason Esteves in a metro Atlanta district that spans Cobb and Fulton counties. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderTwo candidates vying to replace former state Sen. Jason Esteves to represent a metro Atlanta Senate seat are headed to a runoff election next month after neither candidate managed to secure more than 50% of the vote in a six-way special election held Tuesday. 
Esteves, an Atlanta Democrat, resigned from the state Senate in September to focus on his campaign for governor.
Former Cobb County School Board member Jaha Howard and retired state Rep. Roger Bruce will be advancing to the runoff after receiving 33% and 25% of the vote, respectively, according to unofficial results from the secretary of state’s office. Senate District 35 includes portions of Cobb and Fulton counties.
Over 5,000 voters showed up to cast their ballot for Howard, a dentist and Smyrna resident who centered his campaign around supporting small businesses, eliminating obstacles to health care access and reducing energy costs.
Howard has also been a candidate for state school superintendent, and ran for a seat on the Cobb County commission earlier this year, finishing second in the Democratic primary. 
He previously ran for state Senate in 2017, but came under fire after sexist and homophobic comments he posted on Facebook between 2011 and 2014 were unearthed. He later apologized for the comments, and eventually lost that race to attorney Jen Jordan. 
In this year’s race, he received an endorsement from state Sen. RaShaun Kemp, one of the two openly gay lawmakers in the chamber.
Howard did not immediately respond to multiple requests for comment Wednesday.
Ahead of the special election, much of the Democratic establishment coalesced behind Bruce, who was first sworn in as a state representative in 2003 and served for 22 years, until his retirement in 2024. Bruce said earlier that he was inspired to return to politics because of the political climate in Washington.

In an interview Wednesday, Bruce said his tenure at the state Capitol proves he has a record as an effective legislator, and helped drum up enthusiasm among his former constituents in Fulton County. However, he acknowledged that his campaign has work to do ahead of the runoff.
“I was known in Fulton County for the work that l’ve done, and we won overwhelmingly in Fulton County,” said Bruce, whose House district has spanned portions of Fulton, Douglas and Cobb counties during his time as a representative. “I was not as known in Cobb County.”
“Now we’ve just got to spend more time making sure people get to know my history,” he added.
Other candidates in the race included Democrats Erica-Denise Solomon and John Williams, Republican Josh Tolbert, and Corenza Morris, who ran as an independent.
Howard and Bruce will face off again during a runoff election held on Dec. 16. Early voting for the runoff will begin on Dec. 1.
Early voting for the special election partially overlapped with statewide races for the Public Service Commission, prompting the Cobb County Board of Elections and Registration to request that the date be moved to coincide with the PSC election. However, Gov. Brian Kemp denied the request in a Sept. 26 letter, arguing that changing the date would shorten the time for candidates to campaign. Critics of Kemp’s decision saw the move as a strategy to avoid boosting turnout in a left-leaning area. 
Two Democrats running for the commission ending up winning in a landslide this month, thanks in part to coinciding local races in metro Atlanta.

Every female Republican member of Michigan’s House sent a letter on Tuesday to the Michigan High School Athletics Association, or MHSAA, calling on them to confirm whether or not the student, who plays for the Ann Arbor Skyline High School volleyball team, had received a waiver from the association in order to play on a girls’ sports team. 
“Girls train all year for this moment. When necessary eligibility documents are missing, female athletes lose the ability to safely and fairly compete. Families deserve certainty that the same standards apply to everyone,” Rep. Donni Steele (R-Orion Twp.) wrote in a press release accompanying the letter.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
A spokesperson for the House GOP confirmed that, as of 1 p.m. on Wednesday, the lawmakers had not received a response from the athletic association. 
LGBTQ+ advocates at Equality Michigan in the state pushed back on those claims coming from Republican legislators, adding that coverage of the student has led to “singling out a minor and encouraging adults to attack a child online.”
“Kids should be able to play sports without being targeted online and bullied by adults,” wrote Erin Knott, the executive director of Equality Michigan, in a statement. 
Current Michigan High School Athletics Association guidelines do not prohibit transgender girls from playing on girls’ sports teams at the high school level, but do require submission of documentation that details the gender listed on a number of documents for the student, as well as information on the status of the student’s medical transition. 
“The MHSAA executive director will determine eligibility for MHSAA tournaments on a case-by-case basis,” guidelines read, as well as requiring a student, or their parents if the student is a minor, to waive certain privacy rights to disclose relevant information to the association. 










Let’s be clear about what is going on here. One right-wing sports blog has spent months attending games to surveil students, digging through a minor’s legal records, and publishing 11 articles encouraging strangers to target a child. They are putting children in harm’s way.


– Erin Knott, executive director of Equality Michigan


The letter from lawmakers asks the Michigan High School Athletics Association to “immediately confirm whether a complete and approved gender-identity waiver was received and approved before the athlete’s first regular-season contest in 2025,” and to declare the student ineligible for the remainder of the postseason if the waiver was not approved. 
The question of this student’s eligibility was first raised by a right-wing sports blog that features figures including anti-trans activist Riley Gaines, which has published nearly a dozen articles on this student since September. 
“Let’s be clear about what is going on here. One right-wing sports blog has spent months attending games to surveil students, digging through a minor’s legal records, and publishing 11 articles encouraging strangers to target a child,” Knott wrote in her statement. “They are putting children in harm’s way.”
LGBTQ+ advocates condemn House resolution asking to bar transgender girls from high school sports

Transgender girls and women in sports have been the target of conservative attacks in recent years, and President Donald Trump signed an executive order in February banning transgender athletes from any women’s or girls’ sports team. However, the Michigan High School Athletics Association has continued to allow participation under the waiver guidelines, in line with Michigan’s Elliot-Larsen Civil Rights Act, which was updated in 2023 to prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity. 
As of March, when Republican lawmakers put forth a bill to ban all transgender athletes in Michigan from girls’ and women’s sports teams in alignment with Trump’s order, the association had received and granted just two waivers for transgender students to participate in high school sports in the state — out of around 175,000 high school athletes.

As Delaware’s first integrated high school marks the legacy of the “First Five,” Salesianum leans on its civil rights roots to form “Salesian Gentlemen” grounded in faith, service and justice.







WILMINGTON, Del. — Seventy-five years ago, five teenage boys walked quietly into Salesianum School and changed Delaware history.
On Nov. 14, 1950, Thomas Connell, Alfred Connell, James Owens, Fred Smith and Willie Jones — now known as the “Quintus Five” or “First Five” — became the first Black students to enroll at the all-boys Catholic high school in Wilmington. Their admission, arranged by Principal the Rev. Thomas A. Lawless, made Salesianum the first racially integrated high school in Delaware, four years before the U.S. Supreme Court struck down school segregation in Brown v. Board of Education.
Their decision did more than integrate one campus. It helped define Salesianum’s identity as a civil rights trailblazer and cemented its role as a Catholic institution committed to justice, faith and service.
A school shaped by faith and inclusion
Founded in 1903 by the Oblates of St. Francis de Sales, Salesianum was Delaware’s first Catholic high school for boys. From its earliest days, the school’s mission has been to form “Salesian Gentlemen” — young men devoted to faith, service and leadership under the motto “Live Jesus.”
When the Quintus Five enrolled in 1950, that mission was put to the test. At a time when segregation was still the norm, their quiet arrival signaled that the school’s values would not remain theoretical. By opening its doors to Black students before any legal mandate, Salesianum took a public stand that Catholic education in Delaware would be measured, in part, by its commitment to human dignity and racial equality.
Over the decades, the school has produced generations of alumni who have gone on to leadership in business, government, education and community service. Many point back to the integration of 1950 as a turning point that helped shape Salesianum’s sense of responsibility to the broader community.
James Owens ’53 (last surviving member of Quintus 5)
Breaking barriers in Delaware education
In 1950, most schools in Delaware reflected the segregation laws and customs of the era. The decision to admit the Quintus Five into Salesianum’s student body broke that pattern.
Their presence shattered the racial barrier in Delaware’s Catholic high schools and set a precedent that rippled beyond one building on Broom Street. By integrating on principle — before court orders or political pressure — Salesianum offered an early model for how educational institutions could move toward equality.
Educators and community leaders now point to the Quintus Five as a reminder that Delaware’s story of desegregation did not begin or end in the courtroom. It also unfolded in hallways, classrooms and cafeterias, where teenagers learned, studied and played sports together in ways that had been almost unthinkable just a few years earlier.
Quiet courage, lasting leadership
Walking into a previously all-white high school in 1950 demanded courage. The climate of the time included entrenched segregation, open prejudice and resistance to social change.
Yet the Quintus Five chose to enroll, supported by their families and backed by school leadership. Their decision signaled to the wider community that Black students belonged in every classroom — not as an exception, but as equals.
That act of quiet courage has become part of Salesianum’s identity. Faculty and alumni say the story of the First Five continues to shape the school’s understanding of leadership, justice, and faith in action. It is held up as an example of how young people, simply by claiming their place, can help shift an entire community’s expectations.

A community legacy honored 75 years later
In 2025, Salesianum and the Wilmington community marked the 75th anniversary of the milestone with a series of tributes. The celebration included formal proclamations, the unveiling of a commemorative plaque on campus and a symbolic gesture that resonated deeply with students and alumni: the retirement of the number 5 from all Salesianum athletic uniforms.
The number, once just a jersey choice, is now reserved to honor the Quintus Five and their role in integrating the school. For student-athletes, it serves as a daily reminder that the privilege of wearing a uniform is tied to a much older struggle for inclusion and dignity.
At the anniversary events, James Owens — the last surviving member of the Quintus Five — addressed students directly, challenging them to pursue excellence while treating others with respect and humanity. His message underscored the belief that academic success, athletic achievement and moral responsibility belong together.
A hub for faith, service and civic life
Today, Salesianum remains a cornerstone of Wilmington’s Catholic and civic community. The school emphasizes the spirituality of St. Francis de Sales, encouraging students to integrate faith with action through service projects, outreach, and civic engagement.
A strong culture of brotherhood connects students, alumn,i and faculty, with mentorship that extends well beyond graduation. The school frequently partners with Wilmington nonprofits, parishes, and civic organizations, reinforcing its role as a community anchor.
Salesianum also continues to invest in its future and the city’s cultural life. In 2025, the school announced a historic $20 million gift to build a new Arts and Innovation Center, expanding opportunities in creativity, technology and leadership development for students.
Serving young men in grades 9–12 from across Delaware and neighboring states, the school promotes a whole-person approach to education — balancing academics, athletics, arts, and faith formation to develop compassionate, resilient leaders. Nearly all graduates are accepted into their first-choice colleges.
Students also participate in BRIDGE trips abroad, retreat,s and service-learning programs that broaden their worldview, linking the values first tested in 1950 to challenges facing communities around the globe today.
A story taught, not just remembered
The legacy of the Quintus Five is not limited to plaques, ceremonies or a retired jersey number. Their story is woven into Salesianum’s mission and curriculum, taught as an example of how Catholic education can respond to injustice.
Teachers use their experience to help students understand the lived realities of segregation and the responsibilities that come with privilege. Student leaders and alumni often point to the First Five as a call to action — a reminder that each generation has its own work to do in advancing justice and equity in schools and neighborhoods.
For families, especially those navigating issues of race, opportunity and education, the Quintus Five stand as proof that young people can be catalysts for systemic change.
For Wilmington, their story underscores the idea that progress is not solely the result of landmark court cases or sweeping legislation. It can also begin with a single open door, a single school leader willing to take a risk and five teenagers ready to walk through together.
And for alumni, the “Salesian Gentlemen” identity — shaped by faith, service and the example of the Quintus Five — continues to inspire a lifelong commitment to justice, community and faith.
Seventy-five years after they first entered Salesianum’s front doors, the impact of Thomas Connell, Alfred Connell, James Owens, Fred Smith and Willie Jones is still unfolding. Their bravery transformed a single high school into a beacon of integration and helped define a school that remains, to this day, a leader in education, service and innovation for Wilmington and Delaware.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Photo-Mar-19-2024-12-53-22-AM-002.jpg,,,2025-11-19 14:58:13.932357

Mark Rodgers, a spokesperson for Constellation, told the Capital-Star that the federal loan is welcome, and will help reduce overall borrowing costs for the project. He added that the reactor will be a strong source of clean energy, which will offset the added demand on the power grid created by data centers.
“We’re appreciative of [the loan],” Rodgers said. “It’ll be helpful to Constellation. And for the government, we’re going to pay it back in full with interest, so ultimately the taxpayer will get a return.”

Three Mile Island was the site of one of the worst nuclear power disasters in U.S. history, when one of its two reactors partially melted down in 1979, releasing some radioactive material into the surrounding environment. While long-term impacts on the health of people living nearby were minimal, the accident became a symbol for the risks of nuclear energy production in the U.S.
The other on-site reactor, which shuttered in 2019, is what will be brought back online by Constellation Energy. It’s being renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center.
“Constellation’s restart of a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania will provide affordable, reliable, and secure energy to Americans across the Mid-Atlantic region,” U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a press release. “It will also help ensure America has the energy it needs to grow its domestic manufacturing base and win the AI race.”
The taxpayer-backed loan is financed through the Trump administration’s Energy Dominance Financing Program, which will back projects aimed at boosting energy infrastructure capacity for the U.S. Artificial Intelligence industry.
The project, however, has faced some pushback from community members who live near the reactor, some of whom lived through the 1979 incident.
At a public hearing on the reopening in July, a number of people voiced concerns about the risks of another meltdown being shouldered by Middletown and the surrounding communities in Dauphin County, while virtually all of the energy created will go towards powering data centers.
Others spoke in support of the project, with many welcoming the construction jobs it will bring and the potential positive impacts on the local economy.
The reactor is expected to be operational in 2027.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_4445-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-19 14:58:13.932357

(Photo courtesy of Colorado Parks and Wildlife)With the third winter “release season” in Colorado’s gray wolf reintroduction plan just weeks away, state wildlife officials are scrambling to find a source for additional relocated wolves.
A deal to source up to 15 animals from British Columbia is in doubt after the federal government, under pressure from livestock groups and conservative activists, ordered Colorado Parks and Wildlife not to import Canadian wolves. Officials in the Republican-controlled states of Montana, Idaho and Wyoming, home to large and well-established wolf populations, have made it clear that they won’t help Colorado’s restoration efforts.
Ghost wolves: As Idaho aims to reduce its wolf population, advocates worry counts aren’t accurate

And one of Colorado Parks and Wildlife’s few remaining options was taken off the table Saturday when its request to capture and relocate wolves from Washington was rejected by wildlife commissioners there.
“I certainly heard loud and clear from Washingtonians this morning, (on) all different sides of the aisle, saying it’s just not the time for us to support this,” said Lorna Smith, a conservation advocate and member of the Washington Fish and Wildlife Commission.
 Declining wolf populations in Washington a factor in denying Colorado’s request

Colorado’s restoration plan calls for annual releases of 10 to 15 relocated wolves for the program’s first three to five years, with an initial target population of 50 individuals. Colorado Parks and Wildlife captured and relocated 10 wolves from Oregon in December 2023 and another 15 from Canada in January 2025.
In an Oct. 28 letter to Washington wildlife officials, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis wrote that while the state’s goal is to secure up to 15 wolves again this winter, “even 5-7 would be extremely helpful towards successful species recovery.” Colorado Parks and Wildlife Director Jeff Davis, speaking to the commission in Washington on Saturday, reiterated that Colorado would cover the costs of capture and relocation operations, which could take place at any point through the end of February.
Washington’s reported wolf population declined in 2024 for the first time since confirmed wolf packs were reestablished in the state in 2008. Kelly Susewind, director of the state’s Department of Fish and Wildlife, told commissioners that the decision was up to them.
“We’ve assessed this with our staff — we feel that biologically, we can accommodate the request, should you choose to go that way, without interfering with our recovery effort,” said Susewind.
But on a motion from Smith, who cited the “cautionary message” of Washington’s declining 2024 wolf count, the commission voted 8-1 to deny Colorado’s request.
“I myself am really torn on this issue, because of course I’d love to see wolves recovered across the Rocky Mountain range, including Colorado,” Smith said. “But Washington’s wolves, I don’t believe are in a position to assist with that at this point in time.”
 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service orders state to halt any efforts to source wolves from outside a specified area

After two years of winter releases, Colorado currently has a population of around 20 adult or yearling gray wolves, with an unknown number of new pups born to four confirmed breeding packs in 2025. Survival rates for relocated wolves have been lower in Colorado than in previous reintroduction efforts in the northern Rockies, but Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials say their efforts are on the right track.
District Court in Montana hears arguments over wolf hunting regulations

Livestock groups — who opposed the 2020 voter-approved ballot measure requiring wolf restoration and have sought to delay or pause its implementation ever since — scored their biggest victory to date in the fight against the program last month, when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ordered Colorado Parks and Wildlife to halt any efforts to source wolves from outside a specified area in the northern Rockies, including Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and eastern portions of Washington and Oregon.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service letter claims that sourcing wolves from outside the northern Rockies is “violative” of the permit the agency issued for Colorado’s experimental wolf population under section 10(j) of the Endangered Species Act. But while the state’s 10(j) permit, issued in 2023, identifies northern Rockies wolves as a “preferred donor population,” it does not contain any such requirement or limitation on relocation operations.
“The 10(j) rule does not mandate that Colorado’s wolves come from specific states, period,” Thomas Delehanty, a senior attorney with Earthjustice, said in a statement at the time.
While Polis wrote in his letter to Washington officials that the state “disagree(s) with the legal basis for (the USFWS) analysis,” Davis said at last week’s meeting of the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission that Colorado Parks and Wildlife is “working very diligently to be consistent with the letter.”
As it has for every year of the reintroduction program’s operation, a coalition of livestock groups and rural county commissioners has submitted a petition to pause additional wolf releases until at least November 2026.
In a brief statement Monday, Colorado Parks and Wildlife spokesperson Luke Perkins said the agency “continues to evaluate all options to support this year’s gray wolf releases in alignment with the approved Colorado Wolf Restoration and Management Plan and the 10(j) Rule.”

Jackson officials requested more time to review the financial records of JXN Water, the third-party utility running the city’s water and sewer systems. The city and utility reached an agreement over access to the records just prior to the status conference. 
Jackson City Attorney Drew Martin told Wingate the city would have an official response to the court on Dec. 19 after presenting its findings to the city council on Dec. 16. 
JXN Water first brought up the need for a rate increase in a financial report in February in which it said the utility was quickly running out of money. It then formerly proposed the increase — which it said would be come out to about 12% on the average bill — in April. The Jackson City Council unanimously voted it down.
Mayor John Horhn, who took office in July, has also spoken out against the increase. Under Wingate’s 2022 order appointing Ted Henifin to take charge of the utility, Henifin doesn’t need the city’s approval to move forward with the proposal. The order only requires JXN Water to present the increase to the city, and that it wait 365 days between increases.

Despite the mayor and city council already speaking against the proposal, the city argued in court that it needed access to JXN Water’s financial records to offer an informed opinion. The city’s agreement with JXN Water gives Jackson’s financial adviser full access to the utility’s records, with a stipulation that the city not release any information from the records publicly without first consulting Henifin.
Wingate’s 2022 order shields JXN Water from any public records requirements, although intervenors in the case, represented by the ACLU, argued against the exception. 
Mitch McGuffey, attorney for JXN Water, emphasized the need to enact the rate increase before the year ends. Waiting would push back when the utility could increase rates again because of the 365-day requirement, he said. In addition to the 12% increase this year, JXN Water plans to implement smaller increases in 2027 and beyond to keep up with inflation. 
Overall, the utility is losing $1.2 million a month from a lack of revenue, McGuffey added. Henifin also pointed to funds needed to repair two large sewer overflows, one on Mill Street and another along I-55 in north Jackson. 
In the end, Wingate sided with the city, and kept an injunction in place preventing JXN Water from advertising a rate increase. Under the judge’s order, the utility needs to inform the public of any increase 30 days before it goes into effect. If the judge were to allow JXN Water to go forward with the increase on Dec. 19, the earliest it would go into effect would be Jan. 18, 2026. 
By the time of the next meeting, the city may also have new information on restructuring its bond payments as well as on any efforts from the state Legislature to provide new revenue to JXN Water, Martin, the city attorney, added. McGuffey agreed that such changes could reduce how much the utility needs to raise rates.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/19124934/IMG_6111.jpg,,,2025-11-19 14:58:13.932357

(Image by Montana Department of Commerce)The Montana Department of Commerce is polling people on new designs for the state’s “Welcome to Montana” highway signs that greet travelers at the border.
This spring, Gov. Greg Gianforte and Commerce unveiled an update of the state’s branding — the first update in more than a decade — with a new logo, color scheme and imagery.
Now, the department is looking to revamp the state’s highway signs to reflect the new look.
“There’s no better feeling than crossing state lines back home to Montana,” Gianforte said in a press release. “Our highway signs give our families, friends and visitors the warm welcome they deserve. I am excited to see what Montanans choose.”
Three designs have been selected for Montanans to vote on, each incorporating aspects of the new brand and elements of the state.
Mitch Staley, chief marketing officer for the state, describes the designs as a “1990’s style license plate line, the middle design that is very similar to the welcome signs previously displayed prior to 2014 and a new design that features the mountains and badlands landscapes that make our entire state a one of one.”
“Commerce has opted to have one design for all state entrances for brand recognition and strength. We’re confident these signs will be as iconic as signs of the past,” Staley told the Daily Montanan.
Commerce’s website for voting on the sign designs, visitmt.com/welcome-sign is live now and voting is open until Dec. 31, 2025.
Current highway welcome signs were installed in 2014, according to the department. The Montana Department of Transportation will work to install the new welcome signs next spring once weather and access allows, as many of the state’s border crossings are on mountain passes.
Currently, the state’s welcome sign designs include various animals, including black bears, pronghorn and elk, and vivid landscapes including Glacier National Park, riverscapes and prairie lands.

Kevin Steele filed to run as Florida chief financial officer, a local fire captain on Wednesday became the first candidate to announce his bid to replace Steele in House District 55.
Walter Price hopes to succeed Steele in the Pasco district, according to a press release announcing his candidacy. He also announced the support of state Sen. Ed Hooper, the chamber’s appropriations chair, and Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco.
Walter Price is running to replace Rep. Kevin Steele in HD 55 (Via Walter Price).
“As a firefighter and community servant, I’ve seen firsthand the challenges our families face and the strength which makes Pasco County such a special place to live,” the Republican said in a statement. “I’m running for the Florida House to ensure our community’s voice is heard — to protect our families, strengthen public safety, and help small businesses thrive.”
Rep. Steele, whose term ends in 2026, announced Tuesday morning that he had filed to run for chief financial officer with the support of U.S. Sen. Rick Scott. Steele is challenging incumbent CFO Blaise Ingoglia, a Spring Hill Republican appointed to the post in July by Gov. Ron DeSantis.
The race could prove contentious, reinvigorating a 2015 clash between Ingoglia and Scott — by proxy — when Ingoglia defeated Scott’s choice for Republican Party of Florida chair. There’s speculation that Steele may be endorsed by President Donald Trump, although he told the Phoenix after a committee meeting Tuesday that he’ll “let the announcements speak for themselves.”
He didn’t clarify what announcements, nor from whom. Steele did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday on whether he’d back Price as his replacement.
Price, who has yet to file to run in the deep-red district, has served as a captain with Pasco County Fire Rescue for the past decade. He’s largely stayed out of the political sphere, although in 2010 he ran for Pasco County property appraiser.

(Scott Olson/Getty Images)The hospitalization of an Ada County infant with suspected botulism is believed to be linked to a national recall of an infant formula, Idaho health officials say.
The case is the only one in Idaho that state officials believe is linked to the recall of ByHeart Whole Nutrition’s infant formula. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, is investigating the source of the contamination. 
The recalled formula was available in stores throughout Idaho, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare announced in a news release Wednesday.
According to the release, parents should stop using any ByHeart infant formula products immediately and should wash items and surfaces that may have touched the formula using hot soapy water or a dishwasher.
“While infant botulism is rare, it can progress quickly and requires prompt medical attention,” said Idaho state epidemiologist Dr. Christine Hahn. “We want parents and caregivers to know that we are working closely with our federal partners to understand the extent of this outbreak and ensure that affected products are removed from circulation. If your baby has consumed this formula, please watch for symptoms and seek medical care right away.”
Infant botulism is a rare, serious illness. Symptoms, which usually start as soon as 18 hours after digestion but can take up to 30 days, include:

Constipation
Difficulty swallowing or poor feeding
Weak facial expressions
Loss of head control

If a child does develop symptoms, the local public health district may want to collect the formula container for testing and may ask for product information, such as the lot number and best by date on the formula, the release said.

Bousselot had announced an “exploratory” committee for Iowa governor in April, shortly after Gov. Kim Reynolds had said she would not seek reelection. The Ankeny Republican said he had received encouragement from several other Republicans to consider running for the top state leadership position, including from former Gov. Terry Branstad. Bousselot served as Branstad’s chief of staff and as director of the Department of Management for Reynolds before his election to the Iowa Senate in a 2021 special election.
“I have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support and encouragement from Iowans regarding my potential campaign for governor,” Bousselot said. “While visiting dozens of counties this summer, I heard the stories of optimism for our state and opportunity for their families. Ultimately, after prayer and reflection with my family, it is not the right time for me to pursue a run for governor.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Iowa Republicans will have an open gubernatorial primary field in 2026, the first time in more than a decade that the race will not include an incumbent GOP governor. Bousselot was one of several interested parties to throw their hats in the ring after Reynolds’ announcement — others included U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, state Rep. Eddie Andrews, R-Johnston, and former state Rep. Brad Sherman, who have all launched official campaigns. Adam Steen, former director of the Iowa Department of Administrative Services, and Zach Lahn, who has worked for the conservative advocacy group Americans for Prosperity, have also joined the race in recent months.
On the Democrats’ side, Iowa Auditor Rob Sand and Julie Stauch, a Democratic political consultant, are running to become their party’s nominee for governor. Bousselot has made critical remarks about Sand, who is considered the frontrunner in the primary race, for trying to appeal to Republican and moderate voters in his campaign. He has also claimed Sand is not adequately performing his duties as state auditor, saying Sand “has been running for governor since the day he was elected auditor, and not doing the job.”
Other high-profile Republicans, like Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird and state House Speaker Pat Grassley, had said they were considering running for governor earlier in the year, but ultimately chose not to pursue a campaign.
Bousselot said he will seek reelection to the Iowa Senate in a new seat — Senate District 23, currently held by former Senate Majority Leader Jack Whitver. Bousselot currently represents District 21.
District 23, which encompasses parts of Polk and Dallas counties including areas of Bondurant, Polk City and Grimes, will be an open seat in the 2026 election as Whitver announced in September he was stepping down from his leadership role and would not run for reelection.
Whitver, who has held the majority leader position since 2018, was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2024, and said treatment has shown positive progress but remains ongoing. Sen. Mike Klimesh, R-Spillville, was elected later in September to take over as Senate majority leader. Whitver said in a statement he supported Bousselot’s run for his seat.
“He is a humble, hard-working legislator who listens to his constituents and serves his district and the state well,” Whitver said.
Bousselot said he is “so grateful for the opportunity to serve in the Iowa Senate,” and believes there is more work to be done in the Legislature to improve life for Iowans.
“Important work remains on making Iowa more affordable, a more competitive environment for business and investment, improving education for Iowa kids, and keeping our communities safe,” Bousselot said. “For those reasons and to continue serving my state, I am seeking re-election to the Iowa Senate … and look forward to earning the support of voters.”

[Photo/Courtesy]A coal-fueled power plant in West Olive, Mich. which was originally set to shut down at the end of May will continue operating after President Donald Trump’s Administration issued another extension. 
U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright issued the first order prolonging the plant’s lifespan on May 23, with the Department of Energy saying the move was intended to minimize blackouts in the Midwest ahead of high energy demand expected over the summer, despite projections from the energy grid operator, MISO, that it would have enough energy supply to meet expected consumer demand. 
The latest order will extend operations for the plant through Feb. 17, 2026.
Consumers Energy, which owns the plant, initially sought a shut down of the plant in 2021 as part of its plan to go coal free and transition to clean energy resources. The shutdown was approved by Michigan’s energy regulators, the Michigan Public Service Commission, alongside the grid operator, which determined the shutdown would not violate its reliability criteria.  
Consumers Energy projected the plant’s closure would save energy customers $650 million by 2040. However, between May 23 and Sept. 30, keeping the plant online has cost the company $80 million, or more than $615,000 a day.
Additionally, testimony presented as part of a legal challenge to the extension found that during the grid operator’s tightest energy margin over the summer, they had an energy surplus greater than the 10 times the amount of energy produced by the Campbell plant. 
In a statement, Consumers Energy Media Relation Specialist Brian Wheeler said the company is prepared to continue operating the Campbell plant as required by the Department of Energy. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“The costs to operate the Campbell plant will be shared by customers across the Midwest electric grid region – not solely by Consumers Energy customers,” Wheeler said. “We are planning to submit a cost recovery filing to [the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] later this year outlining net costs to operate the plant during the first 90 days.”
Ted Kelly, director and lead counsel for U.S. clean energy at the Environmental Defense Fund, one of the environmental groups challenging the Department of Energy’s previous orders, called the mandate a “guaranteed way to needlessly hike up Americans’ electricity bills and make air pollution worse.”
“These half-a-century old plants are simply too expensive to operate, too dangerous for our health and break down too often to be counted on,” Kelly said. “To keep costs down, we should be unleashing – not blocking – the cheapest, fastest and cleanest sources of electricity onto our grid, including solar, wind and battery projects.”
Alex Kellogg, the federal energy accountability manager for the Michigan League of Conservation Voters said in a statement that the Trump administration had guaranteed a rate hike, slamming Trump’s energy emergency order as a sham to keep the plant operating. 
“His move to keep Campbell open is making our bills higher and our energy dirtier just to score political points with the dying coal industry that backed him heavily in the election,” Kellogg said. 
Activists, officials call for closure of Ottawa County coal plant as utility looks to recover costs

Michael Lenoff, a senior attorney at EarthJustice, which is also challenging the Department of Energy’s previous orders, emphasized the environmental toll of keeping the plant running.
“These aging coal power plants are increasingly unreliable and prone to breaking down,” Lenoff said. “They’re also filthy, dumping toxics into nearby waters (such as Lake Michigan) and spewing pollutants into the air we breathe.”
According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, which is also disputing the Department of Energy’s past orders, the plant releases several millions of pounds of health-harming pollutants and more than 10 billion pounds of carbon dioxide into the air each year. It also releases roughly 100,000 pounds of water pollution into Lake Michigan each year, including 10,000 pounds of toxic metals.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-24-065259.png,,,2025-11-19 13:58:54.552824

(Photo by Jessica Kourkounis for the Pennsylvania Capital-Star)State Treasurer Stacy Garrity announced Wednesday that interest will be forgiven on loans her office awarded to counties and human service providers that were impacted by the budget impasse.
Garrity began offering loans with a 4.5% interest rate for some services, like pre-K programs and rape crisis centers, roughly three months into the impasse that saw state funding dry up after the June 30 deadline.
They were intended as a lifeline for local governments and human service providers which faced difficult choices over whether to cut programming and staffing, dip into their reserves, or seek potentially higher-interest loans from more traditional sources.
“The ability to waive interest is monumental, ensuring that every dollar can be channeled directly into the essential services that impact the lives of our friends and neighbors who depend on the vital support these organizations provide,” Garrity said in a press release.

Loans totaling more than $42.2 million were given to 62 organizations, including one county government, two rape and domestic violence crisis centers, 13 Head Start agencies and 46 Pre-K Counts providers.
The program, however, became a controversial one as negotiations over the 2025-2026 budget dragged on until an agreement was reached earlier this month.
Some Democratic lawmakers said that the Treasury Department did not have the authority to provide such loans unilaterally. Gov. Josh Shapiro’s office also argued that the move allowed Garrity’s Republican allies at the state Capitol to prop her up politically by dragging out negotiations. Garrity is the current frontrunner in the Republican gubernatorial primary to unseat Shapiro in 2026. She has received the endorsement of GOP legislative leaders. 
But some recipients praised the program.
“The Budget Bridge Loan served as a powerful strategic boost that kept FCCA moving forward during a difficult transitional period,” Jackie L. Roberson Jr., executive director of the Family Children & Community Association was quoted as saying in a Treasury press release.
However, when the loan program was first announced, they came with an interest rate of 4.5%. Some eligible recipients said they would be unable to shoulder even that cost.
The Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence, for example, said in early October that they were eligible for a loan of around $5.8 million, but would be unable to afford the roughly $260,000 in interest they expected to pay.
Kyle Kopko, executive director of the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania, said he welcomed the attempt to ease counties’ burden during the impasse, even if most counties were hesitant to take up loans because of the expected 4.5% interest.
“I think a lot of our members didn’t feel right asking taxpayers to foot that burden,” Kopko said.
Questions over the legality of the program were effectively settled when the 2025-2026 budget passed last week with a provision allowing the interest on the loans to be forgiven, and clarifying that future treasurers will not have the authority to unilaterally make similar moves going forward.
Kopko, however, said that the association  will advocate for interest-free loans for counties during future budget impasses going forward.
“In the future, if we did have access to those types of short term loans that had interest reimbursed, or interest at zero percent, you’d have a lot of counties taking advantage of it,” he said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Pennsylvania-Capitol-in-Harrisburg-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-19 13:58:54.552824

(Getty Images)The New Hampshire Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected an attempt by a police officer to remove her name from New Hampshire’s Laurie List — the state’s database of officers with reported credibility concerns — despite the officer’s arguments that the conduct was long ago and irrelevant.
The case stemmed from an incident in 2013 in which a Concord police officer was fired after being accused of obtaining a colleague’s firearm without permission and lying to superiors about it.
The officer, referred to anonymously as “Jane Doe” in the opinion, had taken the colleague’s firearm with her on a trip to transport a prisoner to a hospital. The colleague had realized the gun was missing from its locker and had alerted her supervisors. Those supervisors called Jane Doe at the hospital and asked her to read the serial number of her firearm. After the number matched the colleague’s gun, Doe allegedly gave conflicting and false accounts to those supervisors over the incident, according to the court.
After an internal affairs investigation found that Doe “struggled to answer specific questions” about what happened, Doe was fired and the Concord Police Department submitted her name to the “exculpatory evidence schedule” 
That list exists to let prosecutors know of any past misconduct that could be a liability if prosecutors put an officer on the stand in a criminal trial. 
In order for a police officer to be added to the list by the Department of Justice, there must be a “sustained finding that the officer has engaged in conduct negatively reflecting on the officer’s trustworthiness or credibility,” according to the state statute. 
Doe later sued Concord, alleging gender discrimination and wrongful termination, and obtained a settlement with the city in which the city agreed to move her disciplinary records out of her personnel file and officially label her departure a “negotiated resignation.”
Years later, and after the 2021 passage of a law requiring public release of the Laurie List, Doe brought legal action against Concord and the Department of Justice seeking to remove her name from the list before it was released. 
Doe argued she should not have been added to the list because her “alleged misstatement of fact” did not rise to the level of being potentially exculpatory evidence in any future criminal court case. She contended that the factual record surrounding the firearm was “immaterial to any policy violation.”
Doe also argued that because the disciplinary documents relating to the firearm incident were removed from her personnel file, she should not have been added to the Laurie List. 
And she said it is unlikely that she would be a witness in any foreseeable criminal cases, and that her inclusion in the published list “would serve no purpose other than to publicly embarrass her.”
But the Supreme Court rejected that argument and said the mere fact that it is unlikely for Doe to serve as a future witness is not enough for her to be excluded from the list. The real test, the court held, is whether the officer’s misconduct would or would not be admissible by a court during a trial; if it would, the likelihood of the trial happening does not make a difference.
“There is no dispute that, after multiple proceedings, the plaintiff was found to have been untruthful,” the court ruled. “The sustained findings that the plaintiff lied to her colleagues and supervisors could be admissible to impeach her credibility if, in the future, there arises a criminal case at which she is called as a witness.”
Since the 2021 law, the Supreme Court has heard several cases in which officers have asked for their names to be removed, and in some cases, the court has ruled with the officers. On Tuesday, the court reiterated that officers should only remain on the list if their alleged misconduct relates to their truthfulness — misconduct allegations that don’t involve deceit or lying are likely not relevant for the Laurie List.
“We conclude that the trial court correctly determined that the plaintiff’s personnel information contains ‘potentially exculpatory evidence,’” the court concluded Wednesday.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/policesirens-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-19 13:58:54.552824

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)The New Mexico Aging and Long-Term Care Department this week presented an $8.2 million budget request to state lawmakers, which includes an 11% funding increase from last year.
ALTSD Secretary Emily Kaltenbach met with the New Mexico Legislature’s interim Legislative Finance Committee Monday to discuss several priorities the department’s budget request will address, including expanding Adult Protective Services, community-based aging programs, emergency readiness and outreach efforts.
“New Mexico’s older adults need a strong, responsive support network,” Kaltenbach said in a written statement. “Each year, we see more aging seniors aging in need — this budget strengthens frontline services families rely on, invests in protection for our most vulnerable, and positions us to be prepared for the future.”
According to Kaltenbach’s presentation, New Mexico’s population of people 65 and older is expected to increase by more than 80,000 people between 2020 and 2040, with Catron, Harding and Sierra counties reporting the highest percentages of adults 60 and older. The presentation also noted that 42% of New Mexico seniors have an annual income of less than $40,000, and 9% of seniors receive less than $10,000 annually.
“What’s concerning is those are rural counties that have fewer services and supports, fewer family members, longer distances to travel for support. So we’re very focused on looking ahead to make sure that we’re building out systems of care to support our older adults across all of New Mexico,” Kaltenbach told committee members.
She explained that the increase to the budget proposal includes $1.5 million to fund about a dozen full-time investigative caseworkers and supervisors for Adult Protective Services; $500,000 to add 30 to 35 slots for the Senior Employment Program; $5 million to “strengthen” direct services and increase participation at senior centers, particularly for Tribes, Pueblos and Nations; and about $1 million for departmental operational costs. 
The department is also asking for $2.6 million for special budget requests, which include funds for the annual New Mexico Conference on Aging, educational outreach and emergency preparedness.

Kaltenbach noted that the number of reports to Adult Protective Services and subsequent investigations have increased year-to-year, with more than 15,000 reports made in the 2025 fiscal year. Kaltenbach said the division anticipates increasing to 18,000 reports this year.
“These cases are more complex. We’re dealing with behavioral health issues,” she said. “This is a critical safety net service for our older adults. This is addressing abuse, neglect and financial exploitation. Not only are they out in the homes doing these investigations, we also do a lot of prevention work.” 
She added that the Aging Network Division also provides “safety net services” such as food, transportation, respite care, caregiving and homemaker services. Food insecurity is “top of mind,” Kaltenbach said, particularly because of the large number of seniors in New Mexico who receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits and recent delays to federal funding.
“Our senior center providers are in crisis mode,” Kaltenbach said. “Some of them were concerned about closing their doors…Our $5 million ask is both to keep the lights on and expand services.”
Rep. Rebecca Dow (R-Truth or Consequences) told Kaltenbach during the meeting that she was “very concerned” about the department’s budget, particularly because her district in the southwest part of the state — including Sierra County — is home to large numbers of rural seniors. She said the “most cost effective way” for seniors to remain in their communities and age in place is to “adequately fund the programs” run by ALTSD. 
She said her 74-year-old mother and her 72-year-old aunt are among the older New Mexicans living in rural communities and being supported by family members.
“[Seniors are] choosing between the copays they have for their health insurance and the programs, the supplemental programs that they have to add and the costs they have for their prescription medication, and they’re choosing between food. And it is absolutely heartbreaking,” Dow said. “We have to fund this.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/HK7A0115-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-19 13:58:54.552824

(Photo by Janine L.

The dozen members include representatives from philanthropic and community organizations, employees, and maternal health experts whose role will be to offer guidance and recommendations during a review process that will continue through the spring. Their first meeting is scheduled for the afternoon of Monday, Nov. 24, at the hospital, Rhode Island Current has learned.
The meeting will not be open to the public, Nicole Searles, a spokesperson for the hospital said.
Newport Hospital birthing center supporters pack special meeting at City Hall

The panel’s formation follows up on a commitment made in July by the hospital’s operator, Brown University Health, in response to public outcry over the possibility that the health system could shut down the Noreen Stonor Drexel Birthing Center. A special meeting of the Newport City Council on July 15, drew 200 people to witness the council pass a resolution advocating for the birthing center’s continued operation.
Brown University Health President and CEO John Fernandez originally referred to the group as a “task force” charged with assessing the birthing center’s quality of care, patient safety, access, finances, operations, and its impact on the community and statewide, according to a July 29 memo. The group would conduct its work over the next year, Fernandez said then.
The 12 panel participants are: 

Lori Allan, RN – The Noreen Stonor Drexel Birthing Center 
Carol Bazarsky – Newport Hospital Foundation Board 
Emily Blosser, MD – Obstetrician-Gynecologist, Medical Director, Newport Women’s Health 
Alex Hammer Ducas – Social Enterprise Greenhouse

Rebecca Hurd, CNA, CLC – The Noreen Stonor Drexel Birthing Center 
Elizabeth Lynn – van Beuren Charitable Foundation

Latisha Michel, CLC, CBE, CHW – Certified Perinatal Doula, Ready Set Latch Go, LLC 
Sydney Ormerod – Women’s Resource Center, Newport Health Equity Zone (HEZ) 
Alexandra Quick, PT, DPT – Mae Physiotherapy 
Methodius Tuuli, MD – Chief of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Women & Infants Hospital  

“We are grateful to the members of the panel for generously agreeing to bring their time, experience, and perspectives to an important dialogue about the future of maternity care in our region” the hospital’s president and chief medical officer, Dr. Tenny Thomas, said in a statement. “We look forward to working collaboratively with the panel. Their valuable community input is vital as we plan for the future of the Noreen Stonor Drexel Birthing Center.” 
Searles said the panel will not have a chairperson.
The birthing center opened in 1995 and was named in honor of Newport philanthropist Noreen Stonor Drexel in 2003. Drexel, who passed away in 2012, made improving health care and education a primary focus of her work. The birthing center’s work supporting and educating new breastfeeding mothers earned it a “Baby Friendly” designation from the World Health Organization and UNICEF in 2004, when it became the 40th U.S. hospital to earn that distinction.
The birthing center recorded a total of 479 births in 2024, according to Rhode Island Department of Health data. Women and Infants Hospital in Providence had 8,229 births.
South County Hospital in South Kingstown had 729 births while Kent County Memorial Hospital in Warwick had 450 and Landmark Medical Center in Woonsocket had 432.

(Photo by Jacob Orledge/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota Ethics Commission member Murray Sagsveen no longer has the support to continue serving beyond his expired term, Gov. Kelly Armstrong argued Wednesday.
The governor and two other members of the Ethics Commission Selection Committee remained at a stalemate over reappointing Sagsveen, a Bismarck attorney.
Sagsveen’s term ended Aug. 31, but he has continued serving until the position is filled. Armstrong argued that a lack of consensus from the committee means Sagsveen can no longer serve. He said he plans to send Sagsveen a letter at 5 p.m. Wednesday outlining his position.
“It is by our discretion and our discretion alone,” Armstrong said. “He no longer has that consensus.”
Vacancies to the Ethics Commission are filled by a consensus vote of the governor and the Senate majority and minority leaders, according to the constitutional amendment that created the agency. The selection committee has now met four times without coming to an agreement about reappointing Sagsveen. Armstrong, who has argued that a “reset” is needed on the commission, said Wednesday it is “untenable” for Sagsveen to continue serving.
While the selection committee met in the governor’s conference room, the Ethics Commission held its monthly meeting at the Capitol. Ethics Commission Executive Director Rebecca Binstock said during the meeting that the commission has always operated under the policy of commissioners serving until they’re replaced.
“That has been a longstanding policy of the commission,” Binstock said. “Early on, it was included in the code of ethics that ensured that commissioners knew they were subject to that.”

Binstock said that forcing commissioners to step down after their terms end could leave the commission in a situation where they can’t meet quorum.
Armstrong disagrees with that stance. 
“How long is the wrong question. Under what authority is the right question. It’s not until his replacement is picked. It is by consensus of this group,” Armstrong said. “Only we by consensus can agree Mr. Sagsveen’s service past his expired term is necessary for the commission to carry out its essential work.”
Senate Majority Leader David Hogue and Senate Minority Leader Kathy Hogan have advocated for keeping Sagsveen on to promote continuity.
Hogue, R-Minot, who has called Sagsveen his “top pick” among other finalists, said he was sympathetic to the governor’s position and agreed an appointee should not be able to serve permanently after their term has expired. Hogan, D-Fargo, said she would be gathering additional legal opinions on the subject. 
Also Wednesday, the selection committee appointed Fargo attorney Mark Western to a position on the Ethics Commission.
Western will fill the remainder of the term set to expire next summer that was vacated by the death of former Ethics Commission Chair Dave Anderson. 
“I would hope that we could reappoint him next summer,” Hogue said. 
Previously the selection committee appointed Pam Sharp, former director of the Office of Management and Budget, to another opening on the commission.

Gov. Phil Scott’s administration has signed leases for an additional 22,000 square feet of privately owned office space in Waterbury as it prepares for the governor’s controversial return to office mandate to take effect starting Dec. 1.
The state inked three agreements Monday for offices on Pilgrim Park Road, which is near the southern end of downtown Waterbury. The buildings are a short distance from the Waterbury State Office Complex, which sits on the other side of South Main Street.
Monday’s leases include about 4,260 square feet on the first floor of 5 Pilgrim Park Road, 12,000 square feet on the second floor of 5 Pilgrim Park Road and 5,400 square feet on the second floor of 93 Pilgrim Park Road, according to the agreements, which were provided to VTDigger. All three office spaces are for the Vermont Agency of Human Services, according to the leases.
The agreements take effect Dec. 1 and run through November 2030. The state is set to pay about $430,000 for all three office spaces over its first year renting them.

“If you are planning to travel by plane over the winter holidays and need to renew your REAL ID or obtain one for the first time, we urge you not to wait — go online or visit your local BMV soon,” said Cathie Curtis, deputy secretary of the state for the Bureau of Motor Vehicles. According to the department, more than 70,000 REAL ID driver’s licenses are due for renewal in the next year.
Since the federal government began requiring travelers to present a REAL ID or passport to fly commercially and enter certain federal buildings, Maine BMV offices have seen “record-breaking number of customers,” Curtis said. 
As of Nov. 1, more than 430,000 Mainers had a REAL ID, an increase of 131,000 this year. A REAL ID issued by the State of Maine bears a gold outline of the state with a star in the upper right-hand corner of the card.
Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said the online portal will reduce BMV traffic “helping to open up more availability for in-person services for those who need them and reducing wait times at branches.”
Residents using online renewal cannot change any information on their current license or ID card and will need their social security number and a valid credit card to complete the transaction in the online portal.
Initiated as a security measure in the wake of 9/11, REAL IDs allow for some information sharing between states. Before their implementation, critics raised concern about personal privacy and potential for data breaches. 
Having a REAL ID is optional and a standard Maine ID is valid for all in-state purposes.

The ruling came after the North Carolina Assisted Living Association and dozens of companies challenged the 8% cut to Medicaid rates for personal care services in administrative court. 
Personal care services involve feeding people, helping them walk, bathe, and use the bathroom. 
In affidavits, adult care home operators said that they had cut non-essential staff, switched to lower quality, less expensive food vendors, and even trained maintenance staff to provide direct care.  Some administrators added direct care work to their duties. 
Operators said that if the cuts continued, they would have to close or stop accepting people who are insured with Medicaid. 
Administrative Law Judge John C. Evans on Nov. 7 ordered the state to pay adult care homes the full Medicaid rate for personal care services. The order blocking the rate cut is meant to preserve the status quo until a decision on the assisted living companies’ petition for a preliminary injunction is decided. The order expires on Nov. 24, unless a court extends it. The case was assigned to a mediator. 
The assisted living association is the second group to successfully avoid Medicaid rate cuts suspended, at least temporarily, since the state Department of Health and Human Services imposed them on Oct. 1. Providers of autism therapy won relief from a 10% rate cut in Wake Superior Court last week. 
NCDHHS reduced provider rates because it said the state legislature did not provide enough money to cover Medicaid expenses for the entire fiscal year. A dispute between Republicans in the state House and Senate prevented legislative approval of additional funds. 
Leading Republicans have since united in their criticisms of Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, calling the rate cuts premature. Republicans claim Medicaid has enough money to pay its bills into next year while waiting for additional funds to be approved.
In their petition, lawyers for the adult care homes maintained that the rate cut violates state and federal law. DHHS does not have the authority to reduce the Medicaid personal care service rates set in state law, the complaint said. Moreover, Medicaid rates can’t be cut unless the federal government approves, the complaint said.
State lawyers representing NCDHHS said in their written response to the complaint that the agency did not violate state law or federal regulations. Adult care operators’ statements about harms did not show they were immediate or irreparable, or that they were caused by the rate cuts, the state lawyers wrote. 
The judge’s decision underscores the need for the legislature to appropriate additional funds to Medicaid, NCDHHS said in a statement this week. 
“Any reinstatement or reversal of the provider cuts without additional funding from the General Assembly means the program will run out of funding sooner, putting the entire state Medicaid system at risk,” the NCDHHS statement said. 
If the legislature fully funds Medicaid, the agency said, “the Department will reevaluate all cuts and take action to reverse or modify cuts to ensure NC Medicaid can operate within the appropriated budget.   
“We understand these provider rate cuts are devastating to people, providers and communities that rely on NC Medicaid,” the statement continued. “NCDHHS did not want to take this extremely difficult step of making these significant reductions for NC Medicaid services. However without additional funding from the General Assembly, it was unavoidable.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/justice-scales-gavel_GettyImages-1536x1010-1-1024x673.jpeg,,,2025-11-19 12:57:33.699844

The move came at the request of the D.C. National Guard and was authorized by Indiana Gov. Mike Braun, according to a news release.
“Hoosiers are proud of our Guardsmen, who are well-trained and fully prepared for this mission,” Braun said. “We are grateful for their service and support in our nation’s capital.”
The deployment is part of a federal mission — under the command of the D.C. National Guard — which is supporting efforts by civilian agencies and local law enforcement to reduce crime and minimize property damage in the district. Indiana members will replace soldiers and airmen from other states who have been mobilized since August.
“National Guard soldiers and airmen are uniquely qualified to help in these types of situations. Our Hoosier Guardsmen regularly prepare, train and work side-by-side with civilian first responders, and our Guardsmen are ready for this mission as well,” said Maj. Gen. Larry Muennich, the Indiana National Guard’s adjutant general.
Members will train at Camp Atterbury prior to departure in early December. Additional training will be provided by the D.C. National Guard when Hoosier troops arrive.
Most hail from units based in Bloomington and Gary, home to field artillery and engineer battalions.

(Dean Hanson/Albuquerque Journal)New Mexico’s youth repeatedly return to juvenile jails in large part because of a lack of prevention programs and gaps in behavioral health services, according to a new Legislative Finance Committee report.
The committee presented its findings to state lawmakers Tuesday afternoon and warned that secure facilities operated by the state Children, Youth and Families Department have seen increases in detained kids since hitting a low-point in fiscal year 2021. Staffing challenges have compounded those increases and led some county juvenile jails to turn away children who face charges, while portions of CYFD facilities with beds and cells sit empty due to inadequate staffing.
Juvenile justice issues are acutely felt in New Mexico, which often ranks 50th for overall child well-being in the national Annie E. Casey Foundation’s Kids Count report. In fact, New Mexico’s children face disproportionately high risks of becoming involved with the criminal justice system because they experience outsized rates of adverse childhood experiences like gang involvement, physical abuse and household substance abuse, according to the LFC report.
The report, which primarily focused on CYFD facilities where children are sentenced after courts adjudicate their criminal cases, attributes the rise in incarceration to CYFD officials increasingly overriding the results of their risk-assessment tests to detain “low-risk” children, as well as to an increase in charges of battery, fighting, carrying a deadly weapon on school property and cannabis possession in restricted areas.
“Most juvenile justice referrals are for misdemeanors, rather than for felonies,” Guillermo Caraveo, an LFC program evaluator who co-presented the report to state lawmakers, said on Tuesday. “New Mexico has not redirected funds to build a system of preventative and treatment services for youth,” which results in those children returning to the justice system.
When CYFD diverts children from incarceration, the report says the agency doesn’t track the   “specific services, sanctions, or alternatives” the youth receive. Once those children and teenagers are released, they often encounter a lack of mental health resources across the state.
And detention comes with a steep price tag: $345,000 annually to detain a child in one of CYFD’s secure facilities, the report said. By comparison, the annual cost of community supervision by a juvenile probation officer runs less than $15,000 per child and the annual cost of delinquency prevention programs is $836 per child, the report said.
“We can graduate a kid from Harvard for the same amount of money that it takes us to pay for one juvenile for one year in our facility,” Rep. Mark Duncan (R-Kirtland) said at Tuesday’s hearing. “I’m trying to wrap my mind around that. We definitely need to get these kids before they have to go to these facilities.”
The state spends six times more on these facilities than it spends on “multisystemic therapy treatments” — treatments focused on kids with antisocial behavior that involves their families, friends and schools — and the state spends less on this therapy than it did a decade ago, according to the report. 
“New Mexico’s gaps in available behavioral health and treatment services have worsened,” it said. “In essence, New Mexico is diverting low-risk youth away from the juvenile justice system, but the state lacks an adequate system of community services to send youth to.”
In 2022, state lawmakers set aside $20 million for the New Mexico Health Care Authority to build the infrastructure for Medicaid-eligible behavioral health services for kids across the state. CYFD used that money for non-Medicaid-eligible services that weren’t in line with national best practices according to Tuesday’s report, which accused the child welfare agency of lacking “an action plan for addressing the state’s service gaps.”
The LFC report recommends the Legislature prioritize delinquency prevention and therapeutic programs and amend state law to require CYFD to validate its risk-assessment tools for pre-trial detention once every three years, at a minimum, beginning in 2026.



 The Legislative Finance Committee’s “policy spotlight” report on juvenile justice, presented Tuesday, also recommended that CYFD: 


create a publicly accessible plan to increase the state’s capacity for “front-end” services, including evidence-based behavioral health and treatment services;
reduce staffers’ ability to override the department’s risk-assessment tools;
prioritize staffing its juvenile facilities by reducing spending on overtime and reducing funds spent on Family Services Division employees when facing capacity constraints;
track data on which services or alternatives youth are diverted toward by juvenile probation officers;
track the number of operational beds and staffers in juvenile facilities;
annually project the average daily population at secure facilities.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CYFD-1024x522.jpeg,,,2025-11-19 12:00:08.020085

Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) speaks at a June 6, 2025 town hall in Lansing. | Kyle DavidsonIn recent weeks, U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin has led the call to curb President Donald Trump’s executive powers, with one of her Michigan colleagues echoing that cry after voting to release the Epstein files. 
U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) on Tuesday joined Slotkin, a fellow Democrat from Holly, in calling for an end to the presidential pardon, with Stevens criticizing the president for weighing a pardon of Ghislaine Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for enabling sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein in sexually exploiting more than 250 underage girls.
“It is ridiculous that presidents of both parties have the authority to excuse the most heinous crimes.” Stevens said in a statement on Tuesday. “We’ve seen Donald Trump abuse his power again and again, and now he could pardon a person who helped run a child sex trafficking ring with Jeffrey Epstein along with the other pedophiles Epstein helped enable.”
In a video shared to social media earlier this week, Slotkin explained her reasoning for supporting a ban on the presidential pardon.
“I don’t think it makes sense in the modern world,” Slotkin said.

She pointed to Trump’s decision to pardon Changpeng Zhao, who founded the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. The company helped to create the code for the type of crypto offered by the Trump family’s crypto currency company, World Liberty Financial. In May, a state-owned investment firm in the United Arab Emirates used World Liberty Financial cryptocurrency to make a $2 billion investment in Binance, with a Bloomberg report noting the deal could transfer millions of dollars to the Trump family annually from interest bearing assets.
“It just brings up this real whiff of pay to play, that if you invest in the President’s ventures, you’re going to get yourself a presidential pardon,” Slotkin said. “That’s why I think we should just get rid of the presidential pardon. I didn’t like it when Democrats did it. I don’t like it when Republicans do it, it’s something that we should get rid of. It just does not work in a modern day democracy.”
‘I’m popping a flare’: Slotkin says Trump is using ‘same playbook as every authoritarian in history’

On Nov. 9, Trump issued a pardon for 16 individuals accused of participating in a scheme to certify Michigan’s electoral votes for Trump in the 2020 election, which he lost. Charges against 15 individuals were dismissed in September, while a 16th had reached a cooperation agreement with the Michigan attorney general’s office earlier in the case. In exchange his charges were dropped. 
Meanwhile, Slotkin and five of her Democratic colleagues in both the House and Senate earlier this week called on members of the military and intelligence agencies to refuse illegal orders from the Trump Administration.
Slotkin has also introduced legislation alongside Sens. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) to place limits on the president’s ability to deploy the National Guard into American communities. 
“The U.S. military should always remain apolitical and should never be used as a domestic police force on our streets at the whims of a President,” Slotkin said in a statement about the bill. “This legislation ensures that no president, Democrat or Republican, can turn our soldiers against our citizens by seeking to restore checks and balances in these domestic deployments.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC_1591-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-19 12:00:08.020085

Connecticut utility regulators voted to block the sale of the Aquarion Water Company to a quasi-public entity on Wednesday, following months of criticism from opponents who said the deal threatened to raise water rates for nearly 250,000 customers.
The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority voted 4-0, denying the utility’s sale to the South Central Regional Water Authority. PURA’s decision cited concerns with the proposed structure of a newly created entity to oversee Aquarion and its ability to meet its “managerial responsibility” to customers.
Eversource, Aquarion’s owner, announced its plans to sell the water company to RWA in January as part of a deal worth $2.4 billion. The transaction involved $1.6 billion in cash and $800 million in debt.
The sale would have created a new quasi-public entity, the Aquarion Water Authority, with rates controlled by a board made up of members from each of the towns served by water utility.
Critics of the deal, however, argued that it would remove PURA’s oversight of the state’s largest water utility, which could lead to escalating costs for consumers. Under state law, PURA only approves rates for investor-owned utilities, not those that are publicly owned.
Utility officials projected that Aquarion’s customers would see annual rate increases of between 6.5% and 8.35% over the next decade under the new quasi-public authority, according to filings submitted to PURA.
“This deal was a costly loser for Connecticut families and PURA was right to reject it,” Attorney General William Tong said in a statement Wednesday. “Eversource desperately wanted to offload Aquarion, and they concocted this maneuver to extract as much cash as possible by guaranteeing the new entity free reign to jack up rates. Eversource is free to find a new buyer, but should understand that any new attempt to end public regulatory oversight over water bills for hundreds of thousands of Connecticut families is going to be a non-starter here.”
In a statement following Wednesday’s vote, Eversource spokewoman Jamie Ratliff lamented the failure of the deal after lawmakers pushed through controversial legislation last year allowing the RWA to pursue a bid to purchase Aquarion. 
“The special act approved by legislators in 2024 indicated that the state was interested in an expanded non-profit model,” Ratliff said. “However, once tested, that same special act proved difficult to overcome for PURA to move away from an investor-owned model.”
A spokesman for the RWA said the authority is reviewing PURA’s decision.
Backlash to the proposed deal came from many corners, including consumer advocates, state lawmakers, environmental groups such as Save the Sound and local officials, who raised concerns about the loss of future tax revenues. (Nonprofits and public entities are generally exempt from paying property taxes in Connecticut.)
In 2024, Aquarion paid a total of $19.4 million in local property taxes in Connecticut, according to Ratliff. As part of the proposed sale, the applicants had agreed to pay no less than that amount through a payment in lieu of taxes, or PILOT, agreement.
In its final decision on the proposed sale, PURA cited no concerns with the new authority’s finances or technical ability to provide “safe, adequate and reliable” service to customers. Instead, it was concerns about the structure of the authority itself, and the loss of outside oversight, that led regulators to block the sale. 
“This was the result of an imperfect process, it’s an imperfect product and an imperfect governance structure,” said Commissioner Holly Cheeseman, who is one of three new members of PURA’s board appointed by Gov. Ned Lamont last month.
“We can’t go back,” she added. “We can only rule on the application before us.” 
The other PURA members who voted to block the sale were Vice Chair David Arconti, Commissioner Michael Caron and Commissioner Janice Beecher.  The newly appointed chair of PURA, Thomas Wiehl, did not participate in Wednesday’s vote due to his prior involvement in reviewing the deal as an attorney for the Office of Consumer Counsel.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/saugatuck.jpg,,,2025-11-19 12:00:08.020085

(Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)MANHATTAN — Kansas organizations took part in a first-in-the-world project designed to move silt out of Tuttle Creek Lake in an effort to change projections showing the lake will be 75% full of silt by 2074.
The collaborative study, a project of the Kansas Water Office and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, plans to remove silt from the lake by using water injection dredging, which will shift silt out of the lake into the Big Blue River, said John Shelley, associate research professor at the University of Kansas, at last week’s Governor’s Conference on the Future of Water.
“​​Before the dam was built, there was about 5.3 million tons of sediment per year washing down the Big Blue River, and 5.3 million tons of sediment per year washing out of the Big Blue River,” Shelley said. “But then we built the dam and it causes this large lake, which results in 98% of the sediment being trapped in the lake. Instead of 5.3 million that used to go out, now we have about 107,000 tons of sediment per year that leave the lake.”
To put it in perspective, Shelley said to imagine taking a 1/50th slice of a jelly bean in a liter of water. That’s how much silt currently leaves Tuttle Creek Lake.
Although water injection dredging isn’t a new process, it has never been used in a lake, Shelley said.
Four basic strategies are used for managing sediment, he said: reducing the sediment coming in, redistributing sediment within the lake, routing sediment around or through the lake before it deposits, and removing it after it has deposited.
Water injection dredging is done by pumping clear water from a 120-foot barge to the bottom of the lake. Because muddy water that is stirred up is denser than the clean water, the muddy water “plunges” to the bottom of the lake and moves laterally, Shelley said.
Such a process happens naturally in some lakes and is called a density current, he said.
“The whole idea of water injection dredging is: Let’s induce a density current but do it closer to the dam so that then it can travel, and it’s close enough that it’ll travel to the dam and can be discharged downstream,” Shelley said.
The project has been in the works for several years, with preliminary work being done to test the sediment, consider what pattern the dredge should move across the lake, and consider how the Big Blue River, which the sediment is flushed to, will be affected.
This year, the project received $7.1 million in a federal grant and $2 million from the state to do the demonstration project, which began Sept. 27, Shelley said. A dredge moved in a predetermined pattern across Tuttle Creek Lake for 10 days, with 20 hours each day of active dredging. The project calls for two more 10-day dredgings to occur in the spring and summer.
Keith Gido, a Kansas State University professor, joined the project because of his expertise as a river ecologist. He and other researchers are collecting samples along the Big Blue River to measure any effects the dredging operation is having downstream.
“The dredging worked, so it moved these sediments down through the dam, and that increased the turbidity in the water, so there was a bunch of suspended sediment in the water,” he said. “As the water levels dropped, those sediments are deposited.”
Most of the sediment dropped to the river bottom but some was deposited on the shore, he said. Although many of the water samples Gido’s team took still require analysis, he said they were looking for specific issues.
“One of the things that we were concerned about was that sometimes when you have a lot of suspended sediments in the water, the oxygen concentrations will decline because there’s a lot of organic matter that’s decomposing and using up oxygen,” he said.
Lakes across the state are losing percentages of their main pools of water because silt is filling them in. This graphic, shared at a recent Kansas Governor’s Conference on the Future of Water by John Shelley, who is working on a dredging demonstration project, shows how silt is affecting lakes across the state. (Submitted: John Shelley)
Although there was a small drop in oxygen levels, Gido said, it was not near a critical value that might cause fish to die or other serious issues. When there are major storms, it’s normal for sediment to be stirred up.
“What happened was within the bounds of what we expect based on natural variability that we’ve seen due to rainstorm events and such,” he said.
Another concern was the release of sulfur oxides that make the river smell “a little funky,” Gido said. A Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks technician told Gido that when the dredging was occurring, fishermen who were below the dam moved downstream to get away from the smell and the mud being released, but quickly moved back when it settled.
The project team, which consisted of 12 different organizations and research labs, set constraints — such as concentration limits and water quality — and determined the point where they would have stopped dredging or released more water for dilution, Shelley said. There was robust monitoring both at the lake and along the river during the dredging.
Downstream deposits on the shore of the river may be new to people who live near its banks, but it’s something that commonly happens on the Kansas River, Gido said.
If Tuttle Creek continues to lose more of its water area to silt, that would eventually cause downstream problems, too, he noted.
“A major reason the dam was built was for flood control,” Gido said. “The ability of that reservoir to control flooding is a function of how much capacity it has, right? It’s lost half of its capacity to hold water, and if it loses more, then it’s going to really compromise its ability to trap water and reduce flooding.”
Researchers will continue to assess the effects of dredging on the lake and downstream in different seasons with the upcoming 10-day sessions.
“The main point of this project — it’s not to dredge a certain volume of sediment or lower the bed level to a certain elevation,” Shelley said. “It’s really to answer questions.”
The questions are varied and include how much sediment can be moved out of the lake using water injection dredging, how much it will cost to move per cubic yard, and what are downstream impacts. The barge also moved at different speeds and patterns, so they will analyze those factors to determine what is most effective, Shelley said.
If this project can answer questions so a long-term plan could be made, then it would be successful, he said. The eventual goal would be to maintain the lake where it currently is by being able to remove the same amount of silt as comes into the lake each year.
Data is being processed and analyzed, and a webinar will be held in January to share the results of the first dredging operation, Shelley said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/PB120537-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-19 12:00:08.020085

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — University of Nebraska regents are weighing in after the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Faculty Senate, in an historic vote, expressed “no confidence” in their chancellor.
UNL Chancellor Rodney Bennett came to the university in July 2023 for an initial three-year contract, which would expire June 30, unless extended. He is currently leading a plan to cut $27.5 million from UNL’s budget.

NU Regent Kathy Wilmot of Beaver City, who represents a sprawling 45-county district in western Nebraska, said in a statement Wednesday that she “fully” supports Bennett and his budget actions.
She said his decisions consider available resources and are informed by institutional data meant “to protect the future of UNL.”
Wilmot said she understands people’s lives and careers will be changed by the cuts. But she cautioned that UNL continuing to dip into budget reserves has contributed to current problems. She joined the regents in 2023 and has frequently focused attention on taxpayers before board votes.
“It is understandable individuals have internalized the pain felt by the proposed cuts,” Wilmot said in an email. “However, personal attacks are harmful to the university that we all love. I fully support Doctor Bennett and his efforts to ensure the fiscal viability and future of UNL.”
Budget problem ‘hasn’t changed’
The UNL Faculty Senate voted 60-14 on Tuesday to express “no confidence” in Bennett’s performance and ask that the eight elected regents and NU President Jeffrey Gold consider firing Bennett or negotiating his removal. It was the first such resolution to pass in UNL’s nearly 157-year history.

Reached just after the Faculty Senate vote on Tuesday, Regent Paul Kenney of Amherst, chair of the NU Board of Regents, said he knew faculty were discussing a no-confidence vote, and “what they do is 100% their opinion.”
Kenney said he doesn’t think the rebuke of Bennett changes how he’ll approach budget-related votes come Dec. 5, when regents will consider $6.74 million in Bennett-proposed academic program eliminations
“We were short a lot of money to start with,” Kenney said. “That hasn’t changed.”
A spokesperson for Dr. Gold and the NU system on Tuesday said faculty-shared governance is “one of many voices” in higher education and that NU values their input at UNL.
“However, ultimate decisions rest with the Board of Regents,” the spokesperson said in a statement.
Regent Tim Clare of Lincoln declined to comment Tuesday. The five other elected regents did not respond to Examiner calls seeking comment.
The Examiner on Wednesday also reached out to Pillen, UNL Student Regent Libby Wilkins and the UNL Staff Senate. Student representatives on the NU Board of Regents can cast nonbinding votes on board action. Faculty serve in advisory roles but their representatives cannot cast symbolic votes. Staff have no role in regents meetings.
Bennett desired contract extension
When Bennett was hired in 2023, regents made no comments on his hiring at that summer meeting. He became UNL’s 21st chancellor and is the first person of color to lead UNL.
UNL faculty overwhelmingly pass historic ‘no confidence’ vote against chancellor

Bennett, in October, told the Examiner he had “no idea” if or when a vote extending his contract might come.
“But I sure hope it comes quickly, because I love being here, love being a part of the community, and clearly we have important work yet to do,” Bennett said Oct. 5.
That same day, Gold said he favored extending Bennett’s contract but said it was up to the regents. Gold previously served as chancellor of the University of Medical Center for 10 years, a campus that will likely soon merge with UNL for accreditation and research reporting purposes as UNL continues to seek readmittance to the prestigious Association of American Universities.
It’s unclear if the merger would bring other changes to NU. For example, UNMC has been led by an interim chancellor since Gold became president in July 2024. The two campuses are also led by the same business and finance leader, Anne Barnes, who concurrently is a member of Gold’s cabinet.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Reliable and affordable energy is what keeps our country running. It fuels businesses, supports families, and gives communities the foundation to grow.
Nowhere is that clearer than in South Carolina, where record population growth and major industrial expansion are pushing electricity demand to unprecedented levels.
Yet many projects that could expand supply and strengthen the grid are stuck waiting on approvals that take years to complete.
These delays stem largely from federal reviews that move far slower than the needs of fast-growing states like South Carolina.
The longer they wait, the higher costs climb for everyone.
The issue is not a lack of investment or ingenuity. South Carolina has become a national magnet for advanced manufacturing, electric vehicle production, aerospace suppliers, and next-generation logistics.
BMW’s continued growth in Spartanburg, Bosch’s battery component expansion, new industrial parks in Greer, Gaffney, and Laurens County, and a wave of suppliers serving Siemens and GE Vernova all depend on a modern, reliable grid.
But the bureaucratic process that governs the infrastructure needed to power these projects, transmission lines, substation upgrades, and grid interconnections moves too slowly and has become overly complex.
Developers often face overlapping reviews, shifting requirements, and legal challenges that can drag on for years.
The 732-mile TransWest Express transmission line from Wyoming to Nevada, for example, took nearly 18 years just to secure permits before breaking ground.
Duke Energy shuffles costs to make proposed Carolinas merger more attractive to SC

To support BMW expansions, battery component suppliers, and new industrial development corridors along the Interstate 85 spine, Duke Energy needs timely approvals for new substations, high-voltage transmission lines, and large-scale grid upgrades that often take longer to permit than to construct.
When these projects stall, reliability and affordability for families and businesses are put at risk.
When projects take too long to build, communities lose out on affordable power, new jobs, and private investment.
According to the global consulting firm McKinsey & Company, as much as $1.5 trillion in infrastructure investment nationwide is tied up in the federal permitting process. A meaningful share of that investment is aimed at fast-growing states like South Carolina — if the infrastructure can actually be built.
Permitting reform is about restoring common sense. It means keeping environmental standards strong while making the approval process clear, efficient, and predictable.
The goal is not to cut corners, but to cut confusion.
That can be done by establishing firm timelines so projects can move from proposal to construction without endless waiting; designating a single coordinating agency to avoid duplicative reviews; prioritizing high-impact projects such as Upstate transmission upgrades; and creating a clear judicial review process so infrastructure that meets every requirement is not stuck in court for years.
Streamlining the process would save time and money without weakening safeguards. Federal reforms are especially important because many transmission projects require approvals from
multiple federal agencies before South Carolina utilities can even begin construction.
Today, a routine transmission line needed to power a new industrial supplier in Spartanburg County can take years longer to approve than to build. Substation upgrades serving fast-growing communities around Greer, Powdersville, and the western Upstate must often navigate multilayered reviews that move more slowly than the growth they are intended to support.
With targeted reforms, builders could move forward with confidence, and communities would benefit from lower costs and greater reliability as new energy sources and delivery systems come online sooner.
Permitting reform also strengthens America’s energy independence, and South Carolina’s competitiveness.
Much of the region’s electric grid is operating with equipment deep into the second half of its lifespan, even as demand accelerates. Federal energy analyses show that the United States will need to double the size of its electric grid by mid-century to support artificial intelligence, manufacturing, electric vehicles, and population growth, all trends already reshaping South Carolina.
When infrastructure can be built faster, energy becomes more affordable and more secure. Local industries, from battery manufacturing in the Midlands to aerospace and advanced-materials
suppliers across the Upstate, can expand with confidence.
And new employers deciding where to invest will see a state prepared for continued growth, not constrained by outdated processes.
Modernizing how projects are approved is not a partisan issue. It is a practical step toward a stronger economy and a more resilient energy system. Families deserve affordable electricity and
reliable service, and they deserve a government that helps make that possible.
The time to act is now. Modernizing the federal permitting process will lower costs, strengthen reliability, and keep energy affordable for every family and business in South Carolina.
Cutting red tape is not just good policy. It is essential to keeping our state’s momentum moving forward.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/transmission-lines-closeup-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-19 10:57:13.020262

The governing board of Proud To Partner Leadership Academy didn’t consider any plans for improvement during its meeting Tuesday night, though the Statewide Charter School Board demanded such a plan by Nov. 26. 
“There’s nothing to fix,” said Sharri Coleman, board chairperson for the academy.
The statewide board dropped the charter school to probation, one step away from closure, last week over concerns of weak finances, poor organization and low academic quality, all of which the school’s leaders dispute.

Chief among state officials’ concerns was a report that Proud To Partner Leadership Academy, known as PTPLA, had only one teacher on its payroll. The school now has more than 100 students enrolled after starting the school year with 56.
Statewide board staff said they observed a “profound lack of student instruction, supervision and engagement” during three school visits in recent weeks.
PTPLA Superintendent Dawn Bowles said she refused to allow a state official to make a fourth visit after the probation vote. She said she denied entry to the school because her students are “emotionally scarred” from the visits and from the recent media attention.
Bowles said the school laid off three teachers after low enrollment caused budget constraints. Those three teachers continued working full time without pay while another remained on payroll, she said in a 45-minute presentation refuting state officials’ allegations. 
“When I spoke with each of them about the budget cuts that had to be made, they each said, ‘I’m not going anywhere, Ms. Bowles. It doesn’t matter if I’m getting paid or not. I’m here,’” she said of the teachers.
Bowles noted three other paid staff — the school counselor, a dean of leadership and herself — also hold teaching certifications.

PTPLA’s board voted Tuesday to rehire the three laid-off teachers on part-time status, though they’ll continue working full time. Bowles said she expects they will return to full pay when more state funding arrives in January. 
The board also approved an adjusted budget for the 2025-26 school year without sharing any details.
Bowles acknowledged some of the state officials’ complaints were true. PTPLA missed two deadlines to file financial reports with the state this year and had to pay fines, she said. 
The school also finished the 2025 fiscal year with a $274,222 deficit, which she said is “not supposed to happen.” A $400,000 grant from the Walton Personal Philanthropy Group later lifted PTPLA out of debt, Bowles said.
The statewide board’s director of school performance, Skyler Lusnia, gave a brief presentation of the deficiencies Tuesday night before receiving several pointed questions from PTPLA’s board. 
“What our concern is, is the totality of it all,” Lusnia told the board. “There are multiple concerns, and if it was just one thing, we would have never gotten to this point.”

The board members dismissed Lusnia after their chairperson, Coleman, repeated their three requests: That the statewide board review information and documents from PTPLA, publicly apologize and immediately remove the school from probation. 
Coleman said Lusnia had presented “incorrect” information that led to PTPLA’s demotion.
The fact that school leaders met Tuesday without establishing an improvement plan “does raise concerns,” said Brian Shellem, chairperson of the statewide board. He said the Nov. 26 deadline to produce a plan still stands.
“We’re going to give them the benefit of the doubt that they will provide us the plan,” Shellem said after observing the PTPLA board meeting. “If the corrective actions have already been made, even prior to our board meeting, great. Just show us what that is in writing. Provide us the documentation that all the kids were being taught. Wonderful. We’ll look forward to any and all evidence of what it is that’s being done.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-19 15:23:59+00:00,CT Mirror,"ICE courthouse arrests meet resistance from CT, other Democratic states",Jonathan Shorman | Stateline,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/19/ct-ice-courthouse-arrests-resistance/,"Officials worry raids risk keeping people from testifying in trials, fighting evictions or seeking restraining orders against domestic abusers.","A day after President Donald Trump took office, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued a new directive to its agents: Arrests at courthouses, restricted under the Biden administration, were again permissible.
In Connecticut, a group of observers who keep watch on ICE activity in and around Stamford Superior Court have since witnessed a series of arrests. In one high-profile case in August, federal agents pursued two men into a bathroom.
“Is it an activity you want to be interfering with, people fulfilling their duty when they’re called to court and going to court? For me, it’s insanity,” said David Michel, a Democratic former state representative in Connecticut who helps observe courthouse activity.
Fueled by the Stamford uproar, Connecticut lawmakers last week approved restrictions on civil arrests and mask-wearing by federal law enforcement at state courthouses. And on Monday, a federal judge tossed a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Department of Justice that had sought to block similar restrictions in New York.
They are the latest examples of a growing number of Democratic states, and some judges, pushing back against ICE arrests in and around state courthouses. State lawmakers and other officials worry the raids risk keeping people from testifying in criminal trials, fighting evictions or seeking restraining orders against domestic abusers.
The courthouse arrests mark an intensifying clash between the Trump administration and Democratic states that pits federal authority against state sovereignty. Sitting at the core of the fight are questions about how much power states have to control what happens in their own courts and the physical grounds they sit on.
In Illinois, lawmakers approved a ban on civil immigration arrests at courthouses in October. In Rhode Island, lawmakers plan to again push for a ban after an earlier measure didn’t advance in March. Connecticut lawmakers were codifying limits imposed by the state Supreme Court chief justice in September. Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont is expected to sign the bill.
States that are clamping down on ICE continue to allow the agency to make criminal arrests, as opposed to noncriminal civil arrests. Many people arrested and subsequently deported are taken on noncriminal, administrative warrants. As of Sept. 21, 71.5% of ICE detainees had no criminal convictions, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data research organization.
Some states, such as New York, already have limits on immigration enforcement in courthouses that date back to the first Trump administration, when ICE agents also engaged in courthouse arrests. New York’s Protect Our Courts Act, in place since 2020, prohibits civil arrests of people at state and local courthouses without a judicial warrant. The law also applies to people traveling to and from court, extending protections beyond courthouse grounds.
“One of the cornerstones of our democracy is open access to the courts. When that access is denied or chilled, all of us are made less safe and less free,” said Oren Sellstrom, litigation director at Lawyers for Civil Rights, a Boston-based group that works to provide legal support to immigrants, people of color and low-income individuals.
But in addition to challenging the New York law, the Justice Department is prosecuting a Wisconsin state judge, alleging she illegally helped a migrant avoid ICE agents.
“We aren’t some medieval kingdom; there are no legal sanctuaries where you can hide and avoid the consequences for breaking the law,” U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to Stateline. “Nothing in the constitution prohibits arresting a lawbreaker where you find them.”
Some Republican lawmakers oppose efforts to limit ICE arrests in and near courthouses, arguing state officials should stay out of the way of federal law enforcement. The Ohio Senate in June passed a bill that would prohibit public officials from interfering in immigration arrests or prohibiting cooperation with ICE; the move came after judges in Franklin County, which includes Columbus, imposed restrictions on civil arrests in courthouses.
“The United States is a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of law and order. To have a civilized society, laws must be respected, this includes immigration laws,” Ohio Republican state Sen. Kristina Roegner, the bill’s sponsor, said in a news release at the time.
Roegner didn’t respond to Stateline’s interview request. The legislation remains in a House committee.
Knowing where a target will be
Courthouses offer an attractive location for ICE to make immigration arrests, according to both ICE and advocates for migrants.
Court records and hearing schedules often indicate who is expected in the building on any given day. Administrative warrants don’t allow ICE to enter private homes without permission, but the same protections don’t apply in public areas, such as courthouses. And many people have a strong incentive to show up for court, knowing that warrants can potentially be issued for their arrest if they don’t.
“So in some respects, it’s easy pickings,” said Steven Brown, executive director of the ACLU of Rhode Island.
In June, ICE arrested Pablo Grave de la Cruz at Rhode Island Traffic Tribunal in Cranston. A 36-year-old Rhode Island resident, he had come from Guatemala illegally as a teenager.
“They pulled up on him like he was a murderer or a rapist,” friend Brittany Donohue told the Rhode Island Current, which chronicled de la Cruz’s case. “He was leaving traffic court.”
An immigration judge has since granted de la Cruz permission to self-deport.
McLaughlin, the Homeland Security assistant secretary, said in her statement that allowing law enforcement to make arrests “of criminal illegal aliens in courthouses is common sense” — conserving law enforcement resources because officers know where a target will be. The department said the practice is safer for officers and the community, noting that individuals have gone through courthouse security.
Still, ICE’s directive on courthouse arrests sets some limits on the agency’s activity.
Agents “should, to the extent practicable” conduct civil immigration arrests in non-public areas of the courthouse and avoid public entrances. Actions should be taken “discreetly” to minimize disruption to court proceedings, and agents should generally avoid areas wholly dedicated to non-criminal proceedings, such as family court, the directive says.
Crucially, the directive says ICE can conduct civil immigration arrests “where such action is not precluded by laws imposed by the jurisdiction.” In other words, the agency’s guidance directs agents to respect state and local bans on noncriminal arrests.
Trump administration court actions
But the Trump administration has also gone to court to try to overcome state-level restrictions.
The Justice Department sued in June over New York’s Protect Our Courts Act, arguing that it “purposefully shields dangerous aliens” from lawful detention. The department says the law violates the U.S. Constitution’s supremacy clause, under which federal law supersedes state law.
New York Democratic Attorney General Letitia James argued the state law doesn’t conflict with federal law and sought the lawsuit’s dismissal.
U.S. District Court Judge Mae D’Agostino, an appointee of President Barack Obama, on Monday granted James’ motion. The judge wrote that the “entire purpose” of the lawsuit was to allow the federal government to commandeer New York’s resources — such as court schedules and court security screening measures — to aid immigration enforcement, even though states cannot generally be required to help the federal government enforce federal law.
“Compelling New York to allow federal immigration authorities to reap the benefits of the work of state employees is no different than permitting the federal government to commandeer state officials directly in furtherance of federal objectives,” the judge wrote.
The Justice Department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
The department is also prosecuting Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan, who prosecutors allege helped a person living in the country illegally avoid ICE agents in April inside a Milwaukee courthouse by letting him exit a courtroom through a side door. (Agents apprehended the individual near the courthouse.) A federal grand jury indicted Dugan on a count of concealing an individual and a count of obstructing a proceeding.
In court documents, Dugan’s lawyers have called the prosecution “virtually unprecedented and entirely unconstitutional.”
Dugan has pleaded not guilty, and a trial is set for December.
Lawmakers seek ‘order’ in courthouses
Rhode Island Democratic state Sen. Meghan Kallman is championing legislation that would generally ban civil arrests at courthouses. The measure received a hearing, but a legislative committee recommended further study.
Kallman hopes the bill will go further next year. The sense of urgency has intensified, she said, and more people now understand the consequences of what is happening.
“In order to create a system of law that is functioning and that encourages trust, we have to make those [courthouse] spaces safe,” she said.
Back in Connecticut, Democratic state Rep. Steven Stafstrom said his day job as a commercial litigator brings him into courthouses across the state weekly. Based on his conversations with court staff, other lawyers and senior administration within the judicial branch, he said “there’s a genuine fear, not just for safety, but for disruptions of orderly court processes in our courthouses.”
Some Connecticut Republicans have questioned whether a law that only pertains to civil arrests would prove effective. State Rep. Craig Fishbein, the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, noted during floor debate that entering the United States without permission is a criminal offense — a misdemeanor for first-time offenders and a felony for repeat offenders. Because of that, he suggested the measure wouldn’t stop many courthouse arrests.
“The advocates think they’re getting no arrests in courthouses, but they’ve been sold a bill of goods,” he said.
Stafstrom, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, said in response that he believed the legislation protects many people who are in the country illegally because that crime is often not prosecuted.
“All we’re asking is for ICE to recognize the need for order in our courthouses,” Stafstrom said.

It’s part of a $7.4 billion settlement announced by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York on Tuesday.
Connecticut’s settlement money will be used for opioid treatment and prevention, and to give direct support to victims and their families, said Attorney General William Tong.
“But no amount of money and justice will make whole the lives lost and families destroyed by the Sackler Family and Purdue Pharma’s craven pursuit of profit,” Tong said.
Tong is one of 55 attorneys general across the country, including New York, who sued Purdue and the Sackler family for their role in the opioid crisis.
The funds will be distributed over the next 15 years. Connecticut will get a majority of its $64 million share of the multi-billion-dollar settlement over the next eight years.

,California,2025-11-19 15:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,Community Benefits,sponsor,,,,,https://calmatters.org/sponsored/2025/11/community-benefits/,"Across California, communities and developers are coming to the negotiating table in an effort to distribute prosperity. Community Benefits Agreements can help.","Construction of a new stadium or solar farm can spark both alarm and promise for local residents, and for good reasons. Often, communities are sidelined in decision making about these projects, and the benefits of such large-scale developments are not always evenly distributed. 
Historically, when these opportunities arrive, local officials have held public hearings where residents could voice concerns. However, this type of engagement has its drawbacks. It tends to favor vocal residents with the time and resources to attend. Moreover, research shows residents who attend these public hearings are disproportionately project opponents, rather than those who are pushing for more energy infrastructure or housing. And, ultimately, there is no guarantee that local electeds will take community feedback into consideration.Community Benefit Agreements (CBA) have emerged as one way to increase local control over development decisions and ensure that economic and other gains from new infrastructure are more widely shared. 
What is a CBA?
A Community Benefit Agreement is a legally binding contract between a developer and local governments or community groups such as labor unions, neighborhood associations, or environmental advocates. 
In exchange for specific, tangible benefits, such as job training programs, affordable housing units, local hiring guarantees, parks, reduced electricity rates, or direct financial payments, local organizations agree to support a proposed project – or at least not oppose it. In this way, CBAs might be able to help speed up approval processes and accelerate development by navigating potential community opposition.


CBAs to Support Clean Energy Development
As California moves toward its goal of 100% renewable energy by 2045, communities are beginning to see many more wind and solar infrastructure projects — particularly those in the inland and rural counties of the state. As of November 2025, there are 282 planned utility-scale solar projects in California. Their total planned capacity is 59,721 megawatts (MW).
Historically, Community Benefits Agreements have resulted from extensive advocacy and organizing by local community members. However, instead of pushing communities to self-organize for these benefits, California has begun to require clean energy developers to enter into legally-binding agreements with local community organizations in order to benefit from streamlined permitting at the state level. 
CBAs for renewable energy are becoming increasingly prominent in policy and some jurisdictions both in California and other states have institutionalized community benefits: 

Riverside County’s Policy B-29 requires large solar projects to pay approximately $150 per acre.
Imperial County’s Public Benefit Program collects fees from solar projects to issue grants for infrastructure improvements and job creation. 
California’s AB 205 now requires developers seeking state-level permits for large solar and wind facilities to execute a CBA
Michigan’s recent legislation mandates that developers enter Host Community Agreements with minimum payments of $2,000 per megawatt.
New York established a Host Community Benefits program with annual fees per megawatt issued as electric bill credits to residents of municipalities hosting renewable energy projects

Explore our Energy Project Benefits Agreement Database 
The Promise and Challenges of CBAs
The promise of CBAs is that they give communities direct power to negotiate for their needs and preferences. However, it can be unclear who actually represents “the community.” Because CBAs are often negotiated by select community groups, they can lack democratic accountability. And just as the residents attending a public hearing may not be representative of the demographics of a community, with varying and unequal access to economic and political capital, the same could be true of the community groups who participate in negotiating CBAs. 
As a result, some critics view CBAs as essentially allowing developers to “buy off” opposition in order to streamline approvals. The importance of timing in these agreements doesn’t improve optics: offered too early, benefits might feel like bribes; too late, they may seem like unjust compensation for negative impacts. 
In the end, CBAs are private contracts and the details of many agreements stay hidden. As a result, despite many examples of CBAs in and outside California, surprisingly little is known about their actual structure, benefits, and outcomes. Many important questions remain unanswered, including whether CBAs speed up or slow down development. Which communities successfully negotiate CBAs, and which don’t? What happens when negotiations are unsuccessful? Who follows through to ensure commitments are fulfilled?
CBAs are a promising vehicle to address the potential tensions between the need to quickly build more infrastructure and the desire to engage communities in decision-making. Nonetheless, more research is needed to understand their effectiveness in delivering real benefits to communities while enabling progress on housing, energy, and other new development.

His testimony came Nov. 18, 2025, at the Capitol. (Kansas Reflector screen capture from Kansas Legislature video) TOPEKA — The secretary of the Kansas Department of Revenue offered to create within the state agency the job of ombudsman to provide information and guidance — not legal counsel — to Kansans interested in representing themselves in property tax appeal cases.
Secretary Mark Burghart said Tuesday during an interim tax committee meeting of the Kansas Legislature that the objective of the extra employee would be to better prepare individuals interested in contesting county property tax valuations that were heard by the Kansas Board of Tax Appeals.
The idea of an ombudsman was raised in September by Kristen Wheeler, chair of the state tax appeal board, in response to dramatic growth in the board’s caseload.
The concept received a positive response from several legislators, including Sen. Caryn Tyson, a Parker Republican who chairs the interim House and Senate tax committee. She urged Burghart to begin preliminary planning for the hiring of an ombudsman. She suggested the task might be done without the 2026 Legislature adopting a bill specifically granting the revenue department permission.
“It sounds to me like you could actually implement this without statute,” Tyson said. “I think that would be the ideal solution.”
Kansas has more than 2 million individual taxpayers, Burghart said. The Board of Tax Appeals, or BOTA, during the 2024 fiscal year reported an increase of 700 cases on its general appeal docket. There were 300 additional property tax appeals and 300 more appeals related to tax exemptions.
“This position is important. It think it’s needed. It does make sense to me that it live in the Department of Revenue,” said Sen. Craig Bowser, R-Holton. “Why do we have a large number of tax appeals right now? It’s because our taxpayers are surprised with very large, unexpected tax bills. So, they appeal.”
Burghart said the Department of Revenue currently had an individual responsible for general taxpayer advocacy. A person dedicated to property tax affairs should initially be limited to an educational role that involved assisting taxpayers with their understanding property valuation procedures and BOTA’s appellate process. The ombudsman could explain deadlines, required forms, evidentiary expectations and appeal options.
“The creation of this position, initially framed as an educational and navigational resource rather than a legal representative, would be one way to help expedite appeals before BOTA by improving the quality and completeness of taxpayer filings,” Burghart said. “That, in turn, supports the Legislature’s objective of addressing BOTA workforce and caseload concerns.”
“We would make it abundantly clear that we are not giving legal advice,” the revenue secretary said. “The ombudsman would not serve as the legal representative of any taxpayer … and would not advocate for specific valuation outcomes in individual cases.”
Sen. Marci Francisco, D-Lawrence, questioned whether the Department of Revenue could unilaterally initiate an ombudsman program. Burghart said adding a new staff position to the agency could be worked into the budget, which already included personnel assigned duties associated with assisting taxpayers.
“It’s helpful for that to be part of the discussion so that people understand, when we’re talking about new employees, how that happens,” she said.
Burghart said the Legislature had options in terms of shaping the work of an ombudsman or advocate dedicated to property taxation. The person could be informally added to payroll in the Department of Revenue or the individual could be located in a newly created state office founded, which would require passage of a state law.
The ombudsman also could be established as a law school clinic led by students or as a nonprofit affiliated with the Kansas Bar Association, he said.
He said an ombudsman should be appointed by the state revenue secretary after consultation with the chair of the Board of Tax Appeals and the revenue department’s director of property evaluation. It’s not necessary to include the post among jobs requiring Kansas Senate confirmation, he said.
If the program proved beneficial in terms of BOTA’s case docket or processing times, Burghart said, the Legislature could consider broadening the ombudsman’s role into direct representation or formal advocacy of taxpayers in BOTA proceedings in which counties were involved in the cases.
If the Legislature chose to deepen the ombudsman’s role regarding property tax cases the personnel should no longer be based within the revenue department, he said.
Wheeler, the BOTA chair, said the taxpayer assistance position must be filled by a person with specialized expertise in taxation appeals.
She said BOTA was neutral on whether the position needed to be located at BOTA, but “parameters of the position and its location deserve further consideration and debate.”
She said it was unlikely the state could quickly implement a student-staffed taxation legal clinic at law schools at University of Kansas in Lawrence or Washburn University in Topeka.
“Even if there was interest in this type of clinic, it’s likely that creation of a clinic would take substantially more time than creating a staff position,” Wheeler said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-221336-1024x575.jpg,,,2025-11-19 09:56:45.301552
,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-11-19 14:14:24+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,‘They’re making a huge bet’: Rent control referendum splits progressives,Chris Lisinski and Jennifer Smith,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/politics/theyre-making-a-huge-bet-rent-control-referendum-splits-progressives/,"If a campaign to instate rent control across the Commonwealth makes it to the ballot, voters will need to weigh whether every municipality should adopt a measure more stringent than earlier attempts by Boston, Brookline, and Somerville.","IN THE THREE DECADES since voters narrowly banned rent control in Massachusetts, every swing to revive even the mildest version of the policy has connected with nothing but air. 
Requests from Boston, Brookline, and Somerville withered on Beacon Hill, statewide bills stalled out, and ballot measures fell apart at early junctures. Progressive elected officials and advocates have settled into a frustrated rhythm: Come before indifferent lawmakers every session and ask, unsuccessfully, to leave rent control decisions in the hands of cities and towns that want it.   
Today, the movement to limit rent increases has new momentum, with an updated ballot question coursing toward voters in 2026. It might seem like a boon to the left, but to some who have spent years slowly building support for rent control, the campaign also poses an ultimatum. 
That’s because the initiative petition does not seek simply to lift the ban, nor to allow rent control in the handful of communities that have requested it. The proposal instead would apply one of the nation’s strictest rent caps to all 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts, from Williamstown to West Tisbury and everywhere in between. 
It’s a dramatic, swing-for-the-fences approach that the campaign, led by advocacy group Homes for All, sees as simpler messaging. 
“We’ll continue to support the local option bill at the State House, and we know that is often the way the state Legislature likes to do policy,” said Homes for All executive director Carolyn Chou. “We’ll continue to push that, but we feel that if we go in front of the voters, we need to be presenting something that will impact their lives immediately.”  
The strategy has put many longtime supporters of capping rents in an awkward position, at a time when housing prices are soaring across Massachusetts and the state vacancy rate is one of the lowest in the nation. Should they spend whatever political capital they’ve built over the past decade on a measure far more dramatic than has previously been suggested? Or should they stay on the sidelines, with the risk of alienating allies or undermining momentum? 
With advocates buoyed by last year’s votes to boot the 10th grade MCAS test as a graduation requirement, allow ride-share drivers to unionize, and open up the Legislature’s books, few progressive politicians are eager to downplay the rent control measure’s chances or be associated with real estate interests over the average renter.   
That would be, they say quietly, political suicide.  
But not everyone is eagerly jumping on board yet.  
Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, perhaps the state’s most high-profile supporter of rent control, so far has not thrown her support behind the question, though some of her Boston allies are more enthusiastic. The incoming mayor of Somerville, which green-lit the most ambitious local rent stabilization proposal since the ban, wonders why the statewide pitch needed to be more complicated than simply allowing rent control back into the housing toolkit. 
Several other elected officials and organizers said they would vote for the measure while openly questioning the strategy of going so big in a state where municipalities guard what little local control they have. In private, some worry that the Homes for All group leading the campaign is headed down a path that could set the movement back decades. 
“This is more aggressive than any proposal that has ever been discussed in anyone’s memory in Massachusetts and perhaps anywhere,” said Rep. Mike Connolly of Cambridge, who still intends to support the measure. “They’re making a huge bet that has a lot of consequences.”  
That line of thinking, in turn, has ruffled feathers among supporters, who think it’s essential for anyone with an interest in rent control to maintain a consistent message given the inevitable blitz of opposition from the real estate industry.  
Rep. Sam Montaño of Boston, a longtime rent control supporter who backs the ballot question, described comments by Connolly and others as “frustrating.”  
“What’s the point of saying you have an issue with it if we are moving forward?” Montaño said. “The real estate industry is going to outspend us by a margin of, like, 20 to one. Why are you giving them any more power to say there’s division within the coalition?”

Proponents say the ballot question is bold, but simple. 
It would cap most rent increases across the state at either the annual change in the Consumer Price Index or 5 percent, whichever is lower.  
Owner-occupied buildings with four or fewer units would be exempt, as would newly constructed units for the first 10 years of hosting residents, most public housing, housing in educational or religious institutions, or units typically rented to visitors for fewer than 14 days. 
Most other rent-control proposals floated in Massachusetts or enacted elsewhere in the United States give landlords more flexibility. 
Boston, Brookline, and Somerville — the three cities that submitted home-rule petitions over the past few sessions to the Legislature seeking rent control — each sought to limit rent increases at the CPI change plus an additional margin, effectively allowing landlords to go a bit beyond inflation.  
Statewide laws in Oregon and Washington limit rent increases to inflation plus 7 percent, or 10 percent, whichever is lower. California similarly sets its state cap at inflation plus 5 percent, or no more than 10 percent in the highest-inflation years, while allowing some communities to craft their own policies. 
The city of St. Paul, Minnesota limited rent increases at 3 percent annually with a few options for landlords to seek exceptions. Voters approved that measure in 2021, and the city soon experienced a dramatic downturn in housing production — the seventh largest production plummet in the entire Midwest according to federal data — though other Minnesota municipalities without rent control also experienced pandemic-era downturns. 
St. Paul’s city council in May voted to exempt units built after 2004 from rent control, amending the voter-approved law.

The new Massachusetts ballot measure’s tight limit on rent growth mirrors legislation filed in several consecutive lawmaking terms Rep. David Rogers of Cambridge, Montaño of Boston, and Sen. Patricia Jehlen of Somerville, the House version of which is due for a hearing before the Legislature’s Housing Committee on Wednesday.  
In an interview, Montaño said the bill is “as close to the middle as you can get” at balancing what tenants can afford with increases high enough to empower landlords “continuing to invest” in properties.  
However, that bill offers rent control as an opt-in tool that any city or town could deploy after securing approval at the local level – not an automatic statewide mandate, as the ballot question seeks – and it would also allow communities to restrict no-cause evictions. 
Both Wu and Somerville Mayor-elect Jake Wilson have leaned toward a nuanced local approach rather than deploying a one-size-fits-all requirement. 
As the Somerville City Council crafted its 2023 home-rule petition with a working group’s recommendations, Wilson said, they mulled Somerville’s particular rent prices and housing pressures. 
“I would say the rule of thumb should be something that is ultimately fair to a landlord and fair to a tenant, where it would not break the bank either on a one-year basis or over a sequence of years for a tenant looking to stay in their home,” he said in an interview, “and it would allow a landlord to make the kind of improvements and investments in that property to maintain it as a good housing unit.” 
The ballot proposal, which Wilson now says he will enthusiastically get behind and work to pass, is a far cry from a one-off tailored local measure or even a blanket permission for cities and towns to pursue their own types of rent control without needing legislative sign-off. 
“I will say that the approach that seemed the most logical to me was just a straight up repeal of the prohibition on rent control,” said Wilson, a current at-large city councilor. “The folks behind this say they have polling that shows good support for this prescriptive law-of-the-land model. I’m trusting them on that, and I’m hopeful that this ballot measure ultimately succeeds, so that we can bring in the rent stabilization needed to stanch the bleeding that our communities are experiencing from displacement.” 
Wu has kept the measure at arm’s length. 
When asked in August about the proposal, she told GBH that it “would not be what I would have supported for the City of Boston.” She said at the time that she would “have to figure out what to do about this, because this may be the only shot for a while,” she said. 
Almost three months later, Wu’s stance remains unenthusiastic.  
“The mayor has not yet taken a position on the ballot question,” a city spokesperson said on Friday in response to a CommonWealth Beacon inquiry. 
“She believes that although communities across the Commonwealth are all facing intense housing pressures and the steep cost of housing is Massachusetts’ biggest competitive liability, each city’s specific needs and conditions require nuanced and specific solutions,” the spokesperson said.  
Boston’s proposal would allow rent hikes of inflation plus 6 percent, up to a 10 percent year-over-year cap — higher in every scenario than what the ballot question would require. The city’s measure would also, unlike the ballot question, allow the rent to be raised to market prices in between tenants, prompting Boston officials to argue that additional tenant protections would be needed to make sure landlords could not force out a renter to raise rents. 
Wu took some heat from both the left and the right over her more modest rent stabilization pitch. Rent control advocates said it was an anti-gouging measure at best, leaving significant rent hikes on the table. Real estate groups said it was a more reasonable proposal than other municipalities put forward, but they argue that rent control fundamentally harms the housing market and their businesses. 
Montaño told CommonWealth Beacon she did not refile the Boston home rule “because the mayor asked me not to.” Frankly, she said, “it’s not going anywhere.” (Wu’s office did not respond to questions about whether the mayor decided not to pursue the rent control home rule this session.) 
Some of Wu’s allies in City Hall are more eager to back the ballot measure. At-Large City Councilor Henry Santana introduced in September a nonbinding resolution to declare support for the ballot effort. 
“Putting rent control back on the ballot would let current Bostonians, many of which are at risk of displacement and housing insecurity, show their support or opposition for a measure that would directly impact their lives,” Santana said. Wu endorsed Santana and measure co-sponsors councilors Enrique Pepén and Ben Weber in their city council races this fall. 
The nonbinding resolution, however, faced opposition from some of the moderate councilors and remains in the council’s committee on housing and community development. 
Organizers for the ballot measure appear to be on solid footing so far. The campaign announced on Tuesday it collected more than 120,000 signatures ahead of a Wednesday deadline. While the final number certified by elections officials could be lower, the preliminary haul is well above the nearly 75,000 required to advance to the next stage.

Homes for All has lined up some influential allies. A quintet of labor groups — the SEIU Massachusetts State Council, the Massachusetts Teachers Association, UAW Region 9A MA Cap Council, UFCW Local 1445, and the Boston Teachers Union — last month endorsed the statewide ballot measure. 
Labor leaders say they hear regularly from members that housing costs are increasingly top of mind, and they want to pursue almost any tool imaginable. 
“Without bold action to slow the rising cost of housing, the essential workers who keep Massachusetts going won’t be able to afford to live here,” SEIU’s Dave Foley said in a statement. “By supporting rent stabilization, we’re demanding basic protections against excessive rent hikes to keep people in their homes and stabilize communities all across the state.” 
Landlords and developers have long opposed most rent control ideas, instead contending that Massachusetts must focus on quickly building new housing to rein in skyrocketing prices. 
Now staring down the prospect of one of the nation’s strictest policies, opponents have been quick to mobilize. Last month, the heads of the Greater Boston Real Estate Board, the Massachusetts Association of Realtors, and commercial real estate development group NAIOP wrote to mayors and regional chambers of commerce lobbying against the measure. 
NAIOP CEO Tamara Small said she’s already hearing from prospective investors who intend to withdraw their plans if Massachusetts implements rent control. 
“The risk cannot be overstated,” she said in an interview. 
It’s not just the statewide application that concerns the real estate industry. Opponents said preventing rents from increasing beyond inflation, even while waiting for a new tenant, could make it difficult for property owners to absorb rising utility costs or invest in needed repairs. 
The ballot question would also define base rents as what landlords are charging on January 31, 2026 — 10 months before the measure could reach voters. 
Greater Boston Real Estate Board CEO Greg Vasil said industry groups are prepared to mount a campaign against the ballot question. “We’re fighting for the future of the Commonwealth, our housing future, and so we’ve got to do what it takes,” he said.  
“It’s going to be wildly expensive, but given the irreparable harm this would do, we’re certainly committed to fighting this,” Small added. 
The solution Small would like to see, she said, is simple: “production, production, production.” 
The new rent control ballot measure may clear its signature threshold just a week after a bracing report from the Boston Foundation on the state’s housing crunch. 
Massachusetts renters are navigating a market among the most expensive and constrained in the nation, according to the 2025 Greater Boston Housing Report Card. The Zillow Observed Rent Index, which tracks changes in market rents across housing types, in September found the benchmark rent in Boston’s metro area stood at nearly $3,000 per month without including utilities costs — the fifth highest in the US. 
According to BostonPads, a housing market research and tracking site, the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Greater Boston is around $2,600 a month. That’s up about 3.9 percent from two years ago.  
The Boston metro area’s rental market is “especially tight,” according to the Boston Foundation report, trailing every other comparable major metropolitan area with a vacancy rate of just 3 percent. A stable rate is closer to 5.6 percent. 
“Low vacancies also give landlords more market power to push up rents and create the conditions for greater discrimination,” Boston Foundation researchers wrote. “Section 8 voucher holders, for instance, have a much harder time finding rental opportunities in tight rental markets.” 
To deal with existing overcrowding and accommodate future growth, the Healey administration says the state must build at least 222,000 housing units over the next decade. But, permitting and construction in Boston, the most populous city, is lagging according to city and federal data.

Two years ago, Connolly, the representative from Cambridge, began collecting signatures to advance a ballot question that would have allowed any city or town to regulate rents at whatever maximum increase they each deemed appropriate — a local-option system, not a statewide mandate — as well as to limit evictions, building demolitions, and condominium conversions. 
His campaign fragmented the left. Some progressive groups suggested at the time that there was not enough support for the local-option question to pass or that the movement was not yet unified enough to mount a robust campaign. 
The Homes for All coalition publicly called on Connolly to drop his effort, saying it would “detract from the effort to win the policies our communities need and is not supported by the vast majority of rent control advocates,” the Boston Globe reported in 2023. 
Just two years later, Homes for All is now leading the charge for a rent control ballot question much more dramatic than what Connolly sought. So what changed? 
 “The crisis has continued to intensify,” Chou said. 
“From Springfield to Boston to Worcester to Brockton to Lynn, we are seeing tenants continue to be priced out [and] face huge rent increases. Our communities can’t wait any longer,” she said. “Two years ago, we were really committed to building the infrastructure and building the grassroots people power it would need to take on this campaign, and making sure the question language was as simple, clear, and impactful as possible. We feel like we’re set up now to meet the moment.” 
The coalition has backed local option rent control legislation on Beacon Hill, but for the ballot question, organizers decided to pursue a policy that would immediately affect most renters across the state, not just those in the handful of communities already interested. 
A statewide measure, supporters say, presents voters with a simpler choice: “Do I want rent control in my hometown?” rather than “Do I want a city an hour away to be able to implement rent control after a subsequent vote at the local level?” 
And after witnessing the fierce blowback to the MBTA Communities housing law, which requires cities and towns served by the MBTA system to zone for more multifamily housing, some advocates worried that most communities would remain unwilling to cap rents even if a change to state law cleared the way.

“We will continue to work with the Legislature, but we can’t wait while corporate landlords continue to buy up buildings across our communities,” Chou said. “We felt we needed to pursue every tool in the toolbox to make sure our folks do not have exorbitant rent increases.” 
Some nervous progressives said Homes for All assured them that internal polling — which the campaign declined to share with CommonWealth Beacon — showed that a statewide mandate could garner significant support among voters. If that’s the case, they say, it makes the political gamble of backing such a measure feel less risky. 
Several insiders said they think faulty logic is at play.  
Dan Cohen, a veteran Democratic strategist who worked on Connolly’s short-lived ballot question two years ago, said his own polling has found that the idea of statewide mandatory rent control does “not test as well as the local option” alternative. His survey two years ago found that the idea of a local rent control option was more popular than a statewide system by eight percentage points. 
And he worries that putting forward a statewide mandate will make the opposition campaign easier, allowing influential real estate groups to savage the ballot measure without coming across as making bad-faith claims. 
“They’re putting forward an instrument that is so blunt that suddenly the real estate industry arguments are not going to be entirely wrong,” Cohen said. 
Connolly recently signed the Homes for All petition and said he will “wholeheartedly” support the question if it makes it to the ballot because he thinks the state’s housing crunch is serious enough to embrace “any way possible to win rent control.” 
But he voiced similar concerns that a statewide mandate would “give the real estate industry the best chance it will have to use the proverbial fear-mongering and scare tactics to try to talk voters out of this.” 
Sen. Jamie Eldridge of Marlborough, another progressive who worked with Connolly on the earlier proposal, also said he’ll support the new campaign even as he worries it will be a “tougher sell.” 
“I will certainly be helpful, but yeah, I will say I do feel that the local option approach is easier to message,” he said.

Beacon Hill has been decidedly chilly toward efforts to allow rent control to return — even in just a handful of cities. 
The House overwhelmingly rejected reinstating rent control as part of a 2020 economic development bill, and lawmakers had little interest in considering the subject again by the time Wu’s rent stabilization plan took the spotlight. 
Rent control is usually soft-pitched as part of a “toolkit” along with other stabilization measures like housing production plans, eviction and tenant protections, permitting and zoning reforms, and incentives for good landlords.  
“Municipalities often have the most success when they are able to implement the solutions that work best for them,” said Adam Ploetz, the Metropolitan Area Planning Council’s manager of housing and neighborhood development. He noted two locally tailored proposals before lawmakers this session – one that would allow municipalities to impose a fee on high value real estate sales to fund affordable housing, and another that would give a renter the first chance to purchase their current unit if it goes on the market.  
Those sorts of measures, Ploetz said, “”would allow communities to implement common sense solutions where appropriate.”  
When the statewide rent control ban was headed to the ballot in 1994, only Boston, Cambridge, and Somerville had some form of municipal rent control policy in place. A majority of voters in those three cities voted to keep rent control on the books, but the measure prevailed 51 percent to 49 percent and, as a result, every community had to prohibit the practice. Any local attempt since then to carve a municipality out from the ban needs Beacon Hill approval, which lawmakers have declined to give to Boston, Somerville, and Brookline.  
The outcome left cities and towns in a common holding pattern when it comes to local rent control efforts: A measure is proposed, refined to meet community characteristics, okayed by municipal leaders, and sent up Beacon Hill for consideration from lawmakers. 
The measures from Boston, Brookline, and Somerville, each of which sought to cap rent increases while carving out new construction and smaller buildings, were met with shrugs on Beacon Hill. 
It’s not that rent control has no supporters in the Legislature. A version of the Rogers- Montaño local-option bill filed in the 2023-2024 legislative term notched more than 50 lawmakers as cosponsors. Without buy-in from the top, though, the bill died without clearing a single committee. 
That’s where the ballot question — a tactic activists increasingly use to circumvent an unwilling Legislature — comes into play.  
“If there’s the threat of the voters doing something, sometimes it can spur Beacon Hill to action,” Wilson said. “And maybe the best case scenario here is that Beacon Hill looks at this message of confidence coming out of the folks behind this about the prospects of passage and goes and does something on their own to re-legalize rent stabilization here in Massachusetts.” 
But going directly to voters carries risks. If a campaign fails, it can’t be brought back to the ballot box for at least six years. Lawmakers are also far less likely to approve a policy reform that has been recently rejected by voters. 
“Even if the loss is because of a particular nuance,” said Cohen, the strategist, “traditionally, a loss on the ballot will set something back by decades.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/maurarussel-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C692&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-19 09:56:45.301552

(photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Supreme Court has upheld state regulators’ decision to grant permits for a large gold mine planned for Southwest Alaska, bringing the proposed Donlin project a step closer to construction.
In a unanimous ruling published Friday, the court’s five justices said the Alaska Department of Natural Resources did not need to consider the environmental impact of the entire proposed Donlin Mine when it approved water use permits and a right-of-way permit needed for a natural gas pipeline intended to power the mine.
Their ruling has implications for many major development projects on private land and likely applies to projects on federal land as well, such as the large oil projects on Alaska’s North Slope.
“This decision is a major win for Alaska,” said Attorney General-designee Stephen Cox in a written statement. “The Court rightly recognized that the State’s permitting process met constitutional standards and that Article VIII (of the Alaska Constitution) does not extend to lands owned by Alaska Native Corporations or other private entities. This ruling not only affirms the integrity of DNR’s work but also protects the rights of Alaska Native Corporations and provides certainty for future development.”
The natural gas pipeline will stretch across state land, but the mine itself will be dug on land whose subsurface rights are owned by Calista Corporation, a regional Alaska Native corporation. 
Writing on behalf of the court, Justice Dario Borghesan said the distinction is important.
“Because these are private resources, rather than state resources, the Department was not required to consider the cumulative impacts of their development when deciding whether to allow the use of state waters and access over state lands to develop the mine,” he wrote.
The ruling says that to approve the gas pipeline, regulators needed to consider only the impact of the pipeline, not of the mine it allows. 
Until Friday, a 2013 decision by the Alaska Supreme Court known as REDOIL had required regulators to “take into account all aspects of a project” and consider the “cumulative impacts” when issuing permits for work on state land.
Friday’s decision somewhat limits that precedent, particularly for Alaska’s North Slope oil and gas industry, where most new drilling is taking place on federal land, not state land.
“This decision, I believe, makes clear that the REDOIL requirement to assess cumulative impacts only applies to projects that are on state lands,” said Jon Katchen, an attorney familiar with the new decision and author of a friend-of-the-court brief to the Supreme Court.
Friday’s decision covered two lawsuits filed by the Orutsararmiut Native Council and other Alaska Native tribes opposed to the mine’s development.
They appealed the case to the Alaska Supreme Court after an Anchorage Superior Court judge also ruled in favor of the defendants. The high court heard arguments one year ago.
“While this ruling is unfortunate, our work challenging the Donlin gold mine continues,” said Gage Hoffman, Orutsararmiut Traditional Native Council President, in an emailed statement. 
ONC, as the tribe is also known, is fighting the mine in federal court, and in June, a federal judge found problems with a federal assessment of part of the project.
ONC and other plaintiffs are being represented by Earthjustice, an environmental law firm, and a spokeswoman for that organization said it has another case on appeal at the Alaska Supreme Court as well as federal litigation.
“We will be pushing to ensure that the supplemental environmental study that the court ordered from our federal victory adequately analyses the risks posed by the mine,” Hoffman said. “Our people deserve to know about these dangers; our ways of life are dependent on healthy lands and waters, and it is our responsibility to ensure they are protected for future generations.”
Friday’s ruling covered separate lawsuits filed over different sets of permits. 
One lawsuit involved a permit challenged repeatedly since a preliminary decision in 2019, granting the use of state land needed to build a gas pipeline from Cook Inlet to the mine site.
Referring to legislative history and the text of the state’s Right of Way Leasing Act, Borghesan concluded, “none (of this) can be reasonably read to require the Department to consider the downstream effects of industrial activities by users of gas transported by the pipeline.”
The other suit addressed 12 water use permits issued in 2013 and 2016 by DNR to Donlin.
Plaintiffs argued that the Alaska Constitution, as interpreted by REDOIL, required DNR to consider the impact of the whole project.
Not so, Borgesan wrote.
“In our view, such a rule would extend article VIII (of the Alaska Constitution) far beyond its command to ascertain whether the development of state-owned resources is in the public’s interest.”
He also added that imposing such a restriction would be particularly problematic in the case of Donlin, because it involves land “chosen by ANCSA corporations as compensation for the loss of Alaska Natives’ aboriginal title to their ancestral territories. … These lands and minerals are reserved for their benefit, not for the benefit of Alaskans generally.”
Plaintiffs had argued that DNR failed to consider what will happen after the mine closes, when the mining pit will be filled by rainwater and seepage.
“Pumping will be required in perpetuity to ensure the lake’s water levels do not overtop its banks,” Borghesan wrote, adding that water treatment will also be required forever. 
“This is because the water will have high levels of heavy metals due to contact with mining waste, and will have to be treated in perpetuity to protect downstream lands, waters, fish and wildlife, and people.”
Despite that conclusion, he said the justices “are persuaded that the Department was not required to consider the environmental impacts of the pit lake” because that lake will be regulated by state and federal pollution permits and rules, not just the water-use permits. 
Friday’s decision emphasized that the justices are not intending to give an open hand to development.
“We hold only that the Department was not required, when deciding whether to issue water appropriation and pipeline right-of-way permits for use in mining privately owned minerals on private lands, to condition those permits on an analysis of the cumulative impacts of the mining itself,” the decision states.

Liberal billionaire Tom Steyer raised his profile as a foe to President Donald Trump when he spent $13 million on ads touting Proposition 50. Now, Steyer is jumping in the 2026 California governor’s race.


Tom Steyer, the billionaire climate activist and businessman who unsuccessfully ran for president in 2020, is the latest Democrat to jump into California’s crowded gubernatorial field.
His two core promises — which could appear at odds — are to preserve the state’s status as a hub for business and innovation while also lowering California’s cost of living by making corporations pay “their fair share,” he said in a video message.
The nearly two-minute campaign launch film, which intersperses sleek graphics with footage of line cooks, ranchers and manufacturing workers on the job, encapsulates those dueling themes. 
“There’s a reason everybody comes here to start businesses — because this is the place that invents the future,” Steyer says near the start of the video. “I never want to lose that spark.” 
Steyer made his fortune as the founder of Farallon Capital, a hedge fund headquartered in San Francisco that currently manages about $42 billion in assets. After selling his stake in the company in 2012, Steyer started NextGen America, a liberal nonprofit that supports progressive positions on issues such as climate change, immigration, health care and education. The group also launched a labor-aligned super PAC to fund races nationwide.
His activism through NextGen America has elevated Steyer’s profile in recent years from little-known hedge fund manager to global climate activist and Republican antagonizer. He has spent millions to pass progressive ballot measures to uphold California environmental laws, raise taxes on tobacco to fund health care and push states to invest in more renewable energy.
Gov. Gavin Newsom terms out next year. At least six other Democrats are running to replace him, including former Rep. Katie Porter, former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. 
While a billionaire former financial executive might be at odds with a party base hungry for a more relatable fighter, he’s attempting to appeal to everyday Californians by spotlighting the issue that most people say is their top priority — affordability. 
“The Californians who make this state run are being run over by the cost of living,” Steyer says later in the video. “Californians deserve a life they can afford.”
Steyer also promises to “launch the largest drive to build homes that you can afford” in state history, rein in monopolistic utilities that have driven up costs and “drop our sky-high energy prices.”
Steyer’s nearly $13 million advertising blitz in support of Proposition 50, the congressional redistricting plan that voters approved earlier this month via special election, led many California political insiders to speculate that he would launch another bid for governor. 
He alluded to his gubernatorial ambitions when he launched a controversial advertisement that, rather than amplify the Yes on Prop. 50 campaign’s message of checking the Trump administration’s power, touted his own calls to impeach and resist President Donald Trump.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111825-Tom-Steyer-RS-Getty-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-19 09:56:45.301552

A San Francisco state senator unveiled legislation Tuesday that aims to give Californians the right to seek damages from federal agents, as President Donald Trump’s administration continues to ramp up immigration enforcement across the U.S.
The bill authored by Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat and congressional hopeful, would enable people to file a lawsuit or seek redress against local, state and federal officers for violating their constitutional rights.

Wiener, at a press conference: “This (federal) administration is attempting to wield unchecked power to illegally kidnap and deport people, to punish the administration’s political opponents using government resources, to freeze university funding and to fire thousands of federal workers en masse.”

The measure works to promote what’re known as Bivens lawsuits, a precedent established by a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 1971, which permits individuals to sue federal officers for violating their constitutional rights. But in the years since, the high court has curtailed Bivens actions, making it difficult for people to bring forth claims and recover damages.
In October ProPublica found that more than 170 U.S. citizens have been detained during immigration sweeps — some of whom were reportedly beaten and shot. Little recourse is available for victims, though in a rare case, the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department arrested a federal immigration enforcement officer last week after he held a teenage boy at gunpoint and detained him.
Wiener’s proposal comes a day after the Trump administration filed a lawsuit to block a new California law written by Wiener that bans law enforcement officers, including federal agents, from wearing face coverings. 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has warned other agencies that criminals have posed as immigration agents to carry out crimes, but the U.S. Department of Justice said California’s law threatens the safety of federal officers.

The California State University’s board of trustees plans to vote today on whether to change the university system’s executive pay structure in a way that would boost their wages — a potential overhaul that has drawn blowback from Cal State’s unionized staff and faculty, writes CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn.
Currently, Cal State caps the base pay of its 22 campus presidents at a salary that’s no more than 10% above what their predecessors made. Raises for sitting presidents are also no higher than 10%. The average base pay for presidents ranges from $370,000 to more than $500,000. 
But Cal State says the policy leads to uncompetitive compensation. Trustees are deciding on a plan that would raise the executive base pay (along with overall wage increases for other Cal State workers), and add a 15% incentive-based pay bump that executives would be eligible for.
The proposal comes during a time when Cal State is facing limited budgets, layoffs and program cuts.

Erin Foote, a union board member for California State Employees Union: “I am mad. … We are going to knock the doors of our legislators so hard there will be holes in them until they stand with us in their budget negotiations.”

Tom Steyer, a billionaire environmental activist and former hedge fund manager, said today that he is running to be California’s next governor, reports CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller.
Steyer kicked off his campaign with a video where he pledges to preserve the state as a place for business and innovation, while also lowering California’s cost of living by making corporations pay “their fair share.”

Steyer: “The Californians who make this state run are being run over by the cost of living. Californians deserve a life they can afford.”

The mega-donor for California Democrats spent more than $12.8 million in support of Proposition 50, making him the second-largest independent ad buyer in state history. As an outspoken critic of Trump, Steyer poured millions in a national ad campaign that advocated for the president’s impeachment during his first term. Steyer also ran for president in 2020 before ultimately dropping out of the race.

CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: Candidates for the state’s next governor are changing constantly, underscoring the daunting logistics of a California campaign, and perhaps the hesitations around trying to lead a state that may be ungovernable.
Students in rural California have limited access to mental health care, but peer support programs can help train students to connect with one another and, if needed, refer someone to a professional, writes Alonzia Quinn, a senior at Stanford University studying political science.

While the Massachusetts House considers the pros and cons of the legislation passed by the state Senate, the negative mental health effects of cellphones in schools continue to plague students’ ability to learn and socialize in classrooms across the state.  The issue holding back this critical protection for students? A new generation of parents are demanding a constant lifeline to their children, unaware of the detrimental social impacts of cellphone addiction that teachers are witnessing firsthand.   The anxiety of parents is impacting the tranquility of schools. The political balance of limiting digital distractions and cyberbullying in K-12 schools with parents’ demands to contact their children during the school day has resulted in a patchwork of district-level decisions by school leaders. Districts that have implemented cellphone bans have witnessed immediate improvements in students’ communication, socialization, and academics. They have also experienced pushback and outrage from parents.  We do not know the long-term impacts of online activity on children’s brain development. And we may never have absolute, conclusive data on the brain impacts of screen use. But there is a continuum of research outlining two increasingly unnerving data points: Greater smartphone usage by students results in higher rates of depression and poor academic performance, and students are increasingly using their cellphones more during the school day.  The desire for constant digital contact with a child is a modern extension of “helicopter parenting.” The excessive supervision of parents has already shrunk the boundaries of neighborhood play, redefined sleepovers, and cast aspersions on vaccines. Now, the need to constantly contact a child has become a flashpoint in school board meetings and parent-teacher conferences across the country.  
Parents need to ask themselves whether this truly serves their child’s best interest. And the Legislature needs to empower school administrators to turn off the phones in favor of engaged, safe, and independent learning.  The job of educators to implement health-conscious environments is not a new responsibility. For decades, parents have relied on schools to educate their children in nonacademic areas where they lack expertise. Sexual education, nutritional health, and digital literacy are examples of school-based education provided at the local level over the previous decades, which were put into place to counter growing societal trends in sexually transmitted diseases, obesity, and internet privacy issues impacting a vulnerable population. Many of these educational programs have state-sponsored support. Cellphone usage is the next frontier of this designation and should be incorporated into state law to save a generation of students biologically addicted to their screens.  We cannot wait 10 years for conclusive data on the impacts of screen use on dopamine receptors to tell us what educators already know. We are at an inflection point in how Generation Alpha develops focus, resilience, and social skills. Time is wasting to protect our students from the generational disease of cellphone addiction.  
There are too many mental health problems, plummeting grades, and increasing cyberbullying trends to allow further delay. To save the next generation of students, Massachusetts must enact a bell-to-bell cellphone ban.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)A Michigan woman who says she unwittingly walked into a meeting of the Manistee County Republican Party is speaking out after attendees were handed a flyer suggesting motorists were justified in using force – including driving through crowds of people  – to clear blocked roads blocked by protests.
Janet Stancliff, of Manistee County, told Michigan Advance on Tuesday she mistakenly entered the wrong meeting room Oct. 9 at West Shore Community College in Manistee. She had intended to attend a meeting of the local League of Women Voters chapter, with both groups scheduled to meet in adjacent spaces.
Stancliff said she and her boyfriend sat in the front row, unaware they were in the wrong gathering, and were given a sheet of paper titled “Manistee GOP Internal Memo.” The document, dated Aug. 14, 2025, outlines suggested positions for Manistee County Republicans regarding protesters who block roads.
The Advance was able to review the document, which states that protestors have “shown disdain and contempt for motorists and their passengers” in recent years “by preventing them from proceeding to their destinations, which could include medical emergencies.” 
It goes on to say that obstructed motorists “do not appear to have certain knowledge about what to do when the road is blocked by protesters” and urges Manistee County Republicans to adopt several recommendations, including that motorists “are justified in driving their vehicles through the protesters to escape,” that they are “authorized to use personal force, including weapons,” and that drivers “as militia or otherwise” would be justified in arresting and detaining protesters. The memo further asserts motorists may sue protesters for damages.










I’m pretty sure it’s illegal to run someone over with your car.


– Manistee resident Janet Stancliff


While the flyer handed to Stancliff contains no letterhead or official markings, Duane Jones, the chair of the Manistee County Republican Party, confirmed her story for the Advance.
“The document was presented by a member at our October meeting. It is authentic, but is not an ‘Official Internal Memo’ as titled,” Jones said in an email to Michigan Advance. “No action was requested or taken on the content of the document, nor is it official policy of the Manistee County Republican Party.”
When the Advance asked Jones if he agreed with what was being advocated in the flyer, he said: “That’s not relevant.”
Stancliff said she was initially confused about the nature of the meeting. 
“I started reading it, and I said to my boyfriend, ‘Is this a joke?’” she recalled. 
She said the pair realized they were in the wrong room only after the meeting began with what she described as a lengthy prayer invoking political themes.
“We got up and left,” Stancliff said. “Afterward I showed the memo to my friend, who couldn’t believe it. I said, ‘I can’t believe it either, because I’m pretty sure it’s illegal to run someone over with your car.’”
Under current Michigan law, blocking traffic is a civil infraction, as reinforced by Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, in a December 2024 executive summary in which she noted that protesting and picketing “are generally protected speech under the First Amendment,” and that local criminal ordinances that address traffic safety “should be applied reasonably and judiciously.”
However, legislation has been proposed to change that status, including House Bill 4664, which seeks to update traffic obstruction to a misdemeanor, carrying penalties of up to 93 days in jail or a $5,000 fine when the blockage occurs during assemblies of ten or more people. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Alicia St. Germaine (R-Harrison Township), passed the House in September, but remains in committee in the Democratic-controlled Senate.
Meanwhile, Senate Bill 500, introduced in August by state Sen. Jim Runestad (R-White Lake), who is also chair of the Michigan Republican Party, would shield drivers from civil liability if they kill or injure protestors while acting in self-defense and their actions “arose from another individual’s conduct in furtherance of a riot.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
If approved, those bills would put Michigan in the ranks of other states that passed laws to punish protests after Americans took to the streets following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020.
But as the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law notes, neither the bill nor existing Michigan law defines what constitutes “conduct in furtherance of a riot,” which it calls “a vague phrase” that could include ordinary, nonviolent protest activities, including handing out water or chanting. 
The center added that if enacted, it believes the bill “could encourage violence by drivers and others against people who are participating in or supporting a protest.” 
Runestad’s bill was assigned to the Senate’s Civil Rights, Judiciary and Public Safety, where it remains.
Regardless, Stancliff said the document concerned her because it circulated shortly before planned No Kings protests across the country, including in Manistee. 
“It was a little scary,” she said. “People are pretty nutty right now.”
Despite the confusion of the night, Stancliff emphasized her motivation for speaking about the experience. 
“I’m an aging hippie and a liberal,” Stancliff said. “I am, like most other people like me, absolutely outraged, horrified, and terrified right now at what is going on in Washington, D.C., and the world.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AMR_0454-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-19 08:56:31.099721

Their peers could learn to help them,Alonzia Quinn,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/11/california-rural-youth-mental-health/,Suicide is 50% higher among rural young people than among others in urban or suburban environments. Many also live too far to get counseling.,"Guest Commentary written by

Alonzia Quinn is a senior at Stanford University studying political science.


Imagine a high school student in rural California, struggling with a mental issue for weeks with no one to talk to. The nearest therapist is hours away, the youth’s family can’t spare the time or gas and even if they could get there, the next available appointment isn’t for months. 
It’s likely the student will keep showing up to school, pretending everything’s fine. 
Now imagine a trained classmate they could talk to after class — someone who could listen, really understand and help them find support.
In rural America, young people face some of the most alarming mental health challenges in the nation, with rates of depression, anxiety and suicide far outpacing those of their urban peers. Suicide rates among rural adolescents and young adults are nearly 50% higher than those in suburban or urban areas. California is not an exception to this trend.
Limited insurance coverage and severe shortages of mental health professionals only deepen the crisis. About two-thirds of rural counties lack a psychiatrist, 8 in 10 lack a psychiatric nurse practitioner and nearly half lack a psychologist, experts say. 
States have tried bridging the gap through telehealth, but systems connecting patients with caregivers online fall short when about 30% of rural households lack reliable internet. 
And while artificial intelligence has been proposed to promote access to help, its impact remains limited in rural areas where technological barriers persist. Besides, no algorithm can replace the empathy and trust that come from a human connection.
For rural students, getting help can feel nearly impossible. A “quick trip” to the doctor might mean driving 50 to 100 miles — if a provider is available. Distance and other barriers lead to missed appointments, inconsistent treatment and worsening symptoms.
Gov. Gavin Newsom should support legislation ensuring every rural high school offers access to mental health peer support programs. State Sen. Susan Rubio, a Democrat from West Covina who this year introduced mental health education legislation, is well positioned to lead the effort.
My own journey into youth mental health advocacy began with a similar goal: helping students feel supported and comfortable reaching out.
I grew up in Iowa, where care was limited and stigma ran deeper than our corn fields. 
On the Waterloo Youth City Council, I spent two years working to change that. Our biggest win came with a bill requiring schools to print crisis hotline information on student ID cards. When the bill passed the Iowa House, it felt like a victory not just for policy, but for every student who might see that number in a moment of crisis and decide to reach out.
California recently took a similar step, requiring that schools add the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline to student IDs. It’s meaningful, but awareness alone isn’t enough. Knowing where to turn doesn’t always make it easier to ask for help. 
Sometimes what students need most is a face-to-face connection — a peer who understands.
Leave no student behind
Peer support programs train students to bolster one another, offering empathy, connection and a first point of contact for those who might otherwise struggle in silence. In structured elective classes with teacher oversight and clinical guidance, peer supporters learn to listen, document responsibly and know when to refer someone to a professional. 
Several California high schools have piloted this model, but many rural schools have been left out. With funding available through the Behavioral Health Services Act — a 1% tax on incomes over $1 million — California has the opportunity to expand these programs and ensure rural students aren’t left behind.
Some may worry that focusing on rural schools leaves urban students behind, but rural students face the steepest barriers, often attending school without a single counselor or psychologist. This legislation isn’t about playing favorites; it’s about closing an equity gap. 
Now imagine that student in rural California — the one silently struggling — finally having someone to turn to right down the hall. That single connection can turn isolation into hope. 
Young people want support that feels genuine, relatable and free of stigma. Peer programs can make reaching out less intimidating and more human. If California truly wants to meet the mental health needs of its youth, it must ensure no student faces the silence alone.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/092624_Santa-Rosa-Junior-College-Adjunct_AC_CM-18.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-19 08:56:31.099721

The commission voted 5-1 to continue the contract after a presentation from APT staff and in front of 50 people, many of whom spoke about the importance of public broadcasting in their lives. Commissioner Tijuanna Adetunji was not present for the vote.
Diana Isom, who attended the meeting, told the commission that PBS Kids programming had been invaluable for her son.

“PBS is the reason my son is at a kindergarten level at three years old,” Isom told the commission. “My son goes to an autism clinic, all of those kids watch PBS. A lot of children benefit from it so much, especially autistic kids.” 
Two commissioners at October’s meeting suggested dropping PBS programming, citing the Trump administration’s slashing the budget for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) this summer and what one member of the commission characterized as ideological objections. 
But the proposal drew sharp criticism from around the state, including over 1,400 emails to APT. Before the meeting began on Tuesday, a group of over 30 protesters gathered outside of the APT building to advocate for the AETC to vote in favor of keeping PBS programs going.
“I think it’s important to stand up for quality education, quality programs for our children, especially in economic times such as these, not everyone can afford cable. It’s nice to have free educational programs available to all Alabama’s children,” Julie Reese, one of the protesters, said.

In a letter sent Monday, Gov. Kay Ivey asked the commission to survey the public to see if disaffiliation with PBS had support, and then develop a plan to do so. Pete Conroy, a member of the AETC, passed a motion at the meeting to create a commission to study the issue, consisting of journalists and broadcasters.
“This is Alabama Public Television. It’s not Alabama Commissioner Television. So that motion will establish a group to help us make some of these decisions,” Conroy said.
APT Executive Director Wayne Reid said during the meeting if the station dropped programming it would be replaced by American Public Television, a non-profit syndicator that he said produces “complementary programming” to PBS.
But Reid told commissioners that if PBS programming stopped altogether, it could result in a drop in annual membership contributions of $2.4 to $2.7 million, hurting APT operations. making it hard for APT to continue.
“There was a station in Los Angeles, the only station I know of, but the last station that tried to,” Reid said. “They were mad about PBS dues. They thought they were too high, so they said they were going to break off. They were going to go independent. And they lasted 18 months.
Reid said Tuesday the station received emails and phone calls and tags on social media expressing concerns about stopping PBS programs.
“I’ve been a fan of PBS since my children were little, and they’re now in their 50s. Sesame Street, Mr. Rogers, you read it and as a senior citizen,” Carol Binder, a Hoover resident who attended the meeting, said. “Now, I love everything on PBS. I have [PBS] Passport, and there’s hundreds and hundreds of programs, and it’s just not right for one, two or three people who don’t like the program to cut it off for everybody in the state. It’s outrageous.”
Reese said she heard from other protesters that they wouldn’t continue to donate if programming was cut.
“I just spoke to a gentleman down the corner, he donates to apt, he will not continue donating to apt if PBS folds, which is going to severely impact Alabama public television,” she said.

Following Reid’s presentation, Commissioner Bebe Williams made a motion to continue to pay the PBS contract and maintain programming which passed with only one commissioner, Les Barnett, voting no.
Sens. Linda Coleman-Madison, D-Birmingham, and Rodger Smitherman, D-Birmingham, also spoke to the commission, sharing their own experiences with public broadcasting.  
“You may not be able to travel around the world. I have the opportunity now, but I’ve already been there with public television,” Coleman-Madison said. “And the good thing about it, when I do go, I know where they’re telling me the truth or they’re giving me a snow job. It is trust. We trust public television because we know that the information we get in particular on PBS is going to be true, is going to be factual.”
Conroy praised the decision to continue the contract after the meeting.
“I think today really was a huge victory for the state of Alabama, victory for PBS and APT, although it needs constant attention and this is the beginning of a campaign and not the end,” Conroy said after the meeting. 
Reid said continuing the contract, which expires next June, gives APT a clear picture of what direction to go next.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Two new legislative audits paint a picture of inadequate and flawed mental health care in Utah’s state prison in Salt Lake City.
The reviews released Tuesday found employees failed to properly monitor those at risk of suicide, and the impact is illustrated in several examples of self harm, with one person taking their own life. 
Auditors said a psychiatrist who assisted in the audit process concluded “inmates are often abandoned” because of a lack of consistent follow-up in care. They also recorded examples of some getting the wrong psychiatric medications and others missing doses. 
Together, the two wide-ranging reviews totaled more than 160 pages, with one warning of “significant deficiencies and critical issues in need of immediate action.” 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
One review focused on the Division of Correctional Health Services under Utah’s Department of Health and Human Services, and the other on the Utah Department of Corrections.
The reports come three years after the prison relocated from Draper to Salt Lake City, with a new design that state leaders and prison officials described as “humane,” with a focus on rehabilitation and therapy.
Auditors recommended that the division design a suicide prevention program and a process to review prescriptions, that the agencies collaborate and revise their policies and procedures, and that the prison ensures officers are adequately supervising inmates.
Stacey Bank, executive medical director for the Department of Health and Human Services, told legislative leaders on an audit review panel Tuesday that the agency has already developed new procedures on suicide. It has brought on two psychiatry fellows from the University of Utah who have helped provide more clinical oversight, she said.
Bank said there hasn’t been a suicide at the prison in over a year, “an outcome that reflects focused prevention, better integration and a patient-centered approach.”  
The Utah Department of Corrections is also already at work on many of the recommendations, added deputy executive director Rebecca Brown. 
“Our plan of action really centers on policy revision, enhanced supervision, improved coordination, and formalizing best practices between security and safety,” Brown told the panel.
Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City, said some of the audit’s findings were red flags and brought up questions about the staffing the prison needs to make sure it’s getting prescriptions and other issues right when it comes to mental health. 
“I want to make sure you have what you need,” Escamilla said. “Some of these mistakes that are in this audit are alarming.”
Monitoring and suicide
Among other findings in the audits, reviewers found the correctional health services agency violated its own policy by failing to constantly monitor 26 inmates in the prison’s psychiatric infirmary who had attempted suicide or were deemed “acutely suicidal” from October 2024 to March 2025, the audit said. 
They received the lowest level of observation in the prison’s psychiatric infirmary, which is monitoring in 15-minute intervals. In the time between checks, multiple patients attempted to harm themselves.
When it comes to checks by corrections officers, “we noted that some officers were filling out the logs without looking in the inmate cell and verifying their safety in the report,” auditor Brendon Ressler told the legislative panel.
One person’s suicide was not discovered for over an hour, Ressler said. 
No tracking of suicide attempts 
The audit found the Division of Correctional Health Services doesn’t collect or analyze data on suicide attempts, limiting its ability to evaluate risks, spot trends and make improvements.
“Identifying risk patterns can uncover trends,” auditors wrote. They did their own analysis and found 21 people attempted suicide, some multiple times, from October 2024 to March 2025. 
By comparison, the Arizona Department of Corrections tracks its data, the audit says, and the Utah State Hospital does a similar analysis, with the added step of reviewing what happened to find a root cause. 
Understaffing and its fallout
Auditors documented “the negative effect of not having a staff psychiatrist” at the prison. 
After a full-time psychiatrist left the job in July 2024, it took more than a year for the state to hire a part-time replacement, a delay the division attributed to “the challenges associated with offering a competitive salary,” one audit says. 
The prison has relied on advanced practice registered nurses who have more limited training, with only one of those nurses for every 609 people in the prison with moderate to severe mental health needs, the audit said. 
They may be experiencing excessive workloads, the audit mentioned, leading them to feel overwhelmed or burned out. 
“Consequently, inmates with severe mental health needs did not receive the level of attention and treatment that their condition required,” the report states. “The lack of consistent follow-up has led the consultant to conclude that ‘inmates are often abandoned,’ which is deeply concerning.”
Those housed in the psychiatric infirmary receive brief provider assessments daily, but do not have access to other services such as psychotherapy or group therapy, auditors noted. 
They wrote that “many inmates in the psychiatric infirmary were suicidal due to identifiable life stressors such as divorce or bereavement — conditions that respond well to therapeutic intervention. Instead, these inmates were met with prolonged isolation.”

That’s why, as California’s population soared in the post-World War II era, those who aspired to govern the state typically declared their ambitions at least two years out, even if they were already occupying other offices.
That bit of political history is offered because California voters will elect a new governor in less than a year, and filing candidacy paperwork will open in just a few weeks, but the field of candidates seems to change almost daily.
Some who were in have dropped out, such as Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis and former state Senate leader Toni Atkins. Meanwhile, some who considered a run — such as former Vice President Kamala Harris — backed away, and at least one who had opted out may jump back in. And names of other potential candidates continue to pop up.
The cloud of uncertainty underscores not only the daunting logistics of a California campaign, but perhaps some hesitancy about trying to govern a state that in many ways may be ungovernable.
Gavin Newsom will cede the office, probably to mount a campaign for president, with the major issues that plagued California when he became governor in 2019 still unresolved, and in some cases even worse.
Uncertain water supply, sub-par public education outcomes, an acute housing shortage, rampant homelessness, high levels of unemployment and poverty,  crushing costs of living and a chronically unbalanced state budget are just a few of the critical issues awaiting whoever survives the forthcoming campaign.
There are a few would-be governors who announced early, such as former Congresswoman Katie Porter, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former Attorney General and Congressman Xavier Becerra.
However, their ability to raise the immense amounts of money needed to finance a campaign is hindered by uncertainty over who else might jump in. The lesser known candidates, such as state schools Superintendent Tony Thurmond, former Controller Betty Yee and former Assemblyman Ian Calderon, are even more disadvantaged.

The cloudy picture on the Democratic side doesn’t affect the two most prominent Republicans running, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and former television personality Steve Hilton, but their roles hinge on whether one will place second in the top-two primary election in June or if two Democrats emerge as finalists in the November election.
A very wealthy businessman, Republican-turned-Democrat Rick Caruso, is among those still dithering. Another billionaire, Tom Steyer, dumped a bunch of money into a personal campaign for Proposition 50, Newsom’s partisan congressional gerrymander, implying he’s thinking about it.
Congressman Eric Swalwell, who has become one of President Donald Trump’s most persistent critics, is reportedly weighing a run. Pestering Trump worked for Adam Schiff, who rode it into a U.S. Senate seat, so it might help Swalwell, given voters’ rampant dislike of Trump.
And then there’s Attorney General Rob Bonta, who — somewhat surprisingly — took himself out of contention early and said he would seek re-election. It was surprising because Bonta is a notorious publicity hound who issues some sort of announcement virtually every working day. Tuesday’s version was intervening in a lawsuit over legislation dealing with art theft.
The buzz this week is that Bonta is reconsidering a run for governor due to the lack of an obvious frontrunner.
So who is ahead?
A recent poll by UC-Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies found that among the declared Democrats, Porter was leading at 11% of registered voters, but Sheriff Bianco was the overall leader at 13%.

(Andi Rice for Alabama Reflector)BESSEMER — The Bessemer City Council Tuesday allowed a $14 billion data center to move forward over objections from residents and environmental groups who expressed concerns about water usage and pollution.
The council voted 5-2 to change a zoning designation from residential to light industrial, effectively clearing the final hurdle with Bessemer before construction can begin.
“We have all been listening,” said Carla Jackson, a member of the city council prior to voting to approve the zoning change. “We heard your concerns, and we have waited. Unbeknownst to you, we have done the research.”

The zoning change applies to 670 acres of land within the Bessemer city limits. The construction site is more than one square mile, according to Brad Kaaber, a representative from Logistics Land Investment LLC based out of Atlanta that is developing the site for the data center. He told the council during the meeting that each of the buildings is set back at least 100 feet from the property line. The property also has ridges that conceal the visibility of the buildings.
“In order to get to this point, we had to go through vast amounts of due diligence,” Kaaber said during this presentation to the council. “We have had multiple studies done on this site, including an environmental site assessment, endangered species, traffic studies, wetland delineation reports, all of which show there are no endangered species on the site. There are no archeological findings on this site.”
Kaaber said the project will not affect any of the streams or waterways. However, the data center is expected to consume about two million gallons of water daily, according to a memo that the developer sent to the Warrior River Water Authority that serves residents and businesses in the area. That water, used to cool equipment, will not be available to others to use in an area.
“They requested two million gallons a day from a fairly rural, under-resourced, drinking water utility, and we have questions about whether that utility can upgrade its system without any cost to its customers in order to serve the data center,” said Ryan Anderson, a staff attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, a legal advocacy organization for environmental protections. “And there is another really basic question of whether they are going to use surface water or ground water.”
“I am very concerned about the aquifer because they will dewater the site,” said Mary Rosenboom, a resident who lives one mile from the proposed data center site.
The city’s planning and zoning commission voted to approve the project twice after the city council sent the project back to the commission as residents, along with environmental groups, continued to express concerns about the proposed data center.
The public is becoming increasingly aware of the impact that data centers have on the communities as more are being built to accommodate the increasing demand for technology, particularly with the growth of artificial intelligence.
Many have expressed concerns about the noise that the data center generates, for example.
Residents at Tuesday’s meetings also objected to electricity consumption by the data center and its potential impact on utility rates. Others
Expressed concerns with pollution, particularly the use of fossil fuel plants to power the center.  “It will cause carbon dioxide and methane emissions, which we already know are warming the atmosphere and aggravating different illnesses,” said Julianne Tharp, a field and advocacy fellow with the Greater-Birmingham Alliance to Stop Pollution.
Tharp said she is worried that the data center will increase cases of asthma and other respiratory problems.
Others told the council that they supported the construction of the data center because of the jobs it will bring and the positive impact it will have on the school system.
“We have a wonderful opportunity here today, you do, to make something happen, in this state,” said Michael Turner, superintendent of the city’s school system.
The data center is expected to generate almost $132 million in benefits to the city from sales and property taxes, as well as franchise fees and building permit fees, according to an estimate from the Birmingham Business Alliance. It is also expected to garner another $538 million in benefits to the schools in the city.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bessemer-data-center-hearing-Nov-18-2025-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-11-19 08:56:31.099721

(Photo by Sergio Flores/Bloomberg, Getty Images)A proposal that would lower the minimum age requirement to purchase a long gun in Florida from 21 to 18 won approval in its first committee stop in the Florida House on Tuesday.
The measure (HB 133), sponsored by Rep. Tyler Sirois, R-Merritt Island, is likely to advance through the House in the coming session, as a similar proposal has passed the entire chamber in each of the past three years. However, it’s stalled in the Legislature because there hasn’t been a Senate companion.
The measure passed in the Criminal Justice Subcommittee along party lines, 11-5. It now has just one more committee stop before it would go before the entire chamber for a vote.
The Florida Legislature raised the minimum age to purchase a firearm from 18 to 21 after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018.
The National Rifle Association immediately challenged the law in court, but earlier this year, the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied that challenge, two years after a three-judge panel similarly ruled against the organization. The NRA has since appealed the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier said after that ruling that his office would not defend the law if in fact the NRA filed an appeal with the high court.
Speaking for the legislation, Rep. Jessica Baker, R-Duval County, noted that now in Florida a 19-year-old can own a long gun if someone gives it to him or her, but cannot purchase one. “If we believe in equality, how is it fair that a young adult from a well-off family can get a gun as a gift, and protect their homes and their families, but a young adult with no family support cannot?” she asked.
Rep. Christine Hunschofsky, D-Broward, said that the mother of the teen who killed the 17 people in Parkland in 2018 had said that she never would have given him a gun. “He was able to get his hands on that gun because he was allowed to purchase it. And that’s why the law is written the way it is,” she said.
There is not yet a Senate companion, and it’s not certain that there will be. Rep. Sirois said that the Senate’s deadline to file legislation passes when the 2026 regular legislative session begins.

(Photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)Two Air Force veterans will face off in January to fill a Statehouse seat representing Dorchester County.
Greg Ford, a retired combat veteran, won Tuesday’s Republican primary runoff with 56% of the vote against Brian Hill, according to unofficial results from the South Carolina Election Commission.
The runoff set the ballot for the Jan. 6 special election for the state House seat being vacated by former House Judiciary Chairman Chris Murphy, R-Summerville.
Voters in House District 98 will choose between Ford and Democrat Sonja Ogletree-Satani, who easily won a three-way Democratic primary outright two weeks ago to avoid a runoff.
Hill, who owns a trucking company and worked 40 years in the maritime industry, was the top vote-getter in the three-way GOP primary Nov. 4, with 43% of the vote. But in South Carolina, a runoff is required if no candidate receives at least 50% plus one vote.
Murphy, a 57-year-old attorney, submitted his resignation Aug. 20 for the seat he first won in 2010. The effective date of his resignation is Jan. 5.
The special election the next day will bring the House back to full membership one week before the 2026 legislative session starts.
Two other special elections for House seats are set for Dec. 23.
In Lexington County, Republican John Lastinger will face Democrat Chuck Hightower to fill the vacancy created when ex-Rep. RJ May resigned ahead of pleading guilty to distributing videos of children being sexually abused.
Next month’s election for a Greenville County seat is largely a formality, since no Democrat is on the ballot. Republican Dianne Mitchell, a former teacher, is set to replace Rep. Bobby Cox after winning a GOP runoff Nov. 4. Cox submitted his resignation in August with the intention of running for a Senate seat, then dropped out altogether.
The special elections will not change Republicans’ supermajority advantage in the House. Membership consists of 87 Republicans and 36 Democrats, with one open seat. (Technically, the Lexington County seat is the only current vacancy, since May’s resignation took effect immediately.)",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/statehouse-roof-and-flags-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-19 08:56:31.099721

Republican state Sen. Ira Hansen and Assemblymember Alexis Hansen, who are married, negotiated with Democrats to force one of their own priorities to be considered alongside Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s.
In Nevada, when a governor calls a special session, lawmakers are limited to the topics included within the official proclamation. But legislators also have the ability to call themselves into a special session, if two-thirds of the members in both houses agree to it.
Democrats are one lawmakers shy of supermajorities in each house, so they cannot do that on their own.
The Hansens agreed to join with Democrats and sign a petition to resurrect a bill originally sponsored by Democratic state Sen. Dina Neal that seeks to limit cash-rich corporate investors from purchasing large swaths of housing.
In 2023, the bill passed the Legislature but was vetoed by Lombardo. Ira Hansen voted for the bill; Alexis Hansen did not.
In 2025, the bill died in the Senate because it needed to pass with a two-thirds majority and fell one vote shy. Before the floor vote, Ira Hansen, whose support would have pushed it over the two-thirds threshold, announced he would reluctantly vote against the bill because the governor asked him to.
He has since called that his biggest regret of that legislative session, according to The Nevada Independent.
The amended proclamation reflecting the petition from the Hansens and Democrats is expected to be officially received Wednesday. The new bill is expected to mostly mirror Neal’s earlier version, though it has not yet been made publicly available.
Here are the bills still in play and where they are as the Legislature goes into the seventh day of the special session:

AB4, the governor’s crime bill, received a major amendment Tuesday and is headed to the Assembly, which will need to vote to accept or reject the amendment. If the chamber concurs, the bill will head to the governor’s office for final approval.
SB9, a newly introduced bill that includes select provisions of the crime bill, is on the “secretary’s desk.” That location is a purgatory of sorts where bills wait for myriad reasons.
AB5, the Summerlin Studios film bill, is sitting on the Senate’s agenda, ready for a vote.
SB4, which appropriates money to myriad projects or state agencies (including the University of Nevada Reno for a life sciences building), is sitting on the Assembly’s agenda, ready for a vote.
SB5, which establishes a health care grant program designed to address provider shortages across the state, is sitting on the Assembly’s agenda, ready for a vote.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC08183-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-19 07:57:14.385249

More specifically, the question was about what made him different compared to Michigan Sen. Mallory McMorrow of Royal Oak. In the basement of Wilson Hall at Michigan State University, he keyed in one issue: Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza and the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people.
For some candidates across the nation running for public office big and small, the question could have been debasing, but El-Sayed has been talking about the strife of the Palestinian people since he started his bid for the 2026 contest. McMorrow has only recently said that she believed what was happening in Gaza was a genocide, and some have questioned whether that stance was genuine.

Either way, from the halls of power in Washington, D.C. to the state Legislature and the campaign trail, some Michigan Democrats have made the Palestinian people and their current plight in Gaza cornerstones of their current political work, and other Democrats appear to be taking notes.
“I think there’s a particular kind of shock and horror that folks should have about the idea that our political system can’t countenance the murder of 20,000 kids by our own tax dollars, and call it what it is,” Abdul told the Michigan Advance after the event. “And at the same time, I’m grateful that we seem to be at least headed in the direction where we can turn the page. I’m not running for Senate to obfuscate things. I’m not running for Senate to lie to myself or the people that I represent about what’s happening in the world and what’s being done with their tax dollars. I’m running for U.S. Senate to clarify what’s happening and to try to do something about it.”
Last week, U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) introduced a House resolution officially recognizing the the situation in Gaza and the actions of the Israeli government as a genocide. Tlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress, was joined by 20 other members of Congress in introducing House Resolution 876 of 2025.



The resolution was co-sponsored by:

Reps. Becca Balint of Vermont, André Carson of Indiana, Greg Casar of Texas, Maxine Dexter Oregon, Maxwell Alejandro Frost of Florida, Jesús G. “Chuy” García of Illinois, Al Green of Texas, Pramila Jayapal of Washington, Henry “Hank” Johnson, Jr. of Georgia, Ro Khanna of California, Summer Lee of Pennsylvania, Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Delia C. Ramirez of Illinois, Lateefah Simon of California, Nydia Velázquez of New York, and Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey. 


The resolution, if passed, would put on record that the U.S. House of Representatives believes that the Israeli government committed genocidal acts, but would also call on the government of the United States to take immediate, concrete actions to fulfill its binding legal obligations to the United Nations’ Genocide Convention. Effectively doing so could push the nation and its allies to prevent further atrocities and punish Israel for the crime of genocide.
That is a tall order for the Republican-controlled lower chamber of Congress, in which many of its rank and file members have issued unequivocal support for Israel.
Still, Tlaib remained undeterred and said that the genocide has not ended despite the promises of multiple cease fire deals over the last two years, and that the war and genocidal actions of Israel will not end until the U.S. acts accordingly.
“Since the so-called ‘ceasefire’ was announced, Israeli forces haven’t stopped killing Palestinians,” said Congresswoman Tlaib. “Impunity only enables more atrocity. As our government continues to send a blank check for war crimes and ethnic cleansing, Palestinian children’s smiles are extinguished by bombs and bullets that say ‘Made in the U.S.A’.”

Tlaib said that to end this horror, “we must reject genocide denial and follow our binding legal obligations under the Genocide Convention to take immediate action to pursue justice and accountability to prevent and punish the crime of genocide.”
Michigan legislators push Congressional colleagues to end Israeli arms sales
In Lansing last week, Tlaib’s colleagues in the state Legislature also introduced a similar resolution, calling on Michigan’s congressional delegation to specifically block arms sales to Israel, immediately rush aid to Gaza and restore the revoked visas of Palestinians.
Michigan House Resolution 223 of 2025 faces a steep, near insurmountable climb to reach a vote on the Republican-controlled House floor. After being introduced on Nov. 13, the resolution was immediately scuttled to the House Government Operations Committee, the place in Lansing where bills and measures go to die.

Either way, the legislative Democrats behind the move – state Reps. Erin Byrnes of Dearborn, Alabas Farhat of Dearborn and Dylan Wegela of Garden City – said that for more than two years, the world has watched the horrors unfold in real time, which Byrnes called a “livestreamed genocide.”
“Even after repeated ceasefire deals, Israel continues their escalation of their campaign to eliminate the Palestinian people,” Byrnes added. “What makes that possible is American-supplied weapons.”
Farhat said that polling shows that most Americans want their government to stop fueling the suffering in Gaza and take actionable steps to end the war, steps that the U.S. government has been unable or unwilling to take.
“Polling has clearly shown that most Americans want our government to stop fueling the suffering in Gaza and to take real steps toward ending this war,” Farhat said. “For many families in my district, this is not abstract, people are losing loved ones in Gaza and in South Lebanon, and they’re watching it happen with their own taxpayer dollars. Imagine knowing that your hard earned money is being used to kill your relatives.”
Farhat said the new resolution reflects his community’s moral and democratic mandate to stop funding weapons that are killing civilians, adding that it rang true of all communities in Michigan, as well.
“Our communities want peace, accountability, and policy that values human life and this resolution moves us in that direction,” he said. 
Wegela said that instead of using taxpayer dollars to improve the lives of their constituents, the federal government was funding a genocide on the other part of the world.
“It is our moral obligation to oppose funding the mass murder of civilians,” Wegela said. “This resolution follows growing evidence collected by humanitarian groups, scholars, and international agencies that Israel’s blockade, bombing campaigns, and deliberate targeting of civilians meet the legal definition of genocide. It outlines that it is against U.S. law to supply weapons to Israel, and demands our so-called leaders in Washington assert their power to stop the killing.”
Michigan candidates moving closer to acknowledgement of Gaza genocide
Meanwhile, both McMorrow and Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, who is a candidate for governor in 2026, have both come out in support of labeling the actions of the Israeli government as a genocide.
Gilchrist made the pronouncement in Dearborn, the heart of the Arab community in Michigan, at a national conference for Muslim and Arab Americans.
Gilchrist calls Gaza, Palestine crisis a genocide at Arab convention, fundraising communications

McMorrow made her comments at a campaign stop on one of her town hall-style brewery tours, where she was confronted with a question on Gaza. McMorrow said, by its definition, that a genocide had unfolded against the Palestinians living in Isreal. She also said she would not be accepting money from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the largest pro-Israel lobby in the United States.
The state senator, however, tempered those comments with an acknowledgment of the disturbing loss of life on both sides of the conflict, including the inciting Oct. 7, 2023 inflection point when Hamas terrorists attacked multiple settlements in southern Israel, including a music festival, murdering more than 1,000 civilians and taking hundreds of hostages. Still she called for the war to end immediately.
McMorrow’s stance took some heat when it was reported that she had  privately produced an AIPAC position paper that at least one pro-Israel donor said was “outstanding,” a claim that she has denied.
The shift in McMorrow and Gilchrist joining the long-held positions of Tlaib and El-Sayed shows that more Democrats were waking up to the changing winds of opinion on the war, arming Israel and Palestinian self-determination.
McMorrow clarifies stance on Gaza, joins Michigan Democrats calling situation a genocide

U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens of Birmingham, who is also in the race, is notably a strong supporter of Israel and has taken approximately $5 million from AIPAC during the course of her career in politics.
At the event on Tuesday, as he answered the question from MSU students, El-Sayed said what made him different from McMorrow was the fact that he has long held the position, whereas McMorrow, he said, appeared to be shaky in her stance.
Following the event, El-Sayed told the Advance that he was happy to hear more people were joining him and Tlaib and that he supports her resolution. On McMorrow and other candidates arriving at the issue now, El-Sayed said Gaza has become a “moral Rorschach test on values.”
“I’d rather live in a world where this never happened, and I’m trying to build a world where this never happens again,” El-Sayed said. “I’ll be gratified if we can get there.”

The Act 73 redistricting task force recognizes that closing small schools and creating mega-school districts will not solve Vermont’s rising education costs.

She chairs the Westminster Town School District Board, the Windham Northeast Supervisory Union Board and the Steering Committee for the Rural School Community Alliance.


The Rural School Community Alliance commends the leadership and members of the Act 73 redistricting task force for their principled, evidence-driven approach to the work assigned by the Vermont Legislature. 
On Monday, November 10, the Task Force voted to send a proposal forward to the Legislature that calls for voluntary, cooperative agreements that create real cost savings, protect rural schools, maintain Vermont’s quality of life and preserve democracy at the community level.

Notably, the task force has committed to a democratic, community-driven approach to redistricting Vermont’s schools, one that trusts local decision-making at the community level rather than imposing top-down mandates. They took a strong stand against forced mergers of existing school districts and supervisory unions and an equally strong stand in support of protecting rural elementary schools and keeping them close to the children they serve. 
The task force also proposed a thoughtful, cost-effective framework for communities to explore larger regional and comprehensive high schools, paired where feasible with community and technical education centers. This approach is grounded in the evidence and will reduce costs while increasing opportunities for older students. Their recommendations reflect hours of deliberation, review of research and careful listening to the public. 
With more than 5,000 responses from Vermonters showing up and engaging through surveys, meetings and public comment, the overwhelming conclusion was clear: forced mergers will not reduce costs or property taxes and would have negative impacts on our communities and children. Vermonters want solutions that protect local schools and make education more affordable.
The task force listened. Their proposal affirms that communities, working collaboratively with local school boards, are best positioned to lower costs while maintaining the quality and character of Vermont’s public education system.
Task force members openly questioned the assumption that simply consolidating would save the state money – a concern strongly supported by the research. And much would be lost in the process.
The Rural School Community Alliance supports that view. In a July 2025 position statement sent to the task force, the RSCA stated, “there are no clear and consistent economic benefits from creating mega-districts that dissolve local ties.” Neither per-pupil spending data nor qualitative evidence shows that school closures or consolidations reduce costs.
When increased transportation costs, maintenance of empty buildings, costs for expanding infrastructure, and reduced property values are accounted for, the evidence is even clearer: consolidation does not deliver savings and therefore does not reduce property taxes. Voluntary collaboration, however, consistently does.  
After reviewing this and other evidence, the Task Force concluded that the most effective path for reducing costs now and in the future is the creation of cooperative educational services districts. This shared-services model, used successfully across the United States, especially in rural states, has already begun to show results in Vermont.
Seven supervisory unions and one large school district in southern Vermont have signed agreements to form such a system. As chair of the Windham Northeast Supervisory Union Board, one of the cooperating districts, I can report that we are already seeing savings that will ultimately help relieve pressure on local property tax rates. 
The Act 73 redistricting task force recognizes that closing small schools and creating mega-school districts will not solve Vermont’s rising education costs. Instead, they are poised to ask the legislature to support strategies that actually reduce spending, and therefore cut property taxes, without destroying the character and quality of Vermont’s entire education system in the process. 
On behalf of the members of the Rural School Community Alliance, representing more than 100 towns and villages, we urge the public to contact your senators and representatives and support the task force’s recommendation for voluntary, cooperative agreements that will deliver cost savings, protect rural schools, and preserve local control.

Now he's asking a judge to decide.,"Carmella Bowers and her son Johnnie Boykins are fighting to exonerate Boyers' son Darren Boykins, who was convicted for the 1981 murder of Milton Laufer in Newark. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)A retired attorney fighting to exonerate a Newark man imprisoned for 44 years for a 1981 murder he’s always claimed he did not commit has taken his fight to state court, accusing police, prosecutors, judges, and others of misconduct.
Authorities failed to divulge exculpatory evidence that could have cleared Darren Boykins from suspicion in the May 22, 1981, slaying of carpet salesman Milton Laufer and covered up or dismissed evidence that could have freed Boykins from jail in his post-conviction appeals and parole bids, attorney John Crayton argued in a petition filed in Essex County Superior Court last week. Crayton wants a judge to vacate the conviction.
Boykins, who was 19 at the time of his arrest, has always claimed he did not kill Laufer. He’s now 64 and incarcerated at New Jersey State Prison in Trenton, where he is under psychiatric care.
He had an alibi the day of the murder, investigators never found a murder weapon, and two witnesses repeatedly could not identify him as the killer. But jurors convicted him largely on the word of a jailhouse informant, who later recanted, and a photo lineup 39 days after the homicide that Crayton contends was improper.
Crayton spent six months reinvestigating the case and sent a lengthy report last winter to various authorities laying out evidence he says shows Boykins was wrongly convicted. He has pushed unsuccessfully for Gov. Phil Murphy to grant Boykins clemency and the Essex County Prosecutor’s Conviction Integrity Unit to review his conviction.
“I still am hoping that someone will read what I’ve sent them before and look at what I just filed — and take a hard look at the case and come to the difficult but courageous decision that what happened to Darren 44 years ago was terribly wrong,” Crayton said.
Carmen Martin, a spokeswoman for the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office, declined to comment Tuesday.

Boykins has been eligible for parole since 2006 but twice has been denied release by a board critics have complained routinely rejects parole-eligible prisoners’ bids for freedom. He’ll be eligible again in March. Crayton has petitioned the court for limited guardianship so that he can argue before the state parole board for Boykins’ release.
He’s also working to line up a psychiatric placement in the community for Boykins, in hopes that he prevails in his fight. He regards Boykins’ continued incarceration as a failure of both the criminal justice system that condemned him to life behind bars as well as reformers whose inaction keeps him there despite proof of injustice.
“Why in the world is a soon-to-be 74-year-old, semi-retired attorney sitting in his garage office bringing forward a potential exoneration case in New Jersey?” Crayton said. “Somebody else ought to be doing that.”

Mike Braun speaks at a 25th anniversary celebration of the safe haven newborn surrender law at the Indiana Statehouse on Nov. 18, 2025. (Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Hoosier leaders gathered Tuesday at the Statehouse to hail the 25th anniversary of a safe haven law that encourages parents to surrender infants rather than abandon them.
It “has protected the most vulnerable among us and given hope to others in crisis for a quarter of a century,” said Linda Znachko, founder of He Knows Your Name. The ministry buries “unclaimed” children — including aborted and miscarried infants — and adults.
The law was approved in 2000, after an infant was found dead outside a hospital emergency room.

Imagine “a mother gently laying her baby down, scared to go in the hospital,” Znachko said. She “left her baby, I’m sure, hoping that someone would find that child. And unfortunately, no one did until it was too late.”
The law allows the surrender of unharmed infants, without legal consequences, to emergency medical services providers like hospitals and volunteer fire departments. The handoffs can be in person, or through newborn safety devices better known as baby boxes.
Thirty-one have been surrendered in Indiana since 2017, a He Knows Your Name spokesperson said.
“These boxes are more than plastic and technology. They are mercy made tangible,” said Safe Haven Baby Box Founder Monica Kelsey.
Indiana went 11 years without finding lifeless, abandoned infants, according to Znachko.
“I actually thought that’s what we were going to be celebrating here today,” she said. But “everything changed” when a deceased newborn was discovered at an Indianapolis park in September.
“On this 25th anniversary celebration, I would like us all to recommit ourselves to … taking up this cause all over again,” Znachko said. “… We cannot allow women in crisis to remain under-resourced, under-educated in their most desperate hour.”
She welcomed Indiana’s top leaders to the stage, set up feet away from a pro-redistricting gathering.
“We are setting the trend in this nation, across the gamut, that we honor the sanctity of life,” Gov. Mike Braun said. “And I think you can count on all of us, as legislators and as your governor: we won’t let you down on that very important issue.”
He, like Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray, took the opportunity to shore up his “pro-life” credentials. Both lauded the U.S. Supreme Court’s overturning of the right to an abortion in 2022, noting Indiana was the first state to respond with a near-total ban on abortions.
“This is a good law and a good tool to protect newborns and make sure women have a pro-life option available to them at all times,” said Bray, who leads the Senate’s GOP supermajority.

He said the state should educate Hoosiers about the law and add more surrender locations.
“We’re creating a culture in Indiana that puts innocent lives first,” said House Speaker Todd Huston, leader of that chamber’s Republican supermajority. “… Indiana has installed more baby boxes than any other state in the nation.”
Brandi Koie, one of the first to adopt a baby under the law, said it’s a “win for all of us.”
“When it’s properly utilized, birth mothers who aren’t yet ready or equipped to parent, they get second chances at life. That’s a win,” Koie said. “Babies who are born into a crisis situation, they’re saved … That’s a win. Waiting arms become filled at long last.”
She spoke directly to those birth mothers.
“I want to say: thank you. You are so brave. You are so loved. You are so appreciated,” Koie said. “I want you to know that my daughter has grown up knowing that her birth mother loved her first, and that she did so sacrificially.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)When Marco Azogue climbed the stairs onto a plane parked on the tarmac of Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, shackled at the wrists and ankles, he assumed the plane was taking him to his home country of Ecuador. 
None of the agents or plane staff spoke Spanish. They didn’t answer him when he asked where they were going, or whether they would give him his belongings — his wallet and phone, which he hadn’t seen in days. 
“We had no idea where we were going — they didn’t give us an explanation for where they were taking us,” Azogue said in Spanish in an interview with the Reformer. 
The plane, it turned out, was headed for Louisiana. Agents loaded Azogue and other immigrants into a van, which drove for several hours into the countryside. Azojue would spend several days in an immigrant detention center in Little Pines, Louisiana, before being ushered onto another plane, this time bound for Ecuador.
Azogue was swept up in the mass deportation effort ushered in by the election of Donald Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress, which has poured money into efforts to beef up the infrastructure needed to expel immigrants by the hundreds of thousands.

The activity is everywhere, if you know where to look: Minnesota will soon be home to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection facility at the St. Paul Downtown Airport, MPR reported recently. The Trump administration is considering reopening a closed private prison in Appleton as an immigrant detention center. The sheriff’s offices in eight Minnesota counties have agreed to assist ICE in deportation activities.
Travelers passing through MSP walk and drive by immigrants like Azogue weekly as aviation companies hired by the Department of Homeland Security carry out deportations from the state’s largest airport. Deportation flights were traceable for years using popular tracking websites, but the federal government has recently taken steps to obscure the flight information from the public. 
Most deportation flights are carried out by private charter planes, according to ProPublica. Flight attendants working them told ProPublica they were not allowed to speak to detainees or provide them with food or water. 
On the morning of Nov. 12, three unmarked white vans pulled into a back entrance to the airport. They drove across the tarmac, where a plane operated by Key Lime Air was waiting. 
The vans pulled into a semicircle surrounding the stairs leading to the plane door. Then agents patted down around 20 immigrants before they climbed one-by-one — slowly, shackled — up the steps and into the plane.
A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Airports Commission, which oversees MSP, said federal law prevents MSP from restricting access to public or private aircraft operators. 
“The Metropolitan Airports Commission does not coordinate or get any advance notification of general aviation or non-commercial flight operations at MSP Airport, which would include government owned or operated aircraft,” the spokesperson said.

Nick Benson, a photographer and longtime planespotter, has observed deportation flights since before President Donald Trump’s second term. But the frequency of deportation flights seems to be increasing, he said, and he’s concerned by efforts to obscure the movement of the flights from the public. 
Benson uses open source information to locate incoming and outgoing deportation flights, and shares his photos and observations online.
“I think it’s important for people in the Twin Cities to realize that all of this stuff isn’t just something that happens in Chicago or Portland or somewhere else — that it’s happening here too…. I think it’s historic, and it’s worth knowing and documenting that it happens,” Benson said. 
Judges have found that Trump’s immigration authorities have violated the due process rights of detainees. Civil rights lawyers charge that the administration has turned to formerly off-limits methods for arresting people: using tax data, targeting school grounds and churches and arresting people as they exit court appointments. 
Benson said he’s observed deportation flights out of MSP on planes owned by Key Lime Air, also known as Denver Air Connection; Eastern Air Express; and, up until a few months ago, GlobalX. The airlines use space and services from Signature Aviation, which runs a private aircraft terminal at MSP. None of the companies responded to Reformer requests for comment.
“The airline companies, they are not only complicit, but they are responsible. They are making an active choice to pick profits from the federal government over human lives,” said Drew Harmon, chair of Minnesota 50501, a progressive grassroots group organized in response to the second Trump term.

Azogue, one of the deportees who passed through MSP, was arrested at the federal courthouse at Fort Snelling after a hearing in his asylum case, he said.
He was under the impression that he would have a chance to appeal his case in a future hearing. He has no criminal record. When he exited the courtroom, agents arrested him. 
“We show up for court trustingly, thinking we’re doing everything right, but what we don’t know is that when we get there, it’s like a trick,” Azogue said in Spanish. 
He landed in Guayaquíl, Ecuador, hours from the mountain town where his family lives. When he landed, he had $40, no way to contact his family, and no access to the small savings he’d built while cleaning commercial buildings overnight in Minneapolis. He bought a bus ticket with the cash and borrowed a phone from the woman sitting next to him so he could let his family know he was on his way.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/NN251112_0220-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-19 07:57:14.385249

In 2015, a trial court in Choctaw County sentenced Marcus Taylor to 15 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to conspiring to sell opioid painkillers. But the plea petition was erroneous; it incorrectly cited the maximum sentence for conspiracy to sell schedule III controlled substances as being 20 years. In fact, the maximum sentence was only five years, and should have ended in 2020. 
At the time of his sentence, nobody in court, including Taylor’s then attorney, realized the error, which only came to light when Taylor claimed eligibility for parole in 2023. In May this year, five years after he ought to have been released, the Mississippi Court of Appeals acknowledged that he was serving a sentence 10 years longer than the maximum. But it refused to rectify the error because Taylor, now 43, had applied for post-conviction relief after the three-year deadline to file had already passed. 
Now, the Mississippi Court of Appeals has withdrawn its own opinion and ordered Taylor’s release. 
“When a trial court acts outside the scope of its authority, its actions are void,” the Tuesday order says. “As over a century of precedent firmly establishes, our Judiciary has the inherent power to correct this error.”
Joe Hemleben, Taylor’s attorney, said, “The court made the  right decision to correct, rather than condone this injustice.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/10095411/RenderedImage.jpeg,,,2025-11-19 07:57:14.385249

(Baylor Spears | Wisconsin Examiner)During its last floor session of the year, the Wisconsin Senate passed bills Tuesday that would eliminate the annual $325 revenue increase for school districts, define abortion to not include treatment for ectopic pregnancies and other emergency medical conditions and block state and local dollars from being used on health care for people not legally in the country.
Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) said she is “dismayed” and “disgusted” that lawmakers were not taking up bills that focused on affordability. She said she is open to working across the aisle on the issue.
“Republicans do not care about affordability, and they have no plan about affordability either,” Hesselbein said. “There are no bills on this calendar that will lower prescription drug costs, increase access to health care, lower housing costs or make child care more affordable.”
Sen. Sarah Keyeski (D-Lodi) noted a few of the more than 60 bills lawmakers were scheduled to take up and questioned whether they addressed pressing matters. 
“Republicans, who determine the issues and bills we focus on, today are addressing things like exempting tobacco bars from the public smoking ban, delaying the implementation of commercial building code rules,” Keyeski said. “While these may be worthy issues to discuss, I would suggest that it does not meet the threshold of emergent need when families are facing dire economic circumstances. GOP legislators are essentially forcing us to sit idly by and watch Wisconsinites suffer.”
Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) said at a press conference that Democratic lawmakers were just “filibustering” and rejected the claim that Republicans weren’t working to help with affordability in the state.
“We passed a budget which had the second largest tax cut in state history to get money back into people’s pockets for utility bills, for retirees on fixed incomes, for middle class tax cuts. We’re doing everything we can to try to keep things affordable, ending the 400-year veto so taxes don’t go up in the next budget process,” LeMahieu said. “We are very concerned. It seems like Democrats can make these statements, but yet they’re introducing bills that let local governments increase their levies to tax, raise property taxes, and everything else, so it seems a little disingenuous.”
Republicans advance bill to eliminate 400-year veto
The Senate voted to pass a bill that would reverse Gov. Tony Evers’ partial veto that extended school revenue limit increases for 400 years. 
Lawmakers during the 2023-25 state budget gave school districts a $325 increase to schools’ revenue limits for the 2023-24 and 2024-25 school years. When the bill reached Evers’ desk, he exercised his partial veto power, striking two digits and a dash from the years to extend the annual increases through 2425, to lawmakers’ dismay. The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled in April that the partial veto was within Evers’ powers.
In response, lawmakers introduced SB 389 to eliminate the $325 per pupil school revenue limit increase beginning in the 2027-28 school year. It passed along party lines. 
“We’re very concerned with the ruling of the state Supreme Court, but what we want to do is to clarify that the original intent of the Legislature in the budget was to increase school funding for the next budget period,” Sen. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield), a coauthor of the bill, said. “He changed the bill in a way that no governor in the history of the state of Wisconsin has changed [a bill], and that’s very concerning for us because the Legislature is where the voice of a people is supposed to take place, and the governor is supposed to look at that and use his veto authority to determine where he stands on that, but he went far beyond what’s ever been done before.”
Democratic lawmakers defended the revenue limit increases, saying it is helping school districts that have struggled without inflationary increases in state funding.
“As fists clench over the 400-year veto, know this, it doesn’t even make up for inflation. What it does is, it provides a minimum increase for what people can expect,” Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) said. “Unfortunately, with this vote, it is trying to go back and trying to actually make a horrible budget even worse by saying not only are we giving you zero dollars in general aid increase…, but more than that, we’re also going to bar the local school district from making up for that gap by being able to allow them to vote for an increased property tax.”
Larson said that the law could have been changed during the 2025-27 state budget process and that it is the state’s fault that property taxes are bearing the brunt of the increases.
“Everybody who voted for the budget, in essence, voted for the continuation of the $325 dollars per pupil increase to be passed on to local taxpayers to make up the difference,” Larson said. “If you had wanted to change it, there were two things that you could have done. One, you could have voted to have that ended and substituted with a different per-pupil increase. Second thing is, you could have had the state actually fund those increases using funds from the increasing general aid or using the vast surplus that we have, taking money from the agriculture manufacturing tax credit [or] anywhere else, and you could have actually funded our kids.”
Redefining abortion
The Senate also passed SB 553, which seeks to redefine abortion to exempt treatments for certain medical conditions including the removal of a dead embryo or fetus, an ectopic, anembryonic or molar pregnancy.
Bill coauthor Sen. Romaine Quinn (R-Birchwood) said during a press conference that he wanted to remove confusion from state statute, saying he is “pro-life” and hasn’t wanted to stop women from being able to receive the medical care that they need. 
“Women who need medical attention due to situations of stillbirths, miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies or other related issues, can and should receive the care that they need. That has always been the pro-life position,” Quinn said. “This bill before us today does not ban abortions. It does not restrict abortions, it simply clarifies our laws so that both women and medical providers can do what is necessary in those situations.”
Wisconsin has a web of abortion restrictions in place, including a 20-week ban, but confusion soared in the state after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. An 1849 law interpreted as a near-total abortion ban led health care providers afraid of felony charges to deny care to women who faced miscarriage and life-threatening pregnancy complications.
Recently, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, the state’s largest abortion provider, stopped providing abortion care in part due to federal changes.
Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) said the lawmakers were trying to distance themselves from “the horrors that we are seeing in states that have banned and restricted abortion.” The Assembly coauthor, Rep. Joy Goeben (R-Hobart) said in September that she introduced it in part because Republicans are getting “killed” on the abortion issue during elections, although she said she favors a total abortion ban.
“Women being turned away from hospital emergency rooms repeatedly, being left to bleed out in Walmart parking lots. In fact, women are dying because they are denied timely abortion care that could easily have saved their lives, and their children left orphaned,” Roys said. “That’s the reality of what it looks like when you ban and restrict access to abortion in this country.”
Recent polling done by Marquette Law School found that abortion policy has declined as a “most important” issue among voters across all partisan groups in 2025 as compared to 2022, although 50% of respondents still said they were “very concerned” and 23% said they were “somewhat concerned” about the issue. 
Another recent poll found that 78% of voters support protecting health care professionals from criminal charges related to providing abortion care and 72% of voters favor allowing advanced health care providers like nurse practitioners and midwives to provide abortion care.

Roys said she was also concerned that the bill could push physicians to do emergency C-sections rather than terminate pregnancies as a way of addressing health issues. 
“Abortion is a necessary medical procedure that sometimes pregnant people need to save their lives, to preserve their health, to preserve their future fertility, and nothing in this bill is going to change that,” Roys said. “This bill will instead push physicians to force women to have unnecessary C-sections or to induce delivery rather than providing them with abortion. A C-section is much more dangerous. It is much more invasive. It’s major abdominal surgery that takes weeks or months to recover from, and it also impairs a woman’s future ability to be pregnant to have the labor and delivery that she wishes.”
The bill will now go to the Assembly for consideration. 
Restricting health care for immigrants
The Senate concurred 21-12 in AB 308, which would prohibit state, county, village, long-term care district and federal funds from being used to subsidize, reimburse or provide compensation for any health care services for a person not lawfully in the United States. Sens. Sarah Keyeski (D-Lodi), Brad Pfaff (D-Onalaska) and Jamie Wall (D-Green Bay) joined Republicans in favor. 
Bill coauthor Sen. Van Wanggaard (R-Racine) said the bill would ensure that Wisconsin doesn’t begin spending large amounts of money on people who aren’t legally in the country. He noted that other states, including Minnesota and California, have rescinded or paused providing coverage for people not legally in the U.S. 
“[Illinois] did an audit and found that they had spent nearly $900 million on health care benefits for illegal aliens, about a 200% increase, and then in Minnesota, the Legislature, by bipartisan vote, they voted to end the eligibility for illegal immigrants due to questions about their state’s financial well-being, and then, lastly, wonderful, California. Gov. [Gavin] Newsom recently froze enrollment of illegal immigrants into the state’s medical programs, citing California’s $12 billion budget deficit,” Wanggaard said at a press conference. “We’re looking at something that is really a no-brainer.”
Wisconsin already doesn’t allow immigrants without legal authorization to apply for the state’s Medicaid program, BadgerCare.
There are two programs available to those without legal status outlined on the Department of Health Services website: Medicaid Emergency Services, which provides short-term medical coverage for people who have a medical emergency and aren’t eligible for BadgerCare Plus or Wisconsin Medicaid, and BadgerCare Plus Prenatal Plan, which provides health care coverage for pregnant mothers who are not eligible for BadgerCare Plus due to immigration status or being in prison or jail.
Democratic lawmakers accused Republicans of seeking to make a political point and neglecting to address health care costs and accessibility.
“We are not in an affordability crisis because of less than 1% of BadgerCare funds that are used to save lives,” Sen. Dora Drake (D-Milwaukee) said. “This is cruel, it is a mean-spirited bill that is attempting to score cheap political points off of a group that’s already marginalized enough.” 
Advocates have warned that the bill could have a “chilling effect,” discouraging people from seeking care when they need it.
“Why is this sort of thing even coming up for discussion? Are we that heartless? Have we really lost our vision for this country?” Sen. Jeff Smith (D-Brunswick) asked. “These are all messaging to somebody’s base. Terrible people who are coming here to work in our factories, in our fields without the proper papers need to be punished… How heartless are we to make political points? Go ahead and make your god dang political points.”
The Assembly passed the bill in September, so it will now go to Evers for consideration. 
Other bills passed by the Senate Tuesday include:  

AB 165, which would ban local governments from using tax money to create guaranteed income programs without a work or training requirement. The Assembly passed the bill along party lines in April and the Senate concurred in it 18-15 so it will now go to Evers for consideration. 
AB 265, which would require judges to sentence people convicted of human trafficking to at least 10 years in prison, or at least 15 years for trafficking a child, was concurred in in an 18-15 party line vote. Democratic lawmakers expressed concerns about young victims of sex trafficking potentially facing mandatory minimums if they are forced to participate in trafficking, while Republicans brushed away those concerns. 
SB 498 passed 17-16 with Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) joining Democrats against it. The bill would place specific freedom of speech requirements into state statute, including barring campuses from restricting speakers on campus, and implement new penalties, including a tuition freeze, if a campus violates any parts of the bill.
SB 394 would make it a Class I felony to damage or graffiti structures, plaques, statues, paintings or other monuments on public property or that is maintained by the state or any county or municipality. It passed 18-15 along party lines.
SB 11, which would require school districts to provide an opportunity for certain federally chartered youth membership organizations, including the Girl Scouts, to give students information about their organizations. It passed by a voice vote. The Assembly is scheduled to vote on the bill on Wednesday.
SB 16, which would make the Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association subject to open records and open meeting laws, passed 22-11.

Joe Lombardo’s sweeping crime bill, with the introduction of an amendment adding provisions that would protect students from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and a brand new bill whose language mirrors two key components of the crime bill.
In a late-night meeting, lawmakers introduced Senate Bill 9, which contains the crime bill’s “opt out” resorts corridor language and provisions that would make punishments stricter for people who attack hotel workers.
The Senate also passed Assembly Bill 4, known as the governor’s crime bill, but with an amendment. The amendment would require detention centers to maintain real-time, publicly available lists of all the people they are detaining. The amendment would also prohibit school districts from allowing access to law enforcement — like ICE — from accessing school grounds or records without a lawful order or warrant.
AB4 passed 16-2 with bipartisan support. Democratic state Sens. Dina Neal and James Ohrenshall cast the two votes against. Republican state Sens. Robin Titus, Jeff Stone and John Ellison were not present at the meeting.
The bill now heads to the Assembly, which will have to vote on adopting the amendment.
The curious case of the immigration resolution that immigrant advocates don’t want

The amended bill reflects some of the asks of immigration advocates and the Latino Legislative Caucus, who have publicly criticized the Republican governor and Democratic legislative leadership for not taking action on immigration.
Together, the introduction of the immigration-focused amendment, paired with a stripped-down parallel crime bill, set up a scenario where the Republican governor might veto his own marquee crime bill and instead pass a less comprehensive bill that would still get across the finish line priorities for the resort industry and Culinary union.
What’s in the crime bill
The amended crime bill covers several areas of criminal law — from increasing penalties for DUI-related offenses to expanding the definition of stalking to banning criminal offenders from the resort corridor — and more. 
During the regular session earlier this year both the Assembly and Senate passed different versions of the bill. The Senate was forced to adjourn before they were able to vote on adopting the Assembly’s amendment.
The bill has received criticism from civil liberty groups who say it is an attempt to rollback modest criminal justice reforms passed by lawmakers in 2019.
Washoe County District Attorney Chris Hicks, who helped present the bill to lawmakers, called the bill “common sense criminal justice reform” and said it would not roll back those 2019 provisions, which were aimed at reducing Nevada’s growing prison population and recidivism rates.
“We are not talking about a rollback of AB236,” Hicks told lawmakers during an Assembly committee hearing, referring to the 2019 measure. “Nothing in this proposed bill rolls back AB236. What we are talking about is what will help all Nevadans.” 
The legislation attracted a slew of testimony opposing key provision in the bill, with some provisions drawing more ire than others.
Resorts back Lombardo crime bill containing key requests from gaming industry

One of the more controversial provisions would allow courts to ban certain criminal offenders from the resort corridor for up to a year. The bill includes language giving the Justice Court the authority to reestablish a Resort Corridor Court – a short-lived specialty court created to deal with low-level crimes on the Strip that was disbanded amid questions about its legality.
The bill, however, had the backing of the politically-hefty gaming industry and was co-presented by the Nevada Resort Association. Several gaming companies spoke in support of the crime bill, including Red Rock Resorts, Caesars Entertainment, Boyd Gaming Corporation, MGM Resorts International, and Wynn Resorts.
Provisions in the crime bill mirror the functions of the Resort Corridor Court, which gaming industry leaders argued was effective at deterring low-level crimes on the Strip, often by barring offenders from entering the tourist district for months at a time. 
The bill would require Nevada’s two most populous countries — Clark and Washoe County — to adopt ordinances creating one or more high-traffic corridors where harsher penalties could be imposed because of  higher risk to public safety.
“Recidivism continues to be a significant issue in our tourism areas,” Virginia Valentine, the president and CEO of the Nevada Resort Association, told lawmakers during an Assembly committee hearing. “During the resort court operation, resort security reported a decrease in crime.”
Athar Haseebullah, the executive director of the ACLU of Nevada, argued the bill would privatize part of the judicial system for the purpose of banning homeless people from the resort corridor. 
“This was a court used to target the unhoused. If it was only about gaming properties, it would have been limited to what occurs inside of the casinos, but it’s not. It was used to target people on the street beyond this,” Haseebullah said during an Assembly hearing. 
One portion of the crime bill expands the definition of stalking to include dating relationships and cyberstalking via social media.
Marc Randazza, one of the top First Amendment lawyers in the state, said those provisions are well-intended but “wildly unconstitutional.”  
“I would be happy to work with you on a solution, but this legislation is wildly unconstitutional, please do not sign it. I will be challenging it if you do,” Randazza said Tuesday in a social media post tagging Lombardo.
The bill would list defamation, threats, and inciting violence on social media as unprotected by the First Amendment and punishable under the bill. It would also define continued social media communication towards someone without their consent within those categories as unlawful.
During committee hearings in the Assembly, the Clark County Public Defender’s Office also raised concerns that language around social media in the bill was “overly broad.”
Don Southworth, the offender management administrator for NDOC, said a community transition program included in the bill could potentially reduce the overall population in custody, offsetting some costs.
“We do expect a population reduction of as many as 500 offenders that would be eliminated from our in-house custody,” Southworth told lawmakers during an Assembly hearing. 
The alternative correctional program established in the crime bill would focus on offenders within 18 months of discharge, who are non-violent offenders that fit specific criteria, said NDOC Director James Dzurenda. The program would include home visits, release plans, and monitoring through a contract with a company, including video visiting and drug testing.
Several other measures were included in the crime bill. The bill adds kidnapping and attempted kidnapping to the list of felony domestic violence offenses. Under the bill, child pornography possession would be charged per image. The bill eliminates automatic sealing of records for offenses against children or the elderly. It also increases penalties for DUI-related offenses and establishes an alternative correctional program.
Other provisions in the bill include defining “smash and grab theft” as a felony if property damage and theft value exceeds $750. The bill would also require a mental health evaluation for children who have committed multiple attacks on school employees or child welfare professionals before they can return to school. 
Other crime and safety bills
Assembly Bill 6 would enhance penalties for certain traffic violations in active school zones and school crossing zones. It would also give school districts the ability to extend the time for school zone enforcement. The bill comes amid a sharp increase in the number of students hit by vehicles in school zones this year. The Senate unanimously passed AB4 on Tuesday. The bill heads back to the Assembly, which will need to approve an amendment made by the Senate. After that, it will head to the governor’s desk.
Assembly Bill 1 would bolster cybersecurity initiatives in the wake of a major cyberattack that paralyzed multiple state offices and services for weeks. AB1 has been delivered to the governor for final approval.
Assembly Bill 3 would boost privacy protections for public officers who wish to keep personal information confidential.  The Nevada Press Association opposed the bill arguing it goes far beyond existing exemptions and would error transparency. AB3 has been delivered to the governor for final approval.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/metro-cops-cars-e1763551217559-1024x679.jpg,,,2025-11-19 06:56:28.528288

Micah Beckwith and Secretary of State Diego Morales give remarks during a pro-redistricting rally on Tuesday, Nov. 18, 2025, at the Indiana Statehouse. (Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A few dozen Hoosiers gathered under the Indiana Statehouse rotunda Tuesday morning to call on lawmakers to approve new congressional district maps that could give Republicans a 9-0 advantage in the U.S. House delegation.
The event coincided with Organization Day, the ceremonial start of the 2026 legislative session, when lawmakers return to Indianapolis to set priorities for the months ahead.
Many attendees wore stickers and held signs reading “9-0” and “Let’s get this done!” Organizers also asked participants to fill out postcards urging their state senators to “PLEASE SUPPORT REDISTRICTING.”
The calls are part of a national movement among Republican activists and political leaders to demand that Indiana’s GOP-controlled General Assembly redraw the state’s congressional map so that all nine districts are represented by Republicans, instead of the current 7-2 split.
Supporters argue that Democrat-led states have drawn maps favorable to their own party and that Indiana should respond in kind. 
But key Statehouse Republicans have rebutted. 
Senate GOP leadership announced last week that the caucus lacks the necessary votes to pass redistricting legislation and — despite an official special session order from the governor — will not convene in December to consider new maps.
The Senate chamber additionally voted on Tuesday to adjourn until Jan. 5 —  further refusing redistricting efforts.
Beckwith, Morales drop in
Gov. Mike Braun, Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray and House Speaker Todd Huston were just steps away at a separate Statehouse event on Tuesday. None appeared at the pro-redistricting gathering.
But Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith and Secretary of State Diego Morales both made remarks, prompting short bursts of “9-0” chants from the crowd.

“Redistricting is not a political stunt,” Beckwith said. “This is the most bipartisan issue on the face of the earth when you have Akeem Jeffries, (U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez), Gavin Newsom, Donald Trump, Mike Braun, Micah Beckwith and Diego Morales all saying the same thing. This is the most bipartisan issue in America right now.”
“We are standing up for a fair voice in Washington, D.C., and so we want the fair maps,” he continued. “We want the maps to be redrawn because places like Illinois, California and New England states are stealing our voice in D.C. Redistricting is the right thing to do. We should stand with the president, stand with the governor, and I’m proud to do so.”
Shortly after, Morales addressed the crowd, too, calling redistricting an urgent priority.
“Republicans need to start acting like Republicans,” Morales said. “We didn’t start this fight, but if we don’t stand up now, we risk letting Washington drown Indiana’s voice.”
The secretary of state emphasized that Indiana “needs a nine-zero, America first delegation representing us in Congress.” 
“Zero hesitation, zero backing down — because the stakes are too high,” Morales said. “Show up. Stand up for fair maps. Stand up for President Trump and our Hoosier State.”
‘We deserve to know where everyone stands’
John and LeAnne Kendall of Hancock County said they attended the rally because they believe the issue affects both state and national representation. Their state senator, Mike Crider, has not publicly stated where he stands on redistricting, but he was among the senators who voted Tuesday to adjourn until January.
“This is one of the most critical issues in our country right now, and we have a great opportunity in Indiana to make a difference — an impact in Congress — that will make sure everyone from this state is represented as they should be,” John said. “Indiana is an overwhelmingly Republican state.”
LeAnne added that “states have been badly gerrymandered by Democrats for too long,” and said state senators “need to get their act together” and “answer the call.”
“They need to show up, and they need to vote,” she continued. “I think the votes are there. … And there would be a lot more ‘yeses’ if they had to vote live, in front of all of us. We deserve to know where everyone stands, because this is what Hoosiers want.”
Three statewide polls have found Hoosiers against redistricting. 
Still, John pointed to Indiana’s most recent election results from November 2024, which he said was evidence that “a majority” of Hoosiers want “solid Republican representation” at both the state and federal levels.
“We can’t afford to have uncommitted, RINOs in office,” John said, referring to an acronym that most commonly means “Republican in name only.”
“Republicans (in Indiana) deserve and demand a 9-0 map,” he continued. “It’s anti-Republican and anti-American, in my view, for the people we put into office — in the Statehouse — to deny us that.”

,WyoFile,2025-11-19 11:30:00+00:00,WyoFile,"Politics, press and philanthropy: How a Jackson Hole billionaire couple is shaping Wyoming","By Andrew Graham,WyoFile; Sophia Boyd-Fliegel, KHOL 89.1 FM; Jasmine Hall, Jackson Hole News&Guide",,,,,https://wyofile.com/politics-press-and-philanthropy-how-a-jackson-hole-billionaire-couple-is-shaping-wyoming/,"

In the eight years since B. Wayne Jr. and Molly Hughes moved to Jackson, the billionaire couple has quickly made a mark on Wyoming. Whether Wyomingites know the Hugheses’ names or not, they've likely been impacted by the couple’s philanthropy, political donations or ownership of the Cowboy State Daily.
The post Politics, press and philanthropy: How a Jacks[...]","At the entrance to the Old Bill’s award party last month — Jackson Hole’s signature charity celebration — people rushing into a music- and balloon-filled arts center stopped to talk about B. Wayne Jr. and Molly Hughes. A few newcomers to town said they’d never heard of them, but most people on their way to pick up checks raved about the billionaire couple. 
One woman told a reporter how much money they’ve given to youth services. Another fondly recalled them as the family who made a Jackson farmstand affordable. 
“Are there people who haven’t heard of them?” one attendee said in passing.
Yet, outside Teton County, Wyomingites may not know much about the transplants who moved to Jackson Hole eight years ago from California. That appears fine with the couple, who tend to avoid the spotlight. The Hugheses, who have stated a desire to let their work speak for itself, declined to be interviewed for this story. 
Regardless of whether Wyomingites immediately recognize the Hugheses’ name, they are nevertheless likely to feel their increasing influence on the state’s civic life. If an Equality State resident receives services from a food bank, has a loved one getting charitable treatment for drug and alcohol addiction, tunes into Wyoming PBS or reads the digital news outlet Cowboy State Daily, there’s a good chance they’re touched by the couple’s largesse.  
Hughes Jr. has owned Cowboy State Daily, which describes itself as the state’s most read news organization, since 2022. The Hughes Charitable Foundation has distributed or pledged about $75 million to a wide variety of Wyoming nonprofits since entering the state in 2017.
In the political arena, Hughes Jr. has donated more than $637,000 to Wyoming statehouse candidates and political action committees — a substantive sum for Wyoming, where legislative campaigns are increasingly expensive, but remain low-budget affairs compared to other states. 
To be sure, there are other wealthy Equality State families known for their giving with names such as Friess, Kemmerer, Ellbogan, Storer and McMurry. But the details of the Hugheses’ charitable and political contributions, coupled with Hughes Jr.’s ownership of one of the state’s most visible media ventures, outline a remarkable impact on Wyoming from a single family.

Worth approximately $2 billion by press time Tuesday, according to Forbes, Hughes Jr. and his wife have donated to organizations that help children and the elderly, combat poverty and domestic violence, counter addiction and ease Jackson Hole’s affordable housing crisis. Their checks can change the trajectory of cash-strapped Wyoming nonprofits, people in that world say.
The Hugheses’ investments in Wyoming come at a time when elected officials in both Cheyenne and Washington, D.C., are paring back government services and shrinking tax revenues that fund public schools, public health programs and public amenities. In Wyoming, where charitable dollars are often hard to find outside of Jackson Hole, philanthropists like the Hugheses are increasingly essential to the state’s social safety net. 
Hughes Jr. has also financially supported President Donald Trump — to the tune of at least $2 million for his two inaugurations, according to federal campaign finance filings — and congressional Republicans in Washington, who have cut taxes for the wealthy and corporations while downsizing public services. 
It’s unclear which parts of the president’s agenda Hughes Jr. specifically supports. But it is clear he believes the wealthy should do more through philanthropy to raise up the places where they live. 
In a 2021 op-ed in Cowboy State Daily, the publication he would later buy, Hughes Jr. called on other wealthy people moving to Jackson Hole to treat Teton County as more than just a picturesque tax shelter.
“Teton County is not for everyone,” he wrote, “but for those of us who call it home it’s time to start caring, time to start speaking out, and it’s time to start giving. Many of us have seen the problem and it is us.”
Hughes Jr. did not shy away from acknowledging his own good fortune. 
“And to those that say ‘the problem cannot be solved so why try?’ — they need to look into their hearts and realize that ‘There, but for the grace of God, go I,’” he wrote. 
Quiet benefactors
B. Wayne Hughes Jr., who is in his mid-60s, shares the name of his father, Bradley Wayne Hughes, who died in August 2021. The senior Hughes was a self-made man, the son of a sharecropper who moved from Oklahoma to Southern California’s San Gabriel Valley during the Dust Bowl, according to news reports and obituaries at the time of his death. 
Hughes Sr. worked in several industries but made his fortune after founding Public Storage in the 1970s. The self-storage company — recognizable by its bright orange logo — was revolutionary, and Hughes Sr. “built a fortune storing Americans’ excess stuff,” as Forbes put it. 
To the extent that Hughes Jr. avoids the limelight connected to his philanthropy, it’s a habit he may have learned from the family’s patriarch. In 2019, the Los Angeles Times identified Hughes Sr. as the anonymous donor behind nearly $400 million in giving to his alma mater, the University of Southern California. Most people who donate to universities at that scale have buildings named after them. Not Hughes Sr. 


Editor’s note: 
While reporting this story, reporters first reached out to Molly Hughes, who declined several times to be interviewed. After reporters sent a written interview request to the couple, they received a response in the form of a cautioning letter from former Wyoming governor and attorney Mike Sullivan.
The former Democratic governor referenced the recent assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, and said the Hugheses had concerns that too much attention on their personal lives could expose them to risk. 
“The confluence of events and timing of your profile places a particular burden on you as responsible journalists not to put any members of the Hughes family at risk of danger or harm by reason of their political beliefs, which are admittedly conservative, or by their generosity of spirit,” Sullivan wrote. The Hugheses asked WyoFile, KHOL and the News&Guide to refrain from sharing certain personal details, which the reporters had already planned to avoid. 
Hughes Jr. also declined an interview, saying an interview with a Hughes Charitable Foundation board member should suffice. 
“From my perspective you’ve got enough information. I’m going to pass,” he wrote in an email. 


In a 2014 Forbes article, Hughes Jr. told a reporter he became more serious about philanthropy in the late 2000s and early 2010s after finding his Christian faith in his late 30s and becoming jaded after a stint of seeking change through Washington politics. 
An avid cowboy and outdoorsman, he at the time hosted struggling veterans at his California ranch, helping them confront their problems in a luxurious outdoor setting. He joined liberal billionaires like George Soros in backing, both through significant donations and personal advocacy in Sacramento, a successful 2014 state ballot measure to reduce prison sentences for minor crimes and drug offenses, Proposition 47. 
In 2024, California voters reversed that law amid growing crime and public safety concerns. Hughes Jr. donated $1.27 million to back the ballot measure in 2014, but does not appear to have financially supported the more recent campaign to defend the measure, per California Secretary of State campaign finance records.
The Hugheses also have a home in Hawaii, where Hughes Jr. started a media organization, Aloha State Daily, inspired by Cowboy State Daily. He is reportedly a skilled and passionate surfer.

Hughes Jr. has described his philanthropic giving as focused on people in the “impact zone.” In surfing, that’s a dreaded place to be — trapped where the waves are breaking, unable to reach safety farther out to sea, or to make it back to shore. In the impact zone, wave after wave breaks overhead as a surfer battles for survival. It’s disorienting and dangerous. Hughes Jr. compares that battle with the ocean to the struggles of people trapped in a cycle of addiction and poverty.
“Our philanthropy is focused on supporting the poor, hungry, oppressed, imprisoned, housing insecure, veterans, women and children, and Indigenous communities,” the Hughes Charitable Foundation website states. 
Molly Hughes, a professional fundraiser for over 30 years, has spoken less publicly. She is also known to be deeply guided by her religious faith. People who have worked with her describe her as the brains behind the foundation’s operations, thoughtful and dedicated. Sources said that Molly, the foundation’s executive director since 2018, avoids the limelight but is committed to the belief that the nation’s donor class should give away more to those in need.
Indeed, even in a place as thick with billionaires as Teton County, the Hugheses’ giving stands out. 
Unique and diverse giving strategy
In 2021, far from the Tetons and Jackson Hole’s luxury homes, Ryan Anderson found himself staring at double-digit inflation and a budget that didn’t balance. The leader of Gillette’s Youth Emergency Services House needed about $1 million — roughly 18% of his budget at the time — to retain staff specially trained to provide court-ordered residential care to youth. 
Because the YES House offers, in part, court-mandated care, Anderson’s budget comes largely from federal and state agencies and grants. Not only were reimbursement rates flagging, he said, but many government grants are restricted in ways that make it difficult to pay for basic organizational needs. 


In stepped the Hughes Charitable Foundation. 
After just a few months of discussion, Anderson secured a $1 million grant from the foundation to give staff a pay raise with retention incentives. His employees could continue their work providing housing, outpatient treatment and therapeutic services to Campbell County’s most vulnerable young people. 
“It was incredibly valuable to us in a time when we really needed it,” Anderson said.
Beginning in 2017, when the Hughes Charitable Foundation entered Wyoming, it has distributed or pledged an estimated $75 million to more than 300 Wyoming nonprofits, according to public filings and interviews. The foundation did not respond to requests for an exact number. 
Its annual giving has grown rapidly in recent years. From 2017 to 2021, the foundation donated about $4 million in total, according to public records. In contrast, in the past four years, it has donated about $12 million a year.
(While never a direct recipient of a Hughes Charitable Foundation grant, WyoFile has benefited financially from the foundation’s support of WyoGives Day, a program of the Wyoming Nonprofit Network. Specifically, WyoFile has received a little over $66,000 in WyoGives matching and incentive-pool funds since 2021. Like all Teton County nonprofits, KHOL does not qualify for the match and has not received a foundation grant.)
There are a handful of foundations that operate around the state, and very few of them are generalists and give statewide likes the Hugheses’ foundation does, said Samin Dadelahi, president and CEO of the Wyoming Community Foundation. A veteran of the state’s philanthropy scene, Dadelahi considers her organization and two others, the John P. Ellbogen Foundation and Newell B. Sargent Foundation, the only grant-making nonprofits with as broad and deep a reach in Wyoming as the Hughes Charitable Foundation. That’s because many of Wyoming’s other prominent family foundations either restrict the use of their donations more tightly — focusing on specific geographic regions or causes — or give broadly outside the state. The Hughes Charitable Foundation does give elsewhere, but is focused on Wyoming.
“They have a really traditional lens when it comes to charity, in that they are focusing on those bottom-line safety net services.” Samin Dadelahi, president and CEO of the Wyoming Community Foundation
Direct comparisons between private foundations can be challenging to make, but Dadelahi estimated that the foundation’s giving since 2021 has amounted to 10% of all institutional philanthropy statewide each year. 
“In some ways, they have a really traditional lens when it comes to charity, in that they are focusing on those bottom-line safety net services like food, like housing, youth homes, mental health and wellness,” Dadelahi said. 
The Hughes Charitable Foundation’s board is staffed by Wyoming luminaries, including Marilyn Kite, a retired Wyoming Supreme Court justice, the first female on the state’s high-court bench and first to serve as chief justice. Rather than trying to shape Wyoming according to its vision, the foundation is “focused on where the human needs are, and so that’s why it looks so broad,” Kite said. 
By dollar figure, the foundation’s top areas of giving are affordable housing, Indigenous affairs and youth services. 
In Teton County alone, the foundation has donated or pledged more than $25 million to housing, which town and county leaders cite as the most critical need in one of the nation’s tightest housing markets. Bolstering first lady of Wyoming Jennie Gordon’s hunger initiative, the Hugheses have helped support the state’s food insecurity efforts. 
“The [hunger] needs are so significant in virtually every county in this state,” Kite said.

The Hughes Charitable Foundation — and Wyoming’s philanthropic sector in general — still doesn’t match the state government’s spending and reach on public services, nonprofit experts note. But the foundation stands out through giving that carries a certain “democratic” flair, said Gabel Taggart, an assistant professor at the University of Wyoming who studies nonprofits and giving motivations and serves on the board of the Wyoming Nonprofit Network.
In 2021, the Hugheses’ foundation gave $1 million to the Wyoming Nonprofit Network to establish an innovative match program for established nonprofits as part of the WyoGives fundraising drive, which already existed. Each year since, WyoGives has distributed $1 million from the foundation as part of that match program. 
The Hugheses’ WyoGives incentive excludes nonprofits in Teton County’s already robust philanthropic scene. This was intended to target areas that Wyoming Nonprofit Network Director Jody Shields calls “philanthropy deserts.” If a county’s poverty rate is relatively high, the foundation offers nonprofits there a larger match. 
A new media mogul
A wealthy, religious and politically conservative Jacksonite donated the money to start Cowboy State Daily, an online-only Wyoming media outlet, but his last name wasn’t Hughes. 
Coming off his unsuccessful 2018 run for governor, the financier and conservative megadonor Foster Friess provided seed money for the fledgling nonprofit newsroom, according to past reporting and the news organization’s founding members. 
The new organization was helmed by two people: media veteran Jimmy Orr, who served as an internet strategist for President George W. Bush and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, and as a digital editor at the Los Angeles Times; and Anneliese Wiederspahn, the daughter of U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis.
Bill Sniffin, a longtime Wyoming journalist and publisher from Lander who had worked for Friess on his gubernatorial campaign, joined Cowboy State in January 2020.

By then, Sniffin told a reporter for this story, Friess’ startup money had dwindled, and the financier had indicated he would not provide more. 
Cowboy State Daily occasionally found other donors, Sniffin recalled, and another lifeline came through a $150,000 grant in federal COVID-19 funds administered by the Wyoming Business Council. 
By the end of 2021, Cowboy State Daily “was hanging on for dear life,” Orr said in an October interview. The outlet “didn’t have much time left at all,” he said. 
Two years later, Cowboy State Daily was rapidly acquiring the broadest reach of any news organization in Wyoming, according to Orr. Its roster of staff reporters was growing, and it had become prolific in the Wyoming digital news landscape and even the state’s physical landscape. New billboards along Interstate 80 pitched Cowboy State Daily as a media outlet for those who “drink upstream from the herd.” 
Cowboy State Daily was no longer in financial trouble. It was also no longer a nonprofit. 
The difference was Hughes Jr. 
In 2021, the Hughes Charitable Foundation donated $50,000 to Cowboy State Daily, according to tax records compiled for WyoFile by the Sunlight Research Center, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research organization. Sniffin had reached out to Hughes Jr. while “desperate for donations,” he said. 
The donation was listed in the foundation’s tax filing as “contingent on the completion of two strategy discussions” with the outlet’s senior staff.
Orr, the editor, and Hughes Jr., the billionaire, connected over the media outlet’s newsletter, which Hughes Jr. subscribed to and enjoyed, Orr said. And Orr, whose career in national media largely focused on developing the digital side of publications like the Los Angeles Times, said Hughes Jr. was impressed by his grasp of metrics and readers’ online behavior.
In February 2022, Cowboy State Daily announced its new proprietor. 
“A Wyoming businessman and philanthropist has purchased the assets of Cowboy State Daily,” read the subtitle of a Feb. 11, 2022 article written by Orr.
The story did not share the details of the outlet’s transition, in which the nonprofit was disbanded and a new LLC was formed with Hughes Jr. as owner. Nor did it note Hughes Jr.’s reputation as a “conservative mega-donor,” as the Los Angeles Times described him in 2016.
Hughes Jr.’s motivation in buying the outlet, as opposed to funding it as a nonprofit, isn’t clear. Orr framed the switch from nonprofit to business as the billionaire philanthropist’s decision.
“He’s a very successful businessman, and so he structured it the way that he did,” Orr said.

The newsletter today has more than 100,000 subscribers, according to Orr, and is paired with an online video broadcast and radio show that is syndicated by some stations around the state.
“Wayne Hughes invested in people, invested in resources,” Orr said.
Nationally, it’s not unusual for wealthy individuals to purchase media organizations, which are often in financial distress and relatively cheap acquisitions. Buyers’ motivations vary, said David Coppini, an associate professor in the University of Denver’s journalism program.
“It could be a prestige thing, it could be something that adds to their political clout if they have political aspirations. They could have other financial interests it’s connected to,” Coppini said, and “there could also be the possibility that the person is really interested in journalism.” 
A wealthy person’s ownership raises the question of whether they seek to control the news, Coppini said, a charge Hughes Jr. has faced, particularly from far-right figures in Wyoming politics. It’s up to the news outlets to dispel that notion for readers, Coppini said. 
Hughes Jr. has not involved himself in newsroom decision-making, according to Orr and Sniffin. Other former employees of Cowboy State Daily supported that account.
“He lets us run it,” Orr said. “He’s hands off.” 
Nationally, news organizations purchased by the ultra wealthy have seen initial increases in newsroom resources. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, for example, bought the Washington Post and billionaire doctor Patrick Shoon-Shiong acquired the Los Angeles Times. With time, both newspapers saw layoffs, and in the case of the Washington Post, meddling in editorial direction that some staff journalists found deeply unsettling. 
Orr declined to discuss the financial specifics of Hughes Jr.’s investment in Cowboy State Daily, but said the organization had received “a pretty good runway” while it grows its advertising business. Hughes Jr. wants to see the company eventually pay for itself. 
Speaking on a panel at the 2024 Wyoming Governor’s Business Forum, Orr said Hughes Jr. had given Cowboy State Daily “a mandate to be self-sustaining.” 
Orr is optimistic that it can be, he said. 
“It’s like anything, you find your footing, and you get better,” he said. Describing the business’s growth, he said that “sometimes you overreach, then you have to dial it back.”
So far, the Hugheses’ investment in Wyoming journalism, if anything, has only broadened. In August, Wyoming PBS announced that the Hughes Foundation had awarded it a $500,000 grant to help fill a hole left by Trump administration funding cuts.
The donation came roughly a month after Wyoming PBS CEO Joanna Kail penned a column for Cowboy State Daily, in which she laid some of the blame for Trump and congressional Republicans’ cuts to public media at the foot of the organization itself. 
“PBS’s unwillingness to confront growing concerns about ideological bias created a perception that it no longer served the public equally,” she wrote. 
Cowboy State Daily, on the other hand, has rarely wavered from support for Trump’s policies in its opinion pages.

Hughes Jr. likely would have had broad access at the event, as federal filings show he donated $1 million to Trump’s 2025 inauguration committee. He’s a repeat supporter, having given the same amount to Trump’s 2017 inauguration and donated at least $505,600 to his 2020 campaign, according to Federal Election Commission reports. He has also earmarked part of his federal donations to state political parties for Trump’s Victory PAC.
“This election was clearly a middle-class repudiation of Beltway establishment politics, Americans fed up with a dysfunctional government that has taken us down the same wrong road for too long,” Hughes Jr. wrote in a 2016 statement when Trump won his first election. “Both institutions have failed us, and Donald Trump has tapped into a discontentment and mood that I have long felt and expressed — it’s time for us to abandon the antiquated, precepts of the left and right.” 
Campaign finance heavyweight
Hughes Jr. has long been politically active. And he’s brought that activity to Wyoming, where his wealth could have a significant impact.
Campaign finance records indicate that Molly Hughes has contributed substantially less than her husband.
Hughes Jr. did not respond to questions about his political philosophy, what motivates his spending or what future he wants for Wyoming and the nation. But public records of his spending do tell a story. 

While Hughes Jr. has backed Trump financially, and given to many Trump-endorsed candidates at the federal level, his Wyoming political contributions have been more targeted and moderate, campaign finance records show. He’s even given money to some Democrats nationally and in Teton County.
Former Councilor Jim Rooks received money for his campaign when he ran for Jackson Town Council and, most recently, the Teton County Board of County Commissioners. He lost in the 2024 Democratic primary. 
Although Rooks said he and the Hugheses don’t agree on every issue — they are, after all, longstanding conservatives — he said they knew he was a “moderate, practical sense candidate.”
“I accepted donations proudly from my friends,” Rooks said. “They believed in me.”
The first national political contribution recorded under the name B. Wayne Hughes Jr. by the Federal Election Commission came in 1990, when he would have been 31. He put $1,000 toward a California Republican candidate for U.S. Congress running in a strongly Democratic district. Hughes Jr.’s candidate lost. 
Over the course of the next 35 years, Hughes Jr. would pour millions into political races — including in states where he didn’t live. Aside from supporting Trump’s inaugurations, he has made at least 180 federal campaign contributions totaling $2.3 million since 1990, according to reporters’ analysis of Hughes Jr.’s political spending. 
Reporters did not find federal political action committees connected to his name, though Hughes Jr. could have spent more through other avenues, like inaugural committees. 


Before 2010, Hughes Jr. made 10 federal contributions, including to President George W. Bush’s campaign in 2000 and the California State Republican Party. FEC records show he also gave to two Democratic PACs before the 2008 election, when Barack Obama became president. 
The frequency of Hughes Jr.’s political spending at the federal and state levels increased after 2010, around the same time he started donating to California state races. He spent at least $1.5 million in state elections between 2008 and 2016, according to California Secretary of State campaign finance records. 
The height of Hughes Jr.’s federal political giving has come in the last five years. In that time, he has spent $1.9 million supporting congressional and presidential campaigns and political groups, according to FEC reports. 
Hughes Jr.’s largest individual donations included $500,000 to President Donald Trump’s Victory PAC in 2020, $396,300 to NRSC Victory and $100,000 to Protect the House 2024. The latter two are PACs aimed at keeping Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress.
Since 2020, he has also contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars collectively to candidates closely aligned with Trump, including Rep. Hageman, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and former South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a Republican and Trump ally who is now the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. 
Hughes Jr. had backed former Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., contributing $30,600 to her campaign in 2020, before she condemned Trump following the Jan. 6 Capitol riots. Hughes Jr. then gave to Hageman in the 2022 election cycle when she ousted Cheney.

In Wyoming, Hughes Jr. has given more than $637,000 to state legislative candidates since 2020, Wyoming Secretary of State campaign finance records show. His name wasn’t connected to any PACs on the state PAC roster list. Much of that giving came amid a schism between two Republican factions: the hard-right Wyoming Freedom Caucus and the more traditional Wyoming Caucus.
Hughes Jr. had lived in Jackson a few years before he started spending on state politics. His first donation was to Sen. Affie Ellis in Cheyenne in 2020, who was a more moderate candidate. She didn’t respond to requests for comment about her relationship with Hughes Jr. He made two other contributions in 2020: to the Teton County Republican Party and Wyoming Hope. 
In 2022, he largely donated to Wyoming Caucus candidates, notably Reps. Barry Crago, Shelly Duncan, Ember Oakley and Jon Conrad as well as Sens. Ogden Driskill, Stacy Jones, Drew Perkins and Wendy Schuler. 
Hughes Jr.’s giving to state candidates dropped off in 2024 in comparison to the 2022 election cycle. He made political donations to five Republican candidates not affiliated with the Freedom Caucus. Landon Greer and Kim Withers ran for seats in the Wyoming Senate and lost. David Hill and Robert Hendry ran for seats in the Wyoming House of Representatives and lost. Rob Geringer, meanwhile, won a seat in the Wyoming House.
Over the years, Wyoming Hope has been the largest recipient of Hughes Jr.’s state-level political donations. The PAC supported the continued funding of House Bill 65, which established Wyoming’s suicide prevention hotline. Since 2020, he’s donated $516,000 to the group, accounting for three of the 17 donations made to the PAC since 2020, according to the Secretary of State’s Office.
Wyoming Freedom Caucus members have questioned public financial support for the hotline. Many members have said it’s the responsibility of churches and nonprofits to step in to provide mental health support, which the Hugheses have done with their philanthropic arm. 
Praise and scorn
Former Senate President Driskill met Hughes Jr. when he was looking for a ranch in the eastern Wyoming Black Hills, before the Californian settled on buying a home near Jackson. Driskill said he became friends with both Hugheses and admires their political contributions and philanthropic efforts. 
Driskill didn’t ask for the $1,500 that Hughes Jr. donated to his campaign in 2022, but said the Hugheses knew he was being challenged by the far right.
“They made a real effort trying to work with Wyoming politics, and they found out how tough it really is,” Driskill said. 
Although Californians draw criticism for moving to Mountain West states and affecting politics, Driskill said the vast majority of people who come to Wyoming seek to fit in.

“I’ve got to be honest,” Driskill said. “I don’t think Wayne and Molly tried to change Wyoming’s culture or community. They tried to support what had been there in the past.” 
While Driskill said the Hugheses had “incredible influence on keeping Wyoming stable,” he noted that other powerful actors with money in Teton County are funding the Wyoming Freedom Caucus and the state’s move further right. 
“For all the liberal beatings that you folks take,” Driskill said, referring to Jackson, “you’ve got a group of people that’s not investing thousands, they’re investing millions into the hard right.” 
Even with Hughes Jr.’s history of donating to Republican candidates and organizations, he’s faced criticism from some further to the right, including Honor Wyoming, a political group founded in 2023 that has supported staunchly conservative politicians aligned with the Wyoming Freedom Caucus. Jackson residents Rebecca Bextel and Blair Maus and other notable Teton County Republicans are involved with the group. Cheyenne attorney and former Wyoming Republican Party Chairman Drake Hill has represented the group at legislative hearings. 
In October 2024, Honor Wyoming accused Cowboy State Daily of “providing biased political coverage, favoring politicians who receive donations from its owner, Wayne Hughes.” The group said he “quickly became the largest spender on Wyoming state politics” after moving to Wyoming in 2017.
The solution the group calls for: “Cowboy State Daily could add a simple disclaimer to every article written by or about any political figures who receive funding from Wayne Hughes or his PAC to add transparency for readers.”
But Orr has rejected the suggestion that Hughes Jr.’s personal support for candidates plays any role in news coverage.
“He’s not involved,” Orr said. “Totally separate.”
Mary Martin, the former chair of the Teton County GOP, first met the Hugheses at the Patriots Dinner in 2022. That year Hughes Jr. gave $51,265 to the Teton County Republican Party. She called them “common sense conservatives.
“I think they were just interested in a good Republican candidate,” she said. “I didn’t see them in any camp. They do their homework on who they’re going to support.”

It remains to be seen to what extent the Hugheses will participate in state politics going forward. The state is approaching a pivotal 2026 election. Gov. Mark Gordon’s time in office will end after eight years, and the race for the governor’s mansion appears wide open. Meanwhile, the policies of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus will face a referendum from voters after the group spent two years leading the Wyoming House of Representatives.
Regardless of who becomes governor and what faction of the right holds sway in the statehouse, the Hugheses are positioned — through their news organization, their philanthropy and their political donations — to continue playing a significant role in the state. And that influence, at least according to those who know them, will be wielded without the fanfare or bombast that’s come to define modern politics.  
Martin never would have known the Hugheses were billionaires, she said. Hughes Jr. was unassuming and friendly, causing her to do a double take when she learned more about him.
“They were just like your friend next door,” she said of the couple. “They were very amenable, affable, pleasant. Just like a neighbor.”

A run-in with the dogcatcher spirals columnist Rod Miller into a fabulist nightmare in which even when he's right, he ends up in the wrong.
The post Good Dog Henry’s tangle with tyranny appeared first on WyoFile .","My service dog, Good Dog Henry, almost got rounded up in a K9 ICE raid the other day. GDH is my intellectual support beast, and he was nearly sent to a canine detention camp in El Salvador or Equatorial Guinea. They eat dogs in those countries, if I’m to believe the president, and the holiday feasting season is approaching, so a bust would have had dire consequences for my potlicker.

Opinion

A word about my pooch: Good Dog Henry is prominently mentioned in veterinary manuals as the only dog ever born without a brain. His noggin is solid bone. Consequently, he operates on muscular instinct alone, and his instincts are particularly aroused by Milk Bone Extra-Meaty flavored medium-sized dog cookies and peyote.
A word about my porch, where GDH and I often sun ourselves on nice days, is also in order. The “porch” is a concrete slab about 10 feet square next to the sidewalk on Central Avenue. It’s a nice spot to drink beer, watch traffic and bark our heads off.
What follows here is crackerjack crime reporting, so pay close attention.
It was a lovely Veterans Day, and Henry and I were sunning ourselves on the porch. I nursed a PBR tallboy and waved at passing cars, while GDH lounged beside me, licking where his testicles used to be, fantasizing about lame bunnies and conjugating Latin verbs. Cheyenne’s dogcatcher parked across the street and closely observed us.
Henry and I have followed this same routine for eight years, and we have never felt this oppressive police presence before. It occurred to me that one of Good Dog Henry’s political enemies must have placed an anonymous call to the deep state to have us checked out.
When the dogcatcher disembarked her vehicle, she strode downwind across Central to our porch. On her belt, she had the customary handcuffs, flashlight and stun gun alongside a pouch of dog biscuits to placate nervous curs.

Columnist Rod Miller.(Mike Vanata)
Henry caught a whiff of treats on the westerly breeze, and followed his nose to the sidewalk to investigate. Whereupon the dogcatcher proceeded to warn us that dogs cannot be on the sidewalk, city property and all, without being leashed. Since I refuse to wear a leash, I don’t put them on my critters. So Henry greeted her buck naked.
No ticket was issued, and no dog was hauled off to the camps. We got off with a stern warning, but I got to thinking how my old Rawlins Outlaw football coach, John Maffoni, always told me, “Miller, every time you think, you weaken the team,” but sometimes I can’t help myself.
I had the tantalizing thought that, if Good Dog Henry had been busted and perp-walked into court for prancing on the city’s sidewalk unleashed, I would be his defense attorney. I would establish that Henry was enticed onto the sidewalk by the irresistible aroma of cookies on the dogcatcher’s person, and that this was a clear-cut case of police entrapment.
Henry would walk out of the courthouse a free dog.
My mind conjectured further that, if this same police harassment occurred this winter when the sidewalk was covered in snow, I would again represent Henry before the bar of justice, and he would beat the rap once again.
I ran my defense counsel’s strategy through my mind. I would get the dogcatcher on the witness stand and have her closely examine the 8-by-10 glossies of the crime scene. I’d ask her to tell the court where Good Dog Henry was standing. When she said “on the city’s sidewalk,” I’d have her look closer and admit that Henry was standing on a snow-covered sidewalk.
I’d then establish that, since snow is just frozen water, and the state of Wyoming owns all the water, Henry was actually standing on state property, not city property. And the state of Wyoming doesn’t give a rat’s ass if dogs stand on their snow. Case dismissed!
My revelry would be broken when a badge-carrying member of Sidewalk ICE handed me a ticket for not shoveling my sidewalk in another ploy by the Clinton/Trump, Soros-funded conspiracy against our individual rights.
I, for one, and Good Dog Henry for another, have had just about a bellyful of this tyranny!

John Cavanaugh defends U.S. House bid against risks to state filibuster,Juan Salinas II,,,,,https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2025/11/19/state-sen-john-cavanaugh-defends-u-s-house-bid-against-risks-to-state-filibuster/,"The Omaha lawmaker called the criticisms a “loser mentality” and said he plans to run a campaign that raises “all boats.""","State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha is a candidate for U.S. House in Nebraska's Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District. Sept. 12, 2025. (Photo by Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — In the officially nonpartisan Nebraska Unicameral, the Democratic-leaning minority bloc currently has 16 seats, including progressive Omaha nonpartisan State Sen. Megan Hunt. 
That means the Legislature’s partisan minority, when united, needs Hunt and at least one GOP defector to stop legislation the group opposes. Republicans, when united, hold a narrow supermajority of 33 seats that can overcome them.
Still, filibusters have stopped some controversial majority-sought bills, including a six-week abortion ban, moving the state to winner-take-all in presidential elections and reducing a voter-approved increase in the minimum wage.
But in an off-year election when Democrats might win the Omaha-area race for Congress, some worry about the risks of even temporarily narrowing the party’s thin margin for those filibusters if State Sen. John Cavanaugh wins.
Cavanaugh, who represents one of the state’s most Democratic-leaning legislative districts, would have to resign if elected and be replaced by the governor, a seat of power in Nebraska that Republicans have occupied since 1999. 
Some local Democrats say Cavanaugh winning would allow a Republican majority to pass more controversial legislation that Democratic-aligned lawmakers and some Republican moderates have helped them stop.

A handful argue his departure from the Legislature could spur the state to redraw the 2nd Congressional District mid-decade, putting a potential Democrat in Congress out of a job and cementing GOP power in Nebraska for another generation. Others have questioned whether the current governor, Jim Pillen, or a successor might push for a special session to further restrict abortion.
Many of those concerns come from backers of two of Cavanaugh’s top opponents in the May 12 primary, Douglas County District Court Clerk Crystal Rhoades and local business owner and political action committee co-founder Denise Powell. People expressed similar concerns about the risks of State Sen. Tony Vargas of Omaha running for Congress.
The Democratic primary is a six-person race with Cavanaugh, Rhoades, Powell, Navy veteran Kishla Askins, former congressional staffer James Leuschen and former immigration attorney Evangelos Argyrakis. 
Cavanaugh, in an interview with the Examiner, called the criticisms a “loser mentality” and said he plans to run a campaign that raises “all boats.” 
“I am confident that I’m going to win this house seat, and I’m confident that I’m going to do it in a way as a leader that will help Democrats win more seats at the state level,” Cavanaugh said.

Cavanaugh said Democrats elsewhere have shown in recent congressional elections that “we have a message that resonates with voters” and questioned whether the people who are concerned “think that Democrats can’t win.”
He said he thinks Nebraska Democrats will run strong candidates “up and down the ballot” in 2026, including for governor. No Democratic candidate for governor has yet announced 
Democrats won most of high-profile contests nationally this month, including the Governor’s Office in Virginia and the mayor’s race in New York, which some political observers have said could hint at a positive political environment for them in the midterms. Political experts view the open 2nd District U.S. House seat as a possible pickup for Democrats, following the retirement of Republican U.S. Rep. Don Bacon.

The 2nd District Democratic primary is a six-person race with Cavanaugh, Powell, Rhoades, Navy veteran Kishla Askins, former congressional staffer James Leuschen and Evangelos Argyrakis. 
Rhoades, in particular, has criticized Cavanaugh in public and private about the risks to Democrats, saying she chose to run partly out of concern about Cavanaugh vacating the seat when one or two votes are all that stand between Nebraska and what she describes as bad legislation. 
Rhoades said she wants to make sure “we aren’t sacrificing some of the things that the Democrats have been able to hold off in the Legislature.”  
“We’re hanging on by a thread — our representation, our Electoral College vote, and abortion rights are all dependent on maintaining the filibuster in the Legislature,” Rhoades said, “Throwing all of that away and putting the state and the country at risk is unacceptable. The stakes are too high.”
During the last legislative session, Republican efforts to change how the state awards Electoral College votes for president failed in part because Republican State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston and State Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont sided with Democrats against the timing of the change. A similar effort to make the change in 2024 fell a single vote short when then-State Sen. Mike McDonnell, a new Republican, chose not to back the effort.
Riepe also was the sole Republican to vote against a push for a six-week abortion ban during the 2023 legislative session.
Ryan Longenecker, Powell’s campaign manager, said, “Voters are tired of career politicians looking for their next opportunity.” He said she is focused on the fact that “people back home are really struggling to make ends meet.” 
Cavanaugh told the Examiner he would resign from the Legislature in January 2027 if he won the primary and general elections. The governor would then appoint Cavanaugh’s replacement for all of 2027 and 2028, due to the timing of the potential vacancy.
His appointed replacement would serve until January 2029, according to state law. He has the option of resigning before May 1, which would trigger a special election in November 2026. However, his seat would be filled by a Pillen appointee in the interim.  
Nebraska Democratic Party Chair Jane Kleeb previously said there is a path for the party to make gains in the statehouse after losing seats in recent years, but it would be “difficult.” One reason: a more favorable environment in 2026. Democratic officials hope to gain two seats. The party could also lose ground.
A look at registration numbers in many of the districts where Democrats hope to win seats still shows them at a disadvantage against Republicans.
Hunt has said that is part of why she is watching the Democratic primary closely. Losing any more seats could widen the door for “extremist policies that hurt working people” and “target vulnerable communities,” she said.
“My hope is that we don’t lose that last line of defense,” Hunt added. 
Cavanaugh argues the national stakes are even higher, “because of the current chaos created by [President Donald] Trump.” 
“Congress has the ultimate authority over a lot of the things that people are concerned about,” Cavanaugh said, “So we need strong representation in Congress who’s going to stand up … and fight for the people of this district.”
The winner of the Democratic primary will face the winner of a GOP primary featuring Omaha City Council Member Brinker Harding and former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha.

Idaho’s expenses for the 2025 wildfire season netted about $40.6 million, Idaho Department of Lands Director Dustin Miller said during Tuesday’s meeting of the Idaho State Board of Land Commissioners, which is frequently referred to as simply the Land Board.
Miller told the Land Board that Idaho incurred about $59.3 million in expenses as of Nov. 3, but the state expects to recoup about $18.6 million through reimbursement agreements and partnerships – resulting in a net total of about $40.6 million. 
Miller estimated that leaves the state’s wildfire suppression fund with a balance of about $15 million heading into the 2026 wildfire season.
That amount of money is likely not enough to pay wildfire bills in 2026. Miller estimated that the state will be on the hook for almost $5 million next year in fixed costs at the beginning of the season before the first fire even starts. 
Idaho’s projected state budget deficit increases to $58.3 million

Idaho Gov. Brad Little said costs could be well over $10 million when the cost of contracting for helicopters, crews and other equipment are added – all before fighting a single wildfire.
That means state officials could have to find additional money to fight wildfires at a time when all state agencies – other than the K-12 public school system – are navigating mandatory budget holdbacks of 3% and the state budget is projected to end the current fiscal year with a budget deficit estimated at $58.3 million, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
As state revenues come in below projections, the Idaho Legislature’s powerful budget-setting committee, the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC, has signaled that next year’s budgets will be tight, and legislators will generally focus more on trimming budgets rather than approving new budget expenses to avoid running a budget deficit, the Sun previously reported. 
 Idaho governor said he doesn’t want state going into debt fighting wildfires

Little has favored pre-funding the state’s wildfire suppression fund to make sure money is available upfront, ensure firefighting operations are not shortchanged or interrupted and to avoid going into debt fighting wildfires. 
“Backing the Fire Suppression Deficiency Fund means Idaho’s wildland firefighters can focus on aggressively protecting timber, lands, property and people without funding delays, and lawmakers can enter next year’s budgeting cycle without a deficit due to wildfire suppression,” Little and the Land Board members wrote in a Feb. 18 letter to JFAC.

At the beginning of the 2025 legislative session, Little requested $60 million to build up the wildfire suppression fund, but the Idaho Legislature agreed to provide $40 million.
With the balance of the wildfire fund now dropping to $15 million, Little said Tuesday he is trying to decide how much funding he needs to request to be prepared to fight wildfires in 2026 so the state does not have to use deficiency warrants to pay the bills. Little and other state officials have compared the deficiency warrant process to running up credit card debit to pay for essential state services.
“By the time you contract for helicopters and the airplanes and the crews and everything, it’s well over $10 million,” Little said Tuesday. “I’m just trying to figure out what the budget request needs to be so we don’t have to do deficiency warrants.”
Compared to the more severe 2024 wildfire season, Idaho’s wildfire costs were lower this year at an estimated $40.6 million. In 2024, Idaho’s wildfire costs were about $58 million, the Sun previously reported. 
The Land Board is made up of Little, Secretary of State Phil McGrane, Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, Idaho State Controller Brandon Woolf and Idaho Superintendent of Public Instruction Debbie Critchfield.
The Land Board provides direction to the Idaho Department of Lands, which is responsible for fighting wildfires on state land.
The Idaho Legislature will set the fiscal year 2027 budget for the Idaho Department of Lands during the 2026 legislative session, which begins Jan. 12  at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise.

Bill Lee over his decision to send the National Guard to Memphis praised a judge’s order to temporarily block the deployment, but warned there was “a mighty ways to go” before the city may see an end to the military presence. 
Davidson County Chancellor Patricia Head Moskal ruled Monday that the governor had exceeded his authority in unilaterally deploying the Guard to Memphis as part of the Memphis Safe Task Force established by President Donald Trump.
On Tuesday, the governor’s office said it planned to appeal Moskal’s ruling. 
In a statement,Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti framed the legal battle to keep the Guard in Memphis in historic terms, one with “ramifications for not just the safety of Memphians now but for all Tennesseans for centuries to come.”
Judge temporarily blocks National Guard deployment in Memphis

Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris, a plaintiff in the suit, told reporters Tuesday he was prepared for the lengthy legal battle ahead. 
“Now we realize we have a very long way to go and we are up against the mightiest of adversaries, the White House and Donald Trump, Gov. Lee and federal officials, some of whom are willing to do whatever it takes to satisfy their whimsy of the day,” said Harris, who called Lee’s decision to deploy the Guard “dumbfounding and disappointing.”
“The military should not be used against Tennesseans,” Harris said.
Tennessee State Sen. Brent Taylor, who represents a portion of Memphis, was among state Republicans who condemned the ruling by Moskal, whom he called “clueless.” 
“As is usually the case with decisions from activist low-level chancellors, I expect this ruling to be overturned on appeal,” Taylor said.
Guard plays ‘supportive’ role
The Tennessee National Guard has been deployed to Memphis since Oct. 10 as one component of the Memphis Safe Task Force convened by Trump to fight crime in one of the nation’s largest majority-Black cities. 
The Guard remains under the command of Lee, a Republican, who has neither authorized them to make arrests nor carry weapons. 
Thus far the Guard has taken on a supportive role to aid hundreds of federal and state law enforcement officers who have also been dispatched to the city. 
They are a regular presence at Memphis tourist destinations such as Beale Street, and Facebook photos posted by the Tennessee National Guard show men and women in fatigues walking along streets, fist-bumping passers by and smiling at children.

Just how many Guard personnel are in Memphis remains in question. 
Last week, a spokesperson for the Memphis Police Department said there were 140-180 National Guard members in Memphis, noting their presence would soon double.
In a declaration submitted in court last week, Lieut. Col. Dallas Clements, deputy director of military support for the Tennessee National Guard, said there were 719 Guard members in Memphis.
In total, the federal government has estimated the cost for pay, benefits, meals and hotels for up to 1,000 Guard personnel deployed for a year in Memphis would exceed $33 million annually.
The cost of the Guard presence has drawn criticism from some Memphis leaders, who were contending with budget shortfalls even before Task Force arrests strained the city’s already-overcrowded jail and justice system.
“They’re not doing anything,” said JB Smiley, Jr., a Memphis City Councilman who is among the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. “We’re spending millions of dollars to afford the National Guard to simply walk our streets, to laugh and play, when we have some pressing issues in this community.”
‘Removing the National Guard does not remove the fear’
The presence of hundreds more federal and state law enforcement officers from more than 30 agencies, including Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Tennessee Highway Patrol, remains unaffected by Monday’s injunction. 
Thus far, the Task Force members have made 2,800 arrests, confiscated more than 450 illegal firearms and located 114 missing children, a spokesperson for Lee said Tuesday. The Lookout has been unable to independently verify arrest data released by state and federal officials.

Task force members have also issued thousands of traffic tickets, served warrants and made immigration arrests. Some of the arrests have involved multiple officers tackling individuals to the ground and separating young children from parents in scenes captured on widely circulated videos taken by local activists that have generated fear and outrage in local communities. 
“People were taken without warning, without explanation and without time even to say goodbye,” said Jessica Miller, a spokesperson for The Collective Good Immigrant Food Pantry, an all-volunteer effort to deliver food to immigrant families too afraid to leave their homes or left without resources after a breadwinner was arrested by the task force.
“Last night’s ruling matters and affirmed what many already knew,” Miller said. “But removing the National Guard does not remove the fear. It does not unbreak the families. It does not undo the trauma. And it does not stop the ongoing actions of the Task Force that created the crisis we are in in the first place.”

During a meeting Tuesday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise, the Idaho State Board of Land Commissioners – or Land Board – voted 4-1 to move forward with auctioning off a 160-acre parcel of state land, which is located in eastern Idaho near the town of Driggs. 
The Land Board previously voted 5-0 on July 15 to auction off the same plot of land, which is being leased for grazing by fifth-generation rancher Nick Beard and his family, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
The sale of the land would result in breaking the grazing lease, which would be legal under the fine print terms of the contract, the Sun previously reported.

The Land Board took the issue up again Tuesday after two-thirds of Idaho’sTeton County commissioners and several members of the public voiced opposition to selling the state land and breaking the grazing lease with the local ranching family.
State officials said they want to auction the land off to the highest bidder because the Idaho Constitution requires the state to manage state endowment lands in such a way as to maximize the highest long-term financial return to endowment beneficiaries. The state currently generates about $960 a year off the land through the grazing lease. But by selling the land in Driggs, where property values have been increasing for decades and millionaires have been buying up land that had historically been used by local ranchers and farmers, officials believe they could make millions of dollars for the state.

On Sept. 12, two of Idaho’s Teton County commissioners wrote a letter to Little and the Land Board asking them to not sell the land. They said hundreds of local people spoke out against the sale, sticking up for the Beard family and calling on the state to preserve agricultural land that is accessible to the public in a community that was built on agriculture. 
“Our Comprehensive Plan (p1-8) states … ‘We will strive to … maintain, nurture and enhance the rural character and nature of Teton Valley,’” Commissioners Brad Wolfe and Dan Powers wrote. “It is hard to picture a more striking depiction of this mandate than the Beard family ranching on this property.”
“With the overwhelmingly strong opposition we have received from the public, we as the commissioners of Teton County and representing our constituents, have unitedly come to the decision that we respectfully request that the ‘Driggs 160’ not be considered for sale at this time,” Wolfe and Powers added.
However, Teton County Commissioner Ron James did not sign the letter and sent his own letter to Little and the Land Board urging them to complete the sale.
“I understand the passion surrounding this issue, including the value of public lands for agriculture, wildlife and community heritage, as highlighted in the numerous public comments we have received,” James wrote. “However, I remain convinced that respecting the state’s authority in this instance is the proper course of action.”
 Rancher leasing state lands was not notified in advance of planned sale

One of the issues surrounding the planned sale of the property is that Beard and his family were not notified in advance before the Land Board considered approving the sale in July, the Sun previously reported. Instead, Beard’s wife found out about the sale through a post on Facebook, and it took until July 21, about a week after the first vote July 15, for someone from the Idaho Department of Lands to notify the Beards that they would be losing the land his family has leased from grazing since the 1990s.
Beard’s lease runs through 2032, but the language in the lease agreement allows the state to break the lease in the event the state decides to sell the property.

Several Land Board members, including Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, were highly critical of the Idaho Department of Lands staff for failing to notify Beard of the planned sale in a timely manner. McGrane made an unsuccessful attempt to put the land up for sale under the condition the new buyer honor the terms of Beard’s lease through its end date, but McGrane’s motion failed on a 2-3 vote. Just McGrane and Idaho State Controller Brandon Woolf supported the move, while Little, Attorney General Raúl Labrador and Superintendent of Public Instruction Debbie Critchfield opposed the proposal. 
Moments later, the Land Board voted 4-1 to authorize the sale as planned, which will end the lease. McGrane cast the lone vote against moving forward with the sale as planned. 
Idaho Department of Lands officials previously told the Sun there is interest in the property from prospective buyers, who they declined to identify. State officials said they don’t know who will end up buying the land because it will be sold at auction that anyone can participate in. 
Earlier this year, Beard told the Sun that lawyers representing a neighboring land owner, Thomas Tull, have reached out to him with interest in acquiring the land.  
Tull is a billionaire businessman and movie producer. According to campaign finance records Tull contributed $25,000 to the Friends of Brad Little political committee in 2023. Tull also contributed $100,000 to the Idaho Victory Fund Political Action Committee in 2022, which supported a variety of Republican candidates including Little, McGrane and Critchfield.
Neither the Land Board nor the Idaho Department of Lands set a date for the auction during Tuesday’s meeting.

Aftyn Behn and Nashville Republican Matt Van Epps, former Tennessee General Services commissioner, face off in a special election to fill Tennessee’s 7th U.S. Congressional District.
But with Democratic success nationally in November’s off-cycle elections, the party’s on the rise for the first time since President Donald Trump was elected in 2024, the upcoming U.S. House race is drawing attention from national politicians and political action committees.
Last week, Trump held a “tele-rally” where he said Van Epps was a “true America First patriot who has dedicated his entire life to serving our country.” The President’s political action committee also started spending money to back Van Epps.
Over the weekend, a Democratic-affiliated group called Your Community PAC launched a nearly half-million-dollar independent expenditure campaign attacking Van Epps, and Tuesday former Vice President Kamala Harris was in Nashville at a rally hosted by the Tennessee Democratic Party to encourage people to vote in the upcoming election. Harris attended the rally ahead of her appearance at the Ryman Auditorium as part of her book tour.

Harris called the election a fight “for the future” and about giving political power back to “the people,” but didn’t endorse Behn, who left before the former vice president arrived.
Republicans have held Tennessee’s 7th Congressional seat for more than 50 years, but the seat was redrawn in 2022 as part of state GOP lawmakers’ successful attempt to gerrymander the state map. The new district maps divided Nashville-Davidson County, historically a Democratic stronghold, across three districts, including the 7th.
Former U.S. Rep. Mark Green won the 7th by a 20% in the 2022 and 2024 elections, but this year’s race is the first time the seat will have to hold up in a political environment that, on the surface, doesn’t favor Republicans. Republicans won the 2022 and 2024 U.S. House elections nationwide as a referendum on former Democratic President Joe Biden, but this year, with Trump in power the 2025 election serves as a referendum on his administration’s actions, like the continued increase in cost of living.
Green resigned from Congress in July, triggering the special election for the seat.
What are the candidates running on?
Behn narrowly bested a field of four candidates in the Democratic primary. In the state House, she sponsored measures to cut the state’s sales tax on groceries and to legalize and tax marijuana to pay for road construction.
Van Epps won a primary with nearly a dozen candidates, in part because of a last-minute endorsement from Trump and a significant boost from the pro-school-voucher Club for Growth, which ran advertisements attacking his main rival, state Rep. Jody Barrett. Van Epps has made his military experience as a former Army helicopter pilot a central theme of his campaign.

The 7th District is drawn to include all of the Clarksville area, where a high percentage of people are former military because of the proximity to Fort Campbell, a U.S. Army base.
Van Epps is running campaign advertisements saying he wants to “bring down prices, create good-paying jobs and lowering healthcare costs for working families.” During the primary, Van Epps ran advertisements calling himself a “MAGA warrior” who would take on “radical leftists.”
Behn emphasizes her view that corporate money shouldn’t be allowed in politics and ties Van Epps to rising health care costs.
During the most recent government shutdown, the Democratic Party tried to force the GOP to extend healthcare insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Nearly 650,000 Tennesseans are covered by government-subsidized health insurance plans, according to KFF.
Epstein files take center stage
Candidates launched attack ads the week after the primary, with Van Epps hitting Behn for her pro-choice abortion stance and protests of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement sting operation in South Nashville this year.
Behn has attacked Van Epps over his initial lack of support to release the U.S. Department of Justice’s files about disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
The release of the “Epstein files” has become a rallying cry for Democratic lawmakers across the country because of the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s past ties to Trump. Van Epps backed the release of the files Tuesday, flipping from a previous stance and waiting until after it became clear that the U.S. House would vote to release them.

Behn is receiving independent support from a group called Your Community PAC, which Federal Election Commission disclosures show started spending over $500,000 in mid-November. The group ran TV advertisements over the weekend attacking Van Epps by tying him to his previous stance on the release of the Epstein files.
The group has also sent out dual mailers encouraging Democrats to go to the polls and comparing Van Epps unfavorably to John Thorp, an independent in the race.
Your Community PAC’s money doesn’t link back to an individual donor but to a dark money group called the North Fund. The North Fund, as of 2024, was run by a Washington D.C. consultant named Jim Gerstein, who has served as a pollster and independent expenditure campaign organizer in support of several Democratic Party candidates.
Van Epps has received over $150,000 in independent support from Trump’s MAGA Inc. PAC and the Special Operations for America, a PAC supporting military candidates. So far, Club for Growth’s PAC, the School Freedom Fund, hasn’t spent any money to boost Van Epps or attack Behn in the general election.

(Photo by Leann Ray/West Virginia Watch)Even though the final curtain call has been issued, moving Goldenseal magazine’s print edition out and its digital format in, it is yet another example of the very real threat that faces not only West Virginians but everyone whose life is enriched by the arts. 
It goes without saying that mankind’s basic needs (food, shelter, clothing) are paramount to our survival, our quality of life (and let’s add affordable, accessible health care to the list) we cannot overlook the intrinsic value of the arts, which have always enriched people’s lives, from gazing at paintings to listening to music, to reading and writing stories. Each experience enlivens our senses, invites us to give it a whirl ourselves, and gifts hope, energizing us to keep going, no matter how difficult the journey. Can you imagine a world without the arts? I can’t, and I don’t want to even give it a moment’s thought.
The recent decision to eliminate the print edition of Goldenseal Magazine is troubling, not only because it was an exceptional and impressive publication that countless readers and writers enjoyed, but it effortlessly lured visitors to the state. In a way, it became an elixir, appealing to readers’s senses. 
When I think of West Virginia’s broadband challenges and the percentage of people, especially throughout rural America who face the same challenge, I wonder if those who made the decision to move Goldenseal to digital only gave any thought to the vast number of people who will not have access to the digital format. It can’t always be about dollars and cents. At times, it must be about making certain that the arts are easily accessible to everyone. Historically, it has been shown that it is the arts that keep people from despair, especially in times of unprecedented change. 
The arts have always been most important to those of us without vast fortunes, without easy access to museums and live performances. So many rely on printed material that highlights those experiences in words, in photos, on pages that we can hold in our hands, inhaling the ink from the printed paper, and sharing our experiences with others. I don’t think this has anything to do with adapting to changing times. I don’t think it has anything to do with embracing the digital world. And I don’t think it has much to do with cutting costs. I think that it has everything to do with a political climate that serves a master whose staying power is beginning to wane.
All of this is why I recently found myself in uncharted territory, as I withdrew two pieces I had written and that had been accepted for publication in the next issue of Goldenseal. And once I reached that decision, in an act of silent protest, I knew that I had taken the action I could, rather than simply writing another commentary disagreeing with the decision to no longer publish a print edition of Goldenseal. I would make the decision again. Doing what we can, no matter how seemingly insignificant, is all we can do. And if enough of us do that, the wrongs will be righted.

It’s the second stage of funding offered through the USDA’s Supplemental Disaster Relief Program.
(Photo by iStock/Getty Images Plus)West Virginia farmers whose crops or commodities were affected by natural disasters in 2023 and 2024 will soon be able to access more federal funding to aid their individual recovery, according to a news release from the state Department of Agriculture.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture is launching the second stage of the Farm Service Agency’s Supplemental Disaster Relief Program, making $16 billion total available for farmers nationwide who saw their crops or products impacted or destroyed by natural disasters.
Applications for stage two of the relief program will open on Nov. 24. Both stage one and stage two will accept applications until April 30, 2026. Depending on circumstances, farmers may be able to apply and receive funds from both stages of the program.
Per the USDA, the first stage of the program was mostly reserved for farmers with larger losses while stage two covers a broader range, including “shallow losses,” the loss of uninsured crops and drops in crop quality due to a natural disaster.
Natural disasters that would allow a farmer to qualify for either stage of the funding includes: wildfires, hurricanes, floods, derechos, excessive heat, tornadoes, winter storms, freeze (including a polar vortex), smoke exposure, excessive moisture, qualifying drought and related conditions in calendar years 2023 or 2024.
Per the USDA, two counties — Pendleton and Jefferson — met the standards to receive funds due to a qualifying drought in 2023. In 2024, that increased to 53 counties — all but Hancock and McDowell — being eligible.
To date, according to the USDA, 239 applications for losses in West Virginia have been approved through stage one of the Supplemental Disaster Relief Program, totaling about $3.31 million. About $1.98 million of that went toward losses for “specialty and high value crops.”
“West Virginia farmers have faced repeated weather challenges, and many are still recovering,” said Commissioner of Agriculture Kent Leonhardt. “This federal support will help producers rebuild and prepare for the next growing season. We appreciate USDA’s commitment to getting these resources to our farmers when they need them most.”
About $1.87 million of all the funds distributed so far in West Virginia for stage one went to cover losses from apples. Another $980,000 went to corn. Money to cover losses from most other crops — including potatoes, honey, wheat, peaches and more — totaled less than $10,000 per a crop.
The funds for both stage one and two of the USDA’s Supplemental Disaster Relief Program were made available in the American Relief Act passed by Congress under President Joe Biden in December 2024. 
 The newly available funds for farmers come in addition to those made available previously, including $9.3 billion from the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program that went online in May. That money was specifically meant to help farmers who produce certain commodities “mitigate the impacts of increased input costs and falling commodity prices,” per the USDA. 
Across the country, farmers have been lamenting the consequences of increased prices due to tariffs and trade complications. They’ve been asking Congress to help ease the burden of unprofitable harvests, which these funds are supposed to do. 
But, per the New York Times, the money that is needed and made available now may come too late to help farmers who are already preparing for next year’s crop cycles.

That’s not naivete; it’s a conviction that has guided my life’s work with children and families. Right now, Idaho faces a challenge that tests that belief. Our kids are in crisis. I’m confident we can turn this around, but only if we do it together. 
Treasure Valley youth deserve better. Our mental health coalition is taking action.

Founded as an orphanage in 1908, the Children’s Home became one of Idaho’s first youth mental health counseling centers in 1975. Our organization has been helping kids here for more than a century, but lately, it feels like we’re trapped in a loop. The current state of mental health looks alarmingly similar to what it was 10, even 20, years ago. In many ways, it’s worse. 
Since the isolation and daily stress of the pandemic, we’ve seen a 20 to 30 percent increase in demand for mental health care for children. Kids are struggling with depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and the lingering weight of trauma. Parents and caregivers are doing everything they can to help, but they keep running into a wall. There are simply not enough providers to meet the need. 
When kids don’t have access to care, it doesn’t just hurt them. It harms the well-being of the family and the entire community. There are lifelong consequences to this that impact every single one of us. 
For too long, Idaho’s response has been scattered. Nonprofits and agencies have worked hard in their own corners, each addressing a piece of the problem. That approach isn’t enough anymore. The scale of this crisis demands a united front and collective purpose. 
That’s why Children’s Home, Idaho Youth Ranch, and Women’s & Children’s Alliance have joined forces in a first-of-its-kind collaboration. Our shared goal is simple but powerful: Every child in Idaho deserves access to the mental health care they need. And we won’t stop until that becomes our reality. 
It’s unusual for three nonprofits to come together, but we think it’s the future of how we solve problems in Idaho. We bring more than 200 years of combined service to this work. We’ve seen what makes an impact and where systems fall short. We share data and stories. And we’re using our collective voice to advocate for practical, lasting change — like expanding school-based counseling and offering paid internships for aspiring therapists. 
We’re already seeing what’s possible. When we brought therapy directly into a local school, a parent working three jobs sent our counselor a note that read, “You’ve given us our family back.” 
This is an Idaho problem, but it’s also an Idaho opportunity. When our community faces hard things, we roll up our sleeves and get to work. We support one another. We innovate. We find a way forward. 
That’s what this partnership is about — turning shared belief into shared action. And we’re not doing it alone. With support from community leaders, policymakers, and partners like the J.A. and Kathryn Albertson Foundation, we’re proving that when Idaho comes together, hope and change are possible. 
We’re not just responding to a crisis. We’re building a future where every child has the chance to grow up healthy, hopeful, and whole. Together, we’re turning the unsolvable into the solvable.

“Like a lot of sisters, Faygo and Vernors, spent all week squabbling over who got to wear the fluffier feathers for the big day,” Whitmer said. “And ladies, they both look beautiful.”
In the midst of a speech sprinkled with Thanksgiving-related puns, Whitmer also recounted her administration’s accomplishments over the past year, from securing a bipartisan state budget – after a monthslong budget battle that nearly resulted in a government shutdown – to negotiating with White House to secure a fighter mission at Selfridge Air National Guard Base and funding for the Brandon Road lock and dam project to keep invasive carp out of the Great Lakes. 
“During the holidays, I encourage everyone to find ways to give back to their community, and I hope that everyone can spend Thanksgiving with the ones they love most,” Whitmer said. “This is the best time here to slow down, share a meal and remember what really matters. I’m thankful to the first responders, service members and health care workers who work through the holidays to keep us safe and healthy. And I’m thankful to all of you, my fellow Michiganders, who make our state the best place to live, work and yes, save turkeys.”

,Wisconsin Examiner,2025-11-19 11:00:12+00:00,Wisconsin Examiner,Health care isn’t a political issue. It’s a math issue. And the math isn’t adding up.,Mike Draper,,,,,https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2025/11/19/health-care-isnt-a-political-issue-its-a-math-issue-and-the-math-isnt-adding-up/,"In an ever-changing world, it’s nice to know that some things stay the same – my annual health insurance premium increase just came through for the 20th year in a row!

For 2026, my company’s small-group policy will rise roughly 10%. And believe it or not, in the world of American health care, that’s considered a modest increase.
For my own family — myself, my wife, and our four kids — our health insurance plan costs about $1,800 per month with a $12,000 annual deductible. That is about $34,000 per year. 
If your household earns around $110,000 a year, you’re actually doing extremely well: that puts you in the top 15% of earners in states like Wisconsin.
But even at that income, a $34,000 annual healthcare bill eats up 40% of your post-tax income.
Let’s put that in perspective:

That $34,000 is almost six times what that same family pays in Medicare taxes — taxes that help cover the oldest, sickest people in the country.
That $34,000 is more than my family spends on food, mortgage, property taxes, and utilities combined.
And the gap between what we pay and what we use has become downright comical: I’m at Hy-Vee four times a week, but I haven’t been to a doctor in over three years.

But here’s the bigger problem: When premiums go up 7% per year — again, considered “moderate” — the magic of compound interest turns that into a doubling of price in just a decade.
At only 7% increases, by 2037, a family earning $110,000 will be paying a $45,000 annual premium for a small-group plan. Add a $15,000 deductible, and private insurance would consume 80% of their after-tax take-home pay.
No household, no matter how responsible or hard-working, can withstand that. 
We’ve been promised reform for nearly a decade. Donald Trump began talking about fixing healthcare back in 2016. By 2024, the country still had nothing more than “concepts of a plan.” And temporary patches — tweaked subsidies, tinkering with tax credits, or tossing out $2,000 checks — are not even in the neighborhood of a real solution. 
At the very least, Congress should make sure those price spikes don’t devastate families on Jan. 1, but the fact that those tax credits are needed speaks to out of control costs within the health care system. 
We are out of time for small fixes. The system doesn’t need polishing — it needs structural change. 
What we need is bold leadership and big ideas. And in my view, the fastest, most practical path forward is a public option — Medicare-for-all-who-want-it. Let individuals and small businesses buy into Medicare. If my family could get coverage for anything less than $34,000 a year, that’s an immediate savings! And we’re far from alone. That’s why I’m advocating with other small business owners, including those at the Main Street Alliance, to get it done. 
You can’t solve an economic problem with partisan politics. That’s why Rep. Derrick Van Orden must come to the table to negotiate on health care. He said he would protect rural health care earlier this year, then turned his back on folks on Western Wisconsin and voted for the ‘Big Ugly Law’. The system is broken and we need serious people to address health care in a serious way. The math has already made the case. Now we need you to have the courage to follow it.

(Photo: Clark Couty Public Works Dept.)In an effort to stave off projected budget shortfalls that local transportation officials warned would have decimated funding needed to maintain and grow Southern Nevada roadways and transit projects, Clark County Commissioners voted 6-1 Tuesday to extend inflation-adjusted gas taxes.
The fuel revenue index (FRI) program, which allows the county to index gas taxes to the rate of inflation, was set to expire at the end of 2026. 
Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada officials told commissioners extending the index for another decade was needed to prevent any loss in funding and enable the county to continue to compete for federal dollars. 
Clark County Commissioner April Becker, the lone dissenting vote, bemoaned the fact the decision to extend the index was being made by the commission rather than “a vote of the people” as it was originally intended when it received a vote in 2016. 
“There is a lot of audacity that I’ve been assured that in 2036 it will go to the vote of the people,” she said. “That’s the only way to ensure it will be increased. Guess what, you fool me once, you will fool me again”
Her fellow commissioners disagreed, citing a need to act now to prevent any loss of revenue. 
“It would be irresponsible, in my estimation, to postpone a vote on this item,” said Commission Chair Jim Gibson. “We owe it to the people we represent to take a hard stand and do the right thing.”
For every gallon of gas sold in Clark County, roughly 78 cents is collected in taxes with about 26 cents going to the RTC.
In addition to funding Southern Nevada roadways and transit projects, the revenue generated puts the county in a better position when competing for federal grant dollars. In order to apply for federal grants, jurisdictions are often required to provide matching funds.
The FRI  has “generated $1 billion in additional funding we otherwise wouldn’t have had,” since being adopted, David Swallow, the deputy CEO of the RTC told commissioners Tuesday. The county has been able to turn that into $3 billion worth of projects with the addition of federal grants, he said. 
The money has supported 727 projects with 530 completed, 106 in construction, and 91 in the design phase, Swallow said.
The Clark County Commission originally approved adjusting the tax for inflation in 2014, and two years later nearly 60% of Clark County voters approved extending the fuel revenue index until 2026. 
M.J. Maynard-Carey, the CEO of the RTC, had sounded the alarm for several years about the pending shortfall if the tax wasn’t extended beyond 2026. 
Assembly Bill 530, passed by the Legislature during its regular session earlier this year, allows the Clark County Commission, by a two-thirds vote, to extend FRI an additional decade beyond its current sunset date. The FRI would then require voter approval if it went beyond 2036.
Similar legislation was introduced in 2023. Assembly Bill 359 passed with bipartisan support but was vetoed by Gov. Joe Lombardo. 
The county’s effort to extend the FRI received broad support Tuesday from labor unions, environmental groups and Chambers of Commerce.
In his vote in favor, Commissioner Justin Jones said in numerous conversations with local and national transportation officials, they said “Absent the dedicated funding streams we have as a result of FRI, we would not get those federal grants.”
“Our federal tax dollars are going to go somewhere,” Jones said. “A vote today determines if those federal tax dollars through the Department of Transportation will stay here in Southern Nevada” or go other places.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/gettypylons-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-19 08:56:31.099721

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee’s campaign finance watchdog is ordering a former House staff member — recently pardoned after conviction in a corruption case — to testify about a political action committee he secretly formed in 2020 to sway the election.
The Tennessee Registry of Election Finance voted Tuesday to drop a subpoena against ex-chief of staff Cade Cothren and, instead, bring him in next year to explain his actions in forming the Faith Family Freedom Fund. 
Registry Chairman Tom Lawless said Cothren sent fraudulent documents, including a treasurer’s report and several emails, to the Registry when he formed the political action committee.
In 2022, the Registry board subpoenaed Cothren, who worked for former House Speaker Glen Casada, after a former girlfriend, Sydney Friedopfer, testified he asked her to form the political action committee so he could run it secretly. She also said in telephone testimony that Cothren told her she didn’t need to worry about responding to questions from the Registry.
Cothren refused to comply with the subpoena, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The Registry board sent the matter to the Attorney General’s office, which took it to Chancery Court to be enforced. It languished there until Cothren’s federal corruption case wrapped up with a pardon by President Donald Trump following a conviction on multiple charges involving a bogus campaign vendor.
Registry sends Cothren subpoena to AG’s Office after he refuses to testify, claims the Fifth

Regardless of whether Cothren refuses to show up and talk to the board, it could levy a civil penalty against him. And if Cothren refuses to pay the penalty, he would be ineligible to run for a state office, according to Bill Young, executive director of the Bureau of Ethics and Campaign Finance.
Cothren hinted recently that he would seek election following his pardon.
“And presidential pardons have absolutely no bearing on it,” Lawless said after Tuesday’s board meeting.
Cothren’s attorney, Cynthia Sherwood, told the Registry board three years ago he shouldn’t be compelled to testify in the civil matter at the same time the Williamson County District Attorney’s Office was investigating the matter. It is unclear whether that office is reviving the case.
The political action committee spent money donated in the 2020 campaign by a North Carolina restaurateur, whom the Registry was unable to locate, to pay for campaign ads attacking former Republican Rep. Rick Tillis of Lewisburg. Tillis, a political enemy of Casada’s, was defeated by Rep. Todd Warner in November 2020. Two months later, the FBI raided the offices and homes of Warner, a Chapel Hill Republican, Casada, Cothren, and former Rep. Robin Smith of Hixson. 
Smith pleaded guilty to taking kickbacks from Cothren, along with Casada, for steering House Republicans toward a campaign vendor he ran called Phoenix Solutions, which was set up in New Mexico.
Cothren and Casada received presidential pardons in early November after being sentenced to prison for their roles in the political corruption case. Smith, who testified for federal prosecutors, is to serve a short prison stint but is seeking a pardon as well.
Jurors found Cothren used a phony name, “Matthew Phoenix,” to fill out a federal tax form required by the state. They also heard an audiotape of FBI agents questioning Casada and notifying him it is against federal law to lie to them.
Casada resigned the speaker’s seat in August 2019 amid a sexist and racist texting scandal involving Cothren, in addition to complaints about his management style after the House Republican Caucus cast a no-confidence vote. 
The Registry board initially audited the Faith Family Freedom Fund PAC because of a complaint filed by Greg Hazelwood, the treasurer for Tillis, who claimed the political action committee illegally coordinated with Warner’s campaign. Auditors were stonewalled but finally found Friedopfer, who registered the PAC, in Utah.

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)Beheshte Hemid, 25, smiles while singing the ABCs with fellow women refugees at a weekly class inside Calvary Baptist Church on Broad Street in Providence. 
She smiles stumbling her way through an explanation in English about the life that her family of three has set up since moving to Rhode Island from Afghanistan 11 months ago. 
But Hemid’s smile becomes forced as she takes in the news that the federal food assistance she and many other clients at the Refugee Dream Center rely on will be cut off in three months. She’s too stunned to say anything. So a friend and fellow Afghan refugee speaks for her.
“It’s unbelievable,” Sitara Sakhizada said.
Yet it’s the reality coming for hundreds of thousands of lawful immigrants nationwide, whose access to critical and longstanding government safety net programs will be stripped away by the massive federal fallout from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
The budget reconciliation package targets some of the most vulnerable noncitizen groups: refugees, asylum seekers, and domestic violence and human trafficking survivors, for whom Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid, along with other federal tax credits and health discounts, will be yanked away.
In Rhode Island, an estimated 2,300 people will lose SNAP benefits due to their immigration status starting Feb. 1, according to an Oct. 30 report by the Rhode Island Executive Office of Health and Human Services. Medicaid restrictions will cut off health care coverage for 9,000 adults starting Oct. 1, 2026 — children under 19 can still qualify regardless of their immigration status under state law.
Plus newly begun Medicaid work rules could preemptively kick off immigrants who are unable to find a job, or keep up with the extra paperwork, to comply.
“It’s going to be disastrous,” said Jane Rapanganwa, program coordinator for the Refugee Dream Center, which hosts the weekly women’s class that helps prepare refugees like Hemid for their new lives in America. 
“A lot of our clients come from non English-speaking countries,” Rapanganwa said. “In order to get a job here, you need to be able to speak a basic level of English.”

Statewide consequences 
A new report by The Economic Progress Institute details the widespread financial and economic fallout of benefits cuts for Rhode Island, where nearly 15% of the state’s population are immigrants, contributing $1.8 billion in federal, state and local taxes as of 2023, according to the U.S. Census data.
Cutting off refugees and asylum seekers from federal food assistance will cost the state $5.5 million in annual benefits funding, in turn diminishing the money spent at local grocery stores and circulating through the state’s economy. Separate federal policy changes taking effect in 2026 limit tax credits available for taxpayers with children to only include those with Social Security numbers — an identification code only available to citizens and green card holders. Lawful immigrants who pay taxes using an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number will no longer be able to claim the credit for up to $2,200 per child on their 2026 tax returns, even if their children are citizens. This will sap $30.5 million from Rhode Island residents, and in turn, the state economy in its first year, according to the report.
The report’s author, Divya Nair, senior policy analyst for children and families for The Economic Progress Institute, likened the ramifications of immigrant benefit cuts to a snowball — rolling downward as it grows.
“Basically what this bill does is deepen inequities,” Nair said in an interview. “It’s going to reduce economic participation. Resources that used to go directly to the state will be left on the table. And the state has to create administrative systems to implement all of these changes.”
Meanwhile, local food pantries and community organizations are bracing for increased demand, while health care providers, especially hospitals, will be flooded by patients who no longer have insurance coverage.
And, it will only become harder, and take longer, for refugees, asylum seekers and other immigrants to integrate into the state economy without the programs that help them to transition.
“They are still paving their way, depending mainly on government support to get going,” Rapanganwa said.

The American Dream
English classes are just one of the services the Refugee Dream Center offers. There are also classes for digital and financial literacy, help finding a job, navigating the public transit system, and other life skills. Just as important is the center’s emphasis on community building, creating a place for those fleeing persecution and trauma to seek comfort and build relationships. 
The weekly women’s group that Hemid and Sakhizada attended, for example, might be the only socialization they have outside of their homes and with their immediate families, Rapanganwa said.
As they filter into the church parking lot on an overcast Thursday, the women exchange greetings and hugs before traipsing up the metal stairs tucked around the back. The mood in the small, second-floor gathering space is light as volunteer teacher Tracy Ahmadian leads the group through a series of games designed to practice their English.
It’s a much needed respite from a daily reality that for many, remains a struggle.
Leontine Makanjr, 65, has been plagued by mysterious back and chest pain, prompting multiple visits to Rhode Island Hospital to try and find out what’s wrong. Majanjr, who is from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, hopes her next appointment will yield a diagnosis, and more importantly, a treatment plan.
But she doesn’t know how she will afford doctor’s appointments or medication without Medicaid, she says.










They are still paving their way, depending mainly on government support to get going.

Ibado Mohamed similarly has no backup plan for losing SNAP benefits. The 43-year-old Somali refugee gets paid through Medicaid to care for her younger brother, who has a disability and uses a wheelchair, she said. Yet she struggles to stretch her government income, supplemented by $300 in monthly SNAP benefits, to cover groceries, rent and utilities for the three-bedroom apartment where she lives with her brother and uncle. 
For Parisa Qaderi, an Afghan refugee, the bottom has already dropped out. Her husband died three months ago of a heart attack, her case worker, Noorulhaq Sadeqi, said.
Since then, the 25-year-old mom of two toddlers got a job at a West Warwick day care, earning just enough to kick her off of federal food assistance already.
Qaderi still gets a smaller federal food stipend through the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Unlike SNAP and Medicaid, immigration status will not affect eligibility for WIC.
But it’s hard to make sense of what’s still available and for whom amid evolving federal mandates. 
“For our community members, they are feeling panicked, worried,” Sadeqi said. 
The new restrictions on SNAP did not initially spell out when asylum seekers and refugees will lose benefits. State administrators are still waiting for federal guidance on new Medicaid eligibility restrictions. The federal rescission package also pulls back government health insurance for legal, permanent immigrants who have had green cards for less than five years, but it’s unclear whether that extends to existing beneficiaries, or only new applicants.
The state report on federal policy changes highlights the “substantial public concern and confusion” already around eligibility, noting that it will increase calls to state agencies that administer Medicaid and food assistance, along with appeals for benefits being denied or terminated.
Hemid’s smile has been replaced by a panicked look as she stands in a narrow hallway just outside the women’s group class. Her head bowed toward Sakhizada, she begins brainstorming aloud in search of a solution to her looming SNAP cutoff.
Could she reduce her grocery list? Maybe.
More free food from the food pantry? Perhaps.  
A job? That seems impossible.
Her husband already works at a medical manufacturing facility. She stays home with her baby, she said through her friend as an interpreter.

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)A special election to fill the state Senate seat being vacated by Lt. Gov.-elect Ghazala Hashmi is expected to take place before the General Assembly convenes for its 2026 session in January, setting up a rapid-fire Democratic contest in a deep-blue district that spans parts of Richmond and Chesterfield County.
Hashmi, a Democrat first elected in 2019, won the lieutenant governorship earlier this month, leaving her 15th District seat open just one year into her second term. 
Under Virginia law, the highest-ranking member of the Senate — currently Senate President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth — is responsible for calling a special election while the chamber is still in session. If lawmakers have adjourned, the responsibility shifts to the governor. 
Lucas did not respond to a request for comment.
Sen. Lamont Bagby, D-Henrico, chair of the Democratic Party of Virginia, said Democrats are preparing to move quickly once a date is announced.
“We’re waiting on Senator Lucas to set a special election and then have something done swiftly,” Bagby told The Mercury Tuesday. “I feel good about our chances of winning the district, but we still have to run through the tape and do the work and not take it for granted.”
Bagby cautioned that Democrats have seen districts with strong general-election advantages become unexpectedly competitive when turnout is low. 
“You can’t just assume that you put a Democrat on the ballot and folks are just going to come and you’re going to get the same result as that previous general election,” he said. “It requires doing the work.”
 A heavily Democratic district

Senate District 15, which was redrawn ahead of the 2023 cycle, is one of the bluest seats in the state. 
According to the Virginia Public Access Project, it consistently backed Democratic candidates running for state and federal offices by comfortable margins in recent elections. The district is home to more than 133,000 registered voters, and its demographics and voting patterns make it a safe Democratic hold — at least on paper.
Ernest McGowen, a political science professor at the University of Richmond, said the district’s shifting demographics make it even harder for Republicans to compete than in previous cycles.
“That is going to be a hard seat to flip,” he said, noting that since the most recent redistricting “the district is more fully moving Democrat.”
McGowen pointed to the rapid diversification of south Richmond and northern Chesterfield — including more affluent Black households moving into northwest Chesterfield and fast-growing Latino communities in south Richmond — as trends that “will likely make it a solid hold.”
A special election, he added, could give Democrats “another enthusiasm boost” heading into the next cycle.
David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, agreed that the district has become  “a solid Democratic seat” in recent cycles. 
“Looking at the past few elections, the district has gone for Democrats by 30 points. I don’t think the Republicans have a chance to grab the seat.”
Still, Richards said Republicans may participate even if the odds are long, arguing that the party needs to be visible everywhere if it hopes to rebuild statewide after their devastating statewide losses in the 2025 election. 
“Maybe they would take note of the Democratic strategy in the recent election, where the Dems ran in all 100 House of Delegates districts,” he said. “If the GOP wants to get back into the ring in Virginia, they need to do the same, run candidates even in places where they will likely lose. They need to rebuild their brand in Virginia ahead of 2026.”
As of Tuesday afternoon, no Republican has formally filed to run. The district’s 2023 GOP nominee Hayden Fisher — who lost to Hashmi 62–37% — said in an email that he was not seeking a rematch this year.
Over the weekend, some voters received a phone survey mentioning former Sen. Joe Morrissey as a possible independent candidate. 
Morrissey, who represented the old Senate District 16 until losing a Democratic primary in 2023, has made headlines in September for breaking ranks with his party by endorsing Republican lieutenant governor nominee John Reid. 
But when asked by the Virginia Mercury if he was considering the race, Morrissey replied via text that he has “no plans” to run.
 Two Democrats already in

Two sitting House members — Del. Debra Gardner, D-Chesterfield, and Del. Michael Jones, D-Richmond — have already announced campaigns, positioning themselves for what could be a short and intense primary.
Gardner, first elected to the House two years ago, said she plans to continue the work Hashmi began. 
“I want to thank Lt. Gov-Elect Hashmi for her service as our state senator,” Gardner said in a statement. She emphasized her background in advocacy and social services, adding: “I’ve spent my career serving Virginia families — from protecting survivors of abuse to fighting for fair wages and affordable health care.”
Before her stint in the House, Gardner spent seven years as a social worker before holding senior roles at the Commission on Virginia Alcohol Safety Action Program and the Virginia Department of Corrections. She later oversaw several Richmond agencies under former Mayor Dwight C. Jones before founding D2G-Coaching, a firm focused on executive training and social work. In 2019, she narrowly lost a bid for the Chesterfield Board of Supervisors.
Gardner linked her Senate bid to the incoming Democratic administration that swept all three statewide races this year: “I’m excited to work with Gov.-elect (Abigail) Spanberger to move Virginia forward and protect our narrow Senate majority.”
Jones, who has served in the House since early 2024, highlighted his progressive record and his support from local elected officials. 
“I am eager to continue to provide strong, progressive, compassionate, energetic leadership to Chesterfield County and Richmond in the state Senate,” he said in a statement announcing his candidacy.
Prior to his election to the House of Delegates, Jones served on Richmond City Council from 2016 to 2023, including a term as council president, and became known for pushing changes to public safety and monument policy. 
He championed efforts to remove Confederate statues, backed limits on police use of force during the 2020 protests, and supported an examination of the Richmond Police Department’s budget. He also backed the city’s SPEED plan to address disparities in education, housing and health care. 
In his statement, Jones framed the 2025 election as a continuation of statewide momentum. 
“Election Night, Virginians spoke overwhelmingly that they are tired and frustrated with President Trump and Republican policies,” he said. He promised to focus on affordable housing, public school funding, health care access, gun violence prevention and small business development.
Because the special election date will come quickly, Democrats are preparing for a firehouse primary — a party-run election that typically takes place at a limited number of polling locations over a short window of time. Firehouse primaries are often used when legal deadlines or logistical constraints make a state-run primary impractical.
Special elections in Virginia often draw low turnout even in competitive districts, and the timing — likely early 2026, depending on when Hashmi formally steps down as senator — could limit participation further.

(Photo by Jim Morrison for the Virginia Mercury) Lawmakers are setting their priorities ahead of the next General Assembly session in January, which will begin days before a new governor takes office. As a new legislative era begins, climate issues are expected to take a front seat during debate in the coming year.
A joint committee focused on recurring flooding in Virginia met Tuesday to recommend ideas for legislation they believe can better aid the commonwealth with addressing flooding and helping  funds flow to resiliency projects. 
“Flooding is no longer a future threat, it is a present day challenge that can present itself on any given day,” said Sen. Angelia Williams Graves, D-Norfolk.
The city of Norfolk is in the middle of a major undertaking with the Army Corps of Engineers to build flood walls, levees, tidal gates, pump stations and elevating buildings to prevent rising sea levels from devastating city streets with floodwaters. It is a $2.6 billion project that will be built in phases through 2038 – based on estimations. 
The city and state are expected to split the cost share of the project. Members of the recurring flooding board want to establish a flood mitigation local nonfederal match fund to better distribute the cash to localities that have match obligations for projects.
“Currently, there is no mechanism in the commonwealth to participate directly in localities’ non-federal cost shares for federally funded coastal storm risk management projects,” Williams Graves said. “This leaves each locality, regardless of their size, or their financial ability to pursue one time appropriations session after session, after session.”
Awarding those funds in larger tranches rather than the smaller appropriations from the legislature requires a study by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission be completed. The study will determine how much money the state should be putting up for these matches. The board made a motion to ask JLARC to bump up the study in their schedule to get it finished by 2027. 
Other legislation the board recommended for consideration in the upcoming legislative session include creating precipitation standards when it comes to designs of stormwater management facilities, culverts, bridges and other transportation infrastructure. The standards would be set by the State Water Control Board.
Another proposed bill looks to use materials dredged out of waterways to be repurposed for habitats, living shorelines and other resources. Currently the state designates the sediment from dredging as a waste.
To transform trash into treasure, a modern tech company turns to an ancient recipe

“In some instances, we are taking dredged material and dumping on sleeping blue crabs out in the open water,” said Jay Ford, the Virginia policy manager for the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. “In other instances, we’re staging it. We recently have heard that some of the staging areas for this material may not be available (in the future).”
The board also recommended that the Virginia Marine Resources Commission establish a habitat policy oversight committee that can  aid the commission in policy decisions around coastal resilience. The oversight committee will have weighted input into the commission’s decisions about mitigation strategies, regulation changes to wetlands and habitats.
Williams Graves also recommended multiple budget amendments, with the caveat that she understands that the budget process will be restrictive next year and all of her requests may not be awarded. 
She suggested $50 million be put into the proposed flood mitigation for local nonfederal match funds. She also suggested an additional $200 million be put towards the community flood preparedness fund and to continue to invest in the local assistance fund for infrastructure improvements.
The recommended bills and budget amendments will need to be officially filed for the 2026 General Assembly session by delegates and senators by the beginning of session on Jan. 14.

Tucker High School in Henrico County on June 16, 2025. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Two former state education secretaries and multiple education experts have been appointed to serve on Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger’s transition team, tasked with preparing the new gubernatorial administration for the next four years.
The team was announced on Friday after Spanberger rolled out her “Strengthening Virginia Schools Plan” in August.
Former secretaries of education Jim Dyke, who served under former Democratic Gov. L. Douglas Wilder’s administration, and Anne Holton, under former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s administration, highlighted the list of appointments. 
“I am excited that we will have new leadership in education in Virginia from Governor-Elect Spanberger and her team,” Holton told the Mercury. “It is sorely needed, and I am honored to help with the transition in any way I can.”
Holton recently completed her term on the Virginia Board of Education, during which she frequently challenged Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration on education policy issues including overhauling the state’s accountability system. 
Dyke, who has known Spanberger since she ran for Congress, said he looks forward to sharing his expertise.
“I know what it’s like to have to transition into office and actually to govern, and to the extent I can … I’m looking forward to helping in any way that she thinks is appropriate,” Dyke said.
The list of education experts also includes Douglas Garcia, a former assistant secretary of education; Monica Logothetis, a former senior advisor to the U.S. Department of Education; Baron Braswell, a former school board member of Spotsylvania County Public Schools; and Deborah Frazier, the chief academic officer of Spotsylvania County Public Schools.
Spanberger has pledged her commitment to maintaining public funding for Virginia’s schools, enhancing the affordability and accessibility of higher education, and expanding opportunities for high school students to take college coursework.
This summer, Spanberger’s campaign said she would “make it a priority to give public schools the resources to explore best and promising practices through innovative career and technical education programs and work-based learning.”
Spanberger also expressed her views on balancing parental rights and children’s privacy during her August interview with the Mercury and said she supports more proactive information-sharing between schools, students and families that enhances safety without compromising students’ rights. She said that Virginia has the potential to lead in addressing communication barriers related to issues such as school overdose incidents and teacher arrests involving children.
Spanberger appoints energy policy transition team

The transition team, more broadly, is expected to prepare the way for the administration’s focus on “lowering costs, expanding economic opportunity, increasing business investment in Virginia’s economy, and creating a safer commonwealth for all Virginia families.”
The team also includes two professors connected to the University of Virginia: Yohannes Abraham, former executive director for the Biden-Harris transition team, former U.S. ambassador to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and a visiting professor at UVA; and Chris Lu, former executive director for the Obama-Biden transition team, former U.S. deputy secretary of labor and James R. Schlesinger Distinguished Professor at U.Va.’s Miller Center.
“These Virginians not only bring together deep ties from across every region of our commonwealth, but the experience, integrity, and know-how required to deliver the pragmatic and principled leadership that Virginians overwhelmingly voted for this November,” Spanberger said in a statement on Friday. 
Spanberger’s inauguration will take place in Richmond on Jan. 17, days after the start of the 2026 General Assembly Session.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)A day after President Donald Trump took office, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued a new directive to its agents: Arrests at courthouses, restricted under the Biden administration, were again permissible.
In Connecticut, a group of observers who keep watch on ICE activity in and around Stamford Superior Court have since witnessed a series of arrests. In one high-profile case in August, federal agents pursued two men into a bathroom.
“Is it an activity you want to be interfering with, people fulfilling their duty when they’re called to court and going to court? For me, it’s insanity,” said David Michel, a Democratic former state representative in Connecticut who helps observe courthouse activity.
Fueled by the Stamford uproar, Connecticut lawmakers last week approved restrictions on civil arrests and mask-wearing by federal law enforcement at state courthouses. And on Monday, a federal judge tossed a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Department of Justice that had sought to block similar restrictions in New York.
They are the latest examples of a growing number of Democratic states, and some judges, pushing back against ICE arrests in and around state courthouses. State lawmakers and other officials worry the raids risk keeping people from testifying in criminal trials, fighting evictions or seeking restraining orders against domestic abusers.










Is it an activity you want to be interfering with, people fulfilling their duty when they’re called to court and going to court? For me, it’s insanity.


– David Michel, a Democratic former Connecticut state representative


The courthouse arrests mark an intensifying clash between the Trump administration and Democratic states that pits federal authority against state sovereignty. Sitting at the core of the fight are questions about how much power states have to control what happens in their own courts and the physical grounds they sit on.
In Illinois, lawmakers approved a ban on civil immigration arrests at courthouses in October. In Rhode Island, lawmakers plan to again push for a ban after an earlier measure didn’t advance in March. Connecticut lawmakers were codifying limits imposed by the state Supreme Court chief justice in September. Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont is expected to sign the bill.
States that are clamping down on ICE continue to allow the agency to make criminal arrests, as opposed to noncriminal civil arrests. Many people arrested and subsequently deported are taken on noncriminal, administrative warrants. As of Sept. 21, 71.5% of ICE detainees had no criminal convictions, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data research organization.
Some states, such as New York, already have limits on immigration enforcement in courthouses that date back to the first Trump administration, when ICE agents also engaged in courthouse arrests. New York’s Protect Our Courts Act, in place since 2020, prohibits civil arrests of people at state and local courthouses without a judicial warrant. The law also applies to people traveling to and from court, extending protections beyond courthouse grounds.
“One of the cornerstones of our democracy is open access to the courts. When that access is denied or chilled, all of us are made less safe and less free,” said Oren Sellstrom, litigation director at Lawyers for Civil Rights, a Boston-based group that works to provide legal support to immigrants, people of color and low-income individuals.
But in addition to challenging the New York law, the Justice Department is prosecuting a Wisconsin state judge, alleging she illegally helped a migrant avoid ICE agents.











 “We aren’t some medieval kingdom; there are no legal sanctuaries where you can hide and avoid the consequences for breaking the law.


– U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin



“We aren’t some medieval kingdom; there are no legal sanctuaries where you can hide and avoid the consequences for breaking the law,” U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to Stateline. “Nothing in the constitution prohibits arresting a lawbreaker where you find them.”
Some Republican lawmakers oppose efforts to limit ICE arrests in and near courthouses, arguing state officials should stay out of the way of federal law enforcement. The Ohio Senate in June passed a bill that would prohibit public officials from interfering in immigration arrests or prohibiting cooperation with ICE; the move came after judges in Franklin County, which includes Columbus, imposed restrictions on civil arrests in courthouses.
“The United States is a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of law and order. To have a civilized society, laws must be respected, this includes immigration laws,” Ohio Republican state Sen. Kristina Roegner, the bill’s sponsor, said in a news release at the time.
Roegner didn’t respond to Stateline’s interview request. The legislation remains in a House committee.
Knowing where a target will be
Courthouses offer an attractive location for ICE to make immigration arrests, according to both ICE and advocates for migrants.
Court records and hearing schedules often indicate who is expected in the building on any given day. Administrative warrants don’t allow ICE to enter private homes without permission, but the same protections don’t apply in public areas, such as courthouses. And many people have a strong incentive to show up for court, knowing that warrants can potentially be issued for their arrest if they don’t.
“So in some respects, it’s easy pickings,” said Steven Brown, executive director of the ACLU of Rhode Island.
In June, ICE arrested Pablo Grave de la Cruz at Rhode Island Traffic Tribunal in Cranston. A 36-year-old Rhode Island resident, he had come from Guatemala illegally as a teenager.
“They pulled up on him like he was a murderer or a rapist,” friend Brittany Donohue told the Rhode Island Current, which chronicled de la Cruz’s case. “He was leaving traffic court.”
An immigration judge has since granted de la Cruz permission to self-deport.
Trump’s National Guard deployments raise worries about state sovereignty

McLaughlin, the Homeland Security assistant secretary, said in her statement that allowing law enforcement to make arrests “of criminal illegal aliens in courthouses is common sense” — conserving law enforcement resources because officers know where a target will be. The department said the practice is safer for officers and the community, noting that individuals have gone through courthouse security.
Still, ICE’s directive on courthouse arrests sets some limits on the agency’s activity.
Agents “should, to the extent practicable” conduct civil immigration arrests in non-public areas of the courthouse and avoid public entrances. Actions should be taken “discreetly” to minimize disruption to court proceedings, and agents should generally avoid areas wholly dedicated to non-criminal proceedings, such as family court, the directive says.
Crucially, the directive says ICE can conduct civil immigration arrests “where such action is not precluded by laws imposed by the jurisdiction.” In other words, the agency’s guidance directs agents to respect state and local bans on noncriminal arrests.
Trump administration court actions
But the Trump administration has also gone to court to try to overcome state-level restrictions.
The Justice Department sued in June over New York’s Protect Our Courts Act, arguing that it “purposefully shields dangerous aliens” from lawful detention. The department says the law violates the U.S. Constitution’s supremacy clause, under which federal law supersedes state law.
New York Democratic Attorney General Letitia James argued the state law doesn’t conflict with federal law and sought the lawsuit’s dismissal.
U.S. District Court Judge Mae D’Agostino, an appointee of President Barack Obama, on Monday granted James’ motion. The judge wrote that the “entire purpose” of the lawsuit was to allow the federal government to commandeer New York’s resources — such as court schedules and court security screening measures — to aid immigration enforcement, even though states cannot generally be required to help the federal government enforce federal law.
“Compelling New York to allow federal immigration authorities to reap the benefits of the work of state employees is no different than permitting the federal government to commandeer state officials directly in furtherance of federal objectives,” the judge wrote.
The Justice Department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
ICE arrests fell in August despite show of force in DC, Los Angeles

The department is also prosecuting Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan, who prosecutors allege helped a person living in the country illegally avoid ICE agents in April inside a Milwaukee courthouse by letting him exit a courtroom through a side door. (Agents apprehended the individual near the courthouse.) A federal grand jury indicted Dugan on a count of concealing an individual and a count of obstructing a proceeding.
In court documents, Dugan’s lawyers have called the prosecution “virtually unprecedented and entirely unconstitutional.”
Dugan has pleaded not guilty, and a trial is set for December.
Lawmakers seek ‘order’ in courthouses
Rhode Island Democratic state Sen. Meghan Kallman is championing legislation that would generally ban civil arrests at courthouses. The measure received a hearing, but a legislative committee recommended further study.
Kallman hopes the bill will go further next year. The sense of urgency has intensified, she said, and more people now understand the consequences of what is happening.
“In order to create a system of law that is functioning and that encourages trust, we have to make those [courthouse] spaces safe,” she said.
Back in Connecticut, Democratic state Rep. Steven Stafstrom said his day job as a commercial litigator brings him into courthouses across the state weekly. Based on his conversations with court staff, other lawyers and senior administration within the judicial branch, he said “there’s a genuine fear, not just for safety, but for disruptions of orderly court processes in our courthouses.”
Some Connecticut Republicans have questioned whether a law that only pertains to civil arrests would prove effective. State Rep. Craig Fishbein, the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, noted during floor debate that entering the United States without permission is a criminal offense — a misdemeanor for first-time offenders and a felony for repeat offenders. Because of that, he suggested the measure wouldn’t stop many courthouse arrests.
“The advocates think they’re getting no arrests in courthouses, but they’ve been sold a bill of goods,” he said.
Stafstrom, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, said in response that he believed the legislation protects many people who are in the country illegally because that crime is often not prosecuted.
“All we’re asking is for ICE to recognize the need for order in our courthouses,” Stafstrom said.

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A bill touted as making South Carolina’s abortion ban the strictest nationwide proved to be too extreme even for a panel packed with anti-abortion Republican legislators.
The proposal that received national attention over the last few months ultimately failed Tuesday with a 2-3 vote. Four of the panel’s six Republicans declined to vote on the bill itself, enabling the three Democrats to sink it.
A vote to outright reject a GOP-led bill is rare in the South Carolina Legislature. Usually, legislators choose to let legislation that lacks support quietly die at the subcommittee level by indefinitely delaying a vote — if there’s a hearing at all. But after a day-long public hearing last month and an hours-long meeting Tuesday didn’t sway the sponsor — who also happened to be the panel’s chairman — in at least changing sections opposed by some of the state’s most fervent abortion foes, the panel proceeded to an up-or-down vote.
And it showed the bill doesn’t stand a chance even among Republicans, said Senate Minority Leader Brad Hutto, D-Orangeburg.
“We just think the vast, vast, vast majority of South Carolinians are against this,” he said.
Supporters could still try to revive the legislation after the Legislature returns in January. But the bill’s failure to advance through a subcommittee led by the sponsor, Sen. Richard Cash of Anderson County, likely means that would be futile. Even a co-sponsor on the panel couldn’t vote for it.
Dubbed the Unborn Child Protection Act, the bill would have banned abortions from the moment a pregnancy was medically detectable. (The odd wording was meant to avoid prohibiting emergency birth control or fertility treatments.)
All Republicans on the panel were generally OK with a near-total ban on abortion. And separate legislation that goes further than the state’s six-week ban that took effect in August 2023 could get traction next year.
But what went too far in Cash’s bill for most Republicans were sections that criminalized women for getting an abortion, removed all exceptions for victims of rape or incest, and made it illegal to even advise someone on how to get an abortion elsewhere.
Anti-abortion groups split over proposal that could make SC’s ban the strictest nationwide

Attempted changes
The bill would allow women to be sent to prison for up to 30 years for an abortion. It also would allow her own relatives to sue her.
That was too much even for a co-sponsoring Sen. Billy Garrett, who tried to delete that section. When his amendment failed 4-5, the Greenwood Republican proposed capping the punishment at two years in prison or a $1,000 fine, unless the woman who received the abortion agreed to testify in court against the person who performed it.
But that failed 4-4, with Cash noting his bill already gave women immunity from prosecution if they agreed to testify.
Garrett ultimately was among the four who didn’t vote.
“This world needs more love than hate,” he said. “This world needs more forgiveness than hate. And we’ve got to work toward that.”
Sen. Tom Fernandez spoke through tears about the possibility that his wife or one of his six daughters could end up imprisoned under the law.
“I cannot see women be put in jail,” said the Summerville Republican. “I can’t. If we’re going to sit here and continue to talk about women as if they were the worst creatures on earth, I might as well say that to all six of my girls.”
And yet, he was among the two Republicans who backed the bill in the final vote.
Taking out the punishment would “gut the bill,” Cash said. He contends the possibility of severe prison time or a potential lawsuit is needed to prevent women from getting abortion medication through the mail for an at-home abortion. That’s already illegal in South Carolina, though ordering the two pills online from out-of-state providers remains possible.
“How can you have a law that criminalizes some action and then say if you break the law, there’s no penalty?” Cash said. “It’s not even logical.”
Sen. Tom Corbin, R-Greenville, tried to remove a section making it illegal to even direct someone to a website providing information on getting an abortion.
Telling people what they can and can’t say would violate First Amendment free speech rights, Corbin said.
“It would break my heart if somebody tells somebody where to go get an abortion,” he said. “But I took an oath to uphold the Constitution of this country and this state, and I have a hard time supporting a bill with a section in it that basically says what you can and can’t talk to somebody about.”
Cash likened that section to laws against hiring a hitman to kill someone.
“You don’t have the right to provide information to someone on how to kill an innocent person,” Cash said.
Democrats voted against every amendment offered.
“We already have one of the strictest bills in the country, but to go any further is just an outright attack on women and doctors,” Hutto said. “You can’t make something bad better by voting for things, so we just voted against everything.”
Doctors would face 30 years in prison and loss of their medical license under the bill. Opponents contend doctors’ fear of the existing six-week ban already delays emergency medical care for women. Making doctors face a 30-year prison sentence will endanger women further, they testified.
“There are so many things in this bill that are flawed,” said Ronnie Sabb, D-Greeleyville.
Only one amendment passed, and it was Cash’s. It allowed someone to take a juvenile to another state for an abortion with parental permission. It also allowed doctors to refer patients to specialists in states where abortion is legal.

(Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)A new Ohio bill would remove a requirement that the hepatitis B vaccine be administered to children attending child care or public schools. It would also bar schools from keeping out unvaccinated students if outbreaks of any disease occur.
The legislation is concerning for pediatricians, who worry about the state of public health should the bill be passed and signed into law.
Ohio House Bill 561 was introduced by state Reps. Melanie Miller, R-Ashland, and Monica Robb Blasdel, R-New Waterford.
One of the main goals of the bill, according to the sponsors, is to underscore medical, religious, and conscientious exemptions that already exist in Ohio law with regard to vaccines.
“This bill is about transparency and fairness,” said Robb Blasdel in a release announcing the bill. “Ohio parents should never be denied their lawful rights or face confusion about the exemption process.”
The bill also takes a cue from a federal effort, seeking to remove the hepatitis B vaccine requirement from the preschool regulations.
Children in child care, Head Start programs, and preschool are required to be vaccinated against 14 diseases, unless exempt: chicken pox (also called varicella), diphtheria, haemophilus influenzae type b (HIB), hepatitis A, hepatitis B, influenza, measles, mumps, pertussis, pneumonia, polio, rotavirus, rubella, and tetanus.

Ohio currently requires vaccinations for 10 diseases to attend K-12 schools: diphtheria, hepatitis B, measles, meningitis, mumps, pertussis, polio, rubella, tetanus, and chicken pox.
The federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices mentioned hepatitis B as one immunization for which eligibility requirements may change on the national level.
Hepatitis B has also seen rising case levels in states like Florida, where mandates for the vaccine are being lifted.
While vaccination rates remain high in Ohio, the vaccination rate overall has dropped in recent years below the national average, particularly for kindergarteners.
Melissa Wervey Gittelman, CEO for the Ohio chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics said the group has “a lot of concerns” about the new bill.
She and leaders in the group plan to engage with legislators about those concerns as the bill goes along in the legislative process.
Children’s medical decisions should ultimately be up to the parent, in consultation with their trusted medical professional, Gittelman said.
“What we often find is people are against (vaccinations) because they read something online,” she told the Capital Journal.
“But when they are able to talk to a medical professional, they change their minds because they hear the science behind it.”
Hepatitis B has been in the spotlight due to the advisory committee’s consideration of changing vaccination practices, but also because of political leaders like President Donald Trump giving incorrect statements on the vaccine and others expressing skepticism as to the need for children to receive the vaccine.
The CDC has recommended a hepatitis B vaccine for infants since 1991.
Ohio is one of 14 states that have laws allowing vaccine exemptions due to religious or conscientious reasons. Medical exemptions exist nationwide.
Under the new Ohio bill, schools would not be allowed to require additional documentation for students to be considered exempt from vaccine requirements, and no “specific exemption form” could be used.
The legislation would also bar schools from “excluding healthy, uninfected children” from attending school based on their vaccination status if they have a legal exemption, even during disease outbreaks.
Gittelman said not having the proper documentation could lead to confusion as to vaccination status of children, even if they’re fully vaccinated.
“We’ve seen it where children have the exemption form, but they actually have been vaccinated,” said Gittelman.
“When there is an outbreak, we don’t really know who is or who isn’t, and this bill doesn’t address that.”
Not allowing schools to remove unvaccinated children from a facility during an outbreak puts public health at risk, she said.
She pointed to the recent measles outbreak in New Albany as evidence that public health protocols that remove students who are unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status help keep children and the public safe.
“Those who haven’t had a second dose (of the measles vaccine), they gave that to them so they could be protected,” Gittelman said.
“Unvaccinated kids stayed out of the school for 21 days. Taking away our ability to do that puts many kids at risk.”
As Gittelman and other medical professionals talk with legislators while the bill is considered, she said the importance of having and engaging with a trusted physician will be a top message, because the vaccine discussion continues to be a political talking point.
“Vaccines have become really political, and I think that’s very unfortunate, because health shouldn’t be political,” Gittelman said.
The bill was assigned to the Ohio House Health Committee last week, but has not yet been scheduled for hearings.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderThe stalled Georgia case against President Donald Trump and more than a dozen allies accused of  trying to invalidate the results of the 2020 election was given new life last week. Or was it?
Peter Skandalakis, who was tasked with assigning the case to a different prosecutor following Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis’ dismissal by a top court, has decided to appoint himself to oversee what remains of the sprawling case.
Skandalakis, the executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia, highlighted the unusual nature of the case in his statement announcing his self-appointment.
“The filing of this appointment reflects my inability to secure another conflict prosecutor to assume responsibility for this case,” he said. “Several prosecutors were contacted and, while all were respectful and professional, each declined the appointment. Out of respect for their privacy and professional discretion, I will not identify those prosecutors or disclose their reasons for declining.”
Willis herself alluded to this “culture of fear” last month, warning that the national ramifications of the case and its outcome could make it difficult to find another prosecutor. “I think you have prosecutors, citizens and even judges who are afraid right now, and for good reason,” she told WSB-TV Channel 2. “The reality is it’s going to be hard to find a prosecutor that’s not afraid to prosecute that case when one of the primary defendants is threatening anyone that would dare to prosecute them.” She went on to argue that other district attorney offices may lack the resources and the staff to take on such a huge case.
Skandalakis, for his part, says there are still some parts of the case he needs to review. But he already has some familiarity with the matter. Willis was previously barred from bringing charges against Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, now a top Republican gubernatorial contender. A state senator at the time, Jones called for a special legislative session in the aftermath of Trump’s 2020 defeat and was one of the Republicans who participated in the alleged “fake elector” scheme. But a separate political conflict of interest resulted in Jones being severed off from any case brought by the Fulton DA.
Skandalakis would name himself to oversee the investigation into Jones after the lieutenant governor was listed as an unnamed co-conspirator. But he ultimately concluded that the case warranted no further action, saying that Jones was acting as an elected representative and not a criminal conspirator.
“Considering the facts, applicable law and the circumstances surrounding the events occurring in November and December of 2020 and January of 2021, I find the conduct and involvement of Sen. Jones as an elected representative to be reasonable and not criminal in nature,” Skandalakis said of Jones in 2024.
The appointment leaves Georgia as the only jurisdiction with an active criminal case against the president. He was convicted in Manhattan last year for falsifying business records, and the two federal cases against him were dismissed upon his return to the presidency.
We don’t know how Skandalakis will handle the case going forward. But if his exoneration of Burt Jones is any indication, the case is still skating on thin ice: There is simply no precedent for a state-level prosecution against a sitting president, and he wouldn’t be able to serve any prison time until the end of his term in office.
As for the remaining defendants and conspirators? Trump recently pardoned many of them, including Jones, for trying to overturn the president’s 2020 loss. But given that presidential pardons don’t apply to state prosecutions, the order was largely symbolic.
Now it’s all up to Skandalakis to decide when – or if – the case makes it before a jury. However, finding 12 impartial Georgians with no knowledge of the case to judge a sitting president’s staunchest allies may prove to be the steepest hill to climb.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DSC0364-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-19 05:57:28.125358

(Photo by Allegra Boverman/New Hampshire Bulletin)New Hampshire lawmakers took a step closer to approving a financial rescue mechanism for the Claremont School District Tuesday. But first, they added a string of conditions.
In a 3-2 vote, the Senate Education Committee approved new caveats to proposed legislation to allow struggling school districts access to a revolving loan fund. Among them: a minimum interest rate, a requirement to submit to a state audit, and a provision allowing all parents in the district to obtain education freedom accounts even if otherwise not eligible. 
The committee approved the changes via an amendment to House Bill 292, a dormant bill that lawmakers are using as a vehicle to pass the bill. That proposal still needs to win over majorities in the House and Senate in January. 
Democrats on the committee objected to some changes to the loan fund Tuesday, including the EFA provision and the minimum interest rate, and voted against the amendment.
Claremont has been reeling from a budget hole that emerged in August, when an audit revealed that the district had $5 million less than it had budgeted for in March, due to major accounting and reimbursement errors. Faced with the possibility of closing the doors for the 2025-26 school year, the school board obtained a short-term, $4 million loan from Claremont Savings Bank that will last until April. But representatives of the district say they need more funding to get them to the start of the 2026-27 school year and a new budget.
Republican lawmakers, including Rep. Rick Ladd of Haverhill and Sen. Ruth Ward of Stoddard, have proposed a revolving loan program that would allow Claremont to receive 75% of its anticipated state adequacy payments for the 2026-27 school year early. 
That proposal first emerged as a last-minute bill amendment last month. House and Senate leaders have since met to negotiate details, and many of the changes adopted by the Senate Education Committee Tuesday were recommendations of Rep Jim Kofalt, a Wilton Republican and lead negotiator.
The latest version of the bill makes the revolving loan fund open to any school district facing a financial crisis, not just Claremont. That determination would be made by the Joint Legislative Fiscal Committee, the commissioner of the Department of Education, and the state treasurer.
Tuesday’s amendment would peg the interest rate due back to the state to the effective federal funds rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which on Tuesday was 3.88%. That replaces previous language that allowed the state treasurer to determine the interest rate.
The amended proposal would prevent a school district from drawing from the loan fund if it already had an existing line of credit. It would cap access to the loan fund to three consecutive school years, in order to prevent a district becoming reliant. 
It would require the district to agree to a financial and performance audit by the state’s Legislative Budget Assistance, the legislative branch office that typically audits state departments.
And it would require the district receiving the funding to ask voters whether they would like to impose a tax cap on future district budgets at the next available annual meeting. 
Under the latest amendment, the entire revolving fund would sunset by 2030.
Senate Republicans said the proposal adequately balanced the need to help Claremont schools stay open with the need for accountability and school choice.
But Sen. Debra Altschiller, a Stratham Democrat, objected to the language allowing the education freedom account access. 
And Sen. Suzanne Prentiss said pegging the interest rate to the federal reserve rate might be overly expensive for the district. The interest on Claremont School District’s loan from Claremont Savings Bank is about 1.75%.
Senate Republicans countered that the interest rate was to make sure the state did not lose money itself on the loans, and said the EFA option is important for families who may have been surprised and frustrated by the fiscal mismanagement and might want alternate options.
The amended bill will appear next on the Senate floor in early January. If it passes that chamber, it will then need a vote from the House. That could be complicated, as some House Republicans have expressed uneasiness or even opposition to the idea of the state extending a financial lifeline to a school district, citing a worrying precedent.
Speaking to the committee on behalf of Kofalt, Grant Bosse, the Senate deputy chief of staff, said Tuesday that the latest bill is meant to be a compromise that can bring lawmakers in both parties together.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/claremont-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-19 05:57:28.125358

Yet Connecticut’s 211 service, often called Infoline, steered her toward income-dependent housing and child care, as well as nutrition and energy assistance.
Despite not receiving help from her daughter’s father, Slater kept her job, and within a few years — with some help from family — moved off assistance and met her future husband.
But the United Way of Connecticut, which contracts with the state to run the 211 service, struggles to aid hundreds of thousands more residents now than it did when Slater sought help in the late 2000s.
Further complicating matters, the 211 service, at first glance, is operating with the same state funding it received 15 years ago.

But once those dollars are adjusted for inflation, a key part of Connecticut’s social safety net has lost nearly 30% of its resources.
And officials fear vanishing federal aid for food, housing, heating and health care programs will push demand to unprecedented levels.
“It’s important to me that if people find themselves in these situations, those solutions [still] exist,” said Slater, now 46 and a member of the United Way of Middlesex’s governing board for the past eight years and a regular donor to the nonprofit. “I don’t need them anymore, but I know there are literally thousands of people in our state struggling.”
Inflation shrinks state aid even as demand swells
The 211 service responded to more than 1.7 million requests for help sent via phone or internet last fiscal year, up about 70% from pre-pandemic levels, as well as from the 2010 caseload.
Annual state funding for the program, which covers more than nine out of 10 of these requests, is slightly less than $3.7 million. But that funding barely has changed in a decade and a half, having stood at slightly more than $3.5 million in 2010.
Once adjusted for inflation, annual state support is down more than $1.6 million.
That’s the wrong trend for a service that must track hundreds of federal, state, municipal and private-sector human service programs, said Lisa Tepper Bates, president of the United Way in Connecticut.
“We are the connector, providing for people the path to what they need … and we play that role for all of the resources that we represent in Connecticut,” she said. “We make sure that government investments and the investments of our friends in philanthropy actually hit their intended mark.”
Whether the most complex state or federal benefit program changes its eligibility rules, or the smallest local clothing bank adjusts its hours, Infoline must maintain an up-to-date database, and staff must always be ready to give out detailed, accurate guidance.
“Sometimes a food pantry has moved across town, and they just haven’t updated their address” on websites or fliers, Bates said. “The last thing you want to do for someone in need is send them to the wrong location, at hours that it’s not open.”

Ronette Daniels of Stratford, an Infoline staffer for more than 10 years, said the job has become increasingly complex as a general sense of anxiety has grown among the public since 2020. “Post-COVID, I  think there’s been a change in general,” she said, adding that staff have tried to respond with compassion.
Front line staff, who generally earn between $50,000 and $62,000 per year, also undergo counseling training, not just updates on the latest changes to human services. The United Way’s 211 phone banks and central operations, housed in its office suite in Rocky Hill, include not only call centers and training areas but also rooms for staffers to decompress after particularly stressful calls.
Though requests for help with household and shelter were the single-largest type of inquiry received last fiscal year — about 36% of the more than $1.7 million total — mental health and addiction-related requests ranked second, representing more than 20%.
Most callers require solutions that involve a combination of services, Bates said, adding that emotional strain or trauma often is a component.
“The first thing they do is to validate how hard that must be, and to provide empathy and respect for the dignity of that person,” she added.
When she approached 211 for help, Slater said, she was distraught at the prospect of moving to southeastern Georgia, where her daughter would have attended one of the lowest-rated public school systems in the nation.
“The person on the other end of the phone was trained to make me feel comfortable and try and help me understand that, a), I wasn’t alone, and b), there were solutions.”
Food-related inquiries, which approached 180,000 or 10% last year, neared 117,000 after only about four months this fiscal year, spurred on by the federal government shutdown that stalled Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits.
Infoline staff also routinely coordinate aid involving employment, health care, utilities, legal issues, clothing, transportation, child care and education.
CT officials expect many service providers to seek more funds
The state has grown funding for some specialized programs under the 211 umbrella.
A 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, which didn’t exist 15 years ago, receives about $6.8 million annually from the state. And youth and housing crisis response services that collectively received about $510,000 then now get more than $2.9 million.
But the volume of cases handled by those three programs represent roughly 7% of the inquiries — whether they come in through email, phone or the website — directed to the Infoline service, Bates said. And she added limitations set in contracts with the state bar United Way officials from shifting resources from one program to another.
The core information and referral program, which had 32 front-line staff in 2010, now has just 17 and handles the remaining 93% of the inquiries.
Starting in 2017, Infoline had to begin offering callers the ability to request a call back, rather than wait on the phone. About 7% of callers chose that option last fiscal year. The service also tries to prioritize calls from pregnant women and others with special needs.
These trends sparked several appeals for more state funding from the United Way. And the General Assembly’s Appropriations Committee has endorsed funding increases in some recent years, but those hikes haven’t made it into the final budget adopted by the full legislature and Gov. Ned Lamont.
And the entire $3.7 million budget for the core 211 information and referral program represents a tiny fraction of state government’s finances — about 1/65th of 1% of this year’s $24 billion General Fund and 1/5th of 1% of this fiscal year’s projected $1.8 billion surplus.

But Connecticut since 2017 has been following a series of aggressive budget caps that force large surpluses, which then have been used to build reserves and whittle down the state’s hefty pension debt.
Still, Rep. Toni E. Walker, D-New Haven, and Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chairwomen of the Appropriations Committee, both praised the operations of the 211 service.
But while they didn’t rule out again recommending more funding, they also said their panel likely will face unprecedented calls for increased state dollars from across the spectrum of state, municipal, and private nonprofit social service providers.
Those same cuts in federal funding on nutrition assistance, heating aid, health care and other programs that are straining Infoline are placing unprecedented pressure on other programs as well.
“People are panicking,” Walker said. “It’s their food, their housing, their health care that are being attacked. … I don’t know if we can cover 100%.”
“I think we’re going to hear from everybody,” Osten added.
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said only that the administration is reviewing funding requests from many human service providers. When Lamont recommends his budget for the 2026-27 fiscal year on Feb. 4 to the legislature, Collibee added, the package “will safeguard essential safety nets and fulfill his commitment to increasing affordability for all residents.”
Slater, who began donating to support the 211 service even before she stopped needing public assistance programs, said state officials view the program as an economic investment, even if they don’t feel a moral obligation toward it.
“It was important to me to put it back,” she said of her donations, adding it was done partly from gratitude and partly to challenge negative perceptions.
“I think our society has really stigmatized being poor as bad choices that you make. You make bad choices, and that’s how you’re poor,” she said.
But Slater added her experience with 211 showed her life simply presents difficult challenges at times and that she could be successful.
“I just don’t think that people understand that life just happens. And you can try and make the best choices that are in front of you.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1112_SR_Infoline_037-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-19 05:57:28.125358

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original story.)An Ohio senator wants to place new limits on the scope and duration of post-employment noncompete contracts for certain health care workers.
The agreements are commonplace in several industries, but state Sen. Terry Johnson, R-McDermott, says they can be particularly onerous in the health care field.
In January of 2023, the Federal Trade Commission introduced a proposed rule banning all noncompete contracts nationwide.
Commissioners issued the final rule in April last year and courts put it on hold that August.
Two months ago, the Trump administration Federal Trade Commission formally announced it was abandoning the rule.
In committee, Johnson explained he was working on a bill limiting noncompete contracts for physicians before the federal commission acted.
“It’s apparent to me that the only way to resolve the situation regarding our health care workers will not be from the federal government, but at the state level,” he said.
The FTC wants to ban noncompete contracts, U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan wants to block that effort

The proposal, Ohio Senate Bill 301, limits noncompete contracts to six months and 15 miles.
Those protections apply to physicians, physician assistants, and advanced practice registered nurses working at nonprofit hospitals.
“Noncompete agreements are inherently anti free-enterprise and impede an individual’s ability to earn a living as he or she so chooses,” Johnson said.
“In fact, it’s not uncommon for some of these restrictive employment clauses to stipulate a radius of up to 50 miles. The most onerous I’ve seen in the state of Ohio is 70 miles.”
Johnson’s bill also specifies that the 15-mile radius only applies to the physical location where a worker is employed.
“If you have a large health care organization that has places all over Ohio, well, every place they have, that restricted covenant applies to,” Johnson said. “So, you can’t practice in Ohio anymore.”
Johnson stressed that his proposal “strikes a fine middle ground” — maintaining hospitals’ ability to impose some staffing restrictions but placing limits on their extent.
Thirty-four other states, he noted, have approved some kind of noncompete limitation in their state laws.
Three neighboring states, Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Kentucky, have noncompete restrictions aimed specifically at the medical field.
With FTC rule blocked, Ohio senators propose state-level noncompete ban

State Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, welcomed the idea, but asked why Johnson didn’t go further.
Why not include all nurses or for-profit hospitals, he asked.
“Because I do agree with you,” DeMora said, “that especially in these rural communities, you get a noncompete, and you’d have to move all the way out of move out of town, 60 miles away, or you’re stuck working a job you don’t want to work at.”
Johnson agreed that noncompete agreements can create “a terrible situation” for workers who have to uproot their life to change jobs but didn’t embrace a more broadly written bill.
He explained the current bill is already an expansion on an earlier version that only applied to physicians.
“You know, certainly someone could come up with a bill like that,” he told DeMora, “and and I might even support it, but I’m limiting this to professionals.”
Someone could write a more expansive bill — DeMora himself, for instance.
Ohio Senate Bill 11, a measure he’s co-sponsoring with state Sen. Louis Blessing, R-Colerain Twp., would prohibit all noncompete contracts going forward.
That measure is currently stuck in the Senate Judiciary Committee and hasn’t had a hearing since March of this year.

(Photo by Troy R. Bennett/ Maine Morning Star)In an effort to provide speedy relief for children experiencing discrimination in schools, the Maine Human Rights Commission sued five districts that recently adopted policies that restrict transgender students’ access to athletics, bathrooms and locker rooms.
The quasi-independent state agency told Maine Morning Star in an interview on Tuesday that given the growing number of districts that have approved such policies, filing a lawsuit is the fastest, most transparent way to ensure that schools do not impose rules that discriminate against students based on gender identity. 
The lawsuit against the school districts, first reported on by the Bangor Daily News on Monday, is the first time in recent history that the commission has chosen this course of action. Typically, the commission addresses violations of the Maine Human Rights Act, which has barred discrimination based on gender identity for two decades, through investigations following complaints of alleged discrimination.
“Given how widespread and how fast moving this has been, and what seemed like an increase in the pace of of school boards adopting these policies or considering these policies, it seemed like initiating an investigation within the commission’s investigative process was just was not going to be an efficient way to to deal with this issue,” said Executive Director Kit Thompson Crossman.
The investigation process can take up to two years, and has to remain confidential, Thompson Crossman said. That lengthy process would not address the immediate rights and needs of trans and gender non-conforming students facing discrimination in schools, they said. By filing a lawsuit, the commission is asking the courts to promptly weigh in and require the five districts to repeal their anti-trans policies and implement rules compliant with Maine law.
The lawsuit names five small, rural districts: MSAD 70 in Hodgdon, RSU 24 in Sullivan, RSU 73 in Livermore Falls, and the Baileyville and Richmond school districts.

– Maine Human Rights Commission Executive Director Kit Thompson Crossman


The consequences of these districts’ actions extend beyond creating a hostile environment for their gender nonconforming or trans students, according to the legal filing. It argues that other districts “cannot be assured that they will be protected from unlawful discrimination when they participate in athletic competitions against school districts which have adopted policies requiring students to participate on teams corresponding with their biological sex.”
The commission has received reports of adults threatening students “who do not appear biologically female,” according to the lawsuit, filed by commission lawyers Barbara Archer Hirsch and Collin Hurd.
Trans students are also concerned for their safety and may not file complaints for fear of retaliation, according to the commission, which has testified before several school boards against the policies.
“The harm created by these policies begins as soon as they’re adopted by intimidating transgender students, making them feel unwelcome and unsafe in their public school, which they are required by law to attend,” the lawsuit states.
Given the far-reaching impacts of these policies, the commission is also arguing that “Piecemeal resolution would waste commission and court resources, while a single assessment of the requirements of the Maine Human Rights Act would allow immediate and statewide resolution of this issue.”
Advocates from Maine Women’s Lobby and Equality Maine applauded the commission’s decision Tuesday. There are currently at least eight Maine districts that have passed anti-trans policies with more weighing changes, following a national movement driven by the Trump administration to exclude trans people from athletics, school facilities and gender-affirming care.
As a result, parents are afraid to send their trans or gender nonconforming children to school because they’re worried about discrimination or bullying, said Gia Drew, executive director of Equality Maine.
“The fact that these districts have gone their own way and gone rogue, I don’t know when this has ever happened before,” Drew said. “All kids should feel safe and welcoming and should be treated fairly in school, and that’s what our law says, and that’s what the courts say.”
Both Thompson Crossman and Maine Women’s Lobby Executive Director Destie Hohman Sprague said the fact that the lawsuit was initiated should come as a comfort to families that are worried about their children being unlawfully discriminated against. 
“I hope that they see this act by the commission as the protection that they deserve,” Hohman Sprague said. “Someone needs to have their back. And in this case, it seems that the commission is really making an effort to do that.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/cumberland-trans-rally-8-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-19 04:57:07.230349

Some of the most heinous crimes have the most vulnerable victims.
“I’ve responded to child sexual abuse victims at 2 a.m. in the hospital,” said Emily Gemar, with the Ohio Alliance to End Sexual Violence. “I’ve held their hand throughout the night.”
Thousands of kids in Ohio are sexually abused per year, she said. State data shows the majority of all reported sexual assaults happened to children under 18.
But many cases go unreported, Gemar said.
“It takes some time to build trust with that counselor, that mental health provider, to allow for a setting where somebody feels like they can disclose what’s happened to them,” she said.
And she was thrilled when Gov. Mike DeWine expanded his crisis mental health program. When a child calls the 9-8-8 hotline, they get emergency access to support — free of charge.
The program also lets teens 14 and older get temporary help, including six weeks of counseling, without consent from a parent or guardian.
Gemar said that’s important in sex abuse cases.
“We know that anywhere from 35% to 93% of child victims, one, knew their perpetrator, and, two, that perpetrator was a parent or caregiver,” she said.
But grandfather and conservative activist John Stover said the program keeps families in the dark.
“There is no situation whereby a parent should not be notified that their 14-year-old is dealing with mental health issues,” Stover, who runs the organization Ohio Value Voters, said.
Some Republican state lawmakers agree with him.
Ohio House Bill 172, sponsored by state Rep. Johnathan Newman, R-Troy, would require parental approval for minors to get the temporary support. It repeals the current state law allowing for this care.
“We should all want to see students who suffer with mental health struggles receive the help they need,” Newman wrote in his testimony for the bill’s first hearing.
“This bill seeks to do that, maintaining that the students’ parents cannot be left out of the picture because the parents are the child’s authority and most important and essential part of the student’s recovery.”
His bill is meant to mirror language from the last General Assembly’s H.B. 8, legislation requiring schools to notify parents if the child identifies as LGBTQ+ or has a mental health issue.
“You cannot have two unique programs where parents are notified under one circumstance if it’s in the school, and they’re not notified if it’s another circumstance outside the school,” Stover said.
Stover said the bill wouldn’t stop abusers from being caught. He said mandatory reporting requirements would go into effect — mental health professionals would have to tell police, who would then investigate the parents.
“There is no argument there,” Stover said.
But Gemar warns cases don’t always work like that.
“If a 14-year-old is being raped by a parent, they would have to ask the parent who is raping them for consent to go see a clinician,” Gemar said.
“There could be punishment, there could be threats or more physical or sexual abuse that occurs because of that.”
If the bill becomes law, she said, that is a door closed for teens to be able to safely seek help.
The Ohio Domestic Violence Network is expected to testify against the legislation, along with Gemar, this week.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)When the words “the government says no” come out of the mouth of your child’s health care provider, it feels surreal.
Even though I have watched society devolve in real time, it is still a mystery to me as to why some humans feel such authority over others.
“The government no longer allows your child’s right to hormone therapy. Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do.”
Watching the light drain from my child’s eyes, the fear washing over her face and then mine as her doctor broke the news. She followed that with the fact she was leaving Kansas to practice in a more welcoming state come August. Tyranny affects everyone in the end.
This is the consequence of actions taken by our elected officials. This past session, the Kansas Legislature passed Senate Bill 63, a gender-affirming care ban for LGBTQ+ minors. This bill, pushed by the Kansas Republican Party, effectively banned puberty blockers and hormones for minors, implicated the social transitioning of minors and threatens the licenses of medical providers.
An ER doctor in a rural Kansas community recently asked me: “How did everything work with her transition? How did the surgeries go?”
I thought, “Surgeries? How can a medical doctor be so ignorant of the process of transitioning?”
I had to explain that children do not have surgeries. You have to be grown and pass a psych evaluation for that type of surgery. The misinformation has crept into the most sensitive places when medical professionals become disillusioned by political gab. Misinformation and disinformation play a huge role in anti-trans legislation and policy we see popping up across the country.
In our state, flawed and disproven studies around efficacy and standards were used to justify SB 63. While this rhetoric plays a clear role in partisan politics, to see it seep into the perceptions of everyday Kansans is a travesty.
The ER doctor followed up, “What step is your teen on?”
None. Because Kansas has made it a crime to treat her.
What does treatment for my child mean? Hormone blockers. A delay in puberty that can be reversed. As she ages, and if she is physically and emotionally ready for more of a transition, she can start doing hormone therapy. Or she could have. That decision was taken from her, her endocrinologist and her parents when the Kansas Legislature overrode Gov. Laura Kelly’s veto.
The Legislature singled out a marginalized minority in this state and put a target on their foreheads.
The majority of Americans do not hate trans humans. The majority do not appreciate them being dehumanized. The majority of Americans do not find it necessary to erase the trans population. According to a 2017 poll by the Williams Institute, 67% of respondents from Kansas said they supported laws that would protect LGBTQ+ people from discrimination in jobs, housing and public accommodations.
Taking the “T” out of LGBTQ+ and making trans people hide in the shadows does not erase these beautiful humans, young or old. Those who harm will be remembered for their cruelty and their opposition to inclusion and freedom.
You see, the goal has never been “small government.” The goal has been control, sound bites, false outrage, lies, misinformation, half-truths and malicious intent. This is in step with many Republicans’ patriarchal approach to women’s rights, trans rights, LGBTQ+ rights in general and the rights of every dark-complected human in the states and abroad.
What’s the fight now? Freedom. Freedom for the largest number of human beings. That’s why we hit the streets and share the message of liberty and equality. That is why we hold town halls, why we meet to resist oppression wherever it rears its head. It’s why we speak up and hold the politicians who vote against our freedoms accountable for their votes, words and tone.
According to the UCLA Williams Institute, the LGBTQ+ community makes up 3.3% of the Kansas population, and 33% of that 3.3% are children.
That accounts for 1% of our entire population. That is the whole pie, not just the “T.”
Our government has attacked a marginalized population, taken their voices away by threat. It is our job as community organizers to provide sanctuary to those most affected and stand together to tell our government we will not tolerate the hate campaigns, and we will not exclude these instrumental Kansans from the rights we all hold dear as Americans.

Are you pleased with the way your politicians are “serving” you?
Are you happy you kept politicians in charge of redistricting?
Do you like them mocking you and spitting on your intelligence with more, flagrant gerrymandering?
Do you appreciate political hacks looking down on you as gullible rubes, easily confused and manipulated?
Are you thrilled to be forced, once again, to go to the polls next year and solemnly cast ballots in state and federal legislative races where nearly every outcome is predetermined?
After politicians yoked Ohio voters with partisan gerrymandering for the first half of the decade, they’ve now graciously shackled us with bipartisan gerrymandering for the second half.
In 2026, voters will decide elections in 99 Ohio House districts. Four or five might be competitive. The others will not.
In 2026, voters will decide elections in 17 Ohio Senate districts. One or two might be competitive. The others will not.
In 2026, Ohio voters will decide elections in 15 U.S. House districts. Two might be competitive. The others will not.
That’s 131 races. Seven to 10 might be competitive, being very generous.
The others will not.
That’s pathetic.
It’s a disgrace.
So, tell me.
Are you happy that your vote has been rendered a joke by bad faith politicians only looking out for themselves?
Are you pleased to see all the lip service we pay in America to liberty, to freedom, to free and fair elections, stomped out under the dirty boot of power-mad politicians?
Are these your heroes, these politicians?
Plying you with condescending platitudes?
So enveloped in the putrid miasma of their own flatulent self-importance and lust for power that they’ve abdicated all public responsibility?
So debased that they’ve untethered from basic ethics, honor, logic, and often reality itself?
So lost, they can’t recognize their own debasement?
So sociopathic, so indignant in their own boiling arrogance, they forever play like they’re the victims?
Or wait, I’m sorry, I must not understand…
Are we all supposed to pretend this is normal?
Are we supposed to believe that these people exhibiting this appalling display are our great and noble leaders, the standard-bearers of our society, foisting openly cheated maps on voters?
Are we supposed to pretend this is acceptable?
That these are not frauds and charlatans peddling poisonous political gamesmanship staked on the lives and well-being of American families?
Are we supposed to provide them political cover to be their worst selves?
Are we supposed to pretend we are not not degrading ourselves by continually allowing and excusing their abominable conduct?
Is this what nearly 75% of Ohio voters wanted in 2018 when they told politicians to stop gerrymandering?
Making a joke of public transparency and feedback?
Making a precedent of political extortion?
Making backroom deals that boon political machines and boondoggle the people?
Politicians dripping deceit, proclaiming the process worked?
Because by hook, all the politicians played in the mud together?
Rubbed dirt in their own faces and in the faces of Ohio voters?
Partisan judges poised if necessary to do the same.
Shall we give them all a pass?
Shall we excuse their atrocious acts?
As though the fate of any republic does not precariously balance at tipping point on its embrace or rejection of public virtue?
Shall we weakly, meekly call it “politics as usual” and abdicate our own responsibility? Our responsibility to ourselves? Our responsibility to the future?
Shall we fail to hold any of these politicians accountable for anything, ever?
Shall we just let them continue to run us over?
As long as they slap on that party label, to do whatever they want, no matter what they do?
Do we think that will turn out well for us?
Do we think that it has?

(Photo by Tim Lambert/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Every November 19th is a big day here in Gettysburg as we observe Dedication Day. 
This is a series of events preceded by the Remembrance Day Parade the Saturday before, and including Wednesday’s wreath-laying ritual, Naturalization ceremony, keynote speaker, recitation of the Gettysburg Address, and lighting of luminaria, culminating with the Gettysburg College Fortenbaugh Lecture at the Majestic Theater in the evening.  
All of this is a much-anticipated and beloved annual slate of events commemorating the consecration of the Gettysburg National Cemetery here and especially celebrating Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, in which he challenged his listeners to honor the courageous dead of that battle by completing their “unfinished work.”

I hope that readers finish that work by honoring the courageous living veterans who find themselves embattled by hunger, homelessness, and other pressing needs.
 Unfortunately, that battle has gotten a whole lot harder in recent weeks, as veterans were hit particularly hard by the recent federal government shutdown. 
Moreover, it is vital to note that the stalemate in Congress concerning extensions of the tax credits associated with the Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly called Obamacare, has direct ramifications for veterans. Non-senior veterans who rely on the enhanced premium tax credits held hostage by the shutdown may find themselves without health care if these credits are not extended. 
Indeed, more than a quarter million might lose their healthcare coverage. Of course, some vets receive their healthcare through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Readers should know, though, that VA benefit “eligibility is limited to certain priority groups, including veterans with low incomes or who have service-connected disabilities, and VA services can be inaccessible for those who do not live near VA facilities. 
As a result, subsidized coverage through Medicaid and Marketplaces plays an important role in coverage for nonelderly veterans.”
It is clear, then, that issues concerning veteran healthcare were actually at the very core of the recent government closure, and this is the major sticking point not directly addressed by the deal to end the shutdown. A vote on this issue is supposed to come in December, and the results of that vote will have an outsized impact upon veterans.
In addition, with Thanksgiving right around the corner, it’s particularly heartbreaking to realize that an even more pressing crisis is hunger, which also affects veterans in disproportionate numbers. Even before the shutdown the wolf was already at the door of the households of many Vets, as some 1.2 million veterans nationwide rely upon Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP benefits).










This Dedication Day, let us follow the charge of President Abraham Lincoln by fighting the battle still before us, offering “increased devotion” to those veterans among us.


About 60,000 of these live in Pennsylvania, which is about 9% of our local veteran population. In Pennsylvania in particular, food insecurity is “an ongoing battle for many” veterans, especially because the recent shutdown made it clear that SNAP benefits have become just another ante in the high-stakes game of hold ‘em that Washington politicians continue to play with other folks’ lives.
There is some short-term good news on this front for Pennsylvanians, however. On the last day of October, “Governor Josh Shapiro announced new state-led efforts to support Pennsylvania’s charitable food network and the two million Pennsylvanians who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). He channeled $5 million to Feeding Pennsylvania in order to expedite distribution through that organization’s“network of food banks throughout the state.”
In addition, the commonwealth provides emergency financial assistance to Veterans in need through the Veterans Temporary Assistance (VTA) Program, funded by donations.” Such assistance is vital because veterans are disproportionately at risk for a range of challenges, and are much more likely to find themselves homeless than are members of the general population.

Veterans often face such challenges in no small part as a result of their service.
Falling as it does the week after Veteran’s Day, Dedication Day offers a perfect opportunity not simply to glorify the heroes of the past, but to embrace and to offer solace to the living who have served their country with honor but have fallen upon hard times.
This Dedication Day, let us follow the charge of President Abraham Lincoln by fighting the battle still before us, offering “increased devotion” to those veterans among us. 
Let us seek out those in need and offer them support in terms of food and shelter and other necessities. 
Moreover, let us be, in Lincoln’s words, “dedicated to the great task remaining before us,” and find ways to address the health care crisis facing veterans and others in the short term and to provide better services for hungry and homeless veterans in the long term.

(Photo by Chris McGrath/Getty Images)In 2018, immigration lawyer Jacob Sapochnick noticed that a massive influx of overseas social media influencers were trying to obtain a highly exclusive visa reserved for wealthy and influential immigrants or those with artistic talents.
But it wouldn’t be until 2020 that Sapochnick, based in San Diego, was contacted by an OnlyFans model who hoped to secure an O-1B visa. At first, he was skeptical. 
Then he saw her monthly salary.
“She said, ‘Let me show you the backend of my platform.’ I looked, and she was making $250,000 a month,” Sapochnick told the Florida Phoenix in a zoom interview. 
“I was like, oh my god. Okay. I can use that.”
Learning that she was also involved in fitness influencing, he took her case. She became Sapochnick’s first OnlyFans client to obtain the O-1B visa. In the next two years, Sapochnick represented influencers from places like China, Russia, and Canada — many of whom were fitness influencers “dabbling” in OnlyFans.
Sapochnick’s story isn’t unique — at least, not anymore. According to five other immigration lawyers across the country who spoke with the Phoenix, the immigration sphere began to slowly shift toward the digital world a decade ago before exploding after the COVID-19 pandemic.
The O-1B visa was initially created in 1990 for acclaimed actors, musicians, performers, and other artistic professionals who continue to reap the lion’s share. But many of the lawyers specializing in these visas told the Phoenix that close to half (and up to 65%, in one lawyer’s case) of their clients are immigrants with massive platforms on TikTok, Youtube, or Instagram.
Of note, not all of them work with OnlyFans creators. In fact, those who did noted that the number of OnlyFans workers successfully obtaining these visas has largely declined since 2022 because that market has become “over-saturated,” with more women on the platform and pornography viewers instead turning to AI-generated porn.
OnlyFans, founded in 2016 but popularized during Covid, is a platform where subscribers can pay a fee to view or request content including sexually explicit images and videos from creators.
These little-reported statistics come amid a sweeping, nationwide crackdown on both illegal immigration under President Donald Trump and a growing movement on the right to make legal immigration more difficult. 
That push was strengthened when Trump imposed a $100,000 fee for companies hiring foreigners on certain specialty work visas, and fortified by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ call on universities to stop accepting these visas, called H-1Bs.
 What about the O-1B visa?

O-1Bs are considered one of the more exclusive visas. They’re specifically designed for immigrants with “extraordinary” talents, and people in the hunt for them need to check off at least three of six boxes. They can be renewed every three years.
These include starring in distinguished productions, national recognition, performing a lead role for distinguished organizations, a record of major commercial or acclaimed success, significant recognition from experts, or a high salary.
Many of these can be accomplished through expensive brand deals, high follower count, high engagement rates, and collaborating with other influencers. But that doesn’t mean it’s easy.
“Not everyone’s an O1, and that’s OK. If you’re just great at your job — you’re not an O1,” said Rishi Oza, a 20-year immigration law veteran and partner at the North Carolina branch of Brown Immigration. 
He explained that obtaining an O1 visa, whether it’s O-1B or O-1A — used by athletes, scientists, and business workers — is incredibly difficult, and they only go to those who stand out from others in their field in their home country.
“If there’s a woman with a masters in biostatistics at Yale with six years’ experience but no awards or reports, she’s not an O1,” Oza said. However, “It wouldn’t surprise me to see a dramatic uptick in online personalities applying for O-1Bs. There isn’t a visa for a digital online personality. 
“Inherently, you get forced into the O1 category.”
According to data on the State Department’s website, the U.S. issued 125,351 O1 visas between 2017 and 2024, the latest data available. Unfortunately, the department does not distinguish how many of those are O-1A versus O-1B visas, nor what professions they’re used for.
What is clear: Issuance of O1 visas has steadily increased year-over-year since 2000 — the earliest data provided on the department’s website, with minor fluctuations. The massive exception was 2020 and 2021, when COVID restrictions caused O1 issuance to plummet to 2007-2011 levels.
 Not all are successful

Sapochnick told the Phoenix that fitness influencers often cross over into the OnlyFans world, usually using Instagram as a “front gate” to their porn accounts.
“People will follow them [on Instagram] and they just show a little bit. Then they’ll have a link to their OnlyFans, and there, people will engage with them more,” Sapochnick said. 
He told the story of a Canadian woman he worked with who had more than 2 million followers on Instagram and was making “a lot” of money on OnlyFans. She used that wealth to start a fitness company, began helping brands contact other influencers, and created a program to help women lose weight.
By then, she’d created enough jobs and proved herself enough of an entrepreneur to qualify for a green card.
But not all are success stories. As an example, a Singaporean influencer asked Sapochnick for help with an O-1B visa application, but he told her she didn’t have enough traction online. 
“That’s fine,” she told him. “I’m just gonna keep doing my OnlyFans and when I’m ready, I’ll come back.”  
She was making $6,000 to $8,000 a month.
Careful regulation?
Although Elizabeth Jacobs, director of regulatory affairs at the Center for Immigration Studies and a former senior adviser at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, believes influencers can qualify for O-1B visas under existing law, she also believes policymakers should “carefully regulate” how these petitions are reviewed.
USCIS, the agency in charge of determining whether immigrants are eligible for visas, lets applicants submit “comparable evidence” of extraordinary ability when their field doesn’t neatly fit the criteria.
“The risk, therefore, is that immigration officers treat evidence — such as a decent social media following, some press or brand collaborations, perhaps — as evidence that the beneficiary is ‘outstanding, leading or renowned’ when I think the average media-literate American would understand that these types of achievements a[re] merely evidence of simply above-average talent, given the enormous volume of influencers/digital content creators out there in 2025,” Jacobs said in a written statement.
She added that Congress could tighten the statute by excluding digital creators or adult entertainers, setting a cap and ranking system, or redefining what counts as “extraordinary” in digital fields. Lawmakers could also “re-anchor” eligibility exclusively to awards by professionals or cultural institutions, barring the use of “comparable evidence” altogether.
USCIS did not respond to a request for comment on whether it keeps data on which professions it’s granting O-1B visas to.
 ‘Social media is the new generation’

Other immigration lawyers who spoke with the Phoenix, including Beverly Hills attorney Eli Kantor, his son Jonathan, Miami lawyer Joe Bovino, and New York attorney Michael Wildes, had similar messaging on social media and immigration:
The times are changing.
“It’s always changing. Traditionally, it was actors and actresses but, with the advent of social media, you started getting people who were both — even people who do OnlyFans,” said Kantor, who’s been practicing since 1976. He’s worked with three OnlyFans models in the past three years.
Most of his clients seeking O-1B visas are young aspiring actresses or models, often with brand partnerships with companies like Nike. Kantor often recommends they make appearances at influencer events like the Kentucky Derby or work with additional brands to expedite the green card process.
Bovino, who’s worked in immigration law for “decades,” said his clients are largely young women. He began to focus on the social media sphere after COVID, when he saw the potential for big business. He stressed that he has not worked with any OnlyFans creators.
“It’s not just cat videos anymore [online], it’s social media influencers making lots of money,” Bovino said, estimating that as many as 60% to 65% of his clients seeking O-1B visas are content creators.
 “And if you can make money there, suddenly it becomes a basis for a potential visa application.”
Wildes, whose long-standing immigration firm was founded by his father, who represented John Lennon in his visa application, said his firm works with “tons of social media influencers” and has been “very successful” with OnlyFans models.
“Though my wife doesn’t really approve,” Wildes joked. He said his company has dozens of them in the queue, although he noted it’s important for them to branch out past OnlyFans to eventually obtain a green card.
“If they just have a lot of money and they’re very sexy, it’s not gonna cut it,” he said. 
“Social media is the new generation.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-19 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Stamford’s transit plan — a half measure,Isaac Theodore Reicin,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/19/stamfords-transit-plan-a-half-measure/,Stamford needs an overall transit plan that includes an orbital bus system and street cars like it had before.,"Stamford’s transit history is rich and fruitful, yet the world continues to pass by without us looking back.
The first train arrived in Stamford almost two centuries ago and still today we ride these same trains that connect us deeper into New England and New York City. From wealthy businesspeople to blue collar workers, we all share one space in common: transit.
With the most expensive high school in New England history, we have another expensive infrastructure project under planning for our city. The Stamford Transportation Center Master Plan may improve our downtown transit center; but it is not the solution to the problem this city faces.
Like many cities in the U.S., our city has a car dependency problem and unlike many other U.S. cities, Connecticut cities have the potential for the most expansive transit networks in the United States. Our urban planning has been kept mostly intact below the Bulls Head intersection and there is massive potential for us to get back to our times of transit glory.
The Stamford streetcar network was one of the most expansive in all of New England when it started rolling back in 1894. It connected up and down Route 1 to Norwalk and Greenwich, throughout Glenbrook and Springdale, up the historic Bedford Street and past Washington Boulevard. It made our city accessible, not just for the few but for all. Everyone loves to talk about traffic on our streets, but no one wants to talk about the real solution: public transportation.
The Connecticut Department of Transportation and lawmakers in Hartford provide CT Transit with the money to do the bare minimum in our cities. Even with a recent federal grant providing brand new electric buses it hasn’t changed the fact that the frequencies are not often enough, the routes don’t cover every part of our city, there are not enough dedicated busways, there are no orbital connectors, they don’t run late enough, and have loop routes on weekends and evenings. 
Hundreds if not thousands of commuters in our city drive right past a bus station every morning on their way to work or the train, perhaps even passing the exact bus that is already going where they are going. These buses are nice, but there has not been enough of a push to make people aware of our transit system and that is not the fault of the residents; it is the fault of our city government and CDOT.

While our city government has made a push to make biking in our city safer, they have forgotten about the one form of transportation that is truly accessible to all: the bus and rail. Since our former Mayor Dannel Malloy was making a push to be the Transportation Secretary during the 2016 Clinton Campaign not one lawmaker has brought up the subject of transportation in any serious capacity. The 2010 planning for streetcar network rebuilding in Stamford and New Haven has been all but forgotten and, in a period where the federal government has been hesitant in its transit spending and the state has been lacking true innovation and out-of-the-box thinking, it must be noted that a time for real change is needed.
While our governor has done an excellent job controlling many issues that our state faced eight years ago, such as the state pension debt, there must be a new push to address the problems we have now as well. Stamford, New Haven, Bridgeport, and Hartford will struggle with growth if we do not push for higher spending on transit projects and operations. 
People in power must begin to think about a new future for transit in Connecticut or it will be a dark future for our state’s biggest cities and suburbs. The glory days may be behind us although much of the work has already been done to show that it is possible to get more people on transit. Unless the urban planners in Hartford want to have a new push for streetcars or even just an orbital bus system that is not only hub and spoke they will not help enough people, not now, and not ever.
It is time the politicians come to realize that ridership does not indicate your budget like we have seen with the current trickle flow of funding towards Shore Line East , instead to quote a great movie about the American Pastime “If you build it, they will come.”

On a Monday afternoon last month, 15,000 people lost power, with winds reaching up to 48 mph in Groton and Bridgeport. Trees fell on roads and power lines, heavy rain flooded parts of the state. 
Where I live in Willimantic, the lights stayed on, but the scale of the damage elsewhere reminded me of the flooding and extreme weather I faced growing up in Bangladesh. Even in a completely different economic and geographical setting, the effects of climate change are evident, and the same challenges with infrastructure struggling to keep up are clearly visible. 
As an environmental engineering student, I am concerned that Connecticut’s infrastructure may not be ready for a changing climate. Each time a major storm passes, the urgency fades. People move on, and the problem resets —until the next round of outages reminds us again. We must start planning and investing now, updating design standards, strengthening power systems, and preparing for the climate we actually live in, not the one we used to. 
Connecticut’s climate has been changing for decades. The Governor’s Council on Climate Change reported that precipitation has grown by 0.17 inches per decade since 1985, with the largest increases in fall, the very season when nor’easters often strike. Across the state, rain totals were up to two inches during last month’s storm. Days with more than one inch of rain are expected to rise with climate change. In a high greenhouse gas emission scenario, the average annual precipitation could increase 8% (four inches every year). That means wetter soil, more treefall during storms, and higher risks of power outages during storms. 
According to CT Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, past guidance for design precipitation about “10-, 25-, or 100-year storms” are no longer reliable. A storm that used to happen once in a century may now happen much more often. Most power lines and roads were built for an older climate, not the new reality of stronger storms. The CT Department of Energy and Environmental Protection’s Stormwater Manual has updated its design standards to account for climate change and resilience considerations. 


Eversource, Connecticut’s largest utility provider, has acknowledged that most outages are caused by trees falling on power lines. The company has invested in trimming branches and removing high-risk trees to reduce storm damage. These efforts have helped, but they cannot prevent all outages, especially as storms become stronger and more frequent with changing weather. Even with tree trimming and other maintenance, trees fall more easily because of wetter soil and heavier winds. 
Maintaining overhead lines is also expensive: Eversource spent more than $1.5 billion from 2010 to 2019 on repairs and tree removal. Burying lines underground would cost an estimated $28 billion for a quarter of the state, but annual maintenance would drop to $15 million, compared with $130 million for overhead lines, showing that underground lines could save money over time and reduce outages. 
Our planning and design practices need to catch up with rising temperatures, heavier rainfall, and the realities of climate change. Decisions about infrastructure, whether to bury power lines or continue maintaining overhead ones, should be based on careful research to find the most effective and sustainable solutions. 
Residents can also help by staying aware of storm risks, reporting hazards like unstable trees, and supporting local climate initiatives. The key is to treat these issues seriously and consistently, not to forget them once a storm passes. 
Rapid, well-informed action is essential to reduce damage from future storms and protect our homes and communities.

Sears,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/11/18/state-redistricting-expert-warns-governors-redistricting-panel-of-lawsuit-the-state-will-lose/,"A former executive director of the Department of Legislative Services warned a redistricting commission that if the state attempts to redraw boundaries of its eight congressional districts before 2030, it will end up in court.","Karl Aro, former executive director of the Department of Legislative Services, testifies to the three members of the Governor's Redistricting Advisory Committee who showed up for Tuesday's virtual meeting. Clockwise from top right, they are Senate Preisdent Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City), Aro, Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles) and Cumberland Mayor Ray Morriss. (Screenshot)A former executive director of the Department of Legislative Services warned a redistricting commission that if the state attempts to redraw boundaries of its eight congressional districts before 2030, it will end up in court.
“I won’t say I’m an expert, but I’ve been through a lot,”said Karl Aro, the former executive director of the Maryland Department of Legislative Services, who has been directly involved in “five rounds of redistricting.”
“I’ve seen a lot, and I have to say that I think that doing this midterm redistricting is a major mistake, very high risk for a lot of reasons,” said Aro, one of more than 40 people who testified during a virtual meeting Tuesday of the Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Commission.
It was the third meeting in a week for the fast-tracked commission, and the second at which it took public testimony. Gov. Wes Moore (D) created the five-member commission earlier this month and charged it with a “pressure test” of the state’s current congressional district map.
While Moore said the panel needs to consider whether the map is “fair” — a term he has not defined — it meets as other states engage in their own hyper-partisan midcycle redistricting, in an attempt to gain partisan advantage in the 2026 midterm electionss. Moore has also said Maryland and other blue states must keep pace or risk ceding congress to Republicans.
But if Moore was counting on an outpouring of support for redistricting at the commission hearings, that has not been present so far.
In first night of redistricting testimony, majority of speakers say ‘no’

More than 100 people signed to speak at the first two hearings. A third virtual comment session is scheduled for Dec. 5. On Friday, testimony ran 2-1 against redistricting. Testimony Tuesday was nearly even, with a slim edge to those who called for redistricting. Nearly all testifying in favor were Democrats — many with ties to progressive advocacy groups or party organizations.
Many redistricting supporters cited what they described as an existential threat to democracy, as President Donald Trump encourages Republican states to draw new maps that reduce the number of Democrats in Congress in what could be a tough midterm election for Trump and his party.
“The wheels are coming off of our democracy,” said Michael Replogle, a Severna Park resident. “However, as Republicans have weaponized the process of gerrymandering across the country and created a process where nationally, the majority opinion of our national population of voters isn’t fairly represented in Congress. Maryland needs to counter those Republican gerrymanders by advancing our own efforts to protect our national democracy.”
Opponents mostly identified themselves as Republicans or unaffiliated voters.
Dona Sauerburger, an unaffiliated voter from Anne Arundel County, said a week does not go by when the president, in her opinion, “does something that is such a threat to democracy that sets my hair on fire.” But responding in kind should not be the response, she said.
“A redistricting plan whose purpose is to determine how many candidates of which party will be selected to represent the people before the people even have a chance to vote — That’s voter suppression,” she said. “It threatens our very democracy.
“And you know, just because the parties in some states choose to subvert the democratic process by suppressing their voters’ voices to rig the election in their favor does not mean that the way that we can defend democracy is to also suppress the voices of some of our citizens here in Maryland,” she said.
Some of those testifying Tuesday, like Aro, were veterans previous redistricting battles.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Aro was involved in 2021, whena a congressional map drawn buya legislative committee was struck down by Judge Lynne Battaglia, who called “extreme partisan gerrymandering” and who linked partisan map-making to potential violations of Maryland’s Declaration of Rights.
Aro said lawmakers then believed they had adhered to constitutional requirements. But Democratic lawmakers redrew the lines to get the map in use today, and appeals of Battaglia’s ruling were withdrawn before they could reach the Maryland Supreme Court. Her decision is not binding but some Democrats, including Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City), are not taking it for granted.
Registered Democratic voters make up a little more than half the state’s voters, compared to about 25% each for registered Republicans and unaffiliated voters. But Democrats hold seven of the state’s eight congressionak seats, with Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st) as the lone Republican.
Harris and his district are the clear — if unspoken — focus of efforts by Moore and other state Democrats anxious to stand up to  Trump and hyper-partisan redistricting in Republican-controlled states.
Aro warned that the courts might not look favorably on a midcycle effort.
“I think if you eliminate the only remaining Republican congressional district, you’re going to find yourself in court with, again, extreme partisan gerrymandering, and I think, quite frankly, the state will lose,” he said.
The timing of the current effort will disrupt state and local election boards, he said.

“You’re going to create tremendous problems logistically for them,” Aro said. “You’re going to confuse voters, and you are probably going to anger a lot of independents, who already, from what I’ve heard this evening, are not very happy about things, and I think that that’s just going to exacerbate the situation.”
That was echoed by Diane Butler, one of two Republicans on the Maryland State Board of Elections.
“Our boards of elections work very hard at what they do at the local level and at the state level, but we have many strict deadlines, and they have to be met, some of which have already passed,” said Butler, who told the panel she was speaking as a private citizen and not as an elections board member.
“Redistricting now will negatively affect the local boards and the state board and their ability to give the citizens of Maryland the very best voting experience,” she said.
And a legal challenge is all but certain, Aro told the panel.
“I used to joke and say that the last step in redistricting was to go to court, because no matter what you do, you’re going to go to court,” he said. “And I think the timing of this is very bad.”
Del. Kathy Szeliga (R-Baltimore County) was the lead plaintiff in the 2021 map challenge struck down by Battaglia. She said she is preparing to go to court again if the state opts to move forward new out-of-cycle maps.
“The members of this redistricting commission can conclude that congressional redistricting midcycle is not a good idea,” Szeliga said. “You can oppose it, and I urge you to do that. Should you push through a map extinguishing Republicans, you can call it fair, but it would just be a power grab that flies in the face of democracy.
“If another gerrymandered partisan map is passed, we will see you in court and we will see you at the ballot box,” Szeliga warned.

Aro offered what he acknowledged as an unorthodox alternative to redistricting: He said the Democratic Party should “find somebody, a Republican, who is not MAGA” to challenge Harris, who is “full-on MAGA now, and those policies are very unpopular.”
“In fact, in my craziness, I think you should try to convince Larry Hogan to run in the 1st,” he said.
Hogan, the Republican two-term governor, lives in Davidsonville, outside the 1st District.
“You don’t have to be a resident of your congressional district to run it or represent it,” Aro said, adding Hogan is “very popular. He’s not a MAGA guy.”
For now, witnesses are testifying on the concept of redistricting. There is currently no redrawn map, although the chair of the redistricting commission, U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), said last week that she hoped to provide a map on which the public can comment.
Neither Alsobooks nor former Attorney General Brian Frosh attended Tuesday’s meeting.

Karen Simpson (D-Frederick), left, and Del. J. Sandy Bartlett (D-Anne Arundel), vice chair of the House Judiciary Committee, chat before a briefing Tuesday to discuss Maryland’s wiretapping and two-party consent law. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)For Del. N. Scott Phillips (D-Baltimore County), the debate over Maryland’s wiretapping law boiled down to one question.
“We don’t require consent for video, but we do require consent for audio. Does that make sense?” Phillips asked.
That was just one of the questions during a two-hour briefing Tuesday for the House Judiciary Committee on the wiretapping law, as lawmakers consider amending it when the 2026 session convenes in less two months.
Maryland is currently one of only a handful of states that has a two-party consent rule, under which everyone in a conversation must agree to it being recorded. Under the law, a person wjho records another without their permission could face up to five years in prison or up to a $10,000 fine, or both.
But modern technology has led to some tricky interpreations of the law, said David Gray, a professor at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law, who participated in the briefing. He said that while a doorbell camera might capture video and audio of an alleged crime, the video can be admissible in court under the current law, but not the audio.
“My understanding of the history of the law is that it was adopted at a time where video recording was relatively unavailable, and so it just wasn’t on the minds of the legislature at the time,” said Gray, who participated in the briefing virtually.
“You’re right to recognize that technology might have overtaken us, and trying to write that law now in our current technological environment,” Gray said. “I would not envy you or your staffers.”
There are exceptions to audio and video recordings that are allowed under the law. Claire Rossmark, an analyst with the Department of Legislative Services, and counsel to the Judiciary Committee, said they include telephone companies employees, 911 calls, police body-worn cameras and court-ordered wiretaps for investigative work.
But lawmakers are looking clarify other carve-outs to the law, including in cases of domestic violence or housing discrimination.

Legislation coming back?
Several bills from the 2025 General Assembly are already being eyed for the next session. They include House Bill 314, sponsored by Del. Robin Grammer Jr. (R-Baltimore County). It would allow any oral or electronic communication to be used as evidence in court if “the interest of justice will be served,” such as protecting domestic violence victims.
A companion bill, sponsored by Sen. William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery), passed the Senate unanimously last year but stalled in the House.  Grammer filed a prefile version of the bill Tuesday.
Another bill slated to make a return is House Bill 392, sponsored by Del. J. Sandy Bartlett (D-Anne Arundel), vice chair of the Judiciary Committee who presided over Tuesday’s briefing. Her bill would allow a fair housing tester to obtain evidence of any housing violations under the law.
Sen. Charles Sydnor III (D-Baltimore County) sponsored a Senate version that was approved 28-18 in the Senate, but did not advance in the House.
Heather Morton, who directs the financial services, technology and communications program with National Conference of State Legislatures, said her research did not find any other state with a specific wiretapping exception for fair housing testing programs.
Morton said her research could not find a law similar to Grammer’s HB 314. But she said California does let a domestic violence victim seeking a restraining order record confidential communications with an abuser that “may be held germane as evidence for that restraining order and for it to be admissible” in court.
‘Maryland is an outlier’
Morton said Maryland is just one of 10 states that is a two-party, or “all-party” consent state. The majority of states are one-party consent, which lets one person record a conversation without needing the other’s permission.
“So for example, if you’re on a phone call with a colleague in a one-party consent state, you can record that call without telling the other person or obtaining their consent,” Morton said.
Two attorneys at Tuesday’s briefing had differing opinions on what Maryland should do.
Joyce King, chief counsel with the Frederick County State’s Attorney’s Office, said certain recordings should not need any consent, especially when they deal with domestic violence, child or elder abuse, or other violent crimes.
“Maryland is an outlier,” she said. “These cases are limited to crimes committed against a person, that the recording is not just to embarrass or to be salacious … not to capture your private conversations at the dinner table. It’s a material fact of a crime.”
But Baltimore City Public Defender Marguerite Lanaux said two-party consent provides privacy protection from “fabricated evidence” through artificial intelligence and audio manipulation that “helps prevent malicious actors from creating or editing recordings to frame individuals.”
“Just because we are in the minority [among states] doesn’t necessarily mean that we need to move to the majority,  where the majority is in a place that doesn’t afford protections that the Constitution is truly rooted in,” Lanaux said.
After the briefing, Bartlett said one of the key points in assessing the use of two-party consent next year will be the admissibility of evidence to be reviewed by judges.
“They would have all the evidence, and they could weigh the evidence and see is this the best evidence? Is this evidence going to help prove the material of fact, just as they will with any other evidence that gets admitted,” she said. “It was a good briefing to have this discussion.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Dels.-Karen-Simpson-and-Sandy-Bartlett-11-18-2025-1024x804.jpg,,,2025-11-19 05:57:28.125358
