Faith Winter, who died at 45 in a car crash last week.
Friends, family and colleagues remembered the Broomfield Democrat as an “altruistic” public servant who followed a steady moral compass during her career and life. More than anything, they spoke about her love for and commitment to her family and friends.
“It’s easy to see that she made an outsized impact in her short time. But to me, it’s not what she accomplished that’s remarkable, but it’s how she accomplished it — with empathy, humility and inclusivity,” Jessica Walker, a lifelong friend of Winter’s, said. “Kindness was her North Star.”

The memorial was attended by many current and former elected officials of both parties, including Gov. Jared Polis, members of the state’s congressional delegation and state lawmakers. Nearly everyone wore orange, Winter’s favorite color, or buttons that read “Lift As You Rise,” a nod to Winter’s ethos of creating better pathways and environments for everyone, especially women interested in public service.
“She knew that our state could be a better place, and she focused tirelessly on making it so,” Polis said. “When Faith was on your team, she was a fierce ally, 100% committed to the cause.”
Winter died in a multi-vehicle crash on Interstate 25 near Dry Creek Road on Nov. 26. The cause of the crash, one of two that occurred around the same time along the same stretch of the highway, is still under investigation. Her autopsy could take a month to finish.
Winter is survived by her two teenage children, Sienna and Tobin Snook. She was engaged to Matt Gray, a former Democratic state representative.
“My mom put so much love out into the world, which is why we feel her absence so strongly,” Sienna Snook said. “She didn’t need a reason for fighting to fight for others. She did because she knew that her voice was made for helping those who didn’t have one.”
Snook said that every night her mother would read her a “feminist story to show me to shoot for the moon.”

Elevating women’s voices
Speakers highlighted Winter’s public policy successes, including championing the successful ballot measure in 2020 that created a state-run paid family and parental leave program.
“She didn’t just win paid leave in Colorado,” said Dawn Huckelbridge, the leader of the national Paid Leave for All campaign. “She won it after fight after fight — after introducing it, after flipping the Senate and then taking it to the ballot for the very first time in this country, ignoring every naysayer and winning.”
Winter also sponsored a major transportation funding bill in 2021 that imposes fees on fuel, deliveries and ride-shares to fund transit and transportation projects. During this year’s regular session, she ran a bill to further protect reproductive health care access in Colorado.
As a representative in 2018, Winter alleged sexual harassment by fellow lawmaker Steve Lebsock, setting the stage for the House to expel him.
She became the assistant majority leader in the Senate in 2023.

Winter previously worked as the director of Emerge Colorado, an organization that recruits and trains women to run for public office. Many mourners spoke about Winter’s commitment to elevating women’s voices and helping them ascend to positions of power.
“Because she was only one person and only had so many hours in each day, she trained others on how to step up and do the work and build the bench that we needed to bring the change that she sought. And I was one of thousands who benefited from that,” said U.S. Rep. Brittany Pettersen, a Lakewood Democrat who served in the Colorado Legislature with Winter and first met her in a fellowship program.
“She said ‘You should run for office,’” Pettersen said. “I immediately laughed and replied that people like me don’t run for office. And she said ‘Isn’t that the problem?’”
While many people spoke through tears about Winter’s life and legacy, the atmosphere was also celebratory. Speakers played upbeat music from artists including Taylor Swift and Kesha, two of Winter’s favorites, before and after the memorial service. Large photos of her with her two children flanked the podium. The steps of the Capitol were adorned with vibrant flowers, arranged by Rep. Jenny Willford, a Northglenn Democrat.
“She loved gerbera daisies and sunflowers because they were bright and bold,” Willford said. “They are cheerful blooms that match her energies — the kind of flowers that don’t shy away from the sun. They turn towards it, just like she did.”

Idaho Gov. Brad Little and fellow Idahoan, Chief of the Forest Service Tom Schultz, on Friday announced the renewal of the state’s Shared Stewardship agreement with the U.S. Forest Service. 
 Agreement aims to reduce wildfire fuels through targeted logging 

The state and federal entity have had an agreement in place since 2018, but the new one comes with goals such as to roughly double current timber sales from National Forest land to 100 million board feet annually within five years. 
Little, Schultz and Idaho Department of Lands Director Dustin Miller emphasized Friday that the idea is to reduce wildfire risk. 
“This broader approach allows us to reduce fuels at a meaningful scale, protecting communities, improving forest health, strengthening local economies,” Little said Friday at a press conference. “… I deeply value our partnership as we work to prevent devastating fires, protect property and safeguard Idaho.” 
Schultz said the goals in the updated agreement align with President Donald Trump’s “Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production” executive order issued in March that directs federal agencies to pursue ways to boost logging production and timber sales from federal lands.

Officials in the U.S. The Department of Agriculture, where the Forest Service is housed, are predicting a 25% increase in the volume of timber product sales over the next four years, Schultz said. 
The Forest Service is providing about $4 million upfront to ramp up the effort, he said, and the boosted timber sales are expected to cover ongoing costs. Other goals include working with private landowners to create fuel breaks and reduce fuels in areas where people live close to the wildland interface. 

The Idaho Department of Lands has developed a map of priority areas for logging and other fuel reduction, such as prescribed burns. Forested areas near McCall and in North Idaho around Coeur d’Alene and Sandpoint are among the primary focus areas. 
The agreement also includes plans to use the revenue from timber sales for fish and wildlife habitat restoration, tree replanting, and recreation improvements. 
Idaho is facing a projected budget shortfall of about $58 million for the current fiscal year, and a roughly $600 million deficit in the next fiscal year. Agencies are not expected to be able to increase staffing or request new employees during the upcoming legislative session. Miller said the state lands department has unique authority to be able to hire foresters to scale up activities if the income from it is sufficient.
Miller said the plan is to “bring on additional foresters to grow the program commensurate to the need.” 
 Schultz says Forest Service staffing is stable, conservation leaders worry it’s not enough

The partnership signed Friday will be executed by federal, state, tribal, and private land managers or forest owners.
Around 40% of Idaho’s land is forested, and nearly 90% of that forest land is owned and managed by the U.S. Forest Service. Staffing at this agency was slashed in February amid mass layoffs as part of an effort by the president and then-advisor Elon Musk to cut back on spending. 
The Forest Service at the time cut around 3,400 positions, Reuters reported, or around 10% of its workforce. After a U.S. district court judge ruled in March that the mass firings were unlawful, the agency announced it would rehire many of the employees, Central Oregon Daily News reported.  
Asked Friday about how the staffing volatility might affect the agency’s ability to increase land management activities, Schultz said he wasn’t concerned. 
“Most of the resources that we have at the district and the forest levels have been pretty stable,” he said. “But we’re also leaning on partners. Partners being states and tribes and (non-governmental organizations) that help us do the work.” 
Idaho Conservation League Public Lands and Wildlife Director John Robison remained skeptical that the staffing situation is enough. Robison sits on the governor’s Shared Stewardship Advisory Council. 
“They have lost a tremendous amount of staff and expertise and institutional memory on the forest that’s needed to get this work done,” Robison said Friday in an interview. “… I appreciate the chief’s statements that the staffing decreases have stabilized, but they’re far short of what they need to be to accomplish the stated goals.” 
On Thursday, a group of Democratic U.S. Senators from mostly western states wrote to Shultz questioning if the Forest Service was doing enough to reduce wildfire fuels, Boise State Public Radio reported. The federal lawmakers’ letter came after an analysis from the advocacy group Grassroots Wildland Firefighters that found a nearly 40% drop in fuel reduction projects compared to previous years.

 Robison: New agreement can improve forest health, but must include public

Idaho and federal authorities have worked closely together since 2015, when the state implemented “Good Neighbor Authority” agreements to use state personnel and resources to assist with federal management. 
Little said the Shared Stewardship agreement uses the Good Neighbor Authority model and expands the cooperation across Idaho’s landscape, regardless of ownership. 
“Both models allow the state of Idaho, through our Idaho Department lands, to help get more work done on the ground,” Little said. 
Robison said that the collaborative approach to reducing wildfire fuels in Idaho has been largely successful. The challenge has been to ensure that timber activity doesn’t return to the “timber wars of yesteryear,” he said.  
He said a key component will be to avoid old growth trees. 
“There is an overabundance of small- and medium-sized trees on the National Forest in Idaho that wouldn’t otherwise be there, if not for decades of fire suppression,” Robison said. “And these overstock stands could actually benefit from some targeted thinning and prescribed fire. Those activities can both improve forest health and protect communities if they’re combined with hazardous fuel reduction efforts on private property.” 
Robison attributed Idaho’s success in this area to robust public participation. However, recent changes under the National Environmental Policy Act, known as NEPA, may limit opportunities for public comment.
This summer, federal agencies, including the USDA, proposed regulation updates that include options to expedite environmental reviews and reduce or eliminate chances for the public to weigh in. 
“The public is in danger of being shut out from decisions made on our National Forests,” Robison said, “at a time when that is a core component for successful restoration and management.”",https://idahocapitalsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/logging-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-05 19:56:46.313496

This story by Carly Ocasso was first published in The Bridge on Dec. 4, 2025.
One of the three finalists to become Montpelier’s next city manager is facing a $5 million lawsuit stemming from a decision he made at his current job. 
After hours of interviews and some procedural controversy, Montpelier’s City Council chose three finalists on Wednesday to replace former City Manager Bill Fraser: Pinole, CA City Manager Kelcey Young, Pitkin County, CO Commissioner Kelly McNicolas Kury, and Woodstock, VT Municipal Manager Eric Duffy.
However, Duffy is also one of the defendants in an active lawsuit filed in April by Woodstock Police Chief Joseph Swanson after Duffy demoted him. Duffy had placed Swanson on paid leave in October 2024, two days after a traffic incident involving a confrontation between Swanson’s husband and another driver, according to the Vermont Standard. 
In November, an “independent investigation by the Vermont State Police determined that no charges could be filed against either driver,” according to the Standard. The demotion was reversed by the court in December. But Duffy did not drop the matter and hired a private detective on Oct. 25 to investigate unnamed complaints against Swanson, according to the Standard.
Swanson responded in kind with a lawsuit against Duffy, the village trustees, Burgess Loss Prevention (the private investigator), the Town of Woodstock and the Village of Woodstock. The lawsuit claimed Duffy and the other defendants had acted unlawfully, maliciously, improperly and without cause, which damaged his reputation, according to court documents.
Still, Duffy told The Bridge his decision was warranted following a 14 hour hearing where the matter was discussed publicly.  “I am always going to do what I think is right and in the best interest of my staff, my community and the municipality, and if needed, hold people accountable for their actions or lack thereof,” Duffy said on on Thursday. “We believe he was unable to perform his duties as chief,” citing two no confidence votes — one from the police union and one from the dispatch union in November of 2024.
In Vermont, it is required to show proof  of “cause” to  remove a police chief from office, according to court documents. Village Trustees had unanimously supported Duffy’s decision to demote Swanson, but the court decision on Dec. 2 asserted the trustees did not show evidence of “cause” to do so. 
The village reasoned that a ‘for cause’ determination was not necessary because demotion was not equivalent to terminating employment. The court disagreed, stating that a demotion effectively removes one from office.
Duffy said that as a candidate for city manager, if he gets the position he looks forward to working with the community to co-create a place where people have enough housing and are able to thrive economically.  City Councilor Ben Doyle told The Bridge he was aware of the lawsuit during the hiring process, and that Duffy’s ability to face the situation head-on during the hiring process led him to believe Duffy is a man of integrity “who isn’t afraid to make hard choices.” Doyle also said he hopes community members keep an open mind and ask questions of all the candidates during the upcoming public forum.
An evening email to all Montpelier city councilors only yielded Doyle’s response. An email and phone message to Swanson’s lawyer were not immediately returned.

The layoffs include employees at Hoskinson Contracting and Hoskinson Concrete. The concrete company will close permanently.
The post Construction companies lay off 123 workers in Gillette appeared first on WyoFile .","Hoskinson Contracting and Hoskinson Concrete gave walking papers to a combined 123 employees this week, and an official with one firm said the concrete company will close permanently.
The number of workers laid off is significant, according to state officials, and beyond normal seasonal fluctuations in the construction industry.
Both companies are based in Gillette and founded by Charles Hoskinson, CEO and founder of Input Output Group. He also founded the new Hoskinson Health & Wellness Clinic on the south side of town. 
The construction and concrete companies were created to support the clinic, Hoskinson Contracting CEO Chris Davis said in a press statement.
“The large-scale construction needs that led the clinic to create an in-house construction company have come to an end,” Davis said. “As a result, Hoskinson Contracting is scaling back its operations, and the Hoskinson Concrete division is being closed.”
Every laid off employee will remain on payroll through January, according to a company spokesperson. Hoskinson Contracting employed more than 260 workers, according to its website on Friday morning.

Gov. Mark Gordon, in a statement Friday, described the situation as “one of the most significant layoffs Wyoming has ever seen.”
“This is tough news for more than [100] Wyoming workers who showed up, put their skills to work, and who now face job loss,” Gordon said. “I am deeply concerned for the hard-working individuals and families who now face uncertainty, especially during the holiday season.”
Wyoming Workforce Services has organized resources to reach out to affected employees and connect them to other employers in the region, as well as workforce training opportunities.
“We have offered to do a virtual event and to do something at our [Gillette] location,” Administrator of Workforce Programs Holly Simoni told WyoFile. “We’re trying to get specific contact information on these employees so that we can reach out to them and offer our services.”
Affected workers are encouraged to reach out to the Gillette Workforce Center, Simoni said. Job Seekers can look for employment and register at the HireWyo website.
Neither Gillette nor Campbell County elected officials were notified of the layoffs, according to WyoFile inquiries. Reached for comment Friday, Campbell County Commission Chair Kelley McCreery said he was unaware of the layoffs. 
“I do know [the companies] expanded really, really fast,” he said.
The county awarded Hoskinson Contracting a job earlier this year to install a boiler at the Northeast Regional Airport outside Gillette, according to McCreery, but the company asked to get out of the contract.
“They came back to us later and said, ‘We have lost some supervisors and we’re spread too thin, and we’d like to get out of the deal.’ So we let them out,” McCreery said.
Hoskinson Contracting will “work in a more limited capacity” going forward, according to Davis. “It will concentrate on maintaining existing Hoskinson properties and overseeing future construction projects, which it will bid out to local Wyoming contractors.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-12-05 23:41:52+00:00,Mississippi Today,New Orleans leaders call for transparency during federal immigration sweep,"Aliana Mediratta, Verite News",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/05/new-orleans-immigration-sweep/,New Orleans officials are demanding that federal agents be more transparent and humane during an immigration crackdown.,"New Orleans community leaders and politicians, including Mayor-elect Helena Moreno, U.S. Rep. Troy Carter and former Mayor Mark Morial, hosted a press conference Friday to demand that federal immigration agents deployed to New Orleans be more transparent and humane in their tactics. 
The press conference followed a letter sent earlier in the day by City Council to Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino with five specific demands for the recently-launched immigration sweep dubbed “Catahoula Crunch,” taking place in parts of Louisiana and south Mississippi. 
The council asked agents to report data including number of arrests made and criminal history of detainees, ensure due process, require officers to be identified and unmasked, disavow discriminatory stops and provide medical care and language services to detainees. 
The demands from the City Council come less than a week into the operation, which has led to widespread unease among New Orleans’ sizable immigrant population as individuals have been stopped, detained and even chased at their places of employment, homes and churches. 
“We stand here with an obligation to ensure that federal operations are conducted with transparency, constitutionally and with respect for local residents,” Moreno said. 
As anxiety over the operation continues to rise, multiple leaders spoke about the economic impact to New Orleans’ large hospitality and tourism industries, noting concerns of workers not showing up for fear of being detained or deported. 
Carter represents Louisiana’s 2nd District, which includes New Orleans. He decried any operations that create fear and confusion for families, workers and businesses. 
“We want federal partners, we just don’t want occupation,” Carter said. “We want them to work with us, not around us.” 
City Council members in New Orleans, a Democratic stronghold in a deeply Republican state, have grappled with the legal limitations of their power to push back against federal agents, in part because of laws and policies enacted by Louisiana’s conservative state government, such as a recently passed Louisiana law that prohibits interference with federal immigration agents. Moreno said that she felt they were requesting only basic transparency data, which she said she views as reasonable. 
The clash between local, state and federal officials continues as Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill posted a letter sent to New Orleans Police Department Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick, where Murrill wrote that she recommended Kirkpatrick order NOPD officers to cooperate with ICE. 
Earlier in the week, the council published a web page where people can anonymously upload footage that depicts any alleged abuses from federal immigration agents. The page also includes materials to educate people on their rights in English, Spanish and Vietnamese, which states that the NOPD will not ask people about their immigration status. 
Speakers at the press conference urged continued transparency and community collaboration as operation Catahoula Crunch moves forward. 
Council President JP Morrell pushed back against the reasoning behind the quota announced by Border Patrol — to arrest 5,000 people in New Orleans.
“I do not believe you are here for the reason you say you are here but you have an opportunity to prove me wrong,” he said in reference to federal immigration agents. “Provide this information that’s being requested by the New Orleans City Council. … Until then, this council will continue to use all the resources available to us, legal and otherwise, and make sure that the citizens of this city are protected.”

“All I can say is, it's clearly not based in science,” new state Health Commissioner Rick Hildebrant says of the federal change to the 30-year standard immunization schedule.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont health officials reaffirm importance of hepatitis B vaccine after federal advisory panel recommends delays.","A parent holds his 16-month-old daughter as she receives the Moderna Covid-19 vaccination in Salt Lake City, Utah, on June 21, 2022. File photo by Rick Bowmer/AP
The federal panel that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine recommendations made one of its biggest moves on vaccine policy to date on Friday, saying that rather than vaccinate all newborns against hepatitis B at birth, parents and caregivers should delay the vaccine series until their child is 2 months old — if they choose to vaccinate them at all.
Vermont state officials are adamant that providers and families do not follow the panel’s recommendation and continue to give infants a dose at birth.  
Even before the decision from the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, called ACIP, the Vermont Department of Health issued a public advisory to maintain its support for infants to be vaccinated within 24 hours of birth. 
“I’m concerned,” the state’s health commissioner, Rick Hildebrant, said in light of the federal panel’s decision. “The biggest concern I have is the confusion that this will cause.” 
“We sent the press release to make sure Vermonters know what our recommendation is, that it’s backed by science by 30 years of precedent, that it has been effective and safe in preventing chronic liver disease in folks,” Hildebrant said.
The federal panel voted 8-3 for the delayed vaccination. In June, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. gutted the existing lineup of experts on the CDC panel and instead stacked the panel with many outspoken skeptics of vaccines.
The state recommends the birth-dose, followed by a series of vaccines for a child to complete by the time they are 18 months, as essential to prevent hepatitis B infections. The virus targets the liver and can lead to liver failure, cirrhosis and liver cancer. Though adults exposed to the virus are more able to clear it, 90% of infants infected develop chronic conditions.
Typically, the state Health Department buys the vaccines directly from the CDC at a low cost. That allows for easy distribution to the health care providers who administer the vaccines. Since the CDC panel’s recommendation delays, rather than entirely rejects, the vaccine, Hildebrant is not yet sure if or how this decision will alter the state’s ability to buy the vaccines and distribute them.
Kristina Massari, a spokesperson for BlueCross BlueShield of Vermont, said the state’s largest commercial insurer does not expect a significant shortage of vaccines in the coming year, since a recommendation is still partially in place. 
ACIP’s recommendation only applies to infants whose parent tested negative for hepatitis B while pregnant. The panel did not change the recommendations for those whose parents test positive, or those who do not test at all for the virus.
“Blue Cross VT is not changing its coverage of Hepatitis B vaccines,” Massari wrote in an email. “Members will have zero cost-share and will not be required to obtain prior authorization to receive this vital vaccination.”
Hildebrant said he and his colleagues are preparing to act, should they need to adjust the procurement and distribution pathways, though he is not sure what that would look like exactly. He worries about the added cost of buying the vaccines directly from the manufacturer and the logistics of needing to take on the distribution of them. 
Federal insurers will also continue to cover the vaccine, a policy analyst for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, Andrew Johnson, told the ACIP committee, as first reported by STAT, a health care news source.
“Not only do they care immensely about their insured individuals,” Hildebrant said of Vermonters’ insurance companies, “but they also know that this is going to save money. I mean, it’s very costly to not get vaccinated and then end up with a chronic illness. And that’s the least important part of this.” 
Since the CDC adopted the recommendation of a birth-dose in 1991, the United States saw a significant decrease in hepatitis B cases, dropping from a total of nearly 18,000 to fewer than 3,000 new diagnoses annually, a 2023 public health report found.
“You don’t get that kind of response rate in medicine with treatment,” Hildebrant said, becoming animated about the vaccine’s efficacy. “That is just remarkable. And the thought of going back to the days where we’re seeing 14,000 to 18,000 kids contracting hepatitis B across the country is not one that we’re excited about. It’s one we’re really, really concerned about.” 
Cody Meissner, a professor of pediatrics at Dartmouth’s Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, is one of Kennedy’s recent ACIP appointees. He has a history on the panel, having served under President Barack Obama between 2008 and 2012. He was one of the few dissenters in Friday’s meeting. 
“I will just say, we have heard ‘do no harm’ as a moral imperative. We are doing harm by changing this wording,” Meissner said as he cast his no vote during the panel.
The state health department echoed his concerns.
“There’s been a lot of incredible incredulity about this. ‘Why is this happening?’ And I don’t think anyone has a good answer to [the question of] why are people doing this,” Hildebrant said. “All I can say is, it’s clearly not based in science.”
The state Health Department has been coordinating and in frequent communication with counterparts across the region, according to Hildebrant. Following upheaval at the CDC this summer, Vermont joined a regional coalition to solidify more consensus as federal guidance contradicts consensus public health science.
Merideth Plumpton, the department’s Immunization Program manager, authored a Dec. 1 letter with more detailed guidance for providers and parents on the state’s recommended vaccination schedule, in line with that of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Hildebrant encouraged questions and skepticism of what best protects children from harm, but he encouraged parents to have these conversations with their children’s pediatricians. 
“Do not listen to a politician when it comes to health care decisions, please. These are decisions that belong in an exam room, and they are the people who are the best equipped to give you information about this.” he said.

""Montana Center for Christian Policy"" from the Montana Family Foundation Website. (Image via MFF website) A hard-right Christian legal advocacy organization is moving shop from Laurel to Helena, with the Montana Family Foundation announcing its plans to build the Montana Center for Christian Policy blocks from the capitol building.
According to publicly available data, a permit for 1339 11th Ave., was issued April, matching a site map the organization put in a news release. The permit is for a three-story building, the document says. 
When completed, the new policy shop for the Montana Family Foundation would be across from a Department of Natural Resources and Conservation building and down the street from the state’s new Heritage Center. The organization was previously based out of Laurel.
The Family Foundation did not respond to a request to speak with its leadership and lobbyist Derek Oestreicher, who loomed large during the session. 
In an email, the organization said the new building is, “located in the center of power in Montana” and will include a nonprofit incubator, offices for “Christian attorneys” and a policy and strategy center on its third floor.
“The Montana Family Foundation is a 25-year-old policy partner of Focus on the Family, the Family Research Council, and Alliance Defending Freedom,” the organization said in a news post. “We advance pro-life, pro-family, and religious-freedom principles through legislation and litigation, grounded in a Judeo-Christian worldview and applied in the public square.”
The association with the Alliance Defending Freedom is notable, as one of its members is now on the Criminal Justice Oversight Council, in a position previously held by the American Civil Liberties Union.
The organization said it was a “several million dollar project” and did not specify a timeline in its newspost. The Montana Family Foundation is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit and its 2024 Form 990 said they brought in $133,000 in contributions and grants, down from the previous year, with the documents going on to say they ended the year -$56,538 in net assets or fund balances.
The Montana Family Foundation supported 47 pieces of legislation during the 2025 Legislative session seeing 22 of them pass. 
Great Falls Senator Daniel Emrich, Kalispell Senator John Fuller, Billings Rep. Kerri Seekins-Crowe, and Belgrade Representative Caleb Hinkle, all Republicans, carried many of the bills the Family Foundation sought to pass. A number of those bills also came from known Montana Freedom Caucus members, including Sen. Carl Glimm, a Kila Republican.
They supported legislation that would make judicial races partisan, tightening voting rights, restricting or stopping access to abortions, favoring the display of the Ten Commandments in schools, banning mRNA vaccines, and calling for civil rights investigations into the Montana University System. The organization also supported a resolution against the U.S. Supreme Court’s Obergefell decision, which legalizing same-sex marriage, and a variety of laws targeting the state’s LGBTQ+ population.
“The bills that you lobby on as a lobbyist for the Montana Family Foundation and that Derek (Oestreicher) lobbies on, those are the at the heart of who the Montana Family Foundation is, those social conservative policy bills,” the organization’s executive director, Jeff Laszloffy, said on a recent YouTube podcast hosted by its lobbyists.
All three pieces of legislation it registered in opposition to failed — including SB 139, which would have eliminated a clergy exemption to mandatory reporting laws, meaning religious officials aren’t under any legal obligation to report child sexual assault.
“We question whether the bill is necessary,” Osreicher told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Jan. 28.
According to publicly available lists from the Catholic Church, 47 priests and sisters have been accused of sexual abuse in the Diocese of Great Falls-Billings and 20 priests have been accused in the Diocese of Helena. 
Pastor Tony Aaron Shaw, with Ruby Valley Baptist Church in Sheridan was found guilty of sexual assault against a child earlier this year. And in April of this year, girls who were sexually abused at Morning Star Baptist Church and at the Morning Star Christian Academy filed suit against a pastor — currently serving 30 years — and a church. The girls were around 12 years old at the time of the abuse.
“If everyone that could possibly help someone becomes a mandatory reporter, and there is no place to turn to to get help without winding up in jail, then in the end, they will turn to no one and continue harming children and themselves,” Osreicher told the committee in January.
The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Mary Ann Dunwell, a Helena Democrat, said she worked with the Catholic Diocese on language in the bill that would be acceptable to them, though the bill still failed. 
Dunwell also added that while she disagrees with many of their policies, their right to set up shop where they want isn’t a question.
“It’s democracy,” Dunwell said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MFFConceptArt-1-1011x1024.jpg,,,2025-12-05 18:58:08.745528

Guy Federal Building pictured on Dec. 18, 2024, in Bismarck. (Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The operator of natural gas production facilities on the Fort Berthold Reservation was ordered Friday to pay a $500,000 fine and do 500 hours of community service for an environmental violation.
Targa Badlands LLC pleaded guilty earlier this year in U.S. District Court in North Dakota to a violation of the Clean Air Act that affected the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation. 
Targa, which operates six natural gas compressor stations on Fort Berthold, failed to install required hazardous air pollutant monitoring systems, federal prosecutors say in court records. 
The violation occurred between 2018 and 2022 on the Johnson Compressor Station near Mandaree. Natural gas gathering pipelines include compressor stations that boost pressure before the gas reaches a natural gas processing plant. 
The combustion engines on the compressor station produce hazardous air pollutants such as benzene and formaldehyde, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan O’Konek said during the plea hearing, according to a transcript.
The plea agreement indicates Targa self-reported the violation and promptly corrected it by installing monitoring equipment. The company has since taken steps to improve environmental compliance, federal prosecutors said. The attorney for Targa did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.
In 2019 and 2021, Targa paid a total of $450,000 in civil penalties for similar violations involving compressor stations at Fort Berthold after reaching agreements with the Environmental Protection Agency, court records show. 
The additional $500,000 fine imposed Friday was the maximum penalty for the violation. U.S. District Court Judge Daniel Traynor also ordered Targa to be on probation for three years, do community service work for the MHA Nation and pay a $400 fee. A plea agreement says the company should consult with MHA leaders before starting the community service work.
“Natural gas production is vital to our state’s economy, and it must be done responsibly,” North Dakota U.S. Attorney Nick Chase said in a statement. “This case demonstrates that we can support strong energy production while holding companies accountable when they fall short of their legal obligations.”
MHA Nation Chair Mark Fox said in a statement Friday that tribal leaders appreciate the community service aspect of the sentence, but no formal discussions have occurred about what that will involve.
“We are disappointed with the lack of consultation and are of the opinion that the fines should benefit our nation in some way,” Fox said.
Rep. Lisa Finley-DeVille, a Democrat from Mandaree who also chairs the Dakota Resource Council, said while she acknowledges the company self-reported the violation, it was the third of its kind, illustrating a need for stronger oversight.
“Energy development cannot come at the expense of our people,” Finley-DeVille said. “I will continue advocating for stricter safeguards, better monitoring, and full accountability so our communities receive the clean air and responsible operations they deserve.”

Newborn vaccinations have been critical to stopping the spread of Hepatitis B among Alaska Native children, McMahon said. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Western Alaska, where almost all the residents are Indigenous, used to have the world’s highest rate of childhood liver cancer caused by Hepatitis B. After decades of screenings and vaccinations, that problem has been eliminated; since 1995, only one person under the age of 30 has been diagnosed with hepatitis-caused cancer.
Now the Trump administration is seeking to end one of the key tools credited with accomplishing that goal: Hepatitis B vaccinations of newborns.
The federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Friday voted to drop a longstanding recommendation for universal hepatitis vaccines for newborns. That is in accordance with the controversial views of U.S. Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic who fired all members of the previous committee and appointed like-minded members to replace them.
Current federal childhood Hepatitis B vaccination guidelines recommend one dose of the vaccine at birth, followed by additional doses at intervals through 18 months. The recommendation for newborn vaccinations has been in place since 1991.
The advisory committee, part of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, determined that children under 2 months should not be vaccinated unless their mothers are infected or could be infected by Hepatitis B.
Some vaccine critics in the administration, including Kennedy and President Donald Trump themselves, argue — contradicting medical experts and years of medical research — that Hepatitis B vaccines for young children are unnecessary, claiming that it is spread primarily or exclusively through adult behavior like sex and sharing of needles for illegal drug use.
“Hepatitis B is sexually transmitted. There’s no reason to give a baby that’s almost just born Hepatitis B. So I would say wait till the baby is 12 years old and formed and take Hepatitis B,” Trump said at a Sept. 22 news conference.
Those claims are false, said Dr. Brian McMahon, medical and research director of the liver and hepatitis program at the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium.
There is no credible evidence of  a link between the vaccine and autism of any other health problem, McMahon said.
And sexual transmissions accounted for only a tiny percentage of Alaska’s Hepatitis B cases, he said.
Aside from mother-to-infant transmissions, which occur during childbirth, Hepatitis B was predominantly spread in Western Alaska through normal daily activities. That is because, unlike the HIV virus or other hepatitis viruses, the Hepatitis B virus can live for seven days on surfaces in schools and homes, like tables and personal-grooming items.
“The virus can be found all over, on school luncheon tabletops, counters and homes,” McMahon said. “Kids have open cuts and scratches from bug bites or anything else, and then they shed millions of particles of the virus on environmental surfaces. And then another kid comes along with an open cut or scratch.”
Such risks are exacerbated in rural Alaska, he said, where homes can be crowded and people pursue traditional subsistence lifestyles with a lot of outdoor activities. 
“They’re hunting, fishing, cutting up meat, etcetera, and mosquito bites are real prominent,” he said.

	Nationally, only 12.6% of chronic Hepatitis B cases recorded from 2013 to 2018 were attributable to sexual transmission, according to a 2023 CDC study. Transmissions of all forms of hepatitis, including Hepatitis B, are possible through contact sports like football, rugby and hockey, researchers have found.
Alaska’s disease and vaccination success 
Before the past decades of vaccination and screening, Hepatitis B was so prevalent in Western Alaska that it was classified as endemic there. It was the only part of the United States with such a classification. In some villages, 20% to 30% of the residents were infected, McMahon said.
Geography and ancient migration patterns accounted for historically high rates of the disease in Western Alaska, as well as other Indigenous regions of the Arctic.
Various strains have been carried from Asia to Alaska over millennia, according to scientists. And the remoteness of Indigenous communities meant isolation from medical services, making early diagnosis difficult in the past, allowing infections to linger and be passed down through generations, according to scientists.
In Alaska, children infected with the virus early in life had a high likelihood of winding up with chronic infections that caused serious complications later, such as liver failure. The worst cases resulted in cancer, and even death.
For McMahon, now in his 80s, treating cancer-stricken children in the Yukon-Kuskokwim region, where he worked in the 1970s, was harrowing.
One of his patients was a 17-year-old high school valedictorian. A few months earlier, she started having abdominal pains, but she ignored them. 
“She was really busy with school, and she’d gotten a full ride scholarship and was excited about going to the University of Alaska, representing her community,” McMahon said.
The pains turned out to be cancer, caused by a hepatitis B infection that she had not known she had. Too sick to be flown home, she died in the Bethel hospital. 
“It was horrible,” McMahon said.
Another patient was an 11-year-old boy, also diagnosed after he complained of similar abdominal pain. McMahon visited him at home, where the boy was “in horrible pain” and yellow from jaundice. 
“He was just crying. He said I know I’m going to die. Just help me with my pain,’” McMahon said.
“My wife was with me. She was a public health nurse. She was in tears. The community health aid practitioner was in tears. I was fighting my tears and pulling everything I could out of my bag to try to help this patient sedate.  It was just something I’ll never forget. Never.” McMahon said.
He has relayed these and other experiences to the vaccine advisory committee in hopes of persuading members to keep the infant recommendations in place.
“I said, ‘Do you want to be responsible for children getting liver cancer because this decision?’” McMahon said. “So I’m probably not very popular right now.”
Alaska was one of the first places in the world where the Hepatitis B vaccine was used as soon as it became available in 1981.

	The pilot vaccination project was at the insistence of Alaska Native organizations, along with the state government and the Alaska congressional delegation. Under that pilot program, according to newly published study by McMahon and other researchers from the ANTHC and the CDC’s Arctic program, tribal health organizations and their partners screened 53,860 Alaska Native people for infection and gave vaccines to 43,618 Alaska Native people who tested negative, along with starting the universal newborn vaccinations.
Health officials have followed the outcomes since then, and the new study lists several achievements 40 years after universal newborn vaccination started.
Since 1995, according to the study, there have been no new symptomatic cases of Hepatitis B among Alaska Natives under 20 anywhere in the state. Since 2000, no new cases of hepatitis-related liver cancer have been identified among Alaska Natives of any age in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, a region where prevalence was concentrated in the past, the study said. And follow-up surveillance has revealed that childhood Hepatitis B vaccinations remain effective for at least 35 years, the study said.
Successes are also reflected in the trend of acute hepatitis, the form of infection that is short-lived and can be cleared from the body.
There have been no identified cases of acute hepatitis among Alaska Native children since 1992, according to Johns Hopkins University. The rate of acute hepatitis among Alaskans of all ages and ethnicities dropped from 12.1 cases per 100,000 people to 0.9 per 100,000 in the 2002-2015 period, according to the state Department of Health’s epidemiology section.
Alaska’s rate of chronic hepatitis B – the long-term and persistent infection that can lead to serious liver problems – remains higher than the national average. As of 2020, Alaska’s rate of chronic Hepatitis B was 14.2 cases per 100,000 people, nearly triple the national rate of 5 cases per 100,000 people, according to a report by the state Department of Health’s epidemiology section.
McMahon said that is partly because of the legacy of infections in the older Native population, people whose childhood predated widespread vaccination, and prevalence among foreign-born residents who come from countries without widespread vaccination.
Debate over Hepatitis B risks
This year, vaccine skeptics who are members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, however, along with people who are advising the committee, have argued that the risks of Hepatitis B among children are too low to justify universal infant vaccination.
One of the officials making that argument at Thursday’s committee meeting was Dr. Cynthia Nevison, a vaccine skeptic hired as a CDC consultant. She contradicted McMahon’s description of children spreading the virus through casual contact with contaminated surfaces – a process known as “horizontal transmission.”
“There’s very little evidence that horizontal transmission has ever been a significant threat to the average American child, and the risk probably has been overstated,” she said at the meeting. Also overstated, she said, are the risks of “vertical transmission,” the viral transmission between mothers and their newborns.
The committee’s new recommendation must be approved by the CDC administrator before it becomes federal policy.
McMahon said that no matter how national policy might change, Alaska Native tribal health organizations will continue administering Hepatitis B vaccines to newborns.
“I know they’re not going to stop. Even if they have to pay for it. They’re so aware of this,” he said.
His fears, he said, are for low-income families who depend on free vaccinations through state programs that might lose funding and for parents who are getting conflicting messages that may lead to conclusions that the vaccine is not necessary. 
“It could be a real mess,” he said.

(Courtesy of BorderPlex Digital Assets)Developers behind Project Jupiter, the controversial campus of data centers slated for Doña Ana County, have asked state environment officials to sign off on their plans to emit more greenhouse gases than the state’s two largest cities combined, and to generate as much electricity as the state’s largest power company.
Applications for air quality permits confirm figures that Source NM previously reported: If approved, Project Jupiter could emit more than 14 million tons of greenhouse gases per year. By comparison, Albuquerque and Las Cruces emit a combined 6.7 million metric tons of greenhouse gases annually, according to both cities’ climate action plans. The applications also say developers seek to install 41 turbines to annually generate about as much electricity as PNM.
Developers filed two applications, one for a “west microgrid” and one for an “east microgrid.” A microgrid is a self-reliant energy grid that doesn’t need to draw power from a larger utility, like PNM or El Paso Electric. For months, plans have made it clear that developers want to build natural gas generating stations for Project Jupiter’s microgrids, prompting concerns from residents and lawmakers that the data centers won’t comply with the state’s landmark clean energy law, which requires utilities to use 50% renewable energy by 2030, 80% by 2040 and 100% by 2045.
The applications show that together, the microgrids will emit nearly 500 tons per year of nitrogen oxides, an important ingredient in contributing to ozone. Individually, one microgrid is listed at 249.97 tons per year and the other at 248.9.
Environmental advocates say the developers’ proposal to split emissions across two permits for the same project appears to skirt state regulations, which classify projects with at least 250 tons per year of nitrogen oxides as “major sources” of hazardous air pollutants and subject them to arduous monitoring.
“They’ve split it into two separate plants that are ‘minor sources’ to avoid having to monitor their actual air quality impacts, which are going to be huge,” said Colin Cox, senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute. “They’re coming up to 99.9% of the threshold for when they’d have to do additional work.”
The American Lung Association has long given Doña Ana County a failing grade for ozone, which can cause asthma attacks, increased risk of respiratory infections and even increased risk of premature death.
BorderPlex Digital Assets, the company that has represented Project Jupiter in public meetings, did not respond to a request for comment.
Project Jupiter pits demand for data against New Mexico’s finite natural resources

The permits will only have to go through a public hearing process if an “outside party,” which can include a resident of the area, requests it, according to a spokesperson for the New Mexico Environment Department. No hearings have been scheduled.
Members of the public have, however, tried to stop the project in court.
In October, two residents and a local nonprofit filed a lawsuit against elected members of the Doña Ana County Commission and accused them of voting on an incomplete application when they approved $165 billion in government-backed bonds for the project in September. 
“We’ve seen this with other air permit applications, where they’re right under the limit,” Maslyn Locke, a New Mexico Environmental Law Center senior attorney who is representing residents in the case, told Source NM. “Ultimately that means everything has to go 100% perfectly as they operate to not violate that…I don’t know if that’s realistic.” 
Since filing suit in October, the nonprofit Empowerment Congress of Doña Ana County has withdrawn as a plaintiff in the lawsuit.
Another lawsuit, filed by Las Cruces resident Derrick Pacheco, alleged that county leaders acted inappropriately when they approved the project even though it had yet to go through the Planning and Zoning Commission.

Tony Evers vetoed nine bills Friday including a Republican bill that would have barred local and state funds from being used for immigrants without legal status.
Wisconsin already doesn’t allow immigrants without legal status to access BadgerCare, which Evers noted in his veto message. Republicans lawmakers acknowledged that fact as they advocated for AB 308, saying the bill was intended to block future use of health care benefits by immigrants. The bill would have prohibited state, county, village, long-term care district and federal funds from being used to subsidize, reimburse or provide compensation for any health care services for a person not lawfully in the U.S.
“As this bill’s Republican co-author in the Wisconsin State Assembly plainly stated in the public hearing on this proposal, ‘Wisconsin currently doesn’t allow undocumented immigrants to enroll in BadgerCare,’” Evers wrote in his veto message. 
“I object to Republican lawmakers passing legislation they acknowledge is unnecessary to prevent problems they admit do not exist, all for the sake of trying to push polarizing political rhetoric,” Evers added. 
Evers said the bill was “more about being inflammatory, stoking fear, and sowing division than it was about accomplishing any significant policy outcome or being prudent stewards of taxpayer dollars.” 
U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, one of two Republican candidates for governor, criticized the veto in a statement, saying Evers was putting the interests of “illegal aliens” ahead of Wisconsin taxpayers and sought to tie Evers’ action to next year’s high-profile gubernatorial election. Evers is not running for reelection, and there is a crowded Democratic field that is still taking shape.
“If Democrats take the governor’s office in 2026, you can count on them to hand out driver’s licenses, in-state tuition and taxpayer-funded health care to illegal aliens. I will not let that happen,” Tiffany said.
No new cigar bars
Evers also vetoed a bill that would have allowed for more tobacco bars in Wisconsin. 
Wisconsin first enacted its smoke-free air law in 2010 — prohibiting smoking cigars, cigarettes, pipes and other products in public spaces. The law included an exclusion for cigar bars that were in existence before June 4, 2009.
AB 211 would have allowed for more exemptions for tobacco bars if they came into existence on or after June 4, 2009 provided that they allowed only the smoking of cigars and pipes and were not part of a retail food establishment.
Evers, a former smoker and an esophageal cancer survivor, said he objected due to the harm that the bill could have on Wisconsinites public health.
“Secondhand smoke, a known carcinogen, causes serious health problems and is responsible for thousands of deaths on an annual basis,” Evers stated. He said the state’s smoke-free air law was “a critically important step forward for keeping kids, families, and communities healthier and safer, improving public health and, most importantly, saving thousands of lives… I cannot in good conscience reverse course on that important step for public health, safety, and well-being by restoring indoor smoking in certain public spaces.”
Bill to ban guaranteed income
Evers also vetoed AB 165, which would have banned local governments from using tax money to create guaranteed income programs without a work or training requirement. 
Evers wrote in his veto message that he objects to lawmakers’ “continued efforts to arbitrarily restrict and preempt local governments across our state.” He said they should instead focus on finding ways to support local communities and ensure they have the resources they need to “meet basic and unique needs alike.”
Building code delay
Evers vetoed AB 450, which would have put off the effective date of Wisconsin’s updated commercial building code until April 1, 2026, saying he objected to “further unnecessary delay in implementing new building standards that will benefit Wisconsin communities.” 
The new building codes were originally blocked by lawmakers on the Joint Committee on the Review of Administrative Rules for years, but they were reinstated this year by the the Department of Safety and Professional Services (DSPS) after a state Supreme Court decision. Justices ruled in July that state laws allowing the Legislature to block executive branch administrative rules indefinitely were unconstitutional.
The current effective date for the building codes is Nov. 1, 2025.
Republican lawmakers claimed the delay to next year was needed to provide clarity to builders who had been planning projects under the previous code. 
Evers wrote in his veto message that the bill would do the opposite. 
“This bill would not only create confusion for developers with current building projects under review but would also further delay the implementation of new safety and energy efficiency standards that have been already widely adopted,” Evers said. “The department has and will continue to work with building professionals throughout the state to ensure proper understanding and compliance with the new building commercial code.” 
Education bills rejected
A handful of Republican education-related bills were rejected by Evers. 
Currently, teacher preparation programs are required to have a full semester of student teaching during the school year. SB 424 would have allowed for programs to use student teaching during a summer session as an alternative to a full school-year semester.
Lawmakers had said the bill would help with recruitment by allowing for more flexibility to students seeking to become teachers. However, Evers said that the bill would potentially reduce the rigor of the current training that students are required to have, especially given that summer sessions can be shorter than a typical school term and may not allow students to experience the same opportunities available during the school year such as parent-teacher conferences.
“Reducing training, qualifications, experience, and work ages are not real solutions for solving Wisconsin’s generational workforce shortages,” Evers said in his veto message. “Wisconsin’s challenges recruiting, training, and retaining exceptional educators will not be aided by making education professionals less trained, less qualified, and less experienced — nor will our kids.”
Evers also vetoed AB 166, which would have required UW system institutions, technical colleges and private nonprofit colleges to report cost and student outcome data and required the information be provided to high school juniors and seniors in academic and career planning services. 
Evers said in his veto message that he didn’t want to burden the state’s higher education institutions with more administrative requirements, especially without “necessary resources.” He noted that the UW system says that the requirements in the bill “overlap substantially” with existing information that is already available. 
The University of Wisconsin system keeps a public dashboard with some of the information that the bill would have required, including for financial aid, retention and graduation, and time and credits to degree.
Evers also vetoed SB 10, which would have mandated that Wisconsin public school districts provide military recruiters with access to common areas in high schools and access during the school day and during school-sanctioned events. He said that while he supports the troops, he doesn’t support lawmakers’ attempts to “usurp” local control of decisions on when and where military recruiters are given access to schools. 
Bill that would have eliminated requirement for Elections Commission appeal
Voters currently can file a complaint to the Wisconsin Election Commission if they allege an election official serving the voter’s jurisdiction has failed to comply with certain election laws or has abused his or her discretion with respect to the administration of such election laws. A voter who doesn’t agree with a WEC decision can appeal to a court, though currently courts are only allowed to take up an appeal if voters have suffered an injury to a legally recognized interest as a result. That requirement was established in a 2025 state Supreme Court decision.
SB 270 would have eliminated that requirement, and Evers said he objected because it “would open the floodgates to frivolous lawsuits that not only burden our courts, but our election systems as well.” 
Penalties for those who falsely claim a service animal
AB 366, which would have allowed housing providers to require documentation for service animals and created penalties for misrepresentation of an animal. Evers said he objects to “the creation of unnecessary barriers for individuals with legitimate disability-related needs.”

The mental health program, which was funded by Congress after the 2022 school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, included grants meant to help schools hire more counselors, psychologists and social workers, with a focus on rural and underserved areas of the country. 
In Connecticut, that included a five-year grant of $3 million for a program at the University of Connecticut’s Graduate School of Social Work. The funds were intended to support 25 graduate students in social work providing mental health services to students in Hartford, New Britain, Waterbury and Vernon. 
President Donald Trump’s administration opposed aspects of the grant programs that touched on race, saying they were harmful to students and told recipients they wouldn’t receive funding past December 2025.
[RELATED: CT sues Trump admin. over funds for mental health services in schools]
Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, along with sixteen other state attorneys general, filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington in July.
In October, U.S. District Judge Kymberly K. Evanson, ruled that the administration’s move to cancel school mental health grants was arbitrary and capricious.
The U.S. Department of Education and Secretary of Education Linda McMahon requested an emergency stay and on Thursday, a panel from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied that motion.
The panel wrote in its decision that the government hadn’t shown it is likely to succeed based on its claims that the district court doesn’t have jurisdiction or that it will be “irreparably injured absent a stay.”
The grants were first awarded under Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration. The Education Department prioritized giving the money to applicants who showed how they would increase the number of counselors from diverse backgrounds or from communities directly served by the school district.
The Trump administration said in a statement after the ruling in October that the grants were used “to promote divisive ideologies based on race and sex.”
The preliminary ruling by Evanson, a U.S. District Court judge in Seattle, applies only to some grantees in the 16 Democratic-led states that challenged the Education Department’s decision.

(Photo by Robert Stewart/Verite News)NEW ORLEANS — Local community leaders and politicians, including Mayor-elect Helena Moreno, Congressman Troy Carter, and former Mayor Marc Morial, hosted a press conference Friday to demand that federal immigration agents deployed to New Orleans be more transparent and humane in their tactics.
The press conference followed a letter sent earlier in the day by City Council to Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino with five specific demands for the recently-launched immigration sweep dubbed Catahoula Crunch. The demands asked agents to report data including number of arrests made and criminal history of detainees, ensure due process, require officers to be identified and unmasked, disavow discriminatory stops, and provide medical care and language services to detainees.
The demands from the City Council come less than a week into the operation, which has led to widespread unease among New Orleans’ sizable immigrant population as individuals have been stopped, detained, and even chased at their places of employment, homes, and churches.
“We stand here with an obligation to ensure that federal operations are conducted with transparency, constitutionally, and with respect for local residents,” Moreno said.
As anxiety over the operation continues to rise, multiple speakers spoke about the economic impact to New Orleans’ large hospitality and tourism industries, noting concerns of workers not showing up for fear of being detained or deported.
Carter, who represents Louisiana’s 2nd District — which includes New Orleans — decried any operations that create fear and confusion for families, workers and businesses.
“We want federal partners, we just don’t want occupation,” Carter said. “We want them to work with us, not around us.”

City councilmembers in New Orleans, a Democratic stronghold in a deeply Republican state, have grappled with the legal limitations of their power to push back against federal agents, in part because of laws and policies enacted by Louisiana’s conservative state government, such as a recently passed Louisiana law that prohibits interference with federal immigration agents. Moreno said that she felt they were requesting only basic transparency data, which she said she views as reasonable.

If you see federal immigration agents interacting with the public or have other information related to the operation “Catahoula Crunch,” please contact us on Signal using the username veritenews.22.

The clash between local, state and federal officials continues as Attorney General Liz Murrill posted a letter sent to New Orleans Police Department Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick, where Murrill wrote that she recommended Kirkpatrick order NOPD officers to cooperate with ICE.
Earlier in the week, the council published a web page where people can anonymously upload footage that depicts any alleged abuses from federal immigration agents. The page also includes materials to educate people on their rights in English, Spanish and Vietnamese, which states that the NOPD will not ask people about their immigration status.
Speakers at the press conference urged continued transparency and community collaboration as operation Catahoula Crunch moves forward.
Council President JP Morrell pushed back against the reasoning behind the quota announced by Border Patrol — to arrest 5,000 people in New Orleans.
“I do not believe you are here for the reason you say you are here but you have an opportunity to prove me wrong,” he said in reference to federal immigration agents. “Provide this information that’s being requested by the New Orleans City Council. … Until then, this council will continue to use all the resources available to us, legal and otherwise, and make sure that the citizens of this city are protected.”

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Some Oklahomans in central and downtown Oklahoma City could have two races for the same state House seat on their ballot next year.
Gov. Kevin Stitt on Wednesday set special election dates to fill a vacant seat in House District 92, which was previously represented by Rep. Forrest Bennett, D-Oklahoma City.
Bennett resigned effective Monday to lead the Oklahoma State AFL-CIO, a group of 230 labor unions representing over 100,000 workers. 
The dates the Republican governor set overlap with the 2026 general election dates, an election House District 92 was already set to be on the ballot for. The House seat will remain vacant during this upcoming session. 
Misha Mohr, a spokesperson for the Oklahoma Election Board, said there will be a separate special election ballot. The regular primary for House District 92 will be on a regular primary election ballot. 
“Our interpretation of state law is that a candidate may run in both the regular and special election because, in this case, it is for the same office,” she said in a statement. “The candidate that wins the special election will serve the remainder of the unexpired term. The candidate that wins the regular election will serve the full term.”
Spokespeople for Stitt’s office did not return a request for comment by time of publication or answer questions about why these dates were chosen. 
Candidates seeking to run for the seat in the Oklahoma House must file between April 1 and April 3. 
The special primary will be held June 16. If a runoff primary is needed, it will be on Aug. 25. 
The special general election will be on Nov. 3. If a runoff is not needed, the general election will be held in late August. If a special primary is not needed, the general election will be on June 16. 
If voters elect the same candidate in both the special and regular election, the candidate will serve a full two-year term plus the remainder of Bennett’s term.
However, if two different candidates are elected in the special and regular election, the winner of the special election will only serve a few months.

Counter-protesters gathered on the balcony above. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Redistricting supporters on Friday renewed promises to use their wealth against Indiana Senate Republicans who flout President Donald Trump’s demands for an all-GOP congressional map.
The polarizing proposal would likely eliminate the state’s two Democratic-held congressional districts to create a 9-0 Republican map ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
The Indiana House approved the legislation Friday. The Senate will begin deliberations on Monday, but the chamber’s Republican leader has warned for months there aren’t enough votes.

“If this thing passes (the Senate) … then, we sent that final exclamation point that we needed to send,” said Brett Galaszewski, an enterprise director at Turning Point Action, the political arm of the Phoenix, Arizona organization founded by the late Charlie Kirk.
“But if it doesn’t — and I hope these senators hear me right now when I say these words — if it does not pass, Turning Point Action is willing to throw more money and resources into these primary races than some congressional races,” Galaszewski said, as cheers rang out.
“We will throw so much money and resources into this state that no amount of money coming from a leadership (political action committee) will be able to offset it,” he emphasized.
Galaszewski spoke to Hoosiers gathered in the Statehouse for a Turning Point Action rally targeting reluctant Republican senators, calling Indiana “the last line of defense for us conservatives.”
Indiana Gov. Mike Braun, who headlined the event, doubled down on his own threats.
Failure in the Senate, he said, “means you’re gonna have to clean house to get real conservatives in.”
Braun later told reporters that the Senate is “the place where things die for any good idea,” and described the chamber’s members as “out of sync with most Republicans and conservatives” in Indiana.

Some are already planning to challenge anti-redistricting incumbents. At the rally was Paula Copenhaver, a top aide to Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith who has launched a campaign against GOP Sen. Spencer Deery of West Lafayette.

Beckwith argued most Hoosiers support new maps. Several polls have found a majority do not.
“When you have the corrupt Indianapolis media telling you that the Indiana people don’t want it, they’re lying to you!” he exclaimed. “Hoosiers, overwhelmingly, … want this to happen!”
Speakers repeatedly pointed to “manipulated” maps in other Democratic states, primarily citing California and Massachusetts, as why Indiana should redistrict mid-census.
“They’ve been playing this game a long time,” said U.S. Rep. Marlin Stutzman, a Republican representing Indiana’s 3rd District. “President Trump was nearly assassinated. Charlie Kirk … was assassinated in front of the entire world. They’re using bullets, my friend. We’re going to use the ballot box!”
Indiana’s seven-member Republican congressional delegation pledged support for redistricting in August, in the early days of the Trump administration’s pressure campaign. That included trips in August and October by Vice President JD Vance to meet with Hoosier leaders.
A few hundred supporters attended Friday’s event, where counter-protesters standing at the balconies overhead jeered  and chanted, “Cheaters, cheaters, cheaters!”
Attendees were encouraged to contact their senators — including at stations upstairs by the Senate’s Republican and Democratic entrances, where constituents could leave handwritten messages.

(Photo: courtesy of Siembra NC)Another large-scale immigration enforcement operation appears to be underway in North Carolina, focusing on the Research Triangle and Triad area, according to immigrant advocacy group Siembra NC.
In a statement Friday, Siembra NC said they received reports of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Morrisville, Apex, Durham, Greensboro, Charlotte and other locations this week. Some carried rifles and wore vests labeled “HSI Police” (Homeland Security Investigations is the investigative arm of ICE), while others wore masks and approached people in parked cars or pursued them on the road.
NC Newsline has not independently confirmed these reports.
Citing an unnamed source within the Department of Homeland Security, Siembra NC co-director Nikki Marín Baena said the group believes a monthlong ICE operation is underway in North Carolina involving at least 50 agents from other states. She said it’s the largest statewide operation in many years.
A spokesperson for ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement earlier this week that she could not confirm any ICE activities. “Every day, DHS enforces the laws of the nation across the country. We do not discuss future or potential operations.”
The apparent ramp-up comes after heightened Border Patrol operations in November in Raleigh and Charlotte drew protests and led to the detention of some U.S. citizens. “Operation Charlotte’s Web” resulted in more than 425 arrests, according to the Department of Homeland Security.
“Even as workplaces, schools, and communities are still reeling from the devastating impacts of Border Patrol’s operation in November, this new monthlong operation by ICE is threatening a new wave of school absences, economic turmoil, and families ripped apart just a few weeks before the holidays,” Marín Baena said.
Ojo Obrero, an ICE activity tracker launched by Siembra NC in November, shows 10 reports in North Carolina in the past week, centered around the Research Triangle, the Piedmont Triad, and the Charlotte metropolitan area.
In Durham, at least three individuals were arrested on Dec. 4 and Dec. 5 on their way to interviews with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Siembra NC alleged, including a permanent resident set to interview to become a citizen and two mothers arriving for green card interviews.
The activist group laid the blame for the operations on North Carolina House Speaker Destin Hall, quoting his comments last week that “ICE and CBP are doing a great job. We don’t have much to say to them except we just ask that they come back.”
Hall did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but in a social media post on Tuesday, condemned Siembra NC’s promotion of a “Destin Hall Pass” to stay home from work to avoid ICE.
“Looks like a far-left, pro-illegal group is now giving out a ‘Destin Hall Pass’ to help people skip work when ICE is in NC,” Hall wrote. “I’ve never seen a group of people so committed to breaking the law instead of keeping the public safe. Insanity.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Inc403_Greensboro.120425-1024x676.jpeg,,,2025-12-05 17:59:02.163189

Chiquita Moore, 41, was charged Thursday with theft and with tampering with public records. The ASP began investigating her in February at the request of Sonia Hagood, prosecuting attorney for the state’s 2nd Judicial District, which includes Clay, Craighead, Crittenden, Greene, Poinsett and Mississippi counties.
Moore resigned in August 2024 from her position as district court clerk in Earle, a Crittenden County city with fewer than 2,000 people. According to the 2024 report on Earle from the nonpartisan Arkansas Legislative Audit, the district court clerk’s office displayed “noncompliance with state law and accepted accounting practices.”
The report found financial discrepancies totaling $23,671 in bank deposits and receipts from the district court clerk’s office between January 2023 and August 2024. The validity of $11,935 in voided receipts “could not be substantiated,” according to the report, and $6,298 in receipts did not have adequate supporting documentation.
The remaining $5,438 in receipts “could not be traced to a bank deposit,” the report states.
Moore was taken into ASP custody and booked into the Crittenden County Detention Center on Thursday, according to the news release.
Law enforcement is also investigating Earle Mayor Jaylen Smith for alleged financial misdeeds, according to the audit report.
Audit staff could not substantiate documentation Smith provided them regarding $2,866 in hotel and fuel charges for an out-of-state trip, the report states. The city council approved the credit card charges in August 2024 but reversed its approval two months later because the city treasurer had not received adequate supporting documentation.
The report asserts that without the documentation, the expenses might conflict with Article 12, Section 5 of the Arkansas Constitution, which states, “No county, city, town or other municipal corporation, shall… obtain or appropriate money for, or loan its credit to, any corporation, association, institution or individual.”
As of Oct. 9, when the report was released, the city had not paid the credit card charges and Smith had not reimbursed the city.
Earle voters elected Smith at the age of 18 in 2022, making him the nation’s youngest Black mayor. He said earlier this year that he would run for a seat in the state House of Representatives in 2026, but he later decided to instead run for reelection as Earle’s mayor.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-05-at-4.03.32 PM.png,,,2025-12-05 17:59:02.163189

The review was prompted by a contentious election in Bennington County last year in which dozens of voters received the wrong ballots.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Audit finds more Vermont voters assigned to wrong state House, Senate districts .","MONTPELIER — An audit of local voter rolls prompted by the error-plagued race for a Vermont House seat in Bennington County last year uncovered 100 more cases across the state in which people had been assigned to vote in the wrong legislative district.
As a result, the Vermont Secretary of State’s Office, which conducted the review, is calling for additional checks of town-managed voter rolls each time the state conducts the decennial process of redrawing legislative districts after the U.S. census count.
The number of Vermont voters assigned to the wrong district is low relative to the total number of people — about 373,000 — who cast a ballot in the most recent election. Officials from the secretary’s office said Friday they were not aware of any instances in which the results of a recent election would have changed because of voters who were in the wrong district.

The review was required by a law passed earlier this year and was published Nov. 20. It had all 24 Vermont cities and towns that span more than one district, for the Vermont House or Senate, review the checklists that prescribe who in town votes in which district.
Most Vermont municipalities are part of just one legislative district, meaning every voter there chooses from the same slate of state representatives and senators. But in the two dozen others, municipal and legislative district lines do not align so neatly. That means which candidates a resident sees on their ballot depends on where their house is.
That’s the case in the Bennington County town of Pownal, where some 50 voters were found shortly after the 2024 election to have been assigned to the wrong House district. The error stemmed from how a single street in town had been divided, during redistricting in 2022, between the Bennington-1 and Bennington-5 House districts.
Democrat Jonathan Cooper won the race in Bennington-1 over Republican Bruce Busa by fewer than 30 votes, calling into question if the error influenced the result and how the discrepancies should be handled. The full House later voted to affirm Cooper’s win, though several months after, it also passed the law requiring voter rolls to be audited.
The errors on Pownal’s voter rolls were corrected following the 2024 election. The 100 people identified in the latest report were in addition to those, the Secretary of State’s Office said. All of the newfound discrepancies have also since been corrected.
According to the audit, three other municipalities made “minor errors” putting the 2022 district maps into effect. In Burlington, the state’s largest city, 26 out of about 29,200 total voters had to be moved to another House district, the review found. Meanwhile, Colchester and Williamstown had to move five and one voters, respectively.
The audit also found “data integrity issues” related to voters’ records that were either formatted incorrectly or included incomplete information. For instance, a voter may have listed their apartment number on a line meant for the number of their street address, meaning they were assigned to a voting district on the wrong side of the street. 
As a result of those data issues — many of which predated even the latest decennial redistricting process — 68 more voters across 12 different municipalities had to be moved into a different district after the audit, according to the secretary’s office.
In all, that meant more than half of the towns in the state that encompass multiple districts needed to move at least one voter as a result of the audit.
Lauren Hibbert, Vermont’s deputy secretary of state, said inaccuracies on voter rolls are unavoidable and that the office was expecting to find a small number of them. She said the results of the audit should not make people feel less confident in the integrity of the state’s elections because many of the errors were a result of data being entered incorrectly, almost certainly by accident.
She also characterized the findings as an example of the joint oversight of elections between local and state officials working as it should.
“I think Vermonters can feel very comfortable that their town clerk is aware who is on their voter checklist. And, when you take that across all of our towns, that the statewide voter checklist is very well maintained,” Hibbert said in an interview.
She added that the office’s relatively new election management system, which it rolled out earlier this year, has safeguards that would likely flag similar errors in voter data entry going forward. The system also makes it easier for the office to run reports looking for errors in its statewide database that includes all voters, Hibbert said.
Vermont’s election data, and similar data in other states, has come into the crosshairs in recent months due to efforts by President Donald Trump’s administration to collect details on voters across the country. The White House has indicated that it wants the data to crack down on fraudulent voting and identify instances, which data shows are rare, of non-U.S. citizens voting in state or federal elections.
The Vermont Secretary of State’s Office denied a request in August from Trump’s Department of Justice to hand over voter data. On Monday, the Trump administration sued Vermont to force the state to comply.
Vermont’s Republican Gov. Phil Scott said at a press conference Wednesday that he supported Secretary of State Sarah Copeland Hanzas’ decision to withhold the data, which could include voters’ dates of birth, driver’s license numbers and Social Security numbers.
The secretary’s office had no additional information on the lawsuit as of Friday, Hibbert said.

(Photo by Ryan Murphy/Getty Images)Louisiana’s top criminal justice official has warned New Orleans’ police chief she risks breaking state and federal laws if her officers don’t actively support ongoing federal immigration enforcement efforts in the city.
Attorney General Liz Murrill sent a letter Friday to NOPD Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick saying the department’s policies “conflict with current state law and also may be interpreted as ‘sanctuary’ policies.” (Read the letter below)  
The letter comes as hundreds of agents with U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement have converged on New Orleans and the surrounding area for what the Department of Homeland Security has labeled Operation Catahoula Crunch. The Trump administration has said the campaign, similar to those elsewhere in the country, targets the “worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens.” 
Federal officials have so far identified fewer than 10 people detained in its New Orleans-area sting as having criminal records, and it has not reported how many total have been taken into custody. In comparable ICE and Border Patrol operations in other areas, only a fraction of those arrested have had criminal backgrounds.
The attorney general sent her pointed message to Kirkpatrick as agents continued their roundups, which have included immigrants with legal residency status and people mistakenly targeted.  
“At this time, I recommend that you immediately direct NOPD officers and staff to fully cooperate with ICE and CBP,” Murrill wrote in the conclusion of her letter.
In an emailed statement, an NOPD spokesperson said Murrill’s letter has been received and was under review. 
“NOPD will continue to follow all state and federal laws while staying focused on public safety and maintaining the trust of our community,” Kirkpatrick said in the statement.
Murrill’s letter said NOPD employees would be committing malfeasance in office under state law if they adhere to policies that require them to refuse cooperating with ICE. In addition, they could be charged with a federal felony if they knowingly conceal or withhold information about someone being in the country illegally. 
In the letter, Murrill cited policy in the NOPD Operations Manual that bars NOPD officers from assisting federal immigration authorities except in limited instances. These include when there is a threat to life or safety, when executing a court-issued warrant or order, and sending or receiving citizenship status information to and with ICE.
In an interview with WBOK-AM last month, Kirkpatrick said the NOPD would not take part in any “removals” but during federal immigration sweeps would assist agents “if they need help because of safety.” 
The superintendent has also described the immigration efforts as civil matters, as opposed to criminal. Murrill challenged that stance in her letter to Kirkpatrick. 
“There is no absolution in suggesting that immigration enforcement laws are a ‘civil issue,’ and, on that basis, NOPD cannot assist or support ICE and CBP in their enforcement efforts,” the attorney general wrote. 
Murrill also noted a state law approved in 2024 that prohibits cities from adopting “sanctuary policies” that are contrary to immigration laws, adding that she has the authority to sue any local agency that puts any such ordinances or rules in place.
The attorney general is challenging the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office, which operates the city jail, in federal court over its refusal to honor detainer requests from ICE or share information with the agency on the immigration status of people in custody. The sheriff’s office policy has been in place since 2013 as part of a settlement in a federal case involving two immigrant construction workers who were kept in jail at ICE’s request after they had completed their sentences for minor offenses.
The NOPD’s policy is linked to a 2013 federal consent decree meant to address the department’s history of corruption and unconstitutional police practices. It included measures to curb racial profiling, which potentially impacts how immigration enforcement is conducted.    
But less than two weeks before federal agents launched their operation in New Orleans, a federal judge terminated the consent decree at the request of the U.S. Department of Justice and city leaders.    
The Trump administration has acted to quash similar federal oversight agreements for police departments in Louisville, Kentucky, and Minneapolis, arguing they are too far-reaching and limit the ability of law enforcement to tackle crime.

AMES — Iowa legislators discussed food policy priorities, including the Choose Iowa program, food education efforts and support for food insecure individuals Friday at the Iowa Local Food Summit.
The summit, led by Iowa Food System Coalition and Iowa Farmers Union, included panels with state agencies and Republican and Democratic legislators on local food policies. 
The discussions at the summit centered on supporting Iowa food producers, addressing issues of food insecurity in the state and the places where those two issues intersect.

Food insecurity 
About 12% of Iowans are food insecure, according to data from Feeding American. But food security advocates project recent federal changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, will make it more difficult for the state to support food-insecure households. 
Iowa has also enacted its own changes to food assistance programs. In January, Gov. Kim Reynolds’ plan to stop SNAP recipients from purchasing sugary drinks, candy and other items, goes into effect. This summer, the state opted to carry out its own summer feeding program for food insecure children, rather than follow the federal summer feeding program. 
State Sen. Annette Sweeney, R-Iowa Falls, said these programs allowed for greater localization of food assistance. 
“Our local individuals working in the food pantries, they see the need,” Sweeney said. 
With a state-led program, she said, these local individuals are able to advocate for changes and adjustments to a program so they can best serve their recipients. 
Rather than loading money onto SNAP Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) cards on a per-child basis as the federal program operates, the state program partnered with food banks to instead distribute $40 worth of food, per child, to households. 
Erin Drinnin, the division director for community access and eligibility at the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services, said during a panel earlier Friday that the state is still waiting for a finalized evaluation report of the Healthy Kids Iowa program. 
Preliminary feedback from the evaluation, according to Drinnin, showed that parents “really liked the program” but food banks and distribution sites reported there were “lots of operational challenges” due to the amount of food they had to move in a short period of time. 
Reynolds, speaking with reporters outside of her Terrace Hill residence Nov. 25, said the state is still “looking at all options” with the program to decide how it will proceed next year. 
Rep. Beth Wessel-Kroeschell, D-Ames, opposed the state’s summer program and said a return to the federally led program would allow for more consumer choice. 
“People who are on SNAP buy the same groceries that you and I buy,” Wessel-Kroeschell said. “Sometimes we buy a treat, but not always … So I strongly support the SNAP program, the Summer EBT program, I hope we someday are participating in it also.”
Local food policies 
Choose Iowa, the state’s marketing program for locally grown and raised products, represents a crossover between efforts to address food insecurity and to support local food systems. 
Rep. Norlin Mommsen, R-DeWitt, was one of the legislators wh helped push the Choose Iowa program through the Legislature and later advocated for the program’s purchasing program with local food banks. 
This year, the state agriculture department was allotted $200,000 to issue as matching grants to Iowa food banks for the purchase of locally grown food. 
Mommsen said Choose Iowa, which now has more than 300 members across more than 80 of Iowa’s counties, has helped to “cultivate more food produced in Iowa.” 
The food bank purchasing program, he said, also helps Iowans connect to locally grown food so that when they no longer need food assistance, they will “still recognize the Choose Iowa label, and then choose that food or try and connect with that food later.” 
Choose Iowa also had a pilot program that granted funding to Iowa schools for the purchase of locally produced food. This program did not receive permanent funding in the latest agriculture appropriations bill. 
Mommsen said when it came to creating the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship budget for the year, it was simply a “dollars issue” that led the program to go unappropriated.
Haley Hook, the legislative liaison for IDALS, said in a panel earlier at the summit the department hopes to permanently codify the school purchasing program so that a future allocation could be more easily made to the program. 
Sen. Mike Zimmer, D-DeWitt, said the state budget will be tight in the upcoming legislative session and he is “not hopeful” any budget or program will be expanded this year.
“We’re going to be clawing to hang on to what, minimally, we have right now,” Zimmer said. “So to me, if we could just fund Choose Iowa at where it’s at now, I would call that a success.” 
Food education
Zimmer, who has spent his career in education and currently serves as a career and technology education consultant in eastern Iowa, said he sees support for local food procurement at schools as “key” to keeping Iowans fed. 
Zimmer said those programs have to be supported, because as much as local schools want to purchase locally, they cannot afford to purchase locally without any assistance. 
Sweeney said she plans to, again, file a bill to require a semester of food education in Iowa schools. These classes, she said, would teach things like canning, gardening and food preparation, all skills she said “are gone.” 
“So that’s a bill I’m going to run this year to hopefully have people understand more about their food, where it comes from, and then to be able to buy our local foods and know how to fix it,” Sweeney said. 
Zimmer agreed with his colleague and said the loss of these skills has coincided with an increase in purchasing highly processed, high-calorie food items. He said he would love to see a class like this, but from his experience, trying to find educators for these classes is “a tough go.”
“You can have the most beautiful program and (be) well equipped but if you don’t have a teacher, you have nothing,” Zimmer said. “And we do not have teachers going into that field … we’re in the crisis on the education portion of it.” 
Amid all of the hardships facing local food and food security efforts in the state, lawmakers said they are encouraged by the creativity of Iowans in these fields and from everyday Iowans who have stepped up to support one another. 
“If you are always … gonna wait for the government to do it, don’t,” Mommsen said. “Because just look at, (as) we were talking earlier, there was funding in these areas, and now they’re gone. So I would use creativity, and then whatever the government helps, that’s gravy.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-05 21:51:15+00:00,CT Mirror,Will widening I-95 in Stamford help traffic? CT DOT is considering it,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/05/i-95-widening-lanes-ct-dot/,"The agency will hold a pair of public meetings next week regarding the future of I-95, including an in-person forum at Ferguson Library.","As part of an effort to alleviate traffic on one of the nation’s most congested stretches of interstate highway, the Connecticut Department of Transportation is weighing a fix that has roused local opposition: adding more highway.
In October, the agency delivered a presentation to a committee made up of Stamford residents, business leaders and other local groups unveiling several concepts for a planned overhaul of Interstate 95 through the city’s downtown. One option called for widening the interstate by a single lane in each direction. Another suggests putting up a “collector-distributor” road running parallel to the highway.
A third option presented by the DOT would avoid adding any new travel lanes, and focus instead on reconfiguring the highway’s exits and entrances, as well as adding wider shoulders.
Those proposals were pitched as part of DOT’s long-term study of ways to improve traffic and safety on I-95 between exits 6 and 9, a bottleneck that is well known to Connecticut drivers for producing chronic delays. In addition, the DOT is looking to replace a bridge carrying the highway over local roads and the Metro-North railroad tracks, which is outdated and in need of replacement. 
But some local advocates who had been following the DOT’s work said they were caught off guard by the proposal to widen the highway, which they described as an outdated — and thoroughly debunked — solution to the city’s traffic woes.
“I basically told them that this was pretty bonkers to me,” said Angelo Bochanis, a resident of downtown Stamford who is a member of the local advisory committee that heard the DOT’s proposals in October.
“It felt very out of step with everything we were talking about and the direction I thought this project had been headed,” Bochanis said. “There’s been a national conversation around reconnecting communities that have been adversely impacted by highway construction. I thought CTDOT was really cognizant of that.”
In an interview Friday, DOT officials involved with the study cautioned that the concepts presented at the October meeting were only preliminary and that the agency has yet to settle on a specific plan for the highway.
“We’re early in the planning process for what is the future of I-95,” said Jonathan Dean, the project manager for the DOT’s study. The ideas under consideration at this point, he said, are “all being compared against each other, they’re being compared against, ‘What is the no-build alternative? What if we didn’t do anything other than what’s required just to maintain the highway as it is?'”
The agency has not conducted cost estimates for any of the proposals for I-95 in Stamford, Dean added, nor have detailed designs been produced showing which properties adjacent to the highway may need to be cleared for construction.
A DOT spokesman said that some additional information regarding costs and property impacts could come about as part of the next and final phase of the screening process, before the agency issues its final recommendations late next year. More details, however, won’t be known until those recommendations go through subsequent environmental reviews and design.
“Some will be long-term projects that may not begin for several years,” the spokesman, Josh Morgan, said in an email. “At the same time, we’re working to identify smaller, independent projects that can be done in the next five years.”

The agency will hold a pair of public meetings next week regarding the future of I-95, including an in-person forum on Dec. 10 at Stamford’s Ferguson Library. 
The idea of widening the highway has attracted support from some drivers and businesses, including thousands of commercial truckers that traverse I-95 on a daily basis.
John Blair, the president of the Motor Transport Association of Connecticut, a group representing the trucking industry, pointed out that I-95 in Stamford is one of several locations in the state that perennially rank among the nation’s worst bottlenecks for truckers. (MTAC is also a part of the project advisory council for the I-95 study.)
In addition to the economic costs of having trucks stuck in traffic, Blair said that jams also make highways less safe for drivers.
“There’s a lot of breaking and swerving and traffic and congestion down there,” Blair said. “I think anything they can do to widen it and widen the other spots in Connecticut will help not only the trucking community, but certainly cars and automobiles and passenger vehicles.” 
In its current configuration, I-95 has three travel lanes in each direction through Stamford. The DOT is currently constructing a pair of auxiliary lanes between exits 6 and 7 in order to allow drivers more time to merge onto the highway.
Traffic along I-95 is expected to worsen significantly over the next few decades, according to DOT. By 2050, peak travel times through the 3.2 mile stretch of downtown Stamford are expected to grow by nine minutes in each direction, assuming no major renovations to the highway are made.
Critics of highway widening, including multiple researchers who have studied the topic, argue that it does little to reduce congestion in the long term. The culprit, they say, is a phenomenon known as induced demand. Additional lanes may produce some temporary relief from traffic jams, the theory goes, but other drivers alter their routines to take advantage of the new space — and soon traffic becomes as bad, or worse, than it ever was.
“There are very few examples in this country, if any, where just one more lane solves that problem,” said Peter Harrison, the director of Connecticut programs at the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit advocacy group focused on the tri-state area. “I think DOT is smart enough to know that.”
Harrison said that while the RPA has yet to take a position on the state’s proposals, the group generally favors other methods — such as public transit or congestion pricing — to reduce congestion. New York City rolled out the nation’s first congestion pricing program earlier this year, charging drivers a variable toll to enter the busiest sections of Manhattan.
Bochanis pointed out that it can take him more than 45 minutes to travel from his home in Stamford to Norwalk by bus, a distance of less than 10 miles. Bochanis said he does not own a car, which makes him more reliant on transit.
“Unless we start talking about creating viable alternatives to driving along the 95 corridor, there’s always going to be traffic along 95,” he said. “There’s no amount of expansion, no amount of homes you can demolish that will fix that.”
Zach Oberholtzer, another member of the project’s advisory committee, echoed those critiques of the DOT’s planning. Oberholtzer is also an organizer with People Friendly Stamford, an advocacy group that supports mass transit and efforts to reduce car dependency.
“The problem with I-95 traffic is that the trains run too slow,” Oberholtzer said. “If you want to move people efficiently, if you want to move stuff efficiently, you want to put people and stuff on rail… They have no new, insightful, creative solutions here. It’s just the same, ‘Well, what if we added another lane?’ and we know that doesn’t fix it.”
Mass transit options are not a part of the study looking at an overhaul of I-95 in downtown Stamford. But Dean, the project engineer, said DOT as a whole is considering all modes of transportation in its long-term planning for the area. In addition, he said the study will look at the design of local streets next to the interstate for ways to improve bike and pedestrian access.
“It’s a very built up area,” Dean said. “There are a lot of access points to and from the interstate, but that’s something that we’re looking at: How does it all work together, and what can we improve?”‘
Gov. Ned Lamont has pledged billions of dollars as part of an effort to speed up train service along Metro-North Railroad’s New Haven Line, though much of that work is unfinished and the results have only shaved a few minutes off commutes so far. Earlier this year, DOT had to raise rail fares in order to plug a budget shortfall and continue operating at existing levels. (Bus fares remained flat this year, at $1.75.)
Some lawmakers have also raised concerns that the state’s Special Transportation Fund — which covers some of the costs of highway and transit infrastructure projects — could run out of money by 2030, while the Lamont administration is arguing that the state needs to curtail its borrowing for transportation projects. 
Morgan, the DOT spokesman, said that no funding has been dedicated to any projects that might arise from the ongoing study of I-95 in Stamford.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/I-95-stamford-e1764960181186.jpg,,,2025-12-05 16:57:38.988467

A former Orange County Sheriff’s deputy has been permanently banned from working as a law enforcement officer in Vermont nearly three years after he was sentenced to jail following his criminal convictions in a road rage case. 
The Vermont Criminal Justice Council voted at its most recent meeting last month to take the action against William Pine, according to Christopher Brickell, the council’s executive director.
The action appears to bring a close to proceedings stemming from the road rage incident that dates back to 2019.

The matter before the council last month had been set for a contested hearing, but Pine did not attend, and the council members voted to approve the measure, Brickell said Friday. 
The Vermont Criminal Justice Council oversees the certification, training and standards of police officers in the state.
Pine could not be reached for comment.
The incident leading to the council’s action against Pine dates back to Oct. 7, 2019. That’s when, according to court records, Pine, who was off-duty at the time, was driving a Nissan Titan in Williamstown. 
Charging documents stated that Pine had followed a Jeep Wrangler on Stone Road for several miles and eventually performed a “tactical maneuver” at the intersection of Route 64 in an attempt to block the Jeep. 
A prosecutor told jurors during a later trial in the case that Pine then yelled at two men who were in the Jeep, “Deputy sheriff, don’t F-ing move.”
Then, court records stated, Pine fired shots into the Jeep, shattering the Jeep’s rear window as the vehicle fled toward Interstate 89.
The Orange County Sheriff’s Department had initially placed Pine on unpaid leave after the incident. Following the jury’s verdict, the department terminated him.
Asked Friday why it took so long for the case to reach the council, Brickell replied that it was due to several factors, including awaiting the results of the criminal matter and then PIne’s imprisonment. 
In addition, according to Brickell, attempts to resolve the matter with a negotiated agreement rather than setting a contested hearing was complicated by difficulties contacting Pine, who had since moved out of state.

John Morley, a longtime village of Orleans employee and former state representative, will fill Orleans County’s vacant seat in the Vermont Senate. 
Gov. Phil Scott announced his appointment in a press release on Friday.
Morley replaces Sam Douglass, who resigned in scandal this fall when his involvement in a national Young Republicans group chat replete with racist and bigoted messages was revealed in a Politico exposé. Top Vermont Republicans, including Scott, quickly called for the former senator to step down.

The Caledonian Record this week reported four people considered to replace Douglass, including three current members of the Vermont House: Rep. Mark Higley, R-Lowell; Rep. Michael Marcotte, R-Coventry; and Rep. John Kascenska, R-Burke. (The report also indicated Marcotte had removed himself from the selection process.)
Morley’s name was not on the reported list, though Scott, in a statement, appeared to allude to the sitting House members he’d considered.  
“I also want to acknowledge how difficult this choice was, with three strong, capable, and effective state representatives from the Kingdom sent by the County Committee for my consideration,” Scott said. “All three are invaluable leaders in the House, in important roles at a critical time during the biennium. I look forward to continuing to work with them on our shared priorities.”
Morley, who works as the Orleans village manager, could not be immediately reached for comment late Friday afternoon. He previously served six years in the Vermont House, ending his tenure in 2010, according to a press release from Scott’s office.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)The shot clock has been reset on the imminent closure of Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital under another extension brokered between attorneys for Rhode Island and the hospitals’ bankruptcy estate.
The agreement presented to a federal bankruptcy judge in Dallas Friday gives prospective buyer The Centurion Foundation until the end of January — rather than Dec. 31 —  to line up the investor-backed financing needed to complete the sale. If Centurion can’t pull it off, the hospitals could be placed under state-controlled receivership.
“Centurion has continued to work this issue, we believe very hard and in good faith,” said Andrew Troop, a New York attorney hired by Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha’s office to represent the state in federal bankruptcy proceedings. “They will work like expletive deleted to get this done.”
Ben Mingle, Centurion CEO, reiterated that the foundation is “aggressively executing” its financing strategy with the intent of closing the sale in January.
“We want to acknowledge the support of Attorney General Peter Neronha and his team, as well as the Department of Health, who agreed to this extension of time and to cover any losses through the month of January,” Mingle said in a statement Friday. State leaders have been instrumental in their support of our plan and the importance of these hospitals to the local community.”
Neronha was still skeptical.
“I’m no cheerleader for anybody,” he said in a call with reporters after the court hearing Friday. “They’ve got to put up or shut up.”
The Atlanta nonprofit lined up conditional state regulatory approval to buy the struggling hospitals from their now-bankrupt owner, Prospect Medical Holdings, in June 2024. But Centurion has been unable to lure investors to back the bonds needed to secure its purchase, much to the dismay of Rhode Island health care leaders, the federal bankruptcy judge and Prospect’s many creditors. 
Prospect’s bankruptcy estate in October sought to close the hospitals by the end of the year, rather than keep racking up monthly operating costs and postponing resolution of the 11-month bankruptcy case. 
But Centurion signaled it needs even more time; Mingle said in a court filing on Monday that the bonds being underwritten by Barclays and Bank of America should close “on or about Jan. 15.”
Neronha on Friday acknowledged that Centurion is the only buyer that has already cleared the extensive state regulatory approval process, and agreed to meet a host of conditions critical to preserving hospital operations, workers and services to patients.

No longer Primed for purchase 
That’s in contrast with Prime Healthcare, which Gov. Dan McKee’s administration courted as an alternative buyer for at least several months. Neronha confirmed Thursday that Prime had walked away — at least for now — unable to reach a resolution with state regulators on the conditions and financial investments expected.
Neronha offered more detail Friday on where talks broke down.
The national hospital chain operator, which owns Landmark Medical Center in Woonsocket, was unwilling to cover the $91 million in hospital labor costs, local taxes and a federal loan repayment that Prospect’s creditors — and Neronha — expected a buyer to cover. Prime also refused to commit to keeping service and staffing levels the same, and wanted a $5 million monthly management fee in exchange for running operations, Neronha said.
Noel True, a spokesperson for Prime, confirmed the company had decided not to move forward with an acquisition of the Rhode Island hospitals but declined to comment on details of its negotiations.
Centurion has already agreed to cover the bankruptcy costs and maintain existing service and staffing levels. It has not sought management fees from the state, Neronha said.
Neronha blasted Rhode Island Health and Human Services Secretary Richard Charest, former Landmark CEO, for exposing the state to legal action by soliciting Prime when Centurion was still under exclusive rights to buy the hospitals. Neronha also blamed Charest for making his job as a state regulator more difficult.
“I can’t negotiate with Prime if Prime believes the state will welcome them unconditionally to ownership of these hospitals,” Neronha said. “I’ve got to negotiate on behalf of Rhode Island. It’s very difficult to do that if the Secretary is taking away my bargaining leverage by telling them they can have the hospitals for whatever they want.”
Neronha also said Prime’s press statements, featuring complimentary quotes from Charest, told him “everything I need to know” about the relationship between McKee’s cabinet member and the hospital owner.  










I can’t negotiate with Prime if Prime believes the state will welcome them unconditionally to ownership of these hospitals. I’ve got to negotiate on behalf of Rhode Island.

Ashley O’Shea, a spokesperson for Rhode Island Executive Office of Health and Human Services, said Charest’s conversations with Prime were “contingency planning” and not formal negotiations on an offer.
“When Centurion was having difficulty closing the transaction, it became apparent to the McKee administration that it was in Rhode Island’s best interest to explore back-up options in case Centurion was not able to close the transaction,” O’Shea said in an emailed response Friday. “Secretary Charest has remained focused on fulfilling the governor’s directive to preserve these hospitals — whose closure would be catastrophic for Rhode Island’s already strained health care system.”

Avoiding catastrophe 
Preserving the pair of safety net hospitals — with 500 beds, 50,000 annual emergency room visits and nearly 2,500 employees between them — has been a shared priority among companies, state leaders and even Chief Judge Stacey Jernigan of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas.
“Even though as a bankruptcy judge I am about debtor or creditor rights, you cannot help but feel some responsibility for these human beings,” Jernigan said Friday. 
Jernigan has had harsh words for Centurion in past hearings, questioning why it has been unable to close the sale over the last year of bankruptcy proceedings. But she expressed support Friday.
“I feel much better today than I have in the past hearings,” she said, adding that she was “content to let the process play out.”
For now, that process hinges on Centurion securing the investor-backed bonds to close a sale by mid-January. A timeline Centurion submitted to the bankruptcy court shows a meeting with investors scheduled in Boston on Dec. 15, with documents finalized and agreements executed by Jan. 5.
“Centurion recognizes that this transaction has taken longer to close than anticipated, and it acknowledges that the court approved the sale in February 2025 and is focused on preventing further administrative drain and ensuring a realistic, near-term path to closing.” Mingle wrote in a Dec. 1 affidavit to the court. “Centurion takes these concerns seriously.”

Neronha on Friday said he is solely focused on getting Centurion “to the finish line.”
This includes forking over another $6 million from a state-controlled escrow account to cover hospital operations through Jan. 31. The state already has spent $6 million from the account funded by the facilities’ former owner, private equity firm Leonard Green, to cover operating costs in November and December.
The fund will still have $37 million to $42 million left after January’s expenses, with Centurion — or an alternative buyer — required to replenish the money spent on recent operating costs. 
Closure remains a possibility if Centurion can’t come through on its pledged commitment by the end of January, Neronha acknowledged. An alternative: a court-appointed state receiver, though details of the transfer of the hospitals to a state trustee have not been solidified.
“We’re a long way away from that point now,” Neronha said. 
McKee MIA?
Neronha suggested McKee’s office and the Rhode Island General Assembly could contribute state money to keep the hospitals afloat longer, mimicking actions taken by Gov. Maura Healey in Massachusetts last year after Steward Health Care filed for bankruptcy and sold off its Massachusetts hospitals.
McKee’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday on whether he plans to offer state funding for the hospitals.
“Keeping these hospitals open remains our top priority,” Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, said in an email Thursday. She also noted that nothing prevents Prime from “reengaging” if the Centurion deal does not go through.
Senate President Valarie Lawson and House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi also have not publicly committed to spending state budget funds on the hospitals though they are monitoring developments, Greg Paré, a spokesperson for Lawson, said Friday.
Helena Buonnano Foulkes, who is challenging McKee for the governor’s seat in the 2026 Democratic primary, criticized McKee and other unspecified “state leaders” for their poor performance.
“They have failed to personally convene key stakeholders and leaders of Rhode Island’s health care system or present any contingency plan,” Foulkes said in a statement Thursday. “This lack of leadership is unacceptable when two hospitals, thousands of patients, and hospital workers hang in the balance.”
Brad Dufault, a spokesperson for the United Nurses and Allied Professionals, which represents 1,500 workers across both hospitals, maintained the union’s stance that Centurion’s offered the best hope of survival. The union has been critical of Prime for its trio of federal settlements over Medicaid and billing fraud, and its allegedly poor relations with union members at Landmark in Woonsocket.
“With time running out quickly, the UNAP is pleased that the state can now keep the focus 100% on closing the Centurion deal,” Dufault said in a statement Friday. “The deal is our best immediate option to keep these important community hospitals open and operational into the new year and beyond.”

(Getty Images)A federal appeals court has rejected a late Delaware woman’s challenge to the residency requirement in New Jersey’s assisted suicide law.
The three-judge U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals panel ruled Friday that assisted suicide is not a fundamental privilege the state must extend to residents from other states. Striking the residency requirement would expose doctors to criminal prosecution, risk inter-state conflicts, and undermine anti-coercion safeguards in New Jersey’s law, they said.
“A prescription lawful in Camden can be evidence of a felony in Philadelphia,” Judge Stephanos Bibas wrote for the panel. “If a New Jersey doctor prescribes a Pennsylvanian lethal pills and she swallows them back in Pennsylvania, the doctor might reasonably fear prosecution.”
Antiabortion pregnancy centers take case against NJ to US Supreme Court

In New Jersey, doctors can prescribe self-administered medication to terminally ill New Jersey adults expected to die within six months so they can end their lives.
Before a doctor can prescribe the medication, a patient must make one written request and two oral requests separated by at least 15 days.
The suit was brought initially by Delaware resident Judy Govatos, Philadelphia resident Andrea Sealy, and two New Jersey doctors.
One of the doctors retired during the litigation. Sealy died before a lower court upheld the residency requirement. Govatos, who had late-stage lymphoma, died in November after oral arguments were held in the case, leaving Paul Bryman, a New Jersey doctor, as the case’s only plaintiff.
“I am deeply disappointed by today’s ruling,” Bryman said in a statement. “Terminal patients outside New Jersey should have the option of medical aid in dying without having to travel long distances.”
New Jersey’s Medical Aid in Dying for the Terminally Ill Act, which passed in April 2019, was controversial, with critics raising ethical and religious objections while supporters said people with terminal illnesses deserve to choose when they would die.
Bryman argued the law’s residency requirement violates the U.S. Constitution’s privileges and immunities clause, which requires states to protect the fundamental rights and privileges of out-of-state residents within their borders.
But those protections do not require New Jersey to guarantee all privileges to residents from other states, the court ruled in its precedential opinion. Assisted suicide — a relatively new practice legal in only 12 states and Washington, D.C. — does not qualify as a fundamental right, the judges said.
“There is no longstanding tradition of doctor-assisted suicide. On the contrary, there is a centuries-long tradition against it,” Bibas wrote.
For the same reasons, the law does not violate the Constitution’s equal protections clause, the panel said.
New Jersey’s law “aims to keep both patients and pills in-state” to avoid exposing Garden State doctors to prosecution in other jurisdictions and avoid causing discord with states where assisted suicide is illegal, the court ruled.
Other states also lack laws barring insurers and others from pressuring patients to go take the medication once they have obtained it, which would undermine protections in New Jersey’s law, the court said.
“New Jersey’s justifications are weighty, rooted in real dangers of extending doctor-assisted suicide to nonresidents,” Bibas wrote. “And its response is well tailored to further those justifications.”
The court rejected claims that the law infringes on federal authority over interstate commerce, finding the statute is not commercial in nature.
The Office of the Chief State Medical Examiner reported 409 people died through the program between August 2019 and the end of 2024, including 122 last year.
“Despite this decision, access to medical aid in dying remains a critically important option for all terminally ill people who wish to receive health care in the state of New Jersey,” said Jess Pezley, an attorney with Compassion & Choices, a Colorado-based nonprofit that represented the plaintiffs.

Emergency shelters in Barre and Brattleboro opened Thursday, offering relief to people without housing.

Temperatures remain bitterly cold across Vermont after extreme cold hit the region on Thursday.
Tyler Danzig, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Burlington, said temperatures dropped into the negative teens on Thursday night, with negative 20s across the central and northern areas of Vermont. Wind chills reached -25 degrees Fahrenheit in parts of Caledonia County and -13 degrees at the Burlington Airport.
The extreme cold on Thursday was mostly due to the previous snow, which kept ground temperatures cool, and wind chills, according to Danzig. But the National Weather Service didn’t issue a cold weather advisory because only some areas in the Northeast Kingdom reached the threshold of -20 degrees Fahrenheit.
These temperatures are not uncommon for Vermont in the winter, Danzig said, but he still recommended people to cover their face in higher winds to avoid frostbites, wear several layers of clothes and make sure pets are inside.
The Office of Economic Opportunity at the Department for Children and Families has recently created a new Extreme Cold Weather Shelter Program, in partnership with Vermont Interfaith Action, to support people experiencing homelessness during periods of extreme cold.
The program will operate from Dec. 1 to April 1, when temperatures reach at least -10 degrees, with projects in Bennington, Burlington, Newport, Rutland, Barre, Montpelier and Brattleboro, Lily Sojourner, director of the Office of Economic Opportunity, said.
The shelters in Barre and Brattleboro opened for the first time Thursday night and provided relief for 26 people, according to Sojourner. Sojourner said this program is just one of many others operating this winter, including the General Assistance Emergency Hotel Program and seasonal shelters across the state.
Tess Taylor, homeless and housing liaison for the city of Barre, said the shelter at the Congregational Church also hosted people in need on Thursday. The space has a capacity of 12 people and will continue to operate when temperatures are around zero, providing food, cots and blankets, Taylor said.
“Low temperatures tonight will fall into the single digits across much of Vermont, with temperatures in the Northeast Kingdom around five to 10, then across the central portions of Vermont around 10 degrees,” Danzig said. 
Monday night temperatures might get lower again, he added.

(File photo by Getty Images)NEWBERRY — A former South Carolina representative pleaded guilty to charges of threatening an agency director over the phone.
Former Rep. Rick Martin, a Newberry Republican, must complete an anger management class in the next six months or spend 30 days in jail, a Newberry County judge decided Tuesday.
Martin was charged in 2021 with misconduct in office and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Prosecutors said he gave alcohol to a 15-year-old and called the then-director of the Department of Social Services to threaten his job and agency budget, The Post and Courier reported at the time. Martin was accused of making a similar call to an agency lobbyist.
Both charges were dropped this week and replaced with a single count of unlawful communication, which carries a maximum sentence of 30 days in jail and a minimum fine of $100, according to court records. Martin will have to pay $128.75 in court fees.
Martin was suspended from the House as soon as the charges against him were announced in 2021.
He still ran for re-election the following year but placed last in a three-way GOP primary won by Joe White. The retired businessman joined the hardline Freedom Caucus after he easily won the general election that November with no Democratic opponent. White was re-elected last year to the seat representing Newberry County and one precinct in Lexington County.
Martin and his attorney, House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford, did not respond to calls or texts requesting comment.

Students from Iowa need to have earned a 4.0 or higher grade-point average or “have succeeded in the most demanding curriculum offered by their schools” to qualify for the scholarship, the release stated.

“Iowa has always been home to Grinnell College, and Grinnell College champions Iowa. We are grateful for the support and advocacy that we receive from the state, the Grinnell community, and all of the people who make Iowa home for these outstanding students,” President Anne Harris said in the release. “This scholarship recognizes that support and the impact that Iowa’s top students can have at the College and as they go on to professional success and community leadership in our state.”
The Iowa Dean’s Scholarship will become available to students in the fall 2026 semester, the release stated. It joins other financial aid programs offered by the college, including the full-tuition Iowa Access Initiative for students coming from households earning less than $100,000 annually, according to the release, and the $20,000 Founders Scholarship for all admitted resident students.
According to the college’s website, 92% of Grinnell College students receive financial aid, and 100% of “demonstrated need” is met by the college without requiring students to take out loans.
Grinnell College Dean Ruth Feingold said in the release that the university “brings bright, engaged students from around the world to live and learn in Iowa” and fosters a campus where students can join the intellectual community and learn from more people than just their teachers.
“Our new Iowa Dean’s Scholarship is our way of extending a clear welcome to high-performing students from our home state: come join us here,” Feingold said in the release.

Interim President Donald Landry and UF trustees expressed a commitment during a board meeting to “institutional neutrality” regarding how university actors will behave.
“We are not protecting the right to choose topics for classroom instruction, research, or scholarship if that right is not coupled with institutional neutrality,” Landry said. 
“We have to provide protections for free expression, but we are not going to be able to engage in that protection if we have leadership speaking on issues that then create those aligned with leadership and those opposed to leadership. At that moment, those who are opposed to leadership are now afraid to speak, they don’t know if it’s safe.”

Trustees unanimously supported a policy that applies to university employees with access to communications resources used for “university business,” including email distribution lists, university websites, social media accounts, and teleconference systems. 
“University business” encompasses “instructional activities, research and scholarship, administrative functions, communications,” and lobbying. Also: “Guidance regarding or requiring compliance with laws, regulations or policies.”
“Proclamations from UF institutional and unit leadership on issues that polarize society impair the free and open exchange of differing ideas on campus as it divides the student body and faculty into those aligned with leadership and those opposed,” the new policy says, in part. 
The policy, according to its language, “clarifies expectations regarding (1) leadership commentary and proclamations on Social Issues; (2) the use of communication resources for personal expression; and (3) representations of affiliations.”
“When our leaders make comment or proclamations on social issues, political issues, normative issues, current events to their university constituents, these statements divide our faculty and students, chill free expression for those who do not agree with leadership, and send a signal that suddenly there’s no room for open discourse or the contest of ideas at the University of Florida,” Landry said. 
Landry said he met with deans at the school about the neutrality statement. 
“We resist ideological takeover of any unit of the university, we reject ideological indoctrination in favor of open discourse, we accomplish that at this university and in this state mainly through the right of the students to record any lecture,” Landry said. 
The policy allows “political or social advocacy” as long as it’s not represented as UF policy, protecting “personal expression in their private capacities.”
Violation of the policy could result in termination.

“What we’re going to accomplish today is the voluntary restraint of leadership not to speak. If speech must come forth, it will come forth from the president in consultation with the chair, but otherwise we will remain silent,” Landry said. 
Earlier in the meeting, Landry laid out his vision for the university. He holds the position while the university searches for a president. The search started Friday, and Chair Mori Hosseini said Landry signaled he will apply for the permanent position.
“This is a state where individuals can come confident that they will be able to learn, confident that their education will not be disrupted. It is a state where faculty can come, knowing they will be able to teach, they will be able to do research, they will be able to do their scholarship. That stability is priceless. That’s a firm foundation for a vision of preeminence and leadership,” Landry said. 
The DeSantis administration’s political involvement in higher education led various professors to express their desire to leave the state, the Phoenix reported earlier this year.
Landry spent much of his time outlining his vision for the university, talking about expanding and supporting artificial intelligence research. 
Chairs
Hosseini, a major donor to Gov. Ron DeSantis, will serve another term as chair of the state’s flagship university; the trustees unanimously voted Friday to keep Hosseini in charge for another two years. 
Mori Hosseini via UF
Hosseini has served on the UF board since 2016 and before that he served on the Florida Board of Governors, which oversees public universitites, on which he also was chairman. 
Notably, Hosseini stood behind the UF trustees’ support for Santa Ono, even after the state Board of Governors rejected him to be the leader of the university. Prominent Republicans came out in opposition to the former University of Michigan president after he abandoned his previous support for diversity, equity, and inclusion policies that are anathema to the MAGA movement. 
“It’s no exaggeration to say that, in the modern era, I don’t think anybody has had as much influence on the trajectory of the University of Florida than you. From inspiring and challenging our leadership, to leveraging your relationships in Tallahassee for the benefit of our institution, the impact of your work is visible to all of us, every day,” board Vice Chair Rahul Patel told Hosseini. 
The board also voted to keep Patel as the board’s vice chair.

Carla Cunningham, the Democrat who faced a jeering hometown crowd this summer after delivering a controversial speech on the state House floor criticizing immigrants, is seeking an eighth term. 
She’ll likely be in a crowded primary field in House District 106 in Charlotte. 
The Rev. Rodney Sadler filed campaign paperwork on Monday. 
At least two others say they plan to run. Morris McAdoo, a lawyer, has a campaign website. Vermanno Bowman, whom Cunningham defeated in last year’s primary, announced on social media he also plans to run again. 
Cunningham worked for decades as a nurse and has been a prominent voice in the legislature on health and mental health matters.
She is the widow of longtime House member Pete Cunningham, who resigned his seat in 2007 and died in 2010. Carla Cunningham won her first term in 2012.  
Cunningham has emerged as one of the Democrats who votes most often with the Republican majority. This year, she voted with Republicans more than any other Democrat. And Republican House leaders have recognized that by awarding her coveted positions in chamber leadership: she co-chairs the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Health and Human Services, and is a vice-chair of the House Health Committee.
But, until now, she has not faced a concerted Democratic effort to oust her. She defeated Bowman in last year’s primary with more than 84% of the vote. 
House District 106 is heavily Democratic, so the primary victor is likely to win the seat. 
Cunningham delivered her controversial speech on immigration as she voted with the GOP to override Democratic Gov. Josh Stein’s veto of House Bill 318. The law puts more requirements on law enforcement to help U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement with deportations. 
“All cultures are not equal,” Cunningham said in a speech explaining her vote to override Stein’s veto. Immigrants need to assimilate, she added. 
At an August town hall filled with angry Democrats, Cunningham defended her vote and the speech, WFAE reported. 
Last month, the U.S. Border Patrol began an operation in Charlotte that triggered a wave of fear that temporarily closed businesses and had parents afraid to send children to school.
Cunningham was initially dismissive of reports of the operation. She told NC Newsline, “I’m going to be keeping my eyes on my own safety for right now,” saying she had received threats over her July speech.  
However, in an email Friday announcing her reelection bid, Cunningham said her vote was about serious criminal offenders.

Gov. Kelly Armstrong announced Jan. 21, 2026, as the likely date for a special session to address federal rural health funding. (Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong set Jan. 21 as the tentative date for a special legislative session to allocate federal rural health funding.
In a Friday letter, Armstrong notified legislative leaders of the likely special session date, but said it’s contingent on North Dakota receiving its federal funding award.  
North Dakota and other states applied in November for their share of $50 billion through the Rural Health Transformation Program. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is expected to award funding to states by Dec. 31. 
A North Dakota legislative committee gave input on the state’s application, but lawmakers will still need to meet and give final approval for spending those federal dollars.
North Dakota lawmakers build wish list for $500M federal rural health care grant

“We have an incredible opportunity to strengthen and reshape rural health care in North Dakota through the Rural Health Transformation Program,” Armstrong said in a statement. “I appreciate the collaboration with legislative leadership and look forward to a special session laser-focused on the task at hand – appropriating these federal dollars in the most efficient and effective way possible to improve the well-being of our citizens.”
In a letter to House and Senate leaders, Armstrong defined the purpose of the special session as allocating the rural health funding. But once lawmakers convene, they will be able to run the session as they see fit, said Mike Nowatzki, spokesperson for Armstrong.
“He’s not able to limit them,” Nowatzki said.
Senate Majority Leader Sen. David Hogue, R-Minot, said Legislative Management will meet the week before the special session to “set the table,” but the intent of legislative leadership is to limit the focus of the session to the Rural Health Transformation Program funding.
“But, of course, folks could introduce other things,” Hogue said. He added anything introduced by lawmakers would likely require a two-thirds majority in each chamber to be considered, which is a high bar.
Hogue said the tentative Jan. 21 date for the special session was chosen because it gives the Department of Health and Human Services as much time as possible to implement the funding after it is awarded at the end of the year.
John Bjornson, director of Legislative Council, said the shortest amount of time a special session can last is three days because each chamber cannot vote on the first and second reading of a bill on the same day. 
North Dakota’s Legislature is limited to meeting 80 days every two years. Because Armstrong is calling the special session, Bjornson said the Legislature will retain its six remaining legislative days to use before the 2027 legislative session.
States are expected to get at least $500 million from the federal grant, but states could be eligible for more based on certain factors, including if they implement some health-related policies. North Dakota’s application focuses on boosting the state’s rural health workforce, preventive care and healthy eating, bringing health care closer to home and connecting technology and data.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island has taken “an important step forward” with the official completion of demolition of the westbound lanes of the Washington Bridge, Gov. Dan McKee’s office announced Friday. 
The news arrives a few weeks ahead of the original demolition schedule and less than a week shy of the two-year anniversary of the span’s sudden closure on Dec. 11, 2023. State officials initially said the westbound span would be removed by the end of the year. 
“I know travelers are still feeling the frustration of traffic, and I want to assure them that we are fully committed to rebuilding this bridge as quickly as possible, with one of the nation’s top bridge builders leading the work,” McKee said in a statement Friday. “We thank Rhode Islanders for their patience as we construct a new, safe bridge that will improve traffic flow and shorten commute times.” 
In July 2024, demolition crews began to remove the bridge in two parts, starting with the bridge deck and superstructure in July 2024. Work paused in mid-September 2024 to allow state investigators to document its condition as part of the state’s lawsuit against 13 firms that previously worked on it before resuming on Oct. 11, 2024. 
At the end of January, a video of debris falling into the Seekonk River near the Providence side prompted concerns from local residents. The Rhode Island Department of Transportation said the demolition posed no dangers to the eastbound span and that only a small amount of debris had fallen into the water. Officials worked with state coastal regulators to coordinate the removal of debris from the river.
In March 2025, substructure demolition began, with the removal of underwater portions starting in July. 
The final phase of the substructure removal was completed in the first week of December, according to McKee’s office, ahead of the end-of-month timeline that had originally been set. 
State contractors will now focus their attention on the replacement bridge, which is tentatively scheduled to open in November 2028. The Chicago-based Walsh Construction was awarded the construction contract in June 2025. The agreement has a base price of $339 million, but the total could climb to as much as $427 million, with incentives and contingencies.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Most people of Somali descent in America are citizens, including those living in Minnesota, according to estimates from the American Community Survey, an ongoing survey conducted by the Census Bureau.
Immigration enforcement agents have increased their presence in Minnesota in recent days as part of a targeted campaign ordered by President Donald Trump to deport undocumented Somali immigrants. ICE has arrested at least 12 people this month, including 5 from Somalia, in what it calls “Operation Metro Surge,” according to a U.S. Department of Homeland Security release.
Apart from Minnesota’s biting cold this week, one complication in Trump’s plan to deport Somalis from Minnesota through immigration enforcement is that the vast majority of Americans and Minnesotans of Somali descent are U.S. citizens, many of whom were born here.


Exact numbers on citizenship of Somali-Americans are unknown. The American Community Survey, which extrapolates its monthly sampling of selected households to the larger population through a weighting process, indicates that around 22,000 Somalis in America — 8.4% — are not citizens. In Minnesota, around 5,000 people of Somali descent are not citizens, according to ACS. That figure includes people here through other legal means, such as permanent residents, green card holders and the couple hundred covered by Temporary Protected Status, a protection Trump said he would end earlier than planned.
That number has decreased significantly since the start of the century. According to ACS data from IPUMS, a database housed at the University of Minnesota, over 78% of people with Somali ancestry in America weren’t citizens in 2001, about a decade after the start of a Somali Civil War created a worldwide diaspora.
In Minnesota, the number of Somali non-citizens went from over 76% in 2001 to 9% in 2023. In the same period, U.S.-born people of Somali descent rose from 19% to nearly 39% of all Somalis as families settled here and had children.
Estimates for how many people of Somali descent live in the country and in Minnesota vary by source and time. The decennial census, which is sent to all households every 10 years, estimated in 2020 that there were around 91,000 Somalis in Minnesota and 221,000 Somalis nationwide. The American Community Survey estimated that in 2024, there were around 108,000 residents of Somali descent in Minnesota and 259,000 in America.
The numbers could be off by around 10,000 to 20,000, and the precise number of Somalis in the state and country is unknowable. Still, all estimates indicate that Minnesota is home to the largest Somali population in the country.

(Photo by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)Close to half of South Dakotans aren’t up-to-date on their flu shots or their hepatitis B vaccinations, new vaccine survey results released by the South Dakota Department of Health indicate.
About 63% aren’t up-to-date on their HPV vaccinations, which protect against most cases of cervical cancer, and 78% aren’t up-to-date on their pneumococcal vaccinations, which help protect against pneumococcal infections.
That’s “concerning” to Keith Hansen, president of the South Dakota State Medical Association. Vaccinations are “one of the most important developments in health” to keep people and communities healthy, he said. 
As a reproductive endocrinology and infertility specialist, he is especially concerned with how vaccine-preventable diseases can affect pregnant women and newborn children. 
“It’s really sad when someone isn’t vaccinated and then they come into the hospital because they caught a vaccine-preventable disease,” Hansen said. “Now they have some bad outcome that could have been prevented.”
The state Health Department conducted the survey to better understand vaccination behaviors, decision-making and awareness of the vaccine schedule. A U.S. Department of Health and Human Services grant funded the survey.
COVID pandemic influences some vaccine behavior
More than a quarter of survey respondents said the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted their views on vaccines. Those respondents also had lower vaccination rates for the flu and COVID, at 34% and 4%, respectively.

Among all survey respondents, 96% reported ever being vaccinated. About 98% of respondents with children reported that their child had received at least one vaccination.
About 96% of respondents said they get at least “some” vaccines recommended by their doctor, and nearly 93% of respondents said they follow the routine or a delayed vaccination schedule for their child.
Carmen Toft, director for South Dakota Families for Vaccines and board vice president of Immunize South Dakota, said the state should “celebrate” those positive statistics.
The goal, Toft said, is to reach vaccination rates above 95% to reach herd immunity, which is when the prevention of infectious diseases becomes most effective.
Tdap vaccinations remain high
While most vaccination rates in the survey are lower than Hansen or Toft prefer, up-to-date Tdap vaccination rates were highest among respondents at 78%. The vaccine protects against infections caused by diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough.
Among respondents who said their vaccination views were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, 75.5% of adult respondents were up to date on their Tdap vaccination.
That could be because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends adults get the Tdap booster every 10 years for adults, Toft said, rather than yearly like the flu. If vaccine hesitancy rises, Tdap vaccination rates could be impacted more slowly than more regularly recommended vaccines.
Hansen added that Tdap vaccinations are sometimes administered in response to injuries, such as cuts, to prevent tetanus. Also known as lockjaw, tetanus causes muscle contractions and can be life-threatening.
Conflicting information could lead to more vaccine hesitancy
The most common reasons respondents gave for not receiving vaccinations included hearing contradictory information — from doctors, social media, news outlets, government agencies and others — and believing a vaccine isn’t safe or isn’t needed.
Concern about vaccine safety was the most common reason respondents gave for choosing not to vaccinate a child, followed by the belief that it wasn’t needed and the prevalence of conflicting information about vaccines.

Toft said fast-spreading misinformation on social media is influencing public opinion. So is U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s introduction of “fringe ideas” to inform policy changes, she said.
“It’s moved off of Facebook feeds and onto ‘CBS Mornings’,” Toft said, adding “the decisions seem more and more politicized, and that’ll only lead to more confusion.”
A CDC vaccine committee charged with setting national guidelines around vaccine policy voted on Friday to eliminate a 34-year-old recommendation that all newborn babies receive a hepatitis B vaccine. There was a 99% drop in serious infections among children between 1990 and 2019, which is attributed to the universal vaccination policy. Recommendations for adults and unvaccinated older children will remain unchanged.
CDC vaccine committee overturns decades-old hepatitis B recommendation for newborns

The new recommendation mirrors COVID-19 guidelines changed by the same committee in September. The change at that time caused widespread confusion about the vaccine’s accessibility and if insurance companies would cover it.
“I think it’ll be a while before we see the long-lasting implications of some of these decisions they’re making,” Toft said of the committee’s decisions.
The recommendations play a key role in determining which vaccines insurance companies are willing to cover and how accessible those immunizations are to the public.
South Dakota’s survey results indicate that most people place their trust in local professionals rather than national entities: 84% of respondents said their preferred source of health information is their doctor or health professional. About 95% said they “somewhat” or “to a great extent” trust their doctor or health professional with vaccine information — more than pharmacists, the state Department of Health, or the CDC. Social media and news outlets were the lowest trusted sources among respondents.
Hansen hopes health professionals take note and choose to broach immunization discussions more often with patients. Toft agreed that health professionals are the best point of contact for vaccine education.
“When we talk to vaccine-hesitant parents, we’re like, ‘Yes, ask questions. I’d love to help you. I’d love to connect you with a provider who can answer your questions,’” Toft said. “We want you to have access to information to make the best decision for you and your family.”

This story was originally published by Canary Media.
Big companies have spent years pushing Georgia to let them find and pay for new clean energy to add to the grid, in the hopes that they could then get data centers and other power-hungry facilities online faster.


Now, that concept is tantalizingly close to becoming a reality, with regulators, utility Georgia Power, and others hammering out the details of a program that could be finalized sometime next year. If approved, the framework could not only benefit companies but also reduce the need for a massive buildout of gas-fired plants that Georgia Power is planning to satiate the artificial intelligence boom.
Today, utilities are responsible for bringing the vast majority of new power projects online in the state. But over the past two years, the Clean Energy Buyers Association has negotiated to secure a commitment from Georgia Power that ​“will, for the first time, allow commercial and industrial customers to bring clean energy projects to the utility’s system,” said Katie Southworth, the deputy director for market and policy innovation in the South and Southeast at the trade group, which includes major hyperscalers like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft.


The terms of the commitment were first sketched out in a letter agreement between Georgia Power and CEBA last year and then codified in a July settlement agreement between the utility, staff at the Georgia Public Service Commission, and other stakeholders that cemented the utility’s long-term integrated resource plan.


The ​“customer-identified resource” (CIR) option will allow hyperscalers and other big commercial and industrial customers to secure gigawatts of solar, batteries, and other energy resources on their own, not just through the utility.


Letting data centers procure their own energy resources could solve a lot of problems for utilities — like the risk of sticking their customers with the cost of building power plants that may be unneeded if the AI boom goes bust. That’s a real concern for Georgia Power, which plans to spend more than $15 billion to build 10 gigawatts of new gas plants and batteries by 2031. This move could dramatically increase customers’ bills and is almost entirely motivated by gigantic — yet highly uncertain — projections of how much energy that data centers will need.


The tech giants behind most of those data centers could also benefit from being able to track down their own clean energy. The carbon-free resources would not only help in meeting hyperscalers’ aggressive climate targets; they are also likely to be cheaper and faster to build than gas plants, which face yearslong backlogs and rising costs.


The CIR option isn’t a done deal yet. Once Georgia Power, the Public Service Commission, and others work out how the program will function, the utility will file a final version in a separate docket next year.


And the plan put forth by Georgia Power this summer lacks some key features that data center companies want. A big point of contention is that it doesn’t credit the solar and batteries that customers procure as a way to meet future peaks in power demand — the same peaks Georgia Power uses to justify its gas-plant buildout.


But as it stands, CEBA sees ​“the approved CIR framework as a meaningful step toward the ​‘bring-your-own clean energy’ model,” Southworth said — a model that goes by the catchy acronym BYONCE in clean-energy social media circles.


 Opening up the playing field for clean energy

The CIR option is technically an addition to Georgia Power’s existing Clean and Renewable Energy Subscription (CARES) program, which requires the utility to secure up to 4 gigawatts of new renewable resources by 2035. CARES is a more standard ​“green tariff” program that leaves the utility in control of contracting for resources and making them available to customers under set terms, Southworth explained.


Under the CIR option, by contrast, large customers will be able to seek out their own projects directly with a developer and the utility. Georgia Power will analyze the projects and subject them to tests to establish whether they are cost-effective. Once projects are approved by Georgia Power, built, and online, customers can take credit for the power generated, both on their energy bills and in the form of renewable energy certificates. Georgia Power’s current plan allows the procurement of up to 3 gigawatts of customer-identified resources through 2035.


Letting big companies contract their own clean power is far from a new idea. Since 2014, corporate clean-energy procurements have surpassed 100 gigawatts in the United States, equal to 41% of all clean energy added to the nation’s grid over that time, according to CEBA. Tech giants have made up the lion’s share of that growth and have continued to add more capacity in 2025, despite the headwinds created by the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress.


But most of that investment has happened in parts of the country that operate under competitive energy markets, in which independent developers can build power plants and solar, wind, and battery farms. The Southeast lacks these markets, leaving large, vertically integrated utilities like Georgia Power in control of what gets built. Perhaps not coincidentally, Southeast utilities also have some of the country’s biggest gas-plant expansion plans.


A lot of clean energy projects could use a boost from power-hungry companies. According to the latest data from the Southern Energy Renewable Association trade group, more than 20 gigawatts of solar, battery, and hybrid solar-battery projects are now seeking grid interconnection in Georgia.


“The idea that a large customer can buy down the cost of a clean energy resource to make sure it’s brought onto the grid to benefit them and everybody else, because that’s of value to them — that’s theoretically a great concept,” said Jennifer Whitfield, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, a nonprofit that’s pushing Georgia regulators to find cleaner, lower-cost alternatives to Georgia Power’s proposed gas-plant expansion. ​“We’re very supportive of the process because it has the potential to be a great asset to everyone else on the grid.”


Isabella Ariza, staff attorney at the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign, said CEBA deserves credit for working to secure this option for big customers in Georgia. In fact, she identified it as one of the rare bright spots offsetting a series of decisions from Georgia Power and the Public Service Commission that environmental and consumer advocates fear will raise energy costs and climate pollution.










“They’re proposing something that makes total sense and would help some companies be able to say ​‘We’re powering our stuff with 100% clean energy,’” Ariza said of the CIR option. That’s particularly important at a time when many hyperscalers are backing away from their clean energy targets in their hunt for power for AI data centers, she noted.


 The missing piece: capacity value

Despite those benefits, the CIR framework’s omissions are substantial enough that CEBA did not join stakeholders like Walmart, the Georgia Association of Manufacturers, and the Southern Renewable Energy Association trade groups in signing on to it.


CEBA wanted companies to be able to procure a full range of carbon-free generation resources — such as geothermal and small modular nuclear reactors — rather than just renewable energy and renewables paired with batteries. The trade group also sought a pathway for customers to bring projects forward on a rolling basis more quickly than the current settlement agreement would allow.


But one of the biggest issues CEBA has with the current CIR plan is that it ​“does not recognize the full capacity value of customer-funded clean, firm resources to the grid,” Southworth said. Capacity value is a measure of how power plants, batteries, and other resources meet peak power demands during the handful of hours per year that determine how much generation and grid infrastructure utilities need to build.


That’s a significant gap. If the resources that big customers secure under the CIR aren’t considered part of the solution to this challenge — if their capacity value isn’t factored in — they may not be able to reduce Georgia Power’s need for gigawatts of gas-fired power plants, which are the traditional utility backstop for ensuring adequate energy supplies.


This would be bad for Georgia Power customers at large, who would end up paying for more gas plants than are actually needed after the data centers driving up power demand secure their own resources instead. It could also saddle data centers and other big customers with growing capacity-related costs that their self-secured projects could otherwise help reduce.


“A well-designed CIR program that recognizes the capacity value of customer-funded clean resources is a win-win-win for large customers, Georgia Power, and all ratepayers,” Southworth said. ​“Participating customers pay the incremental cost of new clean, firm projects; the utility gets capacity it can count on; and nonparticipating customers benefit from a more diverse, less gas-dependent resource mix without taking on the full cost or fuel price risk of those projects.”


CEBA has ideas for how Georgia Power could financially compensate customers for the capacity value of the resources that they procure. The utility already calculates ​“avoided capacity values” for the renewable energy, battery, and fossil-fueled resources it brings to the table in its requests for proposals. Georgia Power could provide a capacity credit of similar value to subscribing customers for the projects they procure.


CEBA will ​“continue to work with the company and commission staff,” Southworth said. Her group sees Georgia Power’s long-term plan approved this summer ​“as establishing the floor, not the ceiling, for what CIR can become.”


A big shift at the Public Service Commission could lay the groundwork for a reassessment of the program. Last month, Georgia voters elected two Democratic challengers — health care consultant Alicia Johnson and clean-energy advocate Peter Hubbard — to replace Republican incumbents Tim Echols and Fitz Johnson.


The two new commissioners have both pledged to tackle high and rising electricity costs for Georgia Power residential customers. Across the country, utilities and regulators are striving to force data center developers to take on the costs they’re imposing on power grids, rather than foisting them on everyday utility customers.


“Capacity is still an open question” that the Public Service Commission can take up as it decides on the CIR option, said Whitfield of the Southern Environmental Law Center. ​“Georgia Power is certainly on record that they don’t prefer it to be accredited, which makes sense for them. They want to build more and profit more,” as a regulated utility that earns guaranteed profits on its capital investments. ​“But that is going to be very much a live issue.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/solar--1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-12-05 15:59:28.191722

The amendment’s birthright citizenship clause has been used to give citizenship to the children of immigrants in the country without legal authorization or on a temporary basis.While a schedule for arguments has not yet been released by the court, it’s likely the case would be heard sometime in early 2026.The Trump administration argued in its petition to the court that the amendment, which was adopted in 1868, was meant to apply to newly freed slaves. It was not meant to provide citizenship to the children of immigrants without legal status, Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote.“Long after the Clause’s adoption, the mistaken view that birth on U.S. territory confers citizenship on anyone subject to the regulatory reach of U.S. law became pervasive, with destructive consequences,” Sauer wrote in the September petition.The petition also sought Supreme Court review of a related challenge to the order by the states of Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon. Friday’s court order did not grant a hearing on that case.Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 20 seeking to redefine the birthright citizenship clause to exclude the children of immigrants in the country without legal authority or only temporarily. Democratic-led states and advocacy groups swiftly sued.Courts have largely blocked enforcement of the order, although the Supreme Court in June allowed it to go into effect in the states that had not sued to preserve the right.In a Friday afternoon statement, the American Civil Liberties Union, a leading civil rights group, noted that several federal judges had blocked enforcement and predicted the Supreme Court would preserve birthright citizenship.“No president can change the 14th Amendment’s fundamental promise of citizenship,” Cecillia Wang, ACLU’s national legal director, said. “For over 150 years, it has been the law and our national tradition that everyone born on U.S. soil is a citizen from birth. The federal courts have unanimously held that President Trump’s executive order is contrary to the Constitution, a Supreme Court decision from 1898, and a law enacted by Congress. We look forward to putting this issue to rest once and for all in the Supreme Court this term.”",,,,2025-12-05 14:57:45.618686

The first parcel is a 174-acre addition to the Copeland Bend Wildlife Area. The conservation groups’ acquisition connects multiple tracts of the existing public lands northeast of Nebraska City. 
The second parcel, also 174 acres, is a few miles southeast of the first site and connects portions of the M.U. Payne Wildlife Area along the Missouri River. The groups said the site will improve access to the northern end of the existing wildlife area. 
The acquisition of the sites was funded by Pheasants Forever and Quail Forever’s Build a Wildlife Area program. The program has led to permanent protections and publicly accessible land for more than 243,000 acres in 17 states since 1982, according to a news release from the nonprofit organizations.
The release said the newest parcels add habitat for the game birds in areas that are “heavily utilized” by Iowan and Nebraskan hunters. 
In 2024, hunters bagged an estimated 460,000 roosters, or male pheasants, and 27,500 quail in Iowa.
Quail Forever acquired another Iowa parcel in August that similarly connected several areas of public land, near Centerville, managed by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Iowa DNR.

(Photo by Caity Coyne/West Virginia Watch)Residents in Mingo County filed a federal lawsuit this week against the New York-based company working to build an ammonia plant, two natural gas power plants and a data center complex in their communities.
The lawsuit was filed on Dec. 3 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia on behalf of 10 Mingo County residents. 
Defendants named in the suit are TransGas Development Systems, the Huntington District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
Raleigh County-based attorney Stephen New is representing the plaintiffs in the case.
In their suit, the residents in the case allege that the proposed projects — both the ammonia plant and the power plants, which have received separate air quality permits from the state Department of Environmental Protection — could threaten local, endangered wildlife. They say that TransGas, the company behind these projects, has failed to undergo federal actions necessary to make the construction of the facilities legal.
Those actions, per the lawsuit, include consulting with the federal Fish and Wildlife Services on whether the proposed projects would affect protected species or habitats; receiving a permit under the Clean Water Act to affect local waterways; undergoing a review through the National Environmental Policy Act to create an environmental impact statement for the projects and receiving approval from FERC to construct pipelines that could be necessary to supply natural gas to the power facilities.
Unless the court acts to require these actions, the lawsuit reads, then TransGas will move forward in the project and potentially cause “the precise procedural and environmental harm” the named federal agencies are meant to prevent.
The projects by TransGas are collectively referred to as the Adams Fork Energy Project. One portion of the proposed project includes building the largest natural gas-fueled ammonia plant in the world. It would produce up to 2.1 million metric tons of ammonia per year, according to the company.
The West Virginia DEP Air Quality Board granted a permit to TransGas for that project last year. That permit was carried over from one previously granted to the company nearly 20 years ago for the construction of a plant that would convert coal into liquid fuel. That plant — also proposed for Mingo County — was never built.
At community meetings earlier this year, Mingo County resident Ernie Sammons — who is selling his property to TransGas for the proposed data center complex — told concerned residents that the proposed ammonia plant was no longer happening. But no other evidence has been provided by TransGas or anyone else to demonstrate that. As long as the permit is in place, the company can move forward with its plans.
Representatives for TransGas did not respond to requests for comments for this story.
The more recent portion of the proposed TransGas development would entail constructing two new methane- and diesel-burning natural gas power plants. Per the near-identical air quality applications submitted to the DEP, the plants would operate as “microgrids,” powering two new data centers: one at the Twisted Gun Golf Course in Wharncliffe and another near the Mingo-Logan county line at the Harless Industrial Park, in Holden.
The two natural gas plants would each house 117 engines powered by methane, with 114 of those running full-time. If no gas is available, the engines would run on diesel that is stored in 40 tanks on each site. 
Annually, per the applications, each facility would have the potential to emit up to 206 tons of carbon monoxide, 194 tons of nitrogen oxides, 118 tons of volatile organic compounds and 188 tons of fine particulate matter, or soot. 
These kinds of emissions are known to negatively affect air quality in surrounding areas and contribute to climate change. People at risk of developing respiratory problems — including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, black lung or other illnesses — are particularly vulnerable to negative health impacts from these emissions.
Residents in Mingo and Logan County have been outspoken against the proposed projects. They’ve shared concerns how the new power plants could impact their air quality, their health and their water, as well as their overall quality of life. Their concerns have been met with few answers from either the company or state regulators.
Despite the concerns and continued public pushback, the state DEP granted air quality permits for both power plants in October.

In the 32 years she’s owned and operated her North Broad Street business “Ricard’s Inc.,” it’s taken plenty of sweat and toil to keep the lights on. “I’ve survived hurricanes, the pandemic, the buyout of a partner, all of these things, and I’ve never […]","Kim Krivjanick, owner of Ricard’s, at her supply store on Broad Street in New Orleans, Dec. 2, 2025. (Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)NEW ORLEANS — Kim Krivjanick is not afraid of hard work.
In the 32 years she’s owned and operated her North Broad Street business “Ricard’s Inc.,” it’s taken plenty of sweat and toil to keep the lights on.
“I’ve survived hurricanes, the pandemic, the buyout of a partner, all of these things, and I’ve never been in a situation like this,” Krivjanick said.
But Krivjanick said she has recently started having trouble finding electricians, housekeepers, delivery drivers all essential to her work managing short-term rentals and selling restaurant, catering and janitorial products. People are not showing up or just outright quitting, she said, and she attributes this to workers being afraid that federal immigration agents will target people who have brown skin — even creole women, like her.
She’s not alone.
Broad Street traverses several of the city’s neighborhoods from Broadmoor to the 7th Ward. Long an epicenter of Black-owned businesses, Broad Street is now also a commercial hub for the city’s Latino community. The street and adjacent ones are peppered with a wide variety of businesses — hair salons, grocery stores, restaurants, cafes, auto repair shops, veterinarians and fast food stores. On the strip of Broad between Canal and Tulane, businesses such as Morenita Plus, Ideal Market and Botanica San Simon are frequented by Latino customers. On a normal weekday, music pulses from popular store fronts and people line up at Taqueria El Poblano for lunch.

But now, as the Department of Homeland Security launches Operation Catahoula Crunch, many in the Broad Street business community who spoke with Verite News, say they feel increasingly placed in a quandary: wanting to keep their businesses operating as usual but worried that customers and workers could feel at-risk of being swept up in the operation, which has a reported goal of arresting 5,000 people. They’re saying that the fear that’s gripped residents of New Orleans is negatively impacting business. Some business owners are taking small steps to help where they can.
Others expressed fear of speaking out and drawing the unwanted gaze of immigration agents. Many say that federal law enforcement using aggressive tactics to round up people they see as part of their community is not normal, desired or helpful for business.
“This is not America. This is not who we are,” Krivjanick said. “We don’t have masked men running up to us, grabbing us, throwing us into unidentified cars, you know or to beat us up on the street.”
DHS says the masks worn by many immigration agents protect them from people learning details about them and their families.
Krivjanick said the tactic makes people afraid of the government.
On top of the worker shortage, short-term renters are calling, Krivjanick said, and asking if the U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement is still going to be roaming the streets around the New Year’s holiday or Mardi Gras. Those are times when Krivjanick typically expects her rentals to fill up. She doesn’t know what to say, because she doesn’t know herself.
In her experience, people come to New Orleans to enjoy themselves. Potential renters Krivjanick said, who’ve seen scenes from other Border Patrol operations across the country play out don’t think a confrontation with masked agents compliments the partying, drinking, dining and dancing people anticipate when planning a trip to New Orleans. Three potential tenants canceled on her earlier this week, citing ICE as a reason for cancelling, she said.
In response to Verite News questions about fears of people being targeted for their skin color, DHS denied that it engages in racial and ethnic profiling, calling allegations that it does so disgusting, reckless and false.

Allowing workers to stay home is one step some businesses said they’re taking to help alleviate the anxiety they’re hearing in light of stories of Border Patrol agents profiling and detaining people.

“I can’t ask anybody to come to work right now,” said Krivjanick, choking on some of her words, “I simply can’t, because I feel if I made pressure and said, ‘Hey, you know, if you come in, I’ll pay you a little extra,’ if I do that and something happens to the family, yeah, I wouldn’t be able to live with myself.”
Tommy LeBlanc, co-owner of HEY Coffee Co., based off of North Broad Street, also said he didn’t want to encourage people to come out to an upcoming fundraiser if they didn’t feel safe. On Wednesday, he and his friend, José Chris Blanco, co-owner of Waska, a pop-up store that specializes in cooking arepas, were hosting an event at LeBlanc’s Broadmoor location.
A portion of the proceeds were set to go to a local nonprofit that serves some of the area’s Hispanic community, Puentes New Orleans. Blanco cooked food and said 70% of the profits from Waska would go to Puentes. LeBlanc said 20% of the day’s sales at his other coffee shop in Broadmoor would go to Puentes. LeBlanc’s shop also sells a coffee blend, café con sueños, that launched this summer and whose proceeds go to Puentes NOLA’s mission.
“We’re just trying to take the time to show our neighbors, our Latino neighbors, that they are cherished and welcome, as far as we’re concerned,” LeBlanc said.

Puentes New Orleans normally works to promote better outcomes in education, career development and cultural integration. But they’ve recently had to pivot into crisis mode, to address the fear and panic setting in among families as uncertainty around the immigration enforcement operation looms, according to the non-profit’s executive director, Angela Ramirez.
For Blanco, whose business is mobile and who has sometimes worked on Broad Street, spending a day cooking arepas so that 70% of the proceeds could go to Puentes New Orleans was a “no-brainer.”
“I love what they do, what they stand for,” Blanco said.
Blanco was born in Colombia, grew up in Miami, worked as a chef in Vermont, and started his pop-up around the end of 2022, he said. For the first time since coming to the country, Blanco is carrying around his green card with him, which he called “pretty wild.”
“I’ve never had to walk around with my residence card, and even that … doesn’t give me 100% protection against what ICE is doing,” he said.
As the Trump administration has deployed surges of immigration agents to cities around the country, they have been accused of detaining people based on the way they look, the language they speak or their place of work. American citizens have been detained in the operations, as well.
He also said he knows people who are not leaving their homes.
“Is this, like, Nazi Germany? Like, what’s going on?” Blanco asked. “People are hiding because they don’t want to go out because they’re afraid of being abducted.”
Blanco’s business partner, Marcella Garcia, said she sees the residents of New Orleans as a fearless people, and that she hopes that those who can will help protect the people who are the most vulnerable to immigration enforcement actions by raising awareness of what agents are doing.
Several Broad Street business owners would only speak anonymously for fear of being targeted by federal immigration agents.
One said he’s losing money in sales daily because some of his customers are afraid to come out to shop, and some of his employees are afraid to come to work. He said they’re scared to be targeted even driving around. In places right outside of the city, a routine traffic stop could lead to immigration detention and deportation.

Malaysia Walker, who’s a longtime seamstress and works as a general manager at Broadway Bound Costume Supplies, was sewing the base for a Mardi Gras Indian suit when she spoke with Verite News.
Walker said that as far as she can tell, her business has not been impacted by the operation, but she was personally not fond of the idea of expanded law enforcement in the streets.
“I do feel it’s an extreme way to handle the situation, and I think it’s going to bring more harm than good to the city,” Walker said.
On Tuesday afternoon at Coffee Science on South Broad Street, plastic whistles sat in a container near the sales register, as business was winding down for the day.
Co-owner Leah Vautrot said that the whistles are there for community members to use as a tool to draw attention to immigration agents to alert others of their presence and help prevent people from being isolated or quietly detained. She said that, as a community hub committed to social justice, the business felt a responsibility to stand up for its neighbors.
“Disappearing our neighbors off the street should never be normalized. That’s why we’re doing what we can, however small, to create resources that help our customers recognize when ICE is present, alert others, and draw a crowd,” said Vautrot.
Vautrot said that what she’s witnessing feels like something out of 1933 Germany, when Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany, and his Nazi party completed its takeover of the country’s government.
She also highlighted the important role that immigrants, foreign farms and global exchange play in the main product they sell — coffee — and she said she’s opposed to the idea of disrupting the livelihood of the families that enable their business “from origin to cup.”
“If we don’t stand up for dignity and due process, we’re complicit in a system that erases people,” Vautrot said. “And people are not disposable.”

(Photo by Lauren Sausser/KFF Health News)COLUMBIA — More than 280 people are in quarantine for measles after a significant influx in cases following the Thanksgiving holiday, the state health department said Friday.
An Upstate outbreak reached 84 cases as of Friday, up 22 from last week, according to the department. That includes cases linked to eight schools, whose students account for about 200 of the people in quarantine.

“It’s very unfortunate that we’re seeing this ballooning of cases now,” Bell said. “Though we anticipated a possible increase in cases after Thanksgiving, this is alarming.”
Quarantining students who don’t develop symptoms can return to school between Thursday and Dec. 15, depending on when their quarantine began, according to the health department. But health officials are worried about cases continuing to increase as people travel for Christmas and other winter holidays.
Also of concern is the possibility that people infected with the highly contagious disease may break quarantine and further spread the disease, Bell said.
Most of the people infected developed symptoms after a known exposure to another case, and most people are following the health department’s recommendations about staying home during the virus’ 21-day incubation period.
“We want to make sure people are fully aware of the risk that they pose to the community if they do not stay in quarantine,” Bell said.
Without saying how many, she added that some people have broken their quarantine, risking community transmission, she said. Eight reported cases so far came from an exposure at Way of Truth Church in Inman, one example of how much the disease can spread.
The state will not require people to stay home or get vaccinated, Gov. Henry McMaster told reporters this week. However, he also warned that measles can be deadly in certain cases.
“We don’t want to force or have a mandate, but we need people to be very careful, because it is a dangerous disease,” McMaster said.
Of the 84 people infected as part of the outbreak, 77 were unvaccinated, according to the health department. Another three had received one dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, one was fully vaccinated, and three have unknown vaccination statuses.
Vaccination is the best way of preventing measles infections, according to the department.
Getting two doses of the vaccine, as most people do during childhood, is about 97% effective in protecting against measles, the agency has said.
Vaccine rates in this South Carolina county lagged for years. Then measles struck.

The vaccine also works within three days of exposure. Adults who are unvaccinated or aren’t sure whether they have received both doses of the vaccine can get their shots at a public health department clinic, doctor’s office or pharmacy.
Symptoms can begin between one and three weeks after exposure, usually starting with a cough, runny nose, red, watery eyes, and a fever.
Within several days, infected people develop a red, blotchy rash that typically starts on the face before spreading to the rest of the body.
Measles can cause severe illness, potentially leading to pneumonia or even death, especially in young children.
The Department of Public Health doesn’t track the outcomes of infections, but it has not received any reports of severe complications, Bell said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MobileHealthUnit-measles-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-05 14:57:45.618686

(Image provided)This story originally ran in The New Bedford Light.
The federal agency regulating offshore wind development asked a federal judge on Tuesday to allow it to reconsider a key approval — one the same agency granted just last year — for New England Wind 1, a project planned off the Massachusetts coast.
If the federal government’s request is granted, it would be a blow to the project, which plans to invest in New Bedford and use the city for long-term project operations. If the approval stands, the project could move toward construction once it secures a power purchase agreement with the commonwealth.
This is at least the third time the administration has sought a remand of an offshore wind project approval, the others being for SouthCoast Wind and Maryland’s US Wind. The permits give major infrastructure projects the certainty to secure financing and move forward with construction.
The filing comes more than two months after the federal government signaled it would take such action against this project. The remand request was expected sooner, but the weekslong government shutdown pushed the deadline.
The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management filed the motion as part of a lawsuit brought in May by offshore wind opposition group ACK for Whales and other parties, including the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head Aquinnah, against BOEM and the Interior Department’s approval of New England Wind 1.
This latest move illustrates how President Donald Trump’s administration is using lawsuits brought by municipalities and activist groups as a tool to crack down on the industry. Of the more than 20 actions and orders issued since January, one directed federal attorneys to review pending litigation against projects and consider a remand of permits that the litigation contests.
BOEM Principal Deputy Director Matthew Giacona in a declaration signed Monday cited several of those orders, including Trump’s day-one wind memo.
The Light contacted Avangrid, the company developing the project, for comment Tuesday afternoon.
New England Wind 1 would abut Avangrid’s other project, Vineyard Wind, which sits south of Martha’s Vineyard and is wrapping up construction now.
The Construction and Operations Plan (COP), which BOEM could ultimately decide to revoke or approve with new conditions, is the final stamp of approval from the federal government for a project to build on the Outer Continental Shelf. It is the culmination of years of review that considers expert analysis and input from stakeholders and the public.
Giacona stated the COP approval “may have failed to account for all the impacts” of the project, and that federal reviews “may have also understated impacts.”
He and the federal government did not get into specifics, and cited general concerns such as interference with other marine activities (like commercial fishing and shipping) and “national security.” (The government cited national security concerns in its halting of Revolution Wind; a court later struck down that stop-work order.)
New England Wind 1 plans to construct the project out of Salem (a terminal yet to be built that, in August, lost $34 million in federal funding), but house its long-term operations and maintenance hub in New Bedford.
The project, along with SouthCoast Wind, issued letters of intent to use the under-construction New Bedford Foss Marine Terminal for operations and maintenance work, which is meant to last as long as the turbines operate — or about three decades.
Per a 2024 filing from Avangrid, the project planned to start construction in the second quarter of 2026, at the earliest.
New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell previously said if the project doesn’t move forward, it would eliminate at least 100 future jobs in the city. He added that estimate doesn’t include indirect jobs created, and other economic benefits to city businesses, including restaurants, hotels and shoreside operations.
Contingent on the project moving forward, the Danish company, Liftra, plans to establish a crane manufacturing facility in New Bedford.

Mitchell on Tuesday said he was disappointed, but not surprised: “Whether this particular project goes forward is becoming more in doubt by the day.”
The remand request further complicates negotiations for a power purchase agreement between the commonwealth and New England Wind. The agreements have been delayed several times, in large part due to federal actions. The deadline is now the end of this month.
The request for a remand will be decided by a federal judge. A different federal judge last month allowed the federal government’s remand request for SouthCoast Wind.
The government cited this in its argument to the court, stating its reasoning for New England Wind is the same, and that the court should reach the same conclusion and grant the remand request.
Meanwhile, several states, including Massachusetts, are waiting for a federal judge to rule on whether Trump’s day-one wind memo, the document underlying the administration’s actions against projects, is unlawful. It’s unclear when that decision will come, and what scope of relief it could provide to the states challenged by a president bent on stopping the industry.
Just as the federal government has not given a timeline for the review ordered by Trump’s memo, it has not given a timeline for the remand review. It said the projected timeline is “currently uncertain,” and asked the court to not impose a deadline by which it must make a determination on the 2024 approval.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)The Kentucky Lantern is suing the University of Kentucky after it refused to release records related to a $375,000 settlement with a faculty leader who had challenged the administration’s decision to disband the University Senate.
The Lantern filed the lawsuit on Nov. 26 after Attorney General Russell Coleman’s office rejected the nonprofit news outlet’s appeal of UK’s decision. Under Kentucky’s open records law, parties can appeal the attorney general’s decisions in a local circuit court. 
Earlier this year, the Lantern sought records of email exchanges that preceded the university signing a $375,000 separation agreement with DeShana Collett, who had been a tenured professor in physician assistant studies. A provision in the agreement between UK and Collett required her to withdraw her request for emails among UK administrators that mentioned her. The Office of the Attorney General (OAG) had earlier ruled that under state law Collett was entitled to the records.

Collett played a prominent role last year in opposing a change to UK’s internal governance and presided over a vote of no confidence in UK President Eli Capilouto. After the vote, Collett warned faculty that the administration was taking steps that she thought could lead to retaliation against the president’s critics. Collett entered the separation agreement in June 2025. 
Filed in Fayette Circuit Court, the Lantern’s complaint says that while “the University’s denial and the OAG’s rubber-stamping of the denial based on a dangerous interpretation of the preliminary records exemption should concern” Kentuckians, the “bigger picture is the University’s attempt to buy its way out of the Open Records Act.” 
“This Case calls upon Kentucky’s courts to yet again tell its largest state university that the Open Records Act means what it says: disclosure is in the public interest, and the law’s exemptions must be narrowly construed,” the complaint says. 
The lawsuit has been assigned to Fayette Circuit Judge Lucy Ferguson VanMeter.
Michael Abate, who is representing the Lantern along with Jeremy Lister-Perlman, said in a statement that the case is important “for anyone that cares about transparency or the governance of the state’s flagship university.”
“UK paid almost $400,000 to a professor that had won an open records appeal against it and made the payment contingent on her dropping her request for records. The public has a right to know what the University was willing to pay so dearly to hide,” Abate said. 
“On top of that, the Attorney General’s decision attempts to re-write the narrow exemption for ‘preliminary’ records to include virtually any email or other ‘non-final’ document possessed by an agency,” he continued.” That interpretation, if accepted, would gut the Open Records Act and render most of the documents now accessible to the public off-limits.” 
UK spokesman Jay Blanton defended UK’s denial of the records and pointed to the attorney general’s decision in favor of the university. 
“The University believes the Attorney General’s decision is correct,” Blanton said in an email Friday. “Indeed, the Attorney General’s decision is fully consistent with all Attorney General’s decisions since 2021.”
The Lantern’s records request mirrored a request for records from Collett that asked for emails with her name sent by Eric Monday, UK’s executive vice president for finance and administration and co-executive vice president for health affairs, between July 1, 2023 and June 30, 2024. UK denied the request in early September. 
That time frame spans campus discussions around shared governance at UK. In April 2024, the UK Board of Trustees voted 19-1 to change the University Senate to a faculty senate — a move that faculty members warned would limit their decision-making power over academic decisions.
The aftermath of the no-confidence vote was the subject of an article in The Chronicle of Higher Education that reported Collett had written to faculty members warning of acts of retaliation by the UK administration after the vote. 
In an Aug. 20, 2024, email, Collett forwarded a message that she had shared with faculty members to Lisa Tannock, a former associate provost for faculty advancement, saying that provost office employees were assuming control of the University Senate’s voting system, a PollEverywhere account, which had access to all Senate-recorded votes.
Collett added in her email to Tannock that the University Senate did not keep records of individual members’ votes and was not required to. 
Tannock said in a response that “this matter is under serious investigation with the possibility of becoming a criminal investigation.” Collett’s attorney told the Lantern that UK’s general counsel later said there was no investigation. Tannock no longer works at the university.
Collett’s attorney, Joe Childers, told the Lantern that she decided to leave the university because she was “not comfortable in the environment that she was subjected to” after the controversy over the governance change.
In response to Collett’s open records request, the attorney general’s office issued an opinion partially in her favor in February.
However in the Lantern’s appeal, the attorney general’s office sided with UK, arguing that state law exempts public agencies from disclosing “preliminary” documents in response to open records requests. 
“Describing the contents of emails created during its ‘decision-making process,’ the University explains that the emails contain ‘(1) early drafts of documents; (2) communications between various university officials; and (3) communications between the University’s attorneys and other university officials, including requests for advice and providing information necessary for the University attorneys to formulate legal advice,” the attorney general opinion says. 
In recent years, UK has gone to court with Kentucky news outlets over denied open records requests, including the student-run newspaper, the Kentucky Kernel.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0798-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-05 14:57:45.618686
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-05 19:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Yale hints at layoffs to help pay for endowment tax hike,Michayla Savitt | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/05/yale-endowment-tax-layoffs/,The university estimates Trump administration's new tax will amount to $300 million per year beginning in July 2026.,"Yale University this week informed faculty and staff there may need to be layoffs down the line, as the school continues tackling budget challenges amid federal actions. The issue stems from a major increase to university endowment taxes, enacted under President Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans’ “One Big Beautiful Bill”.
The university estimates it will pay the federal government $300 million per year beginning in July 2026. The Trump administration raised the endowment tax from 1.4% up to 8% on investment gains under the federal policy signed into law in July, as The Yale Daily News reported. Yale must pay the maximum tax, with its endowment valued at over $44 billion dollars.
Cost-cutting measures such as retirement incentives and a three-month hiring freeze, among other moves have already been in the works at Yale. The budget update from the Office of the Provost Wednesday said that’s helped but, “cannot make up for the significant long-term reduction in funds that support students, faculty, and staff.”
This fall the university also requested three-year budget plans from each school and unit, to tackle the rest of the funding gaps. In the update to faculty and staff on Wednesday, Provost Scott Strobel said more staff reductions may also be needed.
“Nearly two-thirds of the university’s expenses relate to compensation and benefits,” Strobel said in the written announcement. “Unfortunately, this means several units may need to meet their budget targets by reducing their workforce. We are hopeful that most reductions can be accomplished by eliminating open positions and through regular turnover and retirement incentives.”
Daniel Martinez HoSang is on the executive committee of the Yale chapter of American Association of University Professors (AAUP). He said people understand these are all difficult budget choices, but that more faculty, students and staff deserve a say.
“I think there is a growing concern among faculty at Yale and other colleges and universities that the problem is not a recognition about the crisis we’re likely to face, but it’s the very, very uneven ways that faculty, students, staff and others are allowed to participate in decisions about what the impact and consequences of these budget reductions will be,” said Martinez HoSang, a professor of American studies and political science.
He said there need to be better ways for people to weigh in.
“Other than a small number of faculty who might have appointments in these committees, many faculty feel kind of in the dark about these processes,” Martinez HoSang added.
Yale’s budget challenges also extend beyond the university, since the school gives tens of millions of dollars in annual funding to the city of New Haven. As Yale Daily news reported, the city of New Haven and Yale are in negotiations about financial contributions in fiscal year 2027, which is slated to decrease by $8 million.

Michelle Lujan Grisham's office announced Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department Secretary Melanie Kenderdine resigned on Dec. 5, 2025. (Courtesy photo)Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Friday morning announced that New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department Secretary Melanie Kenderdine is resigning “for personal reasons,” effective immediately.
Kenderdine has held the position since May of 2024. At the time, Lujan Grisham praised Kenderine’s reputation as “a strategic thinker in the realm of energy policy” and said she expected Kenderdine to play a large role in “helping New Mexico shape our clean-energy future.”
Source NM reached Kenderdine briefly on Friday morning, who said her husband was in poor health. In an email to EMNRD staff, she wrote that her resignation would be effective on Jan. 5, but that Friday would be her last day in the office.
“I’ve enjoyed my time leading EMNRD and appreciate the opportunity the governor has given me. I must, however, attend to serious personal matters — my husband’s health needs — that require levels of attention I cannot give while working full time,” she wrote.
In a May statement, Kenderdine said she was “honored” to join the governor’s administration and wanted to see New Mexico emerge as “a national leader in the country’s journey to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.”
Kenderdine, an alumna of Albuquerque’s Manzano High School and the University of New Mexico, was co-founder and executive vice president of Energy Futures Initiative, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit focused on transitioning to renewable energy. In November, the national Women’s Council on Energy and the Environment named her the “2025 Woman of the Year” for her “long history of mentoring and supporting women in the field of energy.”
Kenderdine previously served in the U.S. Department of Energy, where she oversaw a 26-country initiative to support clean energy research and shaped the Strategic Petroleum Reserve oil exchange, under Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.
“Melanie brought national energy expertise to New Mexico, and I’m grateful for her contributions at EMNRD,” Lujan Grisham said.
Deputy Cabinet Secretary Erin Taylor will serve as acting cabinet secretary, according to a news release.
Taylor has been deputy cabinet secretary since April and previously held leadership roles with EMNRD’s Energy Conservation and Management Division, as well as its Mining and Minerals Division. Before that, she worked for the U.S. Department of Energy and oversaw programs that offered technical assistance for energy programs in every U.S. state and territory.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/kenderdinehorizontal-1024x472.png,,,2025-12-05 13:58:30.203850

Matt Pierce, left, speaks against the Republican congressional redistricting proposal during Indiana House debate on Friday, Dec. 5, 2025. (Photo by Tom Davies/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana House Republicans voted Friday to go along with President Donald Trump’s demand for redrawing the state’s congressional maps.
The House action sends the congressional redistricting issue to the state Senate, where its Republican leader has said for months that too few senators are in support for it to pass. 
House members voted 57-41 in favor of the new maps crafted to produce a 9-0 Republican delegation by carving up the districts currently held by Democratic Reps. André Carson in Indianapolis and Frank Mrvan in the area along Lake Michigan near Chicago.
Twelve Republicans joined Democrats in opposing the bill.
Democratic lawmakers denounced the proposed redistricting as a racial gerrymander for dividing Carson’s 7th District — the state’s most urban and racially diverse — among four new districts. Those extend far into rural heavily Republican counties, with two of the proposed districts stretching to the Ohio River and another nearly reaching Lake Michigan.
Republican Rep. Ben Smaltz, author of the redistricting plan in House Bill 1032, maintains the new districts were drawn “purely for political performance” of GOP candidates.
Attention will now turn to the state Senate, which is scheduled to take up the proposed maps beginning Monday.
Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray has repeatedly declared too few senators are in support for redistricting to pass. But under political threats from Trump and Gov. Mike Braun, Bray announced two days before Thanksgiving that senators would make a Statehouse return to “make a final decision on any redistricting proposal sent from the House.”
Trump started the national redistricting fight by pushing Texas Republicans to redraw its congressional map this summer. The pressure on Indiana Republicans has included trips in August and October by Vice President JD Vance to Indianapolis.

The current three-dose […]","Members of a key CDC advisory committee, known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, met in Atlanta on Dec. 4. Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderATLANTA — A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention committee voted to eliminate a recommendation that all newborn babies receive a vaccine against hepatitis B, ending a policy that has been in place since 1991 to protect Americans against an incurable liver disease that can lead to cirrhosis, cancer and liver failure.
The current three-dose series for hepatitis B includes one vaccine administered to infants within 24 hours of birth, and subsequent booster shots given one month and six months after the initial dose. There was a 99% drop in serious infections among children between 1990 and 2019, which is attributed to the universal vaccination policy.
The agency will leave in place a recommendation that babies born to mothers who test positive for hepatitis B receive a vaccine at birth. However, the new guidelines leave the decision in all other cases to “individual-based decision-making.” They also suggest that parents delay the first dose of the vaccine for at least two months after birth.
Friday’s decision comes after an 8-3 vote from a key CDC advisory committee, known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which is charged with setting national guidelines around which people should be vaccinated against a wide range of preventable diseases and when those vaccines should be administered. The recommendations play a key role in determining which vaccines insurance companies are willing to cover and how accessible those immunizations are to the public.
Retsef Levi, an ACIP member and professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, called the updated recommendation a “very positive change in policy.” arguing that blanket vaccine recommendations force newborns to serve as “a safety net for adults’ mistakes.”
But Dr. Cody Meissner, another member of the committee who also serves as a professor of pediatrics and medicine at Dartmouth College, argued that there was no scientific evidence to support the changes implemented by the panel.
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices member Robert Malone, a doctor and biochemist who once said he views the label of anti-vaxxer as “high praise,” was recently appointed to vice chair of the committee. Maya Homan/Georgia Recorder
“Thoughtful inquiry is always commendable,” he told the committee. “But that inquiry should not be confused with baseless skepticism, which is what I think we’re encountering here.”
The updated recommendation for the hepatitis B vaccine mirrors COVID-19 vaccine guidelines passed by the same panel in September, which places new emphasis on the risks of immunizations, though the CDC’s own data shows that the vaccines are safe and effective for most people. As with the new COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, the updated hepatitis B guidelines will not take effect until being officially signed off by the CDC director.
A second vote, which passed 6-4, encourages parents to discuss using serology testing, a type of blood test that measures antibodies to gauge how well a patient’s immune system has responded to a disease, before allowing their children to receive additional doses of the hepatitis B vaccine.
The changed recommendations will not prevent doctors from administering hepatitis B vaccines to newborns, but may impact which insurance companies are willing to pay for the immunizations. Children enrolled in Medicaid or the Vaccines for Children program, which provides free immunizations to children who are uninsured or underinsured, will continue to be eligible for hepatitis B vaccines at birth under the new recommendations, according to program liaisons.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_1921-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-05 13:58:30.203850

(Photo courtesy of Paige McAtee.)GREAT FALLS —On Nov. 13,  26 year-old Dakota Wheeler pulled into the parking lot of his workplace, Rainbow Senior Living in Great Falls, to drop a friend off for his upcoming shift. The two sat in the car for a few moments, watching videos on their phones, when a silver Dodge Charger pulled up beside them. 
“They came out immediately with guns,” said Brycen Pickering, Wheeler’s friend and coworker. “They kept yelling, ‘Get out of the car! Get out of the car!’” 
Pickering said Wheeler didn’t immediately move from the car, because he didn’t understand what was happening. 
“He kept asking, ‘What’s going on? What’s wrong?’ They were shouting something about warrants, but Dakota doesn’t have any warrants,” Pickering said.  
When asked if officers ever identified themselves, Pickering said they did not. The surveillance footage released by Rainbow Senior Living, shows agents approaching the vehicle with guns drawn.
“They had vests on that said ‘Police,’ that’s all. The car had no markings on it. It could have been anybody,” he said. “And it’s hard to concentrate on anything else when there’s pistols pointed at you and your good friend in the car.”
 A Home in Great Falls 

Wheeler has been in Montana since he was 15, brought to the United States on a visitor’s visa from England with his mother. The visa expired in the spring of 2016, and Wheeler has been trying ever since to finish the naturalization process. The main factor in the way, according to his 20-weeks pregnant fiance, Paige McAtee, has been money. 
“It’s at least $10,000 to get everything situated,” said McAtee. “People can’t even make it on minimum wage as it is. And with our 2-year-old daughter it was, pay bills, feed her, get diapers, and then try to save $10,000.” 
Wheeler has worked at Rainbow Senior Living for eight years. His mother, Lisa Anderson, is the Business Office Director, and remembers the cost when she first came to America. 
“When I went through my immigration, it was $6,500,” said Anderson, emphasizing the process took about three years to complete from start to finish. 
On the day Wheeler was taken, McAtee spent hours trying to find him, calling local police, the sheriff, the U.S. Marshals, and the county jail, none of whom had any record of him. It wasn’t until after she went with Wheeler’s mother and stepfather to the federal courthouse to speak to U.S. Marshals in person, that they were able to make some progress on his whereabouts.
“We got a call later finding out that he was taken by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement,” confirmed McAtee. 
The following day, after researching similar cases, his family located a petition for a restraining order against ICE and filed it that afternoon. Within two hours a federal judge granted it, ordering that Dakota could not be removed from Montana, must have access to counsel, and had to receive proper legal process.
  Federal Inmates as Revenue 

Wheeler is currently being held at the Cascade County Jail, along with 11 other immigration detainees at the time of publication of this article. Unlike other jails in the state, Cascade County has a unique federal contract that allows it to hold immigration detainees longer than 72 hours, a practice Cascade County Sheriff Jesse Slaughter emphasizes is not new. 
“When we signed our marshal contract back in 2021, ICE was delineated on that contract,” explained Slaughter. “And that meant that we would hold anybody that the marshals want us to hold, including ICE detainees, basically making us a federal detention facility.”
The Cascade County Jail is utilized by a variety of agencies, including Great Falls Police Department, the Sheriff’s office, Montana Highway Patrol, the Great Falls pre-release center and more. Each of these agencies holds a specific contract to house inmates at the jail. 
Depending on the contract, the agency will pay anywhere from the state rate of $82 per bed per day, to $115 per bed per day. 
The marshal contract covers all federal agencies, such as the FBI, DEA, IRS, even the EPA. The county recently signed a separate contract with Customs and Border Protection (CBP). 
In a July meeting of the Cascade County Commissioners, Slaughter explained the need for these federal contracts, spotlighting the jail’s reliance on outside contracts for 70% of its $14 million annual budget. Only $4 million of the jail’s budget is covered by taxpayers. 
In June of this year, Cascade County sent out what is called a “white paper” to open negotiations to have a standalone contract with ICE that would pay more in revenue compared to the current marshal contract that already requires Cascade County to hold immigration detainees. 
The county never heard back on the inquiry. 
“In a perfect world you’d levy $5, $6 million and you would kick all your feds out and you’d drop your population by about 140 (people) a day. You would be a fully funded community,” said Slaughter. “So I’d have a smaller operation that would be smaller in the long term to the taxpayer.” 
Until such a levy is passed, however, the county has few options.
“I struggle to think now’s the time to ask for it,” said Slaughter. “But hey, this is what we’re up against.”
In the meantime, Wheeler’s family awaits his Dec. 10 hearing. McAtee has started a GoFundMe page, where they’re raising funds not only for Wheeler’s current legal fees, but also for the $10,000 required to complete the naturalization process. 
“Today I had my 20-week ultrasound,” said McAtee. “Lisa came with me, but he’s been there for every single OB appointment. That was hard going there without him. Everything has changed because he’s always been there, he’s always been such a constant in our lives.” 
Their two year old daughter, Cleo, wants him home more than anyone.
“He’s always at work from six to two, so she’s good in the morning,” said McAtee. “And then dinner comes and nighttime is horrible because she just screams for him. She looks for him. And I don’t know what to tell her.”
“And with a baby on the way,” McAtee continued, “he’s super excited, he’s the one who picked out the name. He loves being a dad. We just want him home.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Wheeler-family-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-12-05 13:58:30.203850

Gabriel Olivier describes himself as an evangelical preacher and alleges the city of Brandon, a suburb in the Jackson Metro area, improperly restricted his religious and free-speech rights. 
But lower courts have ruled a legal quirk may prevent him from challenging the city’s regulations in court.

Olivier also frequently protested outside Mississippi’s only abortion clinic before it closed in 2022 after the U.S. Supreme Court, using a Mississippi case, overturned abortion rights nationwide. In 2021, Olivier stood outside the Brandon amphitheater, a popular concert venue, waving posters with pictures of aborted fetuses, passing out fliers and using a loudspeaker to get his message out.
Police in Brandon arrested Olivier and charged him with breaking a recently passed city ordinance that confined protests to a designated area near the theater. Olivier pleaded no contest to the charges, received a fine, and was placed on probation.
After Olivier pleaded no contest to the charges, he filed a civil lawsuit against the city seeking to overturn its protest ordinances. But a prior Supreme Court precedent, Heck v. Humphrey, places strict limits on when criminal defendants can file civil rights lawsuits that relate to their conviction. 
The city of Brandon in court papers argues its regulations aren’t about the content of the speech, but rather about limiting disturbances caused when he and his group yelled insults such as “Jezebel,” “nasty,” and “drunkards” at people passing by.
A district court and the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Olivier and sided with the city, but the Supreme Court will have the final say.

While the Virginia Freedom of Information Act presumes all government business is by default public and requires officials to justify why exceptions should be made, too many Virginia leaders in practice take the opposite stance, acting as if records are by default private and the public must prove they should be handled otherwise.
In this feature, we aim to highlight the frequency with which officials around Virginia are resisting public access to records on issues large and small — and note instances when the release of information under FOIA gave the public insight into how government bodies are operating.
  Locations of hundreds of Flock cameras in Hampton Roads revealed

In late November a federal judge in Norfolk released the location of about 600 Flock Safety security cameras in the region, the Virginian Pilot reported. The release comes after local cities and counties have rejected requests from media and activists for lists of camera locations. 
U.S. Magistrate Judge Lawrence Leonard ordered the regional list be unsealed as part of a pending federal lawsuit against Norfolk. It’s also not the first time a lawsuit has ensued in Virginia over murky access to the cameras. A Cardinal News reporter drove 300 miles through Southwest Virginia and submitted requests to see captured footage of their drive — ultimately taking localities to court over the matter.
Flock cameras are a form of what is known as an automated license plate reader; the technology has been used nationwide by law enforcement to assist with investigations. However, the technology has been scrutinized, including in Virginia, for potential law enforcement overreach and for privacy concerns. 
As the cameras proliferate across the commonwealth, state lawmakers passed a new law this year to regulate the technology by setting limits on data storage time frames and other guardrails, but it was heavily debated and nearly defeated along its journey to become law.
 Martinsville fulfills a FOIA, with heavy redactions

Cardinal News sought information on a misconduct investigation against Martinsville’s former city manager via a Freedom of Information Act request — but the document the city responded with was almost entirely redacted. 
Martinsville City Council was split in their votes on whether or not to release the investigation to the public earlier this year, following the completion of the probe led by law firm Sands Anderson. The heavily redacted documents are one of three versions of the report to circulate within city hall and to councilors.
 A less redacted version was given to councilors and that version was what Cardinal had requested, but the city’s FOIA officer instead gave the newsroom the version with much of the content edited out.
 Alexandria’s school board may create a website to boost transparency

Alexandria’s school board is considering creating its own website in order to boost transparency, ALX Now reported.
The site would include two posts per month at a minimum and up to 35 posts per month. Content would be topical explainers on key decisions made by the board, information under review by the board that is not confidential, along with board members’ statements as well as vote results and progress updates on matters the board is working on. 
“According to a draft proposal, Board Chair Michelle Rief would designate two board members to be co-editors to manage content, and that all content not republished from the Alexandria City Public Schools website would have to be approved by the school system’s attorney before publication,” ALX Now wrote.
The board would  review the website’s policy annually, if it comes to fruition.



The Mercury’s efforts to track FOIA and other transparency cases in Virginia are indebted to the work of the Virginia Coalition for Open Government, a nonprofit alliance dedicated to expanding access to government records, meetings and other state and local proceedings. 


 State senator’s FOIA shed more light on on former UVA president’s departure 

State senator Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, received a more than 200-page response to a Freedom of Information Act request he sent last month seeking more details about former University of VIrignia president Jim Ryan’s resignation. 
Deeds then gave the details to UVA student newspaper Cavalier Daily, which had also submitted FOIAs on the matter but had not received records. 
Among the details Deeds gleaned were community announcements surrounding Ryan’s resignation, letters from the Justice Department and previously unreleased records like text messages and emails between Board of Visitors members and Ryan’s initial resignation letter. 
Ryan’s departure from UVA made local, state and national headlines this year amid pressure from President Donald Trump’s administration, which has targeted public universities’ Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies this year.

“I’d like to thank Secretary Turner for taking the time to come to Marygrove and the opportunity to share my vision with respect to affordable housing in Detroit,” Sheffield said in a press release. “I’ve spent my entire career advocating for strong neighborhoods that contain diverse housing options for every Detroiter, from transitional to affordable to market rate.”
“As Detroit’s next mayor, my first priority is to ensure our city has the resources we need to improve the quality of life for all Detroiters, to expand housing opportunities for renters and new homeowners, and to build on the progress we’ve made as a city over the past decade,” she continued. “I will continue to work with our partners on the state and federal level, Democrats and Republicans, to ensure Detroit can rise higher.”
Turner told reporters after the meeting that federal government intervention is not the solution on certain issues, including redevelopment of the General Motors Renaissance Center in downtown Detroit, Axios Detroit reported. 
“I think she has a great vision,” Turner added. “She’s a pioneer of sorts, and so we look forward to working with her for the people of Detroit.”
Turner and the department of Housing and Urban Development have recently come under fire, including in a lawsuit filed by Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and 22 other state leaders, for changes made to a funding program that has historically allowed state and local governments to put money towards permanent housing solutions. 
The department, under the current administration, has also pushed to limit the scope of public housing and housing voucher programs. Housing advocates have warned that changes like these could exacerbate homelessness and make it harder for state and local governments to address it.

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)As the question of whether West Virginia will allow religious and philosophical exemptions to its school vaccination requirements works its way through the courts, health committee leaders for both the House of Delegates and Senate say they’re not planning bills to change the requirements during the upcoming 2026 session.  
Senate Health Committee Chair Laura Chapman, R-Wheeling, said legislation about vaccines should come from the House of Delegates next session. During the 2025 session, the Senate passed a religious exemption bill, but the measure failed in the House. 
“This issue is not going away. However, I don’t think it’s necessarily the best use of time to bring this issue up on the Senate side again, because we’ve proven that we care about constitutional rights and can pass the bill,” Chapman told West Virginia Watch. “So from my perspective, I think a bill needs to come from the House if it will pass this session.”
Del. Evan Worrell, R-Cabell, chair of the House Health Committee, said a vaccine exemption bill is not his personal priority, and hasn’t been the focus of conversations with other lawmakers about the upcoming legislative session. 
“It’s not a priority of mine personally, to push through a vaccine exemption bill, especially in light of everything that’s going on through the court system,” Worrell said. “But if the caucus and or the committee, the majority of members feel that that’s something we need to take a look at, we need to take up, then we’ll do it.”
While she doesn’t plan to introduce the legislation, Chapman said she’d support a bill that would codify religious exemptions. 
“All of our surrounding states allow for religious exemption,” she said. “We allow our West Virginia children to play sports against kids from Kentucky and Pennsylvania, and we don’t require vaccines for those kids. And so really it’s a fundamental issue because it’s a constitutional issue, but we’re also not fairly treating children the same because we do allow them to play sports with kids who may or may not be vaccinated.”
State lawmakers have tried for years to water down the state’s strict school vaccine mandates. West Virginia does not allow children whose families object to the shots on religious or philosophical grounds to opt out of school vaccine requirements.
During the 2024 legislative session, lawmakers passed legislation that would have allowed private and parochial schools to have their own vaccine requirements and exempted students attending virtual schools from school mandated vaccinations, but Former Gov. Jim Justice vetoed the bill.
In January, on his second day in office, Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order requiring the state to allow religious exemptions. The governor’s executive order remains in effect even though lawmakers rejected Senate Bill 460, which would have codified the religious exemption. The executive order is based on the Equal Protection for Religion Act of 2023, a religious freedom bill. The state Board of Education advised county boards not to accept religious exemptions. 
The issue has been the subject of lawsuits around the state. Raleigh County Circuit Judge Michael Froble last week issued a ruling enjoining the state Department of Education and the Raleigh County board of education from enforcing the school’s vaccination rules on any family that’s sought a religious exemption to the requirements based on the state’s religious freedom bill. The Supreme Court stayed that decision, and the state education officials have reinstated its policy of not accepting religious exemptions.
In comments about the Supreme Court action this week, a spokesperson for Morrisey hinted at the possibility of legislation concerning the issue.
“Whether we prevail in the courts or prevail with the legislature, West Virginia will ultimately join the other 45 states that protect and defend religious liberty and will no longer be such an outlier on vaccine policy,” Morrisey Press Secretary Drew Galang said. 
Worrell said there are plans for legislative changes related to the state’s application for the federal Rural Health Transformation Program, and he’s looking into more legislation to align with the Make American Healthy Again agenda. No one is “clamoring” to take up vaccines again this year, probably because the issue is tied up in court, Worrell said.
“We’ve got so many issues with our child welfare system,” he said. “You’ve seen articles about even a local school in my area that does psychiatric residential treatment closing down. We had one happen in Charleston. We’ve got issues with the PATH system. I mean, there are a lot of problems, as you’re well aware. 
“I feel like my first year as health chair got bogged down on certificate of need and vaccines,” Worrell said.  “And this next session, I’m not going to let that happen again. Other priorities fell by the wayside because of it.”
Senate President Randy Smith, R-Preston, and House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, R-Clay, did not return a request to comment for this story.  
While Worrell said the legislation won’t be his priority, other Republican delegates said they’ll introduce vaccine legislation. 
Del. Kathie Hess Crouse, R-Putnam, said she’d prefer the state prohibiting vaccine mandates altogether, but she plans to at least introduce a bill adding religious and philosophical exemptions.  
“Parents should always have the option to turn down a medical procedure like that, which it is a procedure. It’s getting a shot, a vaccine,” Crouse said. “If it’s something that affects their child’s health, they should have the option, with informed consent, on what they choose to do.” 
Crouse said she’s also working on a bill that would require school board members, school faculty and staff to have the same vaccines that are required for students, unless there are expanded exemptions for students and to limit school travel to areas that have the same vaccination laws as West Virginia. 
Most states require students attending school be vaccinated for a series of infectious diseases like measles, polio and whooping cough.This year, Idaho officials passed a bill that prohibits all vaccine mandates, including those for school students. Florida officials have also announced plans to end vaccine mandates.
The action comes as cases of vaccine preventable illnesses are on the rise. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 46 measles outbreaks have been reported in 2025, up from 16 last year. Measles cases have been reported in 43 jurisdictions this year, not including West Virginia. 
In 2024, West Virginia reported its first measles case in 15 years. Health experts have attributed the strict vaccination laws with limiting disease outbreaks. Cases of pertussis, commonly referred to as whooping cough, have increased in West Virginia this year. In neighboring Kentucky, three infants have died of the disease this year. 
Del. Chris Anders, R-Berkeley, said he plans to again support a bill to eliminate vaccine mandates. Anders was a co-sponsor of a similar bill earlier this year that was introduced but went nowhere. 
“No government official, no politician and no bureaucrat should be able to tell you what you have to shoot into your own body,” he said. “That’s just absolutely immoral, and it violates the core principles of individual liberty.”
The 60-day legislative session starts Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2026.

Putney’s educational legacy is something Vermonters can be proud of. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Tyler Baker: Why Putney is an epicenter of progressive education in America.","Tyler Baker is an assistant professor of history at Landmark College in Putney. He is the author of a forthcoming history of Landmark College, published by the University of Vermont Press.



Putney is, on the surface, another rural Southeastern Vermont town, but there is more going on in the town than meets the eye — and has been for nearly a century.  The dirt roads, the rolling hills, and the single general store — they do not give the impression of a place that would reshape American education.
And yet, for nearly a century, Putney has been home to an extraordinary concentration of experimental schools and institutions that have had an outsized role in how Americans learn, teach and imagine the purpose of education. 
I imagine some Vermonters, and most longtime locals, know bits and pieces of the story.  Fewer know just how interconnected it really is — or how much the identity of the village was, and is, forged by a deep, almost stubborn commitment to educational innovation. 
It began with The Putney School in the 1930s, one of the earliest American schools built around progressive ideals: experiential learning, farm-based education, democratic governance and a belief in the social value of the arts. Hickory Ridge School followed, incorporating anti-war activism and cooperative living into its curriculum.
The Experiment in International Living brought global immersion and cultural exchange programs into the village, long before “study abroad” became a standard line in college brochures. Antioch University’s Graduate School of Education incorporated an additional dimension, training generations of teachers to rethink teaching beyond what traditional expectation
But the most dramatic chapter happened on a hill overlooking town, where the former Windham College campus now houses Landmark College. 
When Windham closed in 1978, the campus fell into disrepair. The residents of Putney had reason to be worried. Several proposals were floated for the 125-acre property, none of which sat well with the town — understandably.
One proposal would have turned the site into a facility for Cuban anti-Castro refugees. Another plan would have made it a federal prison. A third proposal involved the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi organization, which sought to transform the campus into a Transcendental Meditation university.
Each time, Putney residents organized and pushed back. They understood something simple, yet vital: whatever moved onto the outside of town would shape Putney’s future for decades to come. 
When Landmark College arrived in 1985, the match between institution and town felt almost inevitable, at least in hindsight.
Landmark was the first college in the country created explicitly for students with learning differences — particularly dyslexia — at a time when most colleges did not know how to accommodate, much less fully educate, students with non-typical learning profiles. The college’s founding represented the latest evolution of the same educational impulse that animated Putney for decades: a commitment to redesigning learning from the ground up. 
Over four decades, Landmark has expanded its mission to serve students with ADHD, autism, executive-function challenges and other learning profiles. What has remained constant is the college’s core belief that students should not be seen as exceptions in need of accommodation, but as whole individuals whose strengths, challenges and learning styles should shape pedagogy itself. In other words: difference is not a disruption to education — it is a foundation for it. 
Putney, quietly and consistently, created the conditions where Landmark could thrive. The college did not sprout from apathetic citizenry. Landmark’s history is tied to the town’s long-standing willingness to support models of education that diverge from the mainstream. 
That belief matters now more than ever. Vermont, like the rest of the country, is addressing difficult conversations about retention, mental health, accessibility and the purpose of higher education.  Students who learn differently are enrolling in college at higher rates than at any time in our nation’s history. Disability services offices are overwhelmed. Colleges are struggling to retrofit systems that were never designed for the students they now serve. 
But in Putney, a working model has existed for decades. Landmark shows what’s possible when accessibility is designed into an institution from the start — when pedagogy, advising, campus culture and student life are built around human variation rather than standardized expectations. 
And it also matters that this is not just a Landmark story. It is a Vermont story. 
It is a story about a town that repeatedly chose education over expediency. It is about residents who asked what kind of community they wanted to become, and who recognized that what happens on a campus also happens to the surrounding town. It is a story about a place where innovation was not a buzzword; it was, and continues to be, a civic value. 
Putney’s educational legacy is something Vermonters can be proud of.  In a rural corner of the state, generations of educators, students, activists and community members built — and protected — a tradition of progressive education that continues to shape lives far beyond the town’s boundaries.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-05 17:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,The burden of student debt is transforming education,Collin Jefferson,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/05/the-burden-of-student-debt-is-transforming-education/,"Rising debt makes higher education less about ability and more about affordability, reducing opportunity and diversity on campuses.","What if I told you the only way you can get your college degree is by spending the next 20 years paying off the debt to attend that school. Would you still go? 
Many people I know need to achieve that dream of walking across a stage and receiving a diploma to put themselves in a better position in life. However, that dream comes with a price tag now. A price tag that is so big at times that these people that I know have to give up on their dreams. 



It has gotten to the point where higher education to earn a good paying job seems to be an unreachable luxury. Many kids who have a passion to pursue a certain career after high school cannot because they are too poor to reach a higher level of education. This makes higher education less about ability and more about affordability, reducing opportunity and diversity on campuses. 
Even for those who make it to college, rising tuition widens the gap between students from wealthy families and those from low-income backgrounds. Many talented students must work long hours while studying, leaving them less time to focus on academics and extracurricular activities. The rise in cost takes away time from campus events and functions that students can attend during some downtime to get a leisure activity in. 
In my personal experience as a student athlete, not only am I a full-time student that must prepare and study for class, but I also must prepare and train for my sport while also taking up a part-time job at the school. Balancing sport, school, and the mindset of making enough money to stay in school comfortably leads to lack in performance and mental health.

The issue of debt doesn’t just affect individual students. The issue of student debt affects entire communities and the country’s economy. When young people are forced to take out massive loans, they end up delaying important milestones like buying a home, starting a family, or even beginning a business. Instead of contributing to economic growth, they spend years trapped in a repayment cycle. 
Furthermore, many students who start college but cannot keep up with tuition end up dropping out, leaving them with debt but no degree to show for it. This cycle creates long-term financial stress and limits upward mobility for millions of Americans.
The constant rise in tuition makes college feel less like an opportunity to learn and more like a business transaction. The cost of education discourages students from pursuing degrees in fields that truly interest them. Instead, many choose careers that simply offer higher salaries, rather than following their passions or pursuing work that benefits society. This means a lack of teachers, social workers, and artists. which are professions that shape communities and culture. When education becomes only about survival and not personal growth, society loses creativity and compassion. Schools should focus on helping students succeed, not just on making profits.
Colleges often justify tuition increases by pointing to improved facilities, technology, or campus programs, but those benefits mean little if fewer students can afford to experience them. Education should be a right, not a privilege reserved for the wealthy. If the goal of higher education is to prepare the next generation of thinkers, leaders, and innovators, then it must be made accessible to all who are willing to work hard for it.
Overall, the growing cost of college is transforming education, which is supposed to be a pathway to open doors, into a barrier that limits success for many hardworking students. Colleges and policymakers need to find solutions to make higher education more accessible and affordable. 
Expanding need-based scholarships, increasing state funding for public universities, and controlling unnecessary fees could help ease the cost that gives many students an untenable burden. Investing in education benefits everyone by creating a stronger, more skilled population that can achieve a career after their time in college to help boost the economy and quality of life in our country. 
If tuition continues to rise unchecked, fewer students will be able to achieve their educational goals, and the nation will lose out on the talent and innovation that come from diverse backgrounds filled with motivated graduates who still have so much potential left to reach.

The city is one of three in the state's southwestern-most county that received nine years of taxpayer money meant for the local hospital. (Photo by Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — People in one of Kansas’ southernmost counties noticed in 2014 their local hospital was struggling, so they voted to create a sales tax that would direct funds to keep their health care system afloat.
In the decade that followed, the Morton County hospital only received about half of the sales tax revenue it was owed, missing out on nearly $2 million.
The cities of Morton County received the money instead.
The Kansas Department of Revenue, for nine years, sent checks to Elkhart, population 1,726; Rolla, population 356; and Richfield, population 30, and the cities spent that money.
David Thompson, the county attorney, told a committee of legislators Tuesday in Topeka the clerical error that led to the misappropriated funds “was just an oversight — an accident.”
Rep. Ken Rahjes, a Republican from Agra, called the situation “head-scratching.”
Sen. Rick Kloos, a Berryton Republican, wondered how the cities didn’t realize they had extra money in their coffers for so many years.
“It just bewilders me how you can have that kind of money coming in that long of a period of time and somebody didn’t recognize,” Kloos said.
Thompson pitched the committee on forcing the state to pay the $1.9 million in lost revenue, without interest, to make the hospital whole.
But finger-pointing preempted solutions and the root of the problem.
“The county’s position is this is Department of Revenue’s mess,” said Thompson, who is also the Elkhart city attorney, “and we’ve already spent a lot of time and effort trying to clean this up.”

Rick Kloos, back left, asks Morton County attorney David Thompson, right, during a Dec. 2, 2025, committee hearing in Topeka, Kansas, how three cities went nine years without realizing state checks weren’t meant for them. (Kansas Reflector screen capture of Kansas Legislature YouTube channel)
When the Morton County Commission put the voter-approved sales tax on ballots, it cited the law incorrectly. It used a statute’s subparagraph 1, a general tax provision, instead of subparagraph 5, which is dedicated to health care facilities. Under the first section, retail sales tax revenue should be distributed proportionally between a county and its cities. Under the fifth, revenue should be sent to a county, which then spends it on the health care facility.
The commissioners realized their error soon after ballots were cast. Before the retail sales tax became law in 2015, they passed a series of ordinances to try to fix it.
But the revenue department adhered to the initial iteration of the ballot measure, doling out about half of the countywide sales tax revenue to the county and the other half to its cities. The money went into the cities’ general funds. The mayor of Elkhart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Thompson acknowledged the county made a mistake. But it corrected that mistake, he said.
Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach issued a nonbinding opinion in May that affirmed Morton County’s stance, concluding the will of the voters was to direct all sales tax revenues to the county hospital.
“The question here is whether the electors of Morton County understood what their vote meant on the ballot proposal,” Kobach wrote. “We believe they did.”
The county’s resolutions, formal election notices and the ballot question indicate that voters were aware they were being asked whether they wanted to fund the hospital through a sales tax, Kobach said.
Since Kobach’s opinion, monthly checks containing the full revenues have been delivered to the Morton County Hospital. They total about $36,000, Thompson said.
Richard Adams, who has been CEO of the hospital since August, said the recent checks doubled the previous amounts.
He said that money helps with overhead, operating costs and recruiting staff in an environment where rural hospitals across Kansas ride thin margins. All rural hospitals are struggling, said Adams, who was the hospital’s chief financial officer for two and half years before retiring and then returning to take the CEO role.
Hospitals vie for the same nurses and field the same cuts in Medicaid reimbursements. He said when a hospital disappears, a town tends to dry up.
“It feels like we’re just being squeezed from all directions,” he said.
He credits the local support of the hospital for keeping it afloat. It is the county’s largest employer, according to Thompson.
The recent increase in sales tax revenue provides a cushion. A $36,000 monthly check isn’t monumental, Adams said, but carrying that over 12 months makes a marked difference.
“From the hospital’s standpoint, if the funds were designated for the hospital and they were diverted or put somewhere else, then, yes, whoever made the mistake should own up and then the hospital should be compensated or made whole,” Adams said.
The revenue department has argued Morton County could seek reimbursement from the cities rather than the state.
“For me, the issue really goes back to what happened in 2015,” said Ted Smith, chief counsel for the state revenue department, at the Tuesday legislative hearing.
“And really was it a clerical error?” he said.
The department’s position, Smith said, is that the matter is “a little more substantial than that.”
He said the commissioners’ initial ordinance “sort of tied the department of revenue’s hands.” He argued the department doesn’t have the authority to assume the will of the voters and the county should have taken the matter to court.
Instead, Smith said, “I think both parties just sort of shrugged their shoulders.”
The legislative committee, which handles claims against the state, did not order the county to be reimbursed. Lawmakers voted to send the issue on to another committee, which could take it up in the 2026 legislative session that begins in January.
However, Rep. Marty Long, a Ulysses Republican whose district encompasses Morton County, said he will wait to take direction from the county commissioners. He said in an interview he plans to attend the commission’s regular meeting Monday, at which point he could decide whether to pursue legislation.
He said he has questions that need answered.
“I don’t like to look for fault in these kinds of things, but there was probably either a miscommunication or something happened,” Long said. “I haven’t gotten to the bottom of it yet.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/downtownElkhart-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-05 12:57:44.689173

With the Dec. 8 candidate filing deadline fast approaching, the high court’s decision likely means Texas’ new map will be used for the 2026 midterm elections.
Justice Samuel Alito ruled that it was “indisputable” that Texas’ motivation for redistricting was “pure and simple” partisan advantage, which the court has previously ruled is permissible. Alito rejected the argument that Texas had engaged in racial gerrymandering.

The ruling is a major win for Republicans in Texas and nationally. President Donald Trump had pushed Texas to redraw its map over the summer, hoping to secure five additional GOP seats to shore up the party’s narrow majority in the U.S. House through the midterms.
On Nov. 18, two federal judges barred Texas from using the new map for 2026, saying there was evidence state lawmakers had racially gerrymandered in redrawing the lines. Galveston District Judge Jeffrey Brown, a Trump appointee, authored the opinion ordering Texas to return to its 2021 map, while 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Jerry Smith vociferously dissented.
The state asked the Supreme Court to overturn Brown’s ruling entirely, but that could take weeks or months to proceed through the court system, especially if the justices decide they want to hear arguments in Washington, D.C. With Thursday’s ruling, the justices have temporarily paused Brown’s ruling while that longer legal process can play out.
The ruling said the lower court, under Brown, “improperly inserted itself into an active primary campaign, causing much confusion and upsetting the delicate federal-state balance in elections.”
The new map, approved by the Texas Legislature and signed by Gov. Greg Abbott in August, is engineered to give Republicans control of 30 of the state’s 38 congressional districts, up from the 25 they currently hold under the 2021 map. Numerous Republican candidates have stepped forward to run in the newly favorable districts, while several Democratic incumbents were pushed into nearby districts already occupied by another Democrat, forcing them to contemplate primaries or retire.
Brown’s ruling upended those calculations. But in restoring the new map, the Supreme Court likely ensured that Republicans running for redrawn districts will get to campaign under the new lines in 2026.
Attorney General Ken Paxton celebrated the ruling, saying it was a win for Texas and every conservative who is tired of watching the left try to upend the political system with bogus lawsuits.”
Texas Democrats, meanwhile, condemned the outcome, with House Democratic Caucus Chair Rep. Gene Wu of Houston saying the high court had “failed” Texans.
“This is what the end of the Voting Rights Act looks like: courts that won’t protect minority communities even when the evidence is staring them in the face,” Wu said.
In her dissent, Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan criticized the court for reversing Brown’s 160-page ruling “based on its perusal, over a holiday weekend, of a cold paper record.”
“Today’s order disrespects the work of a District Court that did everything one could ask to carry out its charge,” Kagan wrote on behalf of the liberal justices. “Today’s order disserves the millions of Texans whom the District Court found were assigned to their new districts based on their race.”

But since then, only 80 elective abortions have been performed in the state. Thousands of Missourians had to seek care out of state. 
This is the reality until a trial plays out next year to determine which of Missouri’s anti-abortion laws violate a voter-approved reproductive health care constitutional amendment passed last year — and which can remain in place. 
“It’s hard to hear after we’ve had the vote,” Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains said. “Even knowing that the case really is moving at a wild speed and that we are pushing for trial as quickly as possible.”
Looming on the horizon is another statewide vote on abortion. Republican lawmakers placed a new constitutional amendment on the 2026 ballot that would ban nearly all abortions in the state, with limited exceptions for survivors and for medical emergencies. 
Abortion may be legal again in Missouri, but for most patients, it’s not yet within reach. 
Decades of restrictions have gutted the state’s provider network. Now, Planned Parenthood is the only option. And medication abortion — the method most people previously relied on — is still unavailable as the courts sort through which old laws conflict with the new constitutional amendment.
Some abortion-right advocates say this was all inevitable, arguing the amendment approved by voters last year didn’t go far enough. Others push back, saying access can’t be restored overnight even under the best circumstances. 
“It takes time to rebuild infrastructure that was decimated over decades,” said Mallory Schwarz, executive director of Abortion Action Missouri.
Signs lean against the wall at the Planned Parenthood in St. Louis’ Central West End (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).
It leaves activists on both sides of the abortion debate asking how best to move forward when so much is in flux. 
“If you want an abortion, you want to make that call now. You don’t want to have to wait and see what the state might do to interrupt your care,” Wales said. “And Missourians are thinking about that. When they call us, they are asking, ‘Is care really going to be available and what might happen,’ which is almost impossible for us to say.”
Between January and October, there were 80 in-clinic abortion procedures in Missouri across Planned Parenthood clinics in Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis, according to data from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.
An additional 79 abortions were performed in Missouri hospitals. All were marked as being medical emergencies when reported to the health department.
State Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, who helped pass Missouri’s trigger law that banned abortion in 2022, questioned whether the national donors who bankrolled the passage of the abortion-rights amendment last year will open up their checkbooks again to fight the proposed ban next year. 
In 2024, anti-abortion groups were outspent six to one.
“They spent $30 million for 80 abortions. Are they going to do that again? I don’t know,” said Coleman, an Arnold Republican. “We’re a bad place to invest if you are part of the national pro-abortion movement because we’re not going to stop and we’re going to continue and we’re more unified than we used to be.” 
 Rebuilding infrastructure

To say Julie Burkhart knows something about running an abortion clinic in a hostile environment is an understatement. 
Burkhart worked for Dr. George Tiller’s abortion clinic in Wichita, Kansas, when an anti-abortion activist fatally shot Tiller in 2009. More than a decade later, Burkhardt opened an abortion clinic in Wyoming in spite of the state’s abortion ban.
She is also co-owner of Hope Clinic, a private abortion provider in Granite City, Illinois, located a 15 minute drive northeast of downtown St. Louis. Between 2019 and 2022, the numbers of Missourians making the short trek to her clinic more than tripled. 
The year Tiller was murdered, 6,881 abortions were performed in Missouri, according to state health department data. By 2021, there were only 151. 
In 2024, it’s estimated 7,780 Missourians traveled to Illinois and 3,960 traveled to Kansas to access abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research group.
In Missouri, in what used to be a network of private and non-profit abortion clinics, Planned Parenthood now stands alone. 
“ When we have clinics closing because of government hostility, it’s not an abstract function. It’s not theoretical,” Burkhart said. “What that does is that puts more pressure on real people who are just trying to live their lives, make the best decisions about their lives, the lives of children that they might already have.”
Last year, Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, which is based in St. Louis and operates clinics in the metro area and in the Ozarks, announced the closure of three locations in North St. Louis County, south St. Louis city and Joplin in order to expand telehealth services.

This year, at least 45 Planned Parenthood clinics around the country have shuttered, many due to the ban on abortion providers receiving Medicaid reimbursements. 
“If you don’t have that infrastructure, then it’s just chaotic,” Burkhart said. “People are left not knowing if something’s available or not, or to what limit or not, and it’s just incredibly stressful and chaotic for patients.”
Burkhart has no plans to open an abortion clinic in Missouri, though she sees a “desperate need” for more providers. 
But if a private provider were interested in moving into Missouri, she said they would likely face challenges like finding a financial institution willing to finance them. And she’d advise waiting until after the parameters of the abortion rights amendment are fully litigated and the November vote on the abortion ban. 
“I feel like I’m painting a very grim picture,” she said. “Start-ups can be done, but I think it’s just a matter of good strategy, time and patience to navigate all those hurdles.”
Margot Riphagen, CEO and president of Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, said there is early talk of restarting abortion procedures at the other clinics she oversees (including in Rolla, Springfield, St. Peters and western St. Louis County) after the January trial offers some legal clarity.
At the Planned Parenthood clinic in St. Louis’ Central West End, abortions accounted for less than 1% of all services provided in the 2025 fiscal year ending in June. The majority of appointments were for STI screenings.
The clinic did not provide the total number of abortions it performed in the past year, but said 20% of the abortion patients came from out of state. The clinic is currently offering abortion appointments once a week for patients up to 18 weeks gestation, said spokesperson Krissy Durant.
Wales, with Planned Parenthood Great Plains, hopes for a day when abortion doesn’t rest solely on Planned Parenthood’s shoulders. 
“What I want as a Missourian and as someone who wants people to have access to their own fundamental rights is for there to be providers in every single community who have patients in the waiting room who are there to get obstetrical care or regular checkups or wellness visits or abortion care,” she said, “ … That is what real access to abortion looks like. The challenge we have, though, is getting to that point of normalizing care and having providers feel safe enough to do it.”

Robin Frisella, community engagement director for Missouri Abortion Fund, said conversations about rebuilding access often neglect strategies to fund abortion. 
“When you fund abortion, you are funding the immediate needs of abortion seekers right now,” she said. “You don’t have to wait for elections. You don’t have to wait for amendments to pass to make a real difference in abortion access.”
Missouri law prevents private insurance companies from covering any abortion costs. Federal law bans the use of federal funds, such as Medicaid. 
The average cost of an abortion in the first trimester is about $600, Frisella said. Abortions later in pregnancy can cost upwards of $10,000.
So far in 2025, the fund has paid for out-of-state abortions for more than 1,570 Missourians. But the past few years have seen a steady decline in donations, Frisella said. 
Missouri Abortion Fund is also part of What’s Next, a group made up of reproductive justice activists and organizers who previously called for a constitutional amendment to appear on the Missouri ballot with no restrictions on abortion. 
“When amendment three is considered a win, it gives the false impression that this issue has been solved in the state,” Frisella said. “What a win looks like for abortion access is not limited appointment availability.”
 Republican response

In October, former Missouri Republican Gov. Mike Parson stood before a room of Missouri Baptists and warned they may be facing their “last chance” to remove abortion rights from the Missouri constitution. 
“If we don’t get it done this time,” Parson cautioned, “you’ll be fighting this issue for a long, long time.” 
State Rep. Brian Seitz was in the crowd. 
“Society in general is changing,” Seitz said. “I don’t know that the ideas that some of us have, as conservatives and/or Christians, are really holding sway as much as they did 10, 20, 30 years ago.”
“If the Missouri voter says no to this one, can we run the same thing again?” Seitz said. “ I don’t think so.”
While nothing is stopping the legislature from trying again to ban abortion if next year’s vote fails, Seitz said he thinks a repeat attempt is unlikely. Instead, he said, the fight would take a different form. 
He thinks the best path forward is legislation that would establish fetal personhood. This means that from the moment of conception, an embryo, and then fetus, would have full rights as an individual. This could “negate” the abortion rights amendment, he said, because abortion could then legally become classified as murder.
Rep. Brian Seitz, a Branson Republican, speaks during House debate on Feb. 11 (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
Coleman, the Arnold Republican senator, said if the abortion ban fails at the ballot next year, she will immediately go back to the drawing board to find a new path to restrict the procedure. 
“ This fight isn’t going to go away. I will never stop working on this, and I am one of hundreds of thousands of Missourians who will never stop fighting to protect the unborn,” Coleman said. “The idea that there is one end all be all, it’s not true.”
Legislation pre-filed by state Sen. Mike Moon, a Republican from Ash Grove, and state Rep. Burt Whaley, a Republican from Clever, seeks to charge anyone who has or performs an abortion with murder.
“Instead of protecting a culture that allows the shedding of innocent blood, we must protect preborn babies from abortion and the souls of the mothers who commit them by deterring abortions in the first place,” Whaley said in a statement. “This legislation will help us accomplish this simple directive from God.”
 ‘Changing culture’

Sam Lee, an anti-abortion lobbyist who has spent decades roaming the Missouri Capitol, has been collecting books by progressive activists on topics like environmentalism and violence. 
“They’re really instructive to me in terms of what could be done,” he said. “If we’re going to have a pro-life culture or a culture that respects life, then maybe we need to teach kids that, as opposed to just dealing with guns on one side or the other. What about just relationships? It’s an idea; we’ll see.”
Lee hopes these texts may give him some insight into how to motivate a younger population to his movement. 
“I’m talking about changing culture. Gosh, we lost by just 1.6%; such a close vote,” Lee said. “What could we have done 10 or 15 or 20 years ago, where we could have won that? It’s a legitimate question, and it’s a legitimate criticism of the pro life movement if we could have dealt with it, and we didn’t, when we were focused almost exclusively on trying to overturn Roe versus Wade.”
The question of messaging is top of mind for those on both sides of the abortion movement. 
This fall, volunteers with Abortion Action Missouri started hosting house parties to invite their friends and neighbors to talk about and learn about abortion.
Schwarz, with Abortion Action Missouri, said her organization made a conscious effort to shift toward normalizing the phrase “pro abortion” a few years ago, noting that anti-abortion groups were far more likely at the time to say the word “abortion” out loud. 
Students hold up anti-abortion signs at the Midwest March for Life on May 1, 2024, at the Missouri State Capitol (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).
“How silly that we have ceded that ground to them in favor of something like choice, or women’s healthcare or reproductive healthcare,” she said. 
Schwarz said she sees the destigmatization — something crucial to winning over more support as she knocks on more doors in parts of the state that are historically more conservative and Christian.
“It is freeing. People are itching to talk about this experience, and stigma has kept them silent,” Schwarz said. “Being approached at their door or invited to a meeting, it helps people heal from the shame that they experienced themselves, and they see that they didn’t need to. 
Schwarz said putting abortion on the ballot and winning is not the end all be all. 
“The only path towards a Missouri where we’re not fighting the same attack year after year after year is one where we change the composition of the legislature,” she said. “ … “It was never sufficient for us to look at a 10 plus year plan to flip the state legislature and think we could just live under a ban during that time.”
Jamie Morris, executive director of the Missouri Catholic Conference, said the slim margins of the November 2024 vote re-energized the anti-abortion voters. 
This time around, he’s hopeful the campaign in favor of the abortion ban will be better-funded.
“ It’s easy to go back and sort of Monday morning quarterback, but we lost by 1.6%,” he said. “You don’t even need another $30 million. You just need to raise a little bit more and target in certain areas a little bit sooner than I think our side did last time.”
He also hopes part of the messaging, including what’s preached to those in pews, focuses on laws that help women choose to continue a pregnancy.
“Is it a financial issue? Is it the social safety net that we need to bolster?  Is it childcare issues?” he said. “Pick that public policy topic, but it’s all of these things that help women decide to have the child. How can we impact that and really focus on the women who feel like they have no other choice?”
For now, Missourians sit in the uneasy space between a constitutional right and the reality on the ground — a state where voters restored abortion access, but where it remains largely out of reach. 
“(Lawmakers) can sow chaos on their end,” Wales said. “We’re just going to keep organizing and coordinating and moving with one vision for Missourians to be healthier and safer and free.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_8059-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-12-05 11:58:20.621137

“We don’t have to wait for somebody to tell our own story, we can tell our own story,” said Fiona Vernal, curator of the museum and associate professor of history and director of the University of Connecticut’s Africana Studies Institute.
The West Indian Social Club was founded in 1950 as a home away from home for Caribbean farmworkers who came to Connecticut during World War II to grow tobacco.
In a state where more than 100,000 people now identify as West Indian, the new Caribbean Museum is the result of the club’s organizing, mutual aid and cultural work in Hartford as a way to preserve and keep documenting their heritage.
“Some people say the museum is an offspring of a 13- or even 18-year process,” Beverly Redd, Board of Directors’ chair of the West Indian Social Club, said. “But it really took us 75 years to get here.”

From idea to reality
In 2014, the club’s Board of Directors started brainstorming how to sustain the organization in the long run. As a result, a cultural heritage committee was formed under the leadership of Tanya Dorman, the club’s current director of compliance and regulatory services, who was serving as vice president at the time.
Dorman recalls the club’s basement and attic were full of photos, artifacts and relics of past members, club presidents and parades. Some items have been loaned to different organizations when they needed to use them for West Indian-themed exhibitions. But Dorman wanted these items to have an organized and digitized home.
“So our leadership team decided that we needed to make something of it, and I said, boy, it would be really good if we could have a museum, because we do not have a Caribbean cultural museum here,” Dorman said.
The club then got into partnership with nonprofit Education for Development and Support Network, and that was when Vernal, who had already done oral history exhibitions with the Connecticut Museum of Culture and History since the ’90s, joined the museum project.
Fast forward, Redd and Dorman created the nonprofit Caribbean Cultural Heritage Alliance to be able to accept donations to spin off the project.
“We’re building it from the ground up, without much,” Redd said.
The work Redd, Dorman and Vernal do at the club is on a volunteer basis, like the rest of the members. Outside of the club they have full-time jobs as well as families. Hence, putting together the museum became a slow but steady process that they did not want to give up on.
“I was thinking about how difficult it was for those Black Caribbean men in 1950 to come up with the idea of the organization, fund it, find a building, purchase the building, during times of segregation,” Vernal said. “I have the ghosts of these men, not in a frightening way, in an inspiring way,  reminding me that we should be able to pull this off and take it farther than they did.”

Curating the museum
Vernal had help from graphic designers, student interns and her UConn departments of Africana Studies and History, as well as contract workers ripping up the carpet, doing the electrical work, and flattening the walls, so that the room used for the museum would be ready. They also had the support and guidance of the West Indian Foundation.
“I might be the connected thread with everybody, but this project is a collaborative effort,” Vernal said.
Each of the walls in the museum has its own school program.
Accompanied by a map of the Caribbean, the first panel is called the ‘invitation’ where the curator invites attendants to engage, and learn about the West Indian migrants and their descendants’ history of mobility, organization and leadership that has transformed Hartford into a ‘Caribbean city’.
Next to the map, are the stories of the oldest members of the West Indian Social Club: Sidney Barnett and Kenneth Bennet Sr.
“It’s important to document those stories, because our older generations are dying out, and they’re taking the history with them, so how can we capture it? Here, with the museum,” Redd shared.
The oral history listening station takes place on a touchscreen where you can click on the audio recording stories from field work Vernal has done for more than 25 years.
Alongside the touchscreens, the wall is dedicated to black Caribbean organizing and leadership efforts, like Marcus Garvey, a Jamaican political activist, founder and first President-General of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League, which had a Hartford chapter. There are archive photos of Negro World, Garvey’s newspaper which became one of the most widely distributed and influential Black newspapers in history.
The walls also display a timeline of the West Indian enclave history in Connecticut, the ‘starvation’ ship that transported the first West Indian laborers, photos of cricket and soccer teams, women’s auxiliary, the pageant and parades, which were carefully curated by Vernal and her interns.
In the past museum openings, Dorman said she heard multiple children pointing to the photos and the list of the club’s founding fathers. Dorman said they shouted  ‘that’s my grandpa’ or older adults uttered ‘that’s my auntie.’ It happened to her too, since Dorman’s father is in the photos as well.
“My own father came here as a farm worker and he has his picture and artifacts too. That’s part of the museum. My dad died before my second birthday so my soul attachment is through those artifacts”, Dorman said.
Redd wants the museum to feel like a community hub for West Indians, but also to ‘friends of the Caribbean.’ It’s a place they want all to feel welcomed, especially if they live away from home, and if they are second or third generation.
“When you leave a country like Jamaica, you leave the warmth, where you could walk outside and go get a piece of sugarcane to eat. And then you come to Hartford, and you’re lonely, you’re locked inside,” Redd said. “This space is for them and for all, ‘come on in this is your home away from home.’”

Future plans 
The museum has been open since October — every third Saturday of the month, even though they are still continuing to work on other pieces for it. 
There are some parts of the walls that are meant to have interactive activities, but they wanted to leave it to the community to decide what they want to see so there are areas where people can stick Post-its to the wall with their ideas for what they would like to see added.
Vernal hopes the museum can raise money for a complementary mural project.
“We’re looking to collaborate and partner with the school system from an educational perspective, so there will be field trips,” Dorman added.
Redd, Vernal, and Dorman said the museum can grow as long as they have funding, which has been a longtime struggle. For now, it will stay where it is.
“We’re hopeful that the museum will tell our story 150 years from today,” Redd said.

Nearly 6,500 people have filled out our brain drain survey to date, which is more than we could have imagined when our three organizations – Mississippi Today, the University of Mississippi’s Center for Population Studies and Working Together Mississippi’s Rethink Mississippi initiative – began developing this project.
Responses have come from people living in 76 of Mississippi’s 82 counties and 48 of 50 states (looking at you, North and South Dakota). We have also received responses from Mississippi expats living in 17 countries.
The most important takeaway from the survey is obvious without even looking at the results: Many people care deeply about Mississippi’s future, even if they live far away. 
Our work is not done. We are still collecting responses, so if you haven’t taken the survey yet, we invite you to take a few minutes to fill it out now. If you have taken it but haven’t shared it with your friends and family, we’d love for you to do so. 

Take the survey

Every additional response moves us a step closer to the goal of finding solutions to the brain drain. There are many theories, but the only way to know what will actually work is for you to tell us. It doesn’t matter where you’re from or where you live now – we even want to hear from people who have never been to Mississippi. After all, Mississippi’s brain drain is the result of thousands of personal and family decisions, and each individual response tells us how our state can retain, recruit or return at least one more person.
We know that many of you have lengthier thoughts about Mississippi than could fit in the confines of the survey. We will soon start contacting people who volunteered to be interviewed to hear your stories and learn more about your ideas for making the state a place that you and others want to call home. We will also be convening community conversations around the state and in places that Mississippians have moved, so if you signed up for our mailing list, be on the lookout for information about when we will be in your area. 
Reversing the brain drain will take a collective effort, so we will make as much of the data available to the public as possible. The demographic experts at the Center for Population Studies will continue to dig into the data as it comes in, and we will release more updates ahead of a final report in the new year. All of our findings will be published through Mississippi Today and www.rethinkms.org. 
Below you’ll find an update on the results we’ve received so far. They could change as more responses come in. In fact, we hope they do – that will mean we’re reaching new people who have different priorities and perspectives. We have received responses from a diverse range of places, identities, ideologies and professions, but our current sample is whiter, more female, more highly-educated and more left-leaning than the general population. Additional responses will help us achieve a more representative snapshot and delve more deeply into specific geographies and subgroups. 
Below are select responses to just a few questions in the survey.
Describe why you stayed in Mississippi or moved back.
“This is my home. I want to make it better. My family lives here.”
“I love Mississippi and it can’t get better if everyone leaves. Investment and buy-in is very important.”
“I lived away from Mississippi during college and after college for about 15 years. I moved back to raise my children in a solidly conservative area surrounded by family and rooted in traditions of the land.”
“Despite its flaws, Mississippi is really a great place to live and raise a family.”
“I have always lived in Mississippi because I want to be near my family. I love Mississippi despite its struggles, and Mississippi has many wonderful people. Unfortunately those people aren’t the ones in charge. So our state, the poorest state in the country, cannot move forward due to the people in power.”
Describe why you moved away from Mississippi.
“I moved away because it was the only way to find a job in my field.”
“Job opportunities, access to people my age and to experience different cultures I now live in a city with walkability and access to public transit. I do not own a car and biking is my primary mode of transit which I could not do in Mississippi.”
“The people are too close minded, lack of job opportunities, poor infrastructure, poor leadership, there aren’t enough social activities, too much poverty, terrible healthcare system, high crime, poor water quality in Jackson. A lot of these issues stem from racism.”
“My politics beliefs do not align with the state, and as a result, my job prospects were slim to none in my field as I work in politics. I got my undergrad education in Mississippi but moved to pursue my masters to give me the best chance of finding a job I love.”
“Lack of economic opportunity. Lack of diversity in ideas and beliefs. Felt oppressive. Lack of access to health care and transportation.”
What ideas do you have for making your community and/or Mississippi a more attractive place to live for others?
“We have to have people stay here and be invested. We need investment to help make Jackson better. Rural health care and access HAS to improve.”
“Build the capital. For example, downtown Jackson has way too much potential for it not to be more bustling. Improve public transportation in our capital city and surrounding neighborhoods. Survey and take care of the needs of those with the least resources.”
“We have to be more accepting of all people, help people who are not able to pull themselves up due to generational poverty, and find a way to improve education in underperforming rural areas.”
“Better public access to parks and recreational areas in good repair. Mississippi has this, they should lean into it with better upkeep and advertise it.”
“Elect younger and more progressive leadership. Work with state and regional leaders as much as practical to gain benefits for Jackson.”
What state and/or local changes could encourage you to move back to Mississippi?
“Improving incentives for first time home buyers to make it more accessible and making in-state college tuition more affordable.”
“Tightening up public corruption laws so that our tax dollars actually go where they are designated.”
“More opportunities for professional jobs. I think the state should invest in small businesses through legislation that promotes the use of in-state businesses as well as incubators to foster more small businesses, particularly tech and expertise driven fields. I see engineering and scientific contracts awarded to companies that have few or no employees in this state.”
“Better access to women’s health care, more walkable cities, attention to climate change and the health of the environment.” 
“The enemy of the state isn’t diversity, minorities, the poor, or immigrants. What’s holding us back is clinging to a past we should be ashamed of and fear instilled by the politicians who have nothing of any substance to offer so they peddle fear to the weak minded to stay in office and enrich themselves.”

A loud chorus of medical and public health leaders decried the actions of the panel, whose current members were all appointed by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — a leading anti-vaccine activist before this year becoming the nation’s top health official.
“This is the group that can’t shoot straight,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University vaccine expert who for decades has been involved with ACIP and its workgroups.
For decades, the government has advised that all babies be vaccinated against the liver infection right after birth. The shots are widely considered to be a public health success for preventing thousands of illnesses.
But Kennedy’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices decided to recommend the birth dose only for babies whose mothers test positive, and in cases where the mom wasn’t tested.
For other babies, it will be up to the parents and their doctors to decide if a birth dose is appropriate. The committee voted to suggest that when a family decides not to get a birth dose, then the vaccination series should begin when the child is 2 months old.
The vote passed 8-3.
“We are doing harm by changing this wording, and I vote no,” said committee member Dr. Cody Meissner.
The acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Jim O’Neill, is expected to decide later whether to accept the committee’s recommendation.
The decision marks a return to a public health strategy that was abandoned more than three decades ago.
Asked why the newly-appointed committee moved quickly to reexamine the recommendation, committee member Vicky Pebsworth on Thursday cited “pressure from stakeholder groups wanting the policy to be revisited.” She did not say who was pressuring the committee, and a spokesman for Kennedy did not respond to a question about it.
Committee members said the risk of infection for most babies is very low and that earlier research that found the shots were safe for infants was inadequate.
They also worried that in many cases, doctors and nurses don’t have full conversations with parents about the pros and cons of the birth-dose vaccination.
The committee members voiced interest in hearing the input from public health and medical professionals, but chose to ignore the experts’ repeated pleas to leave the recommendations alone.
Dr. Peter Hotez of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development in Houston declined to present before the group “because ACIP appears to have shifted its mission away from science and evidence-based medicine,” he said in an email to The Associated Press.
The committee gives advice to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how approved vaccines should be used. CDC directors almost always adopted the committee’s recommendations, which were widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs. But the agency currently has no director, leaving acting director O’Neill to decide.
In June, Kennedy fired the entire 17-member panel earlier this year and replaced it with a group that includes several anti-vaccine voices.
Hepatitis B is a serious liver infection that, for most people, lasts less than six months. But for some, especially infants and children, it can become a long-lasting problem that can lead to liver failure, liver cancer and scarring called cirrhosis.
In adults, the virus is spread through sex or through sharing needles during injection drug use. But it can also be passed from an infected mother to a baby.
In 1991, the committee recommended an initial dose of hepatitis B vaccine at birth. Experts say quick immunization is crucial to prevent infection from taking root. And, indeed, cases in children have plummeted.
Still, several members of Kennedy’s committee voiced discomfort with vaccinating all newborns. They argued that past safety studies of the vaccine in newborns was limited and it’s possible that larger, long-term studies could uncover a problem with the birth dose.
But two members said they saw no documented evidence of harm from the birth doses and suggested concern was based on speculation.
The panel was to vote Thursday, but voted to postpone after some members said they had just received the densely-worded vote proposals and wanted clarification and more time to consider it.
Three panel members asked about the scientific basis for saying that the first dose should be delayed for two months for many babies.
“This is unconscionable,” said committee member Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, who repeatedly voiced opposition to the proposal during the sometimes-heated two-day meeting.
The committee’s chair, Dr. Kirk Milhoan, said two months was chosen as a point where infants had matured beyond the neonatal stage. Hibbeln countered that there was no data presented that two months is an appropriate cut-off.
Meissner also questioned a second proposal — which passed 6-4 — that said parents should talk to pediatricians about blood tests meant to measure whether hep B shots have created protective antibodies.
Such testing is not standard pediatric practice after vaccination, but proponents said it could be a new way to see if fewer shots are adequate.
A CDC hepatitis expert, Adam Langer, said results could vary from child to child and would be an erratic way to assess if fewer doses work. He also noted there’s no good evidence that three shots pose harm to kids.
Meissner attacked the proposal, saying the language “is kind of making things up.”
“It’s like never-neverland,” he said.
Health experts have noted Kennedy’s hand-picked committee is focused on the pros and cons of shots for the individual getting vaccinated, and has turned away from seeing vaccinations as a way to stop the spread of preventable diseases among the public.
The second proposal “is right at the center of this paradox,” said committee member Dr. Robert Malone.
Some observers criticized the meeting, noting recent changes in how they are conducted. CDC scientists no longer present vaccine safety and effectiveness data to the committee. Instead, people who have been prominent voices in anti-vaccine circles were given those slots.

Gretchen Whitmer speaks at a gun safety rally at the state Capitol Building on April 22, 2025 | Photo: Anna Liz NicholsFor most of her tenure as Michigan’s chief executive, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has earned her reputation the old fashioned way: by delivering results that matter to the people she represents.
GOP propaganda to the contrary, she kept Michigan on an even keel during a global pandemic, as the first Trump administration seemingly worked overtime to tip the boat over. 
She invested in long-neglected infrastructure while expanding workers’ rights, strengthening reproductive freedoms, and pushing forward common sense gun safety reforms that had been ignored by prior governors.
And even in the face of a plot to kidnap and murder her, Whitmer stood resolute against the rising tide of right-wing extremism that resulted in a blatant attempt to steal the 2020 election and an attempted coup on January 6.
As data centers flock to Michigan communities, what protections exist for residents?

But a governor who stood firmly for the rights of citizens over those of vested interests is now leaning in a strange direction.
Whitmer’s name became prominently mentioned as a potential contender for the White House precisely because she governed with a clear sense of public purpose and leadership that was widely, and rightly, respected.
But her sweeping embrace of massive data center projects has left many Michiganders, including this one, confused. Especially as it is so seemingly in line with the priorities of President Donald Trump, whose July executive order demanded the pursuit of “bold, large-scale industrial plans to vault the United States further into the lead on critical manufacturing processes and technologies that are essential to national security, economic prosperity, and scientific leadership.”
Now compare that to the comments Whitmer offered to the Michigan Public Service Commission this week in support of the massive data center proposed in Saline Township, in which she urged the regulatory body to provide the utility an expedited approval.  
“Right now, time is of the essence,” Whitmer stated. “This is a matter of national security and economic competitiveness, and if we do not act, it will cost us thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of investment in our economy.”
And while she has insisted that “Michigan’s environmental protections remained non-negotiable” in the vetting process, that is a conclusion far more in line with the utilities and tech companies than with environmental advocates.
The governor who has demanded accountability from corporate interests like Enbridge and its Line 5 pipeline through the Straits of Mackinac is now actively courting companies that demand immense public resources, with long-term implications for the air we breathe and the water we drink, in exchange for limited economic return.
It’s perplexing — and hard not to wonder what changed.
The sudden enthusiasm for data centers is especially surprising given the industry’s profile: massive energy consumption, minimal permanent job creation, substantial taxpayer subsidies, and heavy strain on local infrastructure.
Yet Michigan is now extending public money to data center operators — many of them among the most powerful and profitable companies in the world — as if they were fragile startups in need of nurturing.
While Whitmer has leaned enthusiastically into promoting data centers as a symbol of Michigan’s high-tech future, Attorney General Dana Nessel, a fellow Democrat, has struck a far more cautious tone, underscoring the risks that come with rushing such projects forward. 
A new unifying issue: Just about everyone hates data centers

Whitmer, like Trump, has heralded proposed developments as transformative investments, framing the industry as a competitive necessity in a rapidly evolving digital economy. Nessel, by contrast, has repeatedly pressed for rigorous oversight, intervening in utility proceedings and urging full public hearings to ensure that residents are not saddled with higher energy costs, hidden subsidies, or environmental burdens. 
Where Whitmer emphasizes opportunity and momentum, Nessel stresses transparency, accountability, and the need to safeguard public resources. The divergence between the two reveals more than just a policy disagreement but a fundamental difference in governing instincts: one eager to accelerate economic development, the other insistent that Michigan not trade away long-term public protections for short-term headlines.
If she continues down this path, Whitmer risks transforming a strong, people-first narrative into a muddled story of corporate appeasement and economic strategy on autopilot.
If she does have political ambitions beyond the end of her governorship, which seems to be a source of back-and-forth speculation, this is a puzzling path to take toward wooing Democratic voters exhausted by industry-driven agendas that seek to paper over poisoned water and polluted air as necessary progress. 
And that’s what makes this moment so baffling: she doesn’t need to do any of this. Not for her legacy, not for Michigan, and not for the future she’s already spent years shaping.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Facetune_22-04-2025-13-24-00-1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-05 11:58:20.621137

As of Oct. 1, penalties increased for those caught driving over 100 mph, and drivers convicted of either two or three moving violations, must take a driver retraining course. There are also increased fines for drivers who do not yield to pedestrians and new helmet requirements for motorcycle drivers under 21.
Similarly, red light cameras and speeding cameras continue to pop up across the state, since state law allowed for the installation of automated traffic regulation in 2023. Many municipalities and cities are continuing to push for additional cameras.
Historically, fatal accidents occur on Connecticut roads fairly consistently through the year, although summer months have seen slightly more in some years.
That could be attributed in part to traffic volume, which increases in the summer on I-95. 
But while roads in the state tend to be busier in the summer, that could slow traffic overall. According to Department of Transportation data, more drivers tend to speed in the winter months.
Meanwhile, an analysis of each state’s road safety reported that Connecticut could use more laws addressing child and passenger protections in cars.
Connecticut received a ranking of “yellow” or “caution,” from the report, published by Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety. While surrounding states New York and Rhode Island received “green” ratings, based on their traffic policies, most states in the nation aligned with Connecticut. 
The report gave Connecticut credit for the adoption of red light cameras, and the state received a “good” ranking for automated red light and speeding camera usage and allowance.
However, Connecticut received “danger” ratings for seatbelt laws. While the state requires that all front seat occupants wear seatbelts, it is not required for back seat occupants over the age of 16 to wear a seatbelt. Motorcyclists over the age of 21 are not required to wear a helmet.
As for child passenger safety laws, Connecticut fell in line with 38 other states, receiving a “danger” rating. Most states in the nation, like Connecticut, do not require children who have outgrown a front-facing car seat to use a booster seat. Instead, any children 8 or older or over 60 pounds are allowed to use just a seatbelt.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GooV7-number-of-fatal-crashes-in-ct-drops--1024x652.png,,,2025-12-05 11:58:20.621137

Benson had said that ballots returned with mismatched numbers between the ballot stub and the envelope should be counted as a “challenged ballot,” but Judge Brock A. Swartzle ruled Wednesday that if the numbers do not match, the vote cannot be counted. 
Swartzle’s order specifically noted that in Michigan election law, as amended in February 2024, rules about the ballot stub and envelope numbers matching were written into law. 
“While the Secretary can issue instructions and guidance, those must be fully consistent with the laws of this state,” he writes. 
The case, brought by the Republican National Committee, the Michigan Republican Party and Chesterfield Township Clerk Cindy Berry, was first filed in state court in September 2024.  SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Benson’s lawyers had argued that because there was no specific instruction in the law about what to do with a ballot if it was returned with mismatching numbers, it fell within her realm to make a decision on. Swartzle pushed back on that argument, writing that though there is no specific guidance on what to do in that situation, the law is clear that such a ballot should not count. 
“Our Legislature could not have been clearer: if the condition is met—i.e., if the numbers match—then the ballot is to be tabulated,” Swartzle wrote. “The obverse is equally plain and unambiguous: when the numbers do not match, or when no match can be made because there is a missing stub, the board of election inspectors has no statutory authority to tabulate the ballot.”
Swartzle left one question open for a further decision on the case, and asked both parties to submit further briefs on what should be done with an absentee ballot with mismatching numbers, including if an elector should be granted the chance to cure the ballot.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-182152179-700x467-1.jpg,,,2025-12-05 10:59:58.344920

(Photo: Duke Energy)A trade group representing large industrial utility customers is claiming Duke Energy’s proposed rate hike does not comply with North Carolina state law because it only covers two years.
The Carolina Industrial Group for Fair Utility Rates, or CIGFUR, is asking the North Carolina Utilities Commission to deem Duke Energy’s rate increase application incomplete, or to reject the proposal completely.
Duke Energy’s application, filed with the NCUC on Nov. 20, asks for a 15% rate increase over the next two years. This would apply to Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, the company’s two utilities in the state.
But this timeline deviates from state law, according to CIGFUR’s NCUC filing Nov. 26.
“HB 951 established a specific three-year rate plan with express guardrails in place that were painstakingly negotiated through a 9-month stakeholder process established by Speaker Hall,” Susan Vick, a registered lobbyist representing CIGFUR, told NC Newsline.
House Bill 951, titled “Energy Solutions for North Carolina,” became law in October 2021.
Vick described the measure as a product of “intense lobbying” by Duke Energy, who wanted quicker cost recovery. The tradeoff the utility agreed to was to give more transparency and certainty to the ratemaking process for consumers.
“That Duke now seeks to unilaterally change the parameters and submit a plan that is different than what HB 951 requires is a concern,” Vick said, “and requires NC industrial customers to weigh in and object.”
Bill Norton, a spokesperson for Duke Energy, told NC Newsline the company is seeking a two-year multiyear rate plan for 2027 through 2028 so that future rate cases align with a planned merger of Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress.
“If that combination is approved by regulators next year, a two-year rate plan enables our customers to start benefitting from the efficiencies of a combined utility sooner, and these will be our final rate cases as separate utilities,” Norton wrote.
Rates for the two utilities would gradually blend over time in future filings after Jan. 1, 2027, subject to approval from the NCUC, according to Norton.
State leaders like Attorney General Jeff Jackson and Gov. Josh Stein have voiced their opposition to Duke Energy’s proposed increases, NC Newsline previously reported.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/DukeEnergy-Damage-from-Helene-1024x650.jpg,,,2025-12-05 10:59:58.344920

California is home to nearly 1 million children with physical, developmental or cognitive disabilities — most of whom receive at least some services through Medicaid. But cuts from President Donald Trump’s sweeping budget bill have put those crucial services at risk — leaving California parents worried about their children’s futures.
As CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones explains, the $1-trillion cuts to Medicaid over 10 years help fund a broad range of services to disabled children, including speech and physical therapy, wheelchairs and in-home aides. They can receive therapy through regional centers, which seek to help people with disabilities live as independently as possible. California’s regional centers work through a network of 21 nonprofits — a third of which are funded by Medicaid.
Medicaid also pays for therapists, equipment, vision and hearing tests and other services for schools, which are accessible to all students, not just those with disabilities. 
But because of the federal budget’s funding cuts — which were made to help offset the cost of extending Trump’s 2017 tax cuts that mostly benefit the wealthy — money for the regional centers will run out by the end of January, and it’s unclear what services will be on the chopping block.

Kristin Wright, executive director of inclusive practices and systems at the Sacramento County Office of Education: “We have a delicate web of services that, combined, support a whole child, a whole family. So when the basic foundational structure is upended, like Medicaid, for example, it’s not just one cut from a knife. It’s multiple.”

The cuts are raising alarm among some California families, such as Los Angeles resident Lelah Coppedge. She and her husband have a 16-year-old son with cerebral palsy. Though both parents work and have private health insurance, they could not afford their son’s care — which includes a nurse who comes four days a week to help him with basic activities — without government help.

Coppedge: “I go down this rabbit hole of worst-case scenarios. Before this happened, I felt there was a clear path for my son. Now that path is going away, and it’s terrifying.”

Newsom pitches nuance for tech CEOs

For making what he views as concessions to the Trump administration, Gov. Gavin Newsom has been quick to admonish some industries and institutions — like when he slammed law firms for “selling out” to the administration’s demands this year, and threatened to pull state funding from California universities that made certain agreements with Trump.
But when it comes to Big Tech, the governor takes a more forgiving approach, writes CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang. 
At The New York Times’ finance summit Wednesday, Newsom characterized tech leaders’ efforts to court Trump’s favor as “situational” and that he doesn’t see their apparent shift to the right “as big a shift as perhaps others do.”

Newsom: “I think it’s a little bit more, I don’t want to say the word transactional, but it’s fiduciary.”

As a former mayor of San Francisco, Newsom has had a long relationship with tech executives. California relies on the industry’s gains to help balance its budget, and if Newsom decides to run for president in 2028, he could find Silicon Valley’s wealthy donors valuable.

Peter Leroe-Muñoz, a senior vice president at the Bay Area Council: “At the end of the day the governor recognizes that we all have a stake in the success of California and so not cutting off ties or undermining those industry players is in the long term success of the Golden State.”

Poll: Most Californians tired of fed’s immigration crackdown

A new poll examining California voters’ opinion of the Trump administration’s campaign to rein in immigrants, including those with criminal convictions, shows waning support for the administration’s policies — even among a slim majority of Republicans, reports CalMatters’ Wendy Fry.
Commissioned by pro-immigrant organizations, the poll by Goodwin Simon Strategic Research surveyed 1,200 self-identified voters. It found that 84% of Democrats, 61% of independents and 54% of Republicans agreed that “even if someone does have a record, they deserve due process … before being deported.” 
On the topic of California’s sanctuary laws, 61% said they want California prisons to stop directly handing immigrants over to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for deportation. 
The new poll is consistent with other recent surveys that found voters disapprove Trump’s immigration tactics. Last week, a UC Berkeley poll found that one-third of Latino voters who supported Trump now regret their decision, and the Public Policy Institute of California reported 71% of Californians surveyed disapproved of the job ICE is doing.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-05 15:11:27+00:00,CT Mirror,US work authorizations for legal immigrants slashed from 5 years to 18 months,Ariana Figueroa | States Newsroom,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/05/work-authorization-slashed-legal-immigrants/,The new policy follows the shooting of two West Virginia National Guard members by an Afghan national granted asylum earlier this year.,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration Thursday announced new restrictions for immigrants, reducing the work authorization periods from five years to 18 months, the latest crackdown on legal immigration.
The new policy follows the shooting of two West Virginia National Guard members by an Afghan national granted asylum earlier this year. 
The shift will not only affect hundreds of thousands of immigrants, but the shortened period for work authorization could create massive backlogs at the agency responsible for processing legal immigration requests, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. 
“Reducing the maximum validity period for employment authorization will ensure that those seeking to work in the United States do not threaten public safety or promote harmful anti-American ideologies,” USCIS Director Joseph Edlow said in a statement.
“After the attack on National Guard service members in our nation’s capital by an alien who was admitted into this country by the previous administration, it’s even more clear that USCIS must conduct frequent vetting of aliens,” he continued. 
Immigrants affected by the new changes include refugees; those granted asylum; those with a withholding of removal; those with pending applications for asylum or withholding of removal; those adjusting their status, for example by gaining a green card; and those who fall under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act of 1997.
That act applies to certain Nicaraguans, Cubans, Salvadorans, Guatemalans, nationals of former Soviet bloc countries and their dependents who in the 1990s had applied for asylum and were systematically denied.
Additionally, USCIS fees for applying for permits and other paperwork increased as a result of the massive tax and spending passage that Republicans passed over the summer and President Donald Trump signed into law. For initial employment authorization, fees are now $550 and $275 to renew. 
Following the shooting, U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died. A second guard member, U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains critically wounded but hospitalized in stable condition. 
In response, the Trump administration has ramped up its crackdown on legal immigration and highlighted the need for its mass deportation campaign. The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, pleaded not guilty to several charges in court on Tuesday. 
This week, all immigration applications from 19 countries listed on Trump’s “high-risk” countries or travel ban from earlier this year, were paused — a move that freezes processing for green card holders and citizenship applications.

(Photo by Alex Brandon - Pool/Getty Images)TOPEKA — The Trump administration in January cut off 36 people who were bound for Kansas when it canceled travel plans for refugees who planned to relocate to the United States.
Months later, cuts in aid through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act continue to eliminate needed food services for immigrants living in Kansas.
One refugee was a mother waiting to join her family, which had immigrated without her because she was pregnant and unable to travel, said Yeni Silva-Renteria, executive director of International Rescue Committee in Wichita.
Today, that mother still awaits approval to reunite with her husband and children who live in Wichita, she said.
“Now she’s stuck,” Silva-Renteria said. “People come to the office all the time, asking when is my son coming, when is my wife coming, and we cannot answer that at this moment. People are going through a lot of stress right now, and it’s very difficult. This world right now, especially within resettlement and within the immigration system — I’ve never experienced this much stress.”
That stress ramped up when new regulations for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program went into effect in November.
Many immigrants who had previously received SNAP support for food and Temporary Assistance to Need Families, or TANF, were kicked off the programs, including human trafficking victims and refugees, Silva-Renteria said. 
Silva-Renteria stressed that anyone in the country illegally was never able to receive those government dollars, as is often erroneously reported.
Refugees, who often have been living in refugee camps for years before they are approved for relocation, usually receive a work permit and a Social Security card and, typically, eligibility for programs like SNAP to help them as they adjust to their new lives, she said.
SNAP and TANF are especially important when refugees first arrive in the country, Silva-Renteria said.
“The expectation is that within 90 days they’ll obtain a job,” she said. “Within the systems, we know that they’re not going to be self-sufficient within 90 days. Especially in Kansas, day care is a challenge, transportation is a challenge, the language barrier.”
It doesn’t mean that they’re not working, she said, or that they’re taking advantage of the system.
“There is an investment that we provide to those families until they get on their feet,” Silva-Renteria said. “These are people who have been at refugee camps for several years and have endured a lot of trauma. Some of them are the only survivors in their family. That support is critical for them because there’s no other way they’re going to make it without relying on that assistance.”
 
Eliminating support
Federal law previously allowed certain categories of noncitizen residents, such as refugees and human trafficking victims, to receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, said Erin La Row, spokeswoman for the Department for Children and Families.
“In state fiscal year 2025, the average number of legal non-citizen residents receiving Kansas SNAP benefits per month was 9,483,” she said.
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act changed eligibility, limiting it to U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, lawful permanent residents, Cuban and Haitian entrants and Compact of Free Association citizens, which is an agreement between the United States and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau, La Row said.
Beginning Nov. 1, 4,039 individuals in the state were no longer eligible to receive benefits, although the loss of those benefits may not occur until DCF processes a review of their case, La Row said. SNAP requires recertification case reviews to be done within the next six to 12 months, La Row said.
La Row said DCF couldn’t be certain who would lose benefits until each case was reviewed, so after Nov. 1, all applications, reviews or other changes would be verified through the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements system, called SAVE.
“Any family that is no longer eligible to receive benefits will be notified once that review has taken place,” she said. “Additionally, we are working with the International Rescue Committee to determine how best to notify families, as that is the entity that engages with the majority of the population losing their eligibility for these benefits.”
 
The fallout
Silva-Renteria said her organization is doing its best to work with immigrant families as their assistance disappears.
“We’re doing a lot of outreach and communicating with the families. They have to understand this new change and see what that means for them,” she said.
IRC is connecting families with community resources and also using donations to its organization for food and other types of assistance.
Their work happens amid the organization’s own federal grant losses, including the shutdown of a grant funding its resettlement program that forced the layoff of 11 people in February.
“We have minimized our expenses as much as we can to prioritize direct services and support to the families,” Silva-Renteria said. “There’s only so much we can do.”
She and her staff have watched as immigrants have been vilified across the country, including online discussions and political comments after an Afghani immigrant shot two National Guard members.
Cautious about being misunderstood, Silva-Renteria said she doesn’t support violence in any way, but she knows that one person’s actions don’t speak for their entire immigrant communities.
“We do need a lot of support, obviously financially but also understanding and awareness that we’re dealing with people,” she said. “We’re dealing with families, children who deserve a safe space, a home, a place. Unfortunately right now, even within our community in Wichita, some of them may not feel as welcome or as safe just because of the climate.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/trumpjuly42025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-05 10:59:58.344920

It’s been more than a month since ICE’s agreement with CoreCivic and Torrance County regarding the facility expired. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)More than a month after a contract expired governing the operation of a New Mexico immigrant detention facility, local officials have yet to receive any updates from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency or the facility’s private operator CoreCivic, officials told Source New Mexico on Thursday.
The inter-governmental services agreement between Torrance County, ICE and CoreCivic  expired Oct. 31 during the federal government shutdown. But even after the government reopened Nov. 13, County Manager Jordan Barela said he has neither received an updated contract from ICE nor word of when it could be renewed.
“We’ve been checking weekly, and the feedback we have received is that ICE is still evaluating the terms and conditions of a potential extension,”  Barela told Source via email Thursday. 
Torrance County immigration detention center continues operating without ICE contract

An ICE spokesperson did not respond to Source New Mexico’s request for comment on the contract. Ryan Gustin, a CoreCivic spokesperson, did not respond to questions about the contract status, but instead responded that the company is “committed to providing safe, humane and respectful care for everyone entrusted to us, and we take seriously our obligation to adhere to all applicable federal detention standards.”
Advocates for approximately 550 ICE detainees in the jail, as well as U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM), say the lack of a contract means ICE should immediately stop detaining immigrants at the facility. They point to ICE standard operating procedures that require ICE to remove detainees and equipment from the facility absent a contract, as well as long-standing issues about detainee treatment at the facility.
In a statement Thursday to Source New Mexico, Heinrich said he remains “deeply concerned about the situation” at the facility in Estancia, noting that an inspector general overseeing ICE called for the facility’s closure in 2022.

“Conditions have not improved, and now they’re purportedly running the facility without a contract,” he said. “ICE’s inaction on this contract, and refusal to meet their own minimum detention standards, is another example of the agency shunning accountability.”
Heinrich sent a letter to ICE on Nov. 7 demanding the agency identify what authority it has to continue detaining immigrants in Estancia and that it transfer ICE detainees out of the facility in the meantime. ICE had not responded to Heinrich as of Thursday, according to a spokesperson.
Meanwhile, about 30 ICE detainees signed a handwritten letter to Source New Mexico recently saying they continue to face poor conditions inside the jail, including problems accessing tablets they rely on for various necessities.
“Tablets are our only means for vital services such as communication, medical care at the center, and our only way to ‘complain’ about our various needs, not to mention our only access to legal resources for an adequate defense process for the detainees here,” the detainees wrote in Spanish.
Gustin said CoreCivic was unaware of any “recent significant outages or issues with the tablets,” but noted that staff immediately create a service ticket when they learn of technological issues.

Heinrich’s staff also previously noted non-working tablets during a visit in late May and included that in a letter to ICE that also reported complaints of verbal and physical abuse, lack of access to laundry and lack of medical care. 
Previously, detainees, including Rogelio Bolufé of Cuba, said they were repeatedly denied access to the legal library and to legal aid groups, allegations that CoreCivic also denied. 
The letter, which Source received Nov. 24, has signatures from inmates who say they lacked access to the tablets since Nov. 14 due to what jail operators described as a “technical failure.” It’s unclear from the letter whether the problem has been resolved, and Haymel de la Vega, Bolufé’s friend and contact, did not respond to Source’s requests Thursday for an update.
The letter’s signatories said they are from Guatemala, Honduras, Cuba, Mexico and Ecuador. One detainee who identified himself as Edin Santos of Honduras wrote that he missed his son’s birthday due to the issue.

On Wednesday, Cordova Telecom Cooperative and GCI announced a partnership to lay an undersea fiber optic cable from Juneau to Cordova and a second cable from Cordova to Seward.
When open for service in fall 2027, the two cables will provide high-speed internet to small communities in Prince William Sound and northern Southeast Alaska. 
The development matters to the rest of the state as well, because when combined, they will provide a route for internet traffic between the Railbelt and Outside. Currently, four undersea cables through the Gulf of Alaska are the principal routes for internet and phone traffic between Alaska and the rest of the world. 
Matanuska Telecom Association opened the state’s first overland fiber connection in 2020 as an alternative, and the new route will give the state another redundant option, said Cordova Telecom CEO Jeremiah Beckett.
“With what we’ve built out, scalability wise, we could put all the current Alaska traffic on our network if needed,” Beckett said.

While satellite internet services like Starlink have transformed life in rural Alaska, ground-based fiber internet remains the backbone of worldwide telecommunications, delivering service faster and in volumes that satellites can’t provide. 
“It’s kind of like rural communities that don’t have the ferry,” Beckett said. “Places without fiber don’t have the same access that folks with fiber do. So this is really to help connect those rural areas and give them the same access to the digital economy and marketplace as the rest of the world.”
Despite their advantages, fiber-optic cables can be vulnerable.
“Up north, it’s ice scouring … and in our area, it’s typically ship anchors and earthquakes,” Beckett said. 
Alaskans have become intimately familiar with the consequences of broken cables in recent years.
Northern and northwest Alaska are particularly familiar: Quintillion’s fiber-optic cable has been severed three times in two years. The latest break wasn’t fixed for more than seven months because sea ice precluded repairs. That caused widespread problems in areas served by the cable.
In March, a break in a subsea cable left the Alaska Legislature to do business on paper for a day and knocked out both cellphone and internet service for much of Juneau. Juneau had alternatives; a temporary fix was in place within days.
When the cable leading to Sitka broke in 2024, it took weeks to repair. People canceled surgeries and businesses went cash-only until internet service was restored.
Adding a backup fiber route reduces the odds of blackouts like those. Currently, Cordova is served by a single undersea fiber line through Prince William Sound to Valdez.
When the project is complete, internet and phone traffic will have three possible routes: north, west, and east. 
The two cables will cost roughly $88 million combined, according to figures provided by Beckett, and the project is principally funded through two federal grants. Cordova Telecom is paying for part of the project, as is GCI, which will be what Beckett calls an “anchor tenant and partner.”
“It was a good matchup for both of our long-term goals,” he said.
In a prepared statement, GCI senior vice president Billy Wailand praised the plan, which is formally known as Fiber Internet Serving Homes in Southeast Alaska, or FISH in SEAK. 
“Critical state services require network diversity,” he said. “GCI turned up the first subsea cable to Alaska in 1999 and landed a second diverse fiber in 2008. We are thrilled to partner with CTC on its FISH in SEAK project, which includes a next-generation cable that ensures Alaska and its capital city continue to benefit from the newest technologies and adds another crucial layer of redundancy to the network.”
Communities along the cable route will see huge changes, Beckett said. Residents of Pelican on Chichagof Island in Southeast Alaska, who use boardwalks instead of roads and four-wheelers instead of cars, will be able to get fiber internet access directly to their homes.
The island village of Chenega in Prince William Sound, which has about 50 year-round residents, likewise will have new access to fiber internet. 
Alaska’s Lost Coast, between Glacier Bay and Yakutat, could be dotted with cellphone towers. 
Beckett, who grew up in Cordova, returned to the town with his spouse 12 years ago, “basically when Cordova got its subsea fiber,” he said. “We were both teleworkers, and that created the opportunity for us to move back to Alaska, essentially.”
Since then, he’s seen internet service improve and has become head of his local telecom, which has just 20 employees. 
Because it’s a cooperative, it’s run as a nonprofit, he said. That means the telecom’s goal is to deliver faster service and low rates, not necessarily generate a profit.
In Yakutat, “a few years ago, you couldn’t get cell service anywhere,” Beckett said. 
“We’ve upgraded the cell service there to 4G and outside of the fishermen complaining because their wives can get hold of them, it was a huge boost for the community,” he said.
“If someone gets hurt, they can call the paramedics and not have to drive 20 miles before they get to service. … It’s giving people reasons to think about moving home, because it’s one less inhibitor to be back in Alaska,” Beckett said. 
“Yakutat actually got a new clinic a couple years ago, and then with this, I think they’re going to see some good growth. Everyone likes core services, right?”

Kevin Sparks, R-Midland, looks over a proposed congressional map during a redistricting hearing at the Texas Capitol in Austin on Aug. 6, 2025. (REUTERS/Nuri Vallbona)Texas can use its new, GOP friendly congressional map while a legal challenge plays out, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, temporarily pausing a lower court ruling that had blocked the map from going into effect. 
With the Dec. 8 candidate filing deadline fast approaching, the high court’s decision likely means Texas’ new map will be used for the 2026 midterm elections.
Justice Samuel Alito ruled that it was “indisputable” that Texas’ motivation for redistricting was “pure and simple” partisan advantage, which the court has previously ruled is permissible. Alito rejected the argument that Texas had engaged in racial gerrymandering.
The ruling is a major win for Republicans in Texas and nationally. President Donald Trump had pushed Texas to redraw its map over the summer, hoping to secure five additional GOP seats to shore up the party’s narrow majority in the U.S. House through the midterms.
On Nov. 18, two federal judges barred Texas from using the new map for 2026, saying there was evidence state lawmakers had racially gerrymandered in redrawing the lines. Galveston District Judge Jeffrey Brown, a Trump appointee, authored the opinion ordering Texas to return to its 2021 map, while 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Jerry Smith vociferously dissented.
The state asked the Supreme Court to overturn Brown’s ruling entirely, but that could take weeks or months to proceed through the court system, especially if the justices decide they want to hear arguments in Washington, D.C. With Thursday’s ruling, the justices have temporarily paused Brown’s ruling while that longer legal process can play out.
The ruling said the lower court, under Brown, “improperly inserted itself into an active primary campaign, causing much confusion and upsetting the delicate federal-state balance in elections.”
The new map, approved by the Texas Legislature and signed by Gov. Greg Abbott in August, is engineered to give Republicans control of 30 of the state’s 38 congressional districts, up from the 25 they currently hold under the 2021 map. Numerous Republican candidates have stepped forward to run in the newly favorable districts, while several Democratic incumbents were pushed into nearby districts already occupied by another Democrat, forcing them to contemplate primaries or retire.
Brown’s ruling upended those calculations. But in restoring the new map, the Supreme Court likely ensured that Republicans running for redrawn districts will get to campaign under the new lines in 2026.
Attorney General Ken Paxton celebrated the ruling, saying it was a win for Texas and every conservative who is tired of watching the left try to upend the political system with bogus lawsuits.”
Texas Democrats, meanwhile, condemned the outcome, with House Democratic Caucus Chair Rep. Gene Wu of Houston saying the high court had “failed” Texans.
“This is what the end of the Voting Rights Act looks like: courts that won’t protect minority communities even when the evidence is staring them in the face,” Wu said.
In her dissent, Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan criticized the court for reversing Brown’s 160-page ruling “based on its perusal, over a holiday weekend, of a cold paper record.”
“Today’s order disrespects the work of a District Court that did everything one could ask to carry out its charge,” Kagan wrote on behalf of the liberal justices. “Today’s order disserves the millions of Texans whom the District Court found were assigned to their new districts based on their race.”

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Maine’s Somali legislators denounced President Donald Trump’s increasing attacks on the immigrant community in an open letter on Thursday.
“This moment is bigger than any one politician or any one community,” wrote Reps. Mana Abdi of Lewiston, Deqa Dhalac of South Portland and Yusuf Yusuf of Portland. The three are the first Somali-Americans to serve in the Maine House of Representatives.
“What we are witnessing is part of a coordinated effort to destabilize immigrant, Indigenous, and other communities of color, undermine democratic norms, and reshape the fabric of America through exclusion and extrajudicial force,” they wrote.
In the wake of last week’s shooting of two National Guard members in the District of Columbia by an Afghan national who was granted asylum, the Trump administration has taken several drastic steps to halt the nation’s legal immigration and asylum processes. At the same time, the president has turned his ire on the Somali-American community, launching an immigration enforcement campaign in Minnesota’s Twin Cities targeted at Somali people, who he called “garbage” during a Tuesday cabinet meeting.
Minnesota, followed by Ohio, is home to the largest Somali community in the country. Outside of those two states, Maine’s Androscoggin County, which includes Lewiston, boasts one of the nation’s most robust Somali populations.

In their letter, Maine’s Democratic lawmakers said the president’s “dehumanizing” rhetoric is dangerous because it could embolden people “to harass, intimidate, or threaten our neighbors.”
They also condemned the president’s actions to limit temporary protected status for certain immigrant populations, leaving them open to deportation. TPS is granted to people who hail from countries deemed too dangerous for a return, due to violence or major natural disasters. 
Within hours of Wednesday’s shooting, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services halted all immigration requests from Afghan nationals. The administration also ended TPS for more than 330,000 nationals from Haiti. And Thursday, the head of the USCIS announced that by direction of Trump the agency would reexamine every green card application from “every country of concern,” which are the 19 countries on the president’s travel ban list.  
In the letter, the Maine lawmakers said the majority of those being targeted by the Trump administration’s policies “are law-abiding individuals who are legitimately working to attain citizenship,” many of whom “have called America their home for decades, raising families, contributing to our economy, and strengthening our communities.”
“Every person in this nation, regardless of immigration status, is entitled to due process. That is not optional,” they wrote. “Today, TPS holders are being targeted. If we remain silent, we normalize a politics that can, and will, be turned against others.”
In a separate statement, Maine Gov. Janet Mills condemned the president’s comments about Somali immigrants and said he is “demeaning the very idea and spirit of America.”
Mills said the “beauty of America is not that we are bound by a common racial or religious heritage,” but rather people are bound by the principle of being “treated equally under the law and we are all guaranteed equal opportunity to succeed.”
Other community leaders have also spoken out. Lewiston resident Safiya Khalid, who previously served as the first Somali-American elected to the city council, said Trump’s targeting of Somali communities is “incomprehensible, harmful, and absolutely appalling.”
“I expect our state leaders and elected officials to speak out forcefully against this vile attack and to show unwavering support for their Somali constituents,” Khalid wrote on social media. “This is not a moment for silence or political calculation. Our communities deserve dignity, respect, and allies who will stand with us when it matters most.”

“They are ready to go,” Gov. Henry McMaster told reporters. “They’re pleased to go; they’re serious about it, and they’ll do their job.”
The deployment comes a week after a West Virginia soldier was killed and another was severely injured in a shooting attack that the Trump administration has called an act of terrorism. In response, Trump has ordered an additional 500 guardsmen to Washington.
The second deployment round of South Carolina’s guardsmen, which will last 90 days, was scheduled before the shooting took place and is not part of the ramp up. There are no plans for an extension or an increase in number of soldiers, according to a statement from the South Carolina adjutant general’s office.
Soldiers of the 4-118th Combined Arms Battalion, based in Columbia, were the first from the state to go to Washington in August as part of what the president has coined “Operation D.C. Safe and Beautiful.” The group of 200 guardsmen remained in the capital for about 30 days before returning to the Palmetto State.
This time, national guardsmen of the 1st Battalion 178th Field Artillery Regiment, based in Georgetown, were assigned to rotate in and relieve members of Georgia’s national guard.
“Their primary mission is to provide critical support to law enforcement agencies, reinforcing safety and security for residents, workers, and visitors in the nation’s capital,” reads the statement from the adjutant general’s office.
The 178th has previously deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, according to its commander Lt. Col. W. Brunson De Pass III.

“The leadership in the state of South Carolina trusts this battalion. This battalion has a lot of history of doing things the right way and being successful,” De Pass said in a statement.
During the August deployment, South Carolina guardsmen provided security and patrols at transit stations, events and popular destinations, including the National Mall, Union Station, and the White House.
Both times the troops have been deployed under an agreement called Title 32. Under this arrangement, the federal government covers the cost, but Gov. Henry McMaster retains control and can call the guard back at any time.
Upon their arrival in Washington, D.C., the guardsmen will be briefed and receive additional training from federal law enforcement.
“We are confident our soldiers are trained, equipped and ready to accomplish their duties,” Maj. Gen. Robin B. Stilwell, adjutant general for South Carolina, said in a statement.
Meanwhile, prosecutors have charged Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national with first-degree murder, assault with intent to kill and illegal possession of a firearm in the shooting that killed Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and critically wounded Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24.
Their fellow guardsmen shot Lakanwal. He pleaded not guilty from his hospital bed Tuesday.
On Nov. 27, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to end the deployments by guard units, declaring the use of troops was “unlawful” and usurped local officials’ authority.
The order had been on hold for 21 days as the U.S. Department of Justice filed an appeal. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals officially continued the hold Thursday as it considers the case.

She’s fighting to clean it up,Deborah Brennan,,,,,https://calmatters.org/environment/2025/12/tijuana-river-paloma-aguirre-pollution/,The Tijuana River’s sewage contamination continues to sicken communities in southern San Diego County. San Diego County Supervisor Paloma Aguirre has become a leading force in pushing for binational fixes and emergency funding to protect public health.,"In summary
The Tijuana River’s sewage contamination continues to sicken communities in southern San Diego County. San Diego County Supervisor Paloma Aguirre has become a leading force in pushing for binational fixes and emergency funding to protect public health.


Hours after a November storm, the Tijuana River flooded a grove of trees in Imperial Beach, gushed through a row of calverts and exploded into mounds of fetid foam. 
This is ground zero for the contaminated river, which sickens thousands of people in southern San Diego County.
“The Tijuana River is one of, if not the most polluted, river in the entire United States,” said San Diego County Supervisor Paloma Aguirre, who viewed the overflowing river wearing black rain boots and a hot pink respirator mask. “The river is carrying dangerous chemicals, pollutants, pathogens and toxic gases that are impacting South San Diego communities.”
The site, known as the Saturn Boulevard hot spot, is part of a system of polluted waterways and failed sewage treatment plants in the cross-border region. In the ocean, the contamination leaves swimmers and surfers with breathing problems, digestive illness and rashes. Unsafe conditions have closed parts of the Imperial Beach shoreline for three years.
Last year, researchers discovered that the pollution is airborne as well. Foul-smelling hydrogen sulfide emissions near the river sometimes rise hundreds of times higher than the state’s odor threshold. At those levels the gas triggers headaches, nausea, eye irritation and respiratory distress. And there are other chemicals, viruses and bacteria in the mix. 
For children, the effects are worse, said Tom Csanadi, an Imperial Beach physician who has been active in the issue. Their lung surface area to body size is higher, which means they absorb more toxins. Children breathe faster than adults and they’re still growing, so it can affect their body tissues more severely. There are 11 schools within three kilometers of the hot spot.
“It could lower IQ, stunt cognitive development,” Csanadi said.
As a surfer, activist and elected leader, Aguirre has spent two decades tackling this problem, which she considers one of the worst environmental crises in the country.
“She’s been at the forefront of the advocacy side of this for a long, long time, before her political career even started,” said Falk Feddersen, an oceanographer with Scripps Institution of Oceanography who has mapped sewage flows up the coast from Mexico.
A cocktail of chemicals
While storm water seeped across the road at the hot spot, a swiftwater rescue truck drove through puddles, scanning for stranded motorists. The culverts under the crossing were installed to keep flooding under control, but they also churn the water, spewing noxious gas and other pollutants. 
“The unintended consequence is that it’s exacerbating the release of all the molecules and aerosols into the air,” Aguirre said. “It’s literally rocketing them into the environment.”
Hydrogen sulfide, with its distinctive rotten egg odor, is an indicator of that toxic brew, said Kim Prather, an atmospheric chemist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. She raised the alarm about airborne pollution from the Tijuana River last year.

“That’s one in a cocktail of thousands of compounds,” she said. “It’s a blessing that it smells. I know it sounds strange, but it tells you to get away.”
Aguirre described her own struggles with Tijuana River pollution, including migraines, chest pain, shortness of breath, and waking in the middle of the night to an odor she likened to a “porta potty.”
Recent improvements to wastewater treatment plants in the U.S. and Mexico have reduced water pollution by keeping tens of millions of gallons of sewage out of the ocean each day. Aguirre and others celebrate that news, but note the river still contaminates surrounding areas.
More big upgrades are in the works on both sides of the border, but fixing the Saturn Boulevard hot spot quickly could offer immediate relief, Aguirre said.
“This is a very specific and low hanging fruit that will at least begin to mitigate the amount of gases being released into the air and benefit tens of thousands of people that live here,” she said.
Waves of pollution
Tijuana River pollution dates back to at least the 1930s, when the U.S. and Mexican governments built the first cross-border sewage plants. As Tijuana’s population soared with its booming industry, the city’s waste outstripped its treatment systems. Plant failures and sewage spills became common in the early 2000s, along with frequent beach closures along the south San Diego coast.
That’s when Aguirre encountered cross-border pollution in the surf at Imperial Beach. Growing up in Puerto Vallarta Mexico, she was used to surfing in muddy water after rains, so the discolored waves didn’t seem worrisome. 
“I remember going out here in Imperial Beach while the water was chocolate brown, not knowing that it’s nothing like what I was used to, because that was sewage,” she said.
She was the only one at the beach that day, except for a man posting signs stating “Clean water now.” He was Serge Dedina, executive director of the environmental group WildCoast, and he enlisted her in the fight against sewage pollution.
Aguirre first volunteered for the organization and soon joined its staff. She worked there for more than a decade, while earning a master’s degree in marine biodiversity and conservation at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. At WildCoast she organized a citizens’ group, advocated for improved water testing using DNA analysis, and served on working groups for a binational agreement on cross-border pollution, called Minute 320.
When Dedina was elected mayor of Imperial Beach in 2014, Aguirre saw a path to solving the sewage problem.
“I thought, well, if he can do it I can do it,” she said. “And I built on the momentum that he was able to create on this issue.”

Aguirre won a seat on the Imperial Beach City Council in 2018 and was elected mayor in 2022, when Dedina left office. With a bigger platform, she called on California and the federal government to declare a state of emergency over the border pollution problem and lobbied to classify the area as a Superfund site.
Those efforts haven’t gained traction, but other angles yielded results. Imperial Beach sued the International Boundary and Water Commission with the city of Chula Vista and Port of San Diego in 2018, alleging that it violated the Clean Water Act and other federal laws by failing to control coastal sewage pollution. They settled the lawsuit in 2023 with a promise of more resources and binational cooperation. 
“My tenure as mayor of IB really focused on advocating and working in a bipartisan fashion to secure the additional funding that was needed,” to fix cross-border pollution, she said.

Aguirre led delegations of local officials to Washington, D.C. to drum up money for costly infrastructure upgrades needed to get the sewage problem under control. She met with White House officials in both the Biden and Trump administrations, and with lawmakers who had served as Navy SEALS and had experienced the pollution problem at BUD/S, the Navy SEAL training program in Coronado.
In July, Aguirre won a special election for an open San Diego County Board of Supervisors seat. She immediately led county plans to study the health effects of cross-border pollution and asked the state for $50 million to fix the Saturn Boulevard hot spot. 
“She’s moved a problem that has been stuck, when other people could not,” Prather, the Scripps atmospheric chemist, said.
Sewage spills prompt quick fixes
The long-standing pollution problem came under new scrutiny in 2017, when a spill from a damaged line in Mexico dumped an estimated 143 million gallons of wastewater into the Tijuana River, sending foul odors wafting through the region. That accident revealed just how dilapidated the aging infrastructure had become.
“That’s one of the reasons why things are so horrific, because they’re playing catch up on fixing these things when they have catastrophic failures,” said Feddersen, the Scripps oceanographer.
In early 2022, another major spill released hundreds of millions of gallons of sewage-tainted water across the border for two and a half weeks. 
That summer, San Diego congress members freed up more than $300 million that had been authorized for wastewater treatment upgrades through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Mexico committed $144 million to replace failing sewage treatment facilities in Tijuana, with an updated treaty between the two countries known as Minute 328.
In 2024, the lawmakers persuaded the Biden administration to add another $370 million to repair the aging South Bay International Wastewater Treatment Plant near the border, Rep. Scott Peters said.
After decades of deterioration, major improvements came online this year. The South Bay International Wastewater Treatment Plant, which was barely operable, is now fully functioning and expanded its capacity from 25 million to 35 million gallons of wastewater per day. The project was expected to take two years, but was completed in 100 days, according to the U.S. International Boundary and Water Commission.

By the end of next year that will climb to 50 million gallons per day, with higher capacity for peak wastewater surges. The commission, which manages the wastewater systems, has spent $122 million on the first series fixes, and the full project will cost $650 million.
Although the Trump administration has clawed back federal funding for many projects, it has doubled down on the cross-border sewage problem, Aguirre said. In July U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin met with his Mexican counterpart to seal the environmental deal.
In April Mexico repaired its Punta Bandera plant, located on the coast about six miles south of the border. The plant had failed completely in 2020 and was dumping raw sewage into the ocean. It now handles 18 million gallons of wastewater per day. That’s a big boost for beach safety, said Feddersen, whose research tracked the flow of sewage in ocean currents and modeled scenarios for reducing it.
“The best bang for the buck, the greatest reduction in beach closure and reduction in human illness, was fixing Punta Bandera,” he said.
Yet, the Tijuana River still threatens residents in its watershed with untreated sewage and industrial chemicals from maquiladoras in Tijuana. That includes solvents, heavy metals and toxins known as PFAS, or “forever chemicals,” Prather said.
“The river right now is a wastewater treatment plant without any processing,” she said.
Removing the culverts would eliminate the turbulence that sprays out hydrogen sulfide and other toxins. The county plans to finish a feasibility study on the project by January. That project would keep contaminants out of the air, but not out of the water.
Aguirre also wants new infrastructure to clean up the Tijuana River on the U.S. side. The recent binational Treaty, Minute 328, includes that option, and the International Boundary and Water Commission is exploring what it would take to divert and treat the river flows. There’s no funding for the project yet, but Aguirre says it’s on her agenda.
“Rivers are diverted up and down,” she said.  “It’s doable. Is it expensive? Yes. Are our lives in South San Diego worth it? Yes.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/112125_Paloma-Aguirre_AH_CM-22.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-05 09:57:39.753225
,California,2025-12-05 13:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,‘We may be deporting the wrong people’: New poll shows doubts about immigration crackdown,Wendy Fry,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/12/immigration-poll-criminal-record/,A new poll shared exclusively with CalMatters adds to a slate of recent surveys suggesting Californians’ support is waning for Trump’s harshest immigration enforcement policies.,"In summary
A new poll shared exclusively with CalMatters adds to a slate of recent surveys suggesting Californians’ support is waning for Trump’s harshest immigration enforcement policies. 


If you found out your neighbor had a past criminal conviction, your knee-jerk reaction might be that you’d want them relocated. 
But what if that person committed a burglary in their late teens, served years in state prison, turned their life around, and now mentors at-risk youth?
Do the details matter? Researchers found that they do.   
A new poll by Goodwin Simon Strategic Research examines California voters’ attitudes toward due process for immigrants with criminal convictions during the Trump administration’s nationwide crackdown on unauthorized immigration. The survey also examined support for how tax dollars are spent and Californians’ views on the state’s sanctuary policies.
It found bipartisan support for ensuring that immigrants facing deportation receive due process, including ones with criminal records.
“This survey shows that there’s clear concern about the current administration’s approach to immigration enforcement,” said Sara Knight, a research director at Goodwin Simon Strategic Research. “I’m not surprised by the results, but I am heartened to see how strong the support for due process is and the growing frustration with treating people inhumanely in our immigration system.” 
President Donald Trump campaigned on the promise of mass deportations that targeted criminals, among other things, and he has made good on that. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have arrested more than 160,608 noncitizens nationwide with criminal convictions or pending charges, since his inauguration. 
The Trump administration has sought to expand the use of “expedited removal,” which allows immigration officers to remove certain non-citizens, like those convicted of crimes, from the United States without a hearing before an immigration judge.
Researchers say this latest poll by Goodwin Simon Strategic Research, released to CalMatters this week, also reflects waning support, even among a small majority of Republicans for the harshest immigration enforcement practices. It showed  84% of Democrats, 61% of independents, and 54% of Republicans agreed that “even if someone does have a record, they deserve due process and the chance to have their case heard by a judge before being deported.” 
The poll was commissioned by the Immigrant Legal Resource Center and the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, both pro-immigrant organizations. Goodwin Simon Strategic Research describes itself on its website as an “independent opinion research firm.” Researchers wrote the survey questions and polled more than 1,200 self-identified voters. Knight said the partisan divide among those polled mirrored the party-affiliation split in the electorate. The margin of error was 3 points. 
Some other recent polls echo similar conclusions released in recent weeks, including one released last week by UC Berkeley’s Possibility Lab that found one-third of Latino voters who supported Trump now regret their choice. Another public opinion poll by the nonpartisan research firm Public Policy Institute of California found 71% of Californians surveyed said they disapproved of the job ICE is doing. And, a CNN exit poll after the Proposition 50 redistricting election on Nov. 4 found that about three-quarters of California voters said they’re dissatisfied with or angry about the way things are going in the U.S., and 6 in 10 said the Trump administration’s actions on immigration enforcement have gone too far. 
Tricia McLaughlin, an assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, pointed to other recent national polls to argue the public supports Trump’s immigration policies.
“President Trump and Homeland Security) Secretary (Kristi) Noem are delivering on the American people’s mandate to deport illegal aliens, and the latest polls show that support for the America First agenda has not wavered – including a New York Times poll that nearly 8 in 10 Americans support deporting illegal aliens with criminal records,” McLaughlin said in a written statement.
“The American people, the law, and common sense are on our side, and we will not stop until law and order is restored after Biden’s open border chaos flooded our country with the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens,” she continued.
From prison to ICE
In the more recent Goodwin Simon Strategic Research poll, 61% of voters surveyed said they want California’s prison system to stop directly handing immigrants over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement for deportation. 
The state’s sanctuary law does not apply to immigrants who have been convicted of serious crimes. State prisons have transferred to ICE more than 9,500 people with criminal records since Gov. Gavin Newsom took office in 2019, according to data released to CalMatters. So far in 2025, ICE has picked up 1,217 inmates directly from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, the data shows. 
The corrections department also provides ICE with information that helps the agency locate, arrest, and deport people who are not directly transferred. CalMatters obtained and reviewed more than 27,000 pages of emails between state prison employees and ICE. The emails show prison employees regularly communicate with ICE about individuals in state custody, including U.S. citizens. They often share personal details about their families, visitors, and phone calls. Often, these family members have no criminal records and are U.S. citizens
Newsom, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla, and Speaker Robert Rivas have all denounced ICE’s broader deportation efforts. But all three have also indicated some level of support for having federal immigration officials remove noncitizens with prior convictions for violent crimes from the community. 
The governor has stated he would veto legislation that seeks to restrict the state prison system’s ability to coordinate with federal immigration authorities for the deportation of felons.
‘We may be deporting the wrong people’
Goodwin Simon researchers found that voters’ opinions change when they find out more details about the personal circumstances of a noncitizen with a past criminal conviction, even for violent crime. Pollsters gave two narratives to voters.
One was about a man who was brought to the United States from Mexico as a child. He got into a fight in his early 20s that left someone injured. The man was sentenced to seven years in state prison, where he turned his life around by taking college classes and helping other inmates get their high school diplomas. When he got out of prison, he was deported to Mexico before an immigration judge could decide on his case. 
The other narrative was about a person closely connected to a man whose family fled genocide in Cambodia when he was a baby. In the U.S., the man was the lookout for a robbery when he was a teenager and served 30 years in state prison. Upon his release, prison officials turned him over to ICE. 
“We may be deporting the wrong people. Although this last person did commit a crime, he has served his time and is now a valuable member of society, so it would be hard to say for sure if a person ever committed a crime deserves to be sent back. That is why the due process is important,” one Republican voter from Sacramento responded to the poll. She shifted her opinion from the view that people with past criminal convictions should be automatically deported to favoring a judge reviewing each individual case after hearing the narratives. 
After voters reviewed both pro- and anti-messaging and the two stories, support for having an immigration judge review individual cases before deportation increased from 84% to 90% among Democrats; from 61% to 74% among independents, but it dropped from 54% to 51% among Republicans. Central Coast voters and Republican women voters increased support for due process by 9 points after hearing the stories.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/061125-Socal-Raid-PR-03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-05 08:57:20.342611

Gateway Cities with budgets already nearing a breaking point will now lose out on funds they have used for nearly a decade.,"FOR THE SECOND YEAR in a row, the Legislature has directed gaming revenue used for mitigating the local impacts of casinos into its own coffers, leaving city and town leaders frustrated amid worsening municipal budget strains.  
The move falls in line with the Legislature’s penny-pinching efforts to alleviate state budget pressures amid a host of federal funding claw backs nearly a year into the second Trump administration. Gateway Cities with budgets already nearing a breaking point will now lose out on funds they have used for nearly a decade for projects that address the adverse local impacts of casinos, such as increased crime, traffic, and regional gambling addiction. 
The Community Mitigation Fund (CMF), established in 2015 and used to award millions of dollars in grants to municipalities that host a casino or are next to a community that does, normally receives 6.5 percent of the annual revenues collected from a tax on casinos.  
In the 2025 state budget, lawmakers allowed a temporary redirection of those gaming revenues – a move Gov. Maura Healey branded as a one-time maneuver to free up $100 million for state spending during a tight budget year. But the 2026 state budget saw the Legislature again redirect the funds to priorities like transportation, education, economic development, and tourism. 
“Retrospectively, I think that’s when we should have really voiced concern that they’re touching the money at all,” Springfield’s chief development officer Tim Sheehan said in an interview. “From the Legislature’s standpoint – we did it once and we didn’t have any pushback, therefore, we’re going to take it again.”  
With funding for the CMF now stalled for two consecutive years, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission will use the small remainder of the funds – around $5 million – to award grants for fiscal year 2027. Those allocations will be significantly smaller than the ones in previous years, leaving the mitigation fund to run out of money unless funding is restored.  
The gaming commission has awarded nearly $80 million in grants from the CMF to eligible municipalities and entities since 2015. In 2024, the total amount awarded was approximately $22 million. Eight Gateway Cities are eligible for the funding, including Everett, Chelsea, Revere, Malden, and Lynn, because of their proximity to the Encore Boston Harbor casino in Everett, as well as Springfield, Holyoke, and Chicopee, because of the MGM Springfield casino.
The city of Lynn used a $200,000 grant to install dozens of surveillance cameras in public areas for increased safety. 
Holyoke used the funds to conduct a survey assessing harmful gambling habits in the area, according to Aaron Vega, Holyoke’s planning and economic development director.  
“Now that we have this data, what do I do with it?” Vega said. “I’ve got no funds to address it, whether that’s an educational campaign or targeting youth and seniors.”  
In Springfield, Sheehan said the funds have been used for fire equipment and police presence around the casino, as well as major improvements to sidewalks and street lighting near the casino. It also helped pay for improvements to neighborhood parks like Court Square. 
Springfield has been receiving around $3 million annually from the CMF since 2022, but the city is expected to receive just $360,000 in fiscal year 2027. (Springfield began receiving mitigation funds in 2016.) 
“Three million may not seem like a lot to Boston, but it’s a lot to Springfield,” Sheehan said. “Those funding resources for that type of programming are no longer going to be there.” 
In October, the Springfield City Council adopted a resolution calling for the restoration of casino mitigation funding for the city.   
“The Massachusetts Legislature recently allocated $10 million in mitigation funding to Eastern Massachusetts communities to address the impacts of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, while Western Massachusetts communities lost their casino mitigation support,” the resolution stated. 
Boston’s host committee for the World Cup games had requested $20 million for operations, transportation, and other expenses related to the event, which was included in Healey’s supplemental spending proposal. But the Legislature earmarked only $10 million. 
State Sen. Adam Gomez of Springfield filed an amendment to the fiscal year 2025 closeout supplemental spending bill that would have restored the statutory 6.5 percent allocation of total gaming tax revenues to the CMF, but it was rejected by the Senate in October. But Sheehan and Vega said the effort was too little too late, and state lawmakers representing the cities didn’t respond forcefully enough when the cuts were first proposed. 
“It happened. They didn’t question it. Then they were called out on it, and they tried to do something about it,” Sheehan said of the lawmakers. “The train had already left the station. That ball had already dropped.”  
Sen. Gomez did not respond to interview requests. CommonWealth Beacon also reached out to State Rep. Patricia Duffy of Holyoke and Rep. Bud Williams of Springfield, both of whom did not respond to interview requests.  
In addition to traffic and public safety projects, Vega said Holyoke has been able to use the mitigation funds to create the Explore Holyoke website and initiative, which supports tourism and small businesses in the city. Like many other projects, it’s something the city wouldn’t have been able to pay for themselves, he said.

“The city is not going to give me $20,000 a year to run the Explore Holyoke website. It can’t give me $15,000 a year to run a shuttle bus between Springfield and Holyoke for events. It wouldn’t be able to give me $15,000 to do a survey on gambling habits in the city,” Vega said. 
Local leaders appear to agree that the funds should be used locally for their original, intended purpose, despite the state’s budget woes. Vega said the state taking the money for itself was “a little bit of an insult.”  
In January, the Holyoke City Council will likely file a resolution like Springfield’s calling for the restoration of the funds, according to Vega. Even if the budget has passed, lawmakers could still restore casino mitigation funds through a separate spending bill.  
Funding for mitigation projects was promised to the community when the MGM Springfield casino was first being built in 2015, Sheehan said.  
“The bottom line is that this was the compact that was made between the host communities and the state,” he said. “Clearly, those promises that were made have now been broken.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/everettmayor-6-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-05 08:57:20.342611

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Coal-fired generators at the Intermountain Power Plant, located in Delta, stopped producing energy the day before Thanksgiving as its owners move to cleaner resources and Utah leaders search for buyers to avoid what they deem an early retirement of dispatchable energy. 
The plant owned by 23 Utah municipalities has been the subject of legislative action for years amid an effort to retire its coal-fueled operations in favor of a multibillion-dollar natural gas project known as IPP Renewed — meant to keep serving its main client, California, as it takes aggressive steps away from fossil fuels.    
“The coal units have been laid up in an operable condition while the state of Utah conducts its search for new customers for the coal-generated power,” said John Ward, spokesperson for Intermountain Power Agency. “But there they are no longer operating.”

That’s because of a law the Utah Legislature passed this year that forbade the Intermountain Power Agency from disconnecting switchyard equipment from its coal-powered facilities. Aiming to comply with that legislation, the agency kept one of the coal units connected to the switchyard, so if the coal unit is restarted it could immediately be connected to the grid, Ward said. 
Cox signs bill to keep coal plant open amid warnings of federal conflict

There aren’t any decommission activities in place for the units, which have a joint 1,900 megawatt-capacity — state law would also prohibit that. 
However, the state’s plans to secure buyers for the plant’s coal power aren’t ripe yet. Emy Lesofski, director of the Utah Office of Energy Development, said the Utah Energy Council that the Legislature created this year received 14 responses to an initial request for information process to gather data on companies to keep the coal units going. 
But, there’s still a long way to go before negotiations with potential buyers start.
Advocates from the Sierra Club highlighted in a news release that shutting down the units had no impact on customers, and questioned who should “shoulder the cost of keeping an obsolete coal facility on standby.”
“On one of the biggest holidays of the year, people’s lights stayed on and no one noticed that these coal units went offline. That silence speaks volumes: we don’t need to keep our communities tethered to outdated, dirty coal plants to maintain reliable power,” Zack Waterman, western manager for the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign in Utah and California said in a statement.
Before ceasing operations, the coal units had been working at low capacities for several years because the agency’s users hadn’t been calling on the power, Ward said. 
The plant was built to deliver most of its energy to California, which pledged to eliminate coal from its power supply.

“We were allowed to continue operating these plants under the existing power purchase agreements up until now,” Ward said, “but we were not able to continue to sell power to California after those agreements expired.”
In the meantime, the Intermountain Power Agency’s natural gas project is still under development, with one of the two planned units starting commercial operations last October, and the second scheduled to do the same later this month, Ward said.
The new facilities will also be able to use hydrogen to produce 840 megawatts and store the resource in underground caverns, which would allow them through its natural gas turbines anytime. 
“So it works like a battery, except batteries are good for hours. This can last for months or years, and it’s also much, much larger in scale,” Ward said.
The original power purchase agreement with California was scheduled to expire in 2027. With this new project, and without coal, they have been extended through 2077, according to Ward.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/020325_Intermountain-Power-Plant_03-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-05 08:57:20.342611

(Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)A joint legislative committee Thursday temporarily blocked four legal contracts after a senator on the committee raised objections to a lawsuit over the distribution of proceeds to local governments from the state’s internet sales tax.
The Contract Review Committee put holds on three legal contracts for Legislative Services and one by the Pharmacy Board. Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, the chair of the Alabama Senate’s General Fund committee, said Thursday he wanted to send a message that the Alabama Legislature is the final authority on the distribution of state tax revenue.
“This lawsuit, I think, didn’t need to be dropped (filed),” Albritton said in an interview with the media following the meeting. “I don’t think it should have been dropped. I think that lies directly between the Legislature’s purview and the legislative role. You don’t need to go to the judiciary. You don’t need to be impatient. You just come here and let’s work it out.”

While Albritton’s request pertains only to the contracts presented before the committee in December, he didn’t dismiss the possibility of continuing to hold future contracts until the matter is resolved.
“We’ll see how that develops,” Albritton said.
The city of Tuscaloosa and the city of Mountain Brook filed suit against  the Alabama Department of Revenue in August, arguing the internet sales tax, known as the Simplified Sellers Use Tax (SSUT),  violates the state’s constitution. It further argues some of the retailers who are part of the program should be disqualified because they are ineligible to be part of the alternative taxing program.
Walt Maddox, the mayor of Tuscaloosa, said in a statement on Thursday that several cities have been working with the Alabama Department of Revenue to fix the legal issues pertaining to the SSUT for nearly a decade.
“Seeking a legal remedy is not an action we have taken lightly; however, our responsibility is to protect our citizens, educate our children, and invest for the future,” Maddox said. “Unfortunately, SSUT jeopardizes these sacred responsibilities.”
Prior to the 2018 U.S. Supreme Court decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, local taxing entities such as cities and counties could only collect sales taxes on businesses that were within their jurisdictions. The decision by the nation’s highest court overturned that precedent and allowed governments to collect sales taxes on commercial enterprises that are not located in the area but also conduct business through the internet.
Companies, however, may apply to be part of SSUT, which exempts them from collecting local sales taxes at 10%, and instead charge their customers the lower rate of 8% outlined in the rules governing SSUT.
Brick-and-mortar retailers have long complained that that gives Internet retailers a price advantage and makes it harder for them to do business.
Lawmakers changed the program in 2017 and placed more stringent requirements to be eligible for the program. It disqualified any business with a storefront or an affiliation with another business in the state.
The Association of County Commissions of Alabama has been traveling throughout the state to warn counties about the potential revenue loss that could happen because of the lawsuit. The organization expressed its concerns at the Montgomery County Commission in September. It said that several area municipalities could lose almost $200 million, according to a memo distributed at the meeting.
Montgomery County, according to the memo, received about $40 million in tax revenues because of SSUT, which could now be at risk.
Plaintiffs in the case allege that SSUT reduces the amount of revenue they could receive when retailers that are part of the program pay less in sales taxes because of commercial activity. According to the lawsuit, the city of Tuscaloosa is projected to forfeit about $14.6 million in revenues because of the difference in the amount that is collected from SSUT versus the traditional sales tax scheme.
“If they have a shortfall in revenue, they can raise the taxes,” Albritton said. “They have three, four, five-person councils. And all they need is two votes, or three votes, or whatever, to get it done. Here, we have to deal with 140 people plus the governor. So, if they want to raise a tax to improve their revenue, or if they want to tax something different, they can.”
Maddox said that Albritton displays a passion for his district similar to the way he has passion for the city of Tuscaloosa.
“Multiple solutions have been proposed since 2017, and I firmly believe as leaders with authentic conviction we can find a way forward,” Maddox said.

,California,2025-12-05 13:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Assembly Speaker Rivas promises to scrutinize how California’s new laws work,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/dan-walters/2025/12/assembly-speaker-rivas-new-laws/,Speaker Robert Rivas says real legislative oversight of the effects of new laws will become regular practice starting next year.,"The California Legislature not only habitually passes legislation without considering downside risks, it also only rarely examines whether those new laws deliver the promised results.
The latter is called “oversight,” and while legislators often tout its virtues, only rarely do they seriously implement it. What are termed “oversight hearings” are often merely exercises in self-congratulation or vehicles for grinding political axes, rather than objective inquiries into efficacy.
Robert Rivas, the speaker of the state Assembly, says he wants to make real oversight a regular practice starting next year, terming it “outcomes review.”
“Passing laws is only the first step,” Rivas said in a statement as he announced the new effort. “The real test is ensuring they work. Gone are the days when laws can be signed and forgotten. The outcomes review tool empowers Assembly members to evaluate real-world outcomes, engage directly with residents, and refine our solutions for greater impact. It’s a forward-looking approach to oversight that every 21st century Legislature should adopt.”
The program includes identifying specific laws to be examined, scheduling hearings and community meetings to invite public comment on how the targeted laws are working and, finally, announcing what was learned and what, if any, changes need to be made to make the laws more effective.
Rivas said the new process would begin with four measures:

Assembly Bill 744, passed in 2019 and carried by Assemblywoman Cecilia Aguiar-Curry, a Davis Democrat, requires health insurers to cover medical appointments via the internet the same way as in-person treatments.
AB 2011, a 2022 measure carried by Assemblywoman Buffy Wicks, an Oakland Democrat, makes it easier to build housing for low-income families in commercial areas.
AB 488, a 2021 law authored by Assemblywoman Jacqui Irwin, a Democrat from Thousand Oaks, enables the state Department of Justice to regulate online charitable solicitations. 
AB 457, a measure passed this year and carried by Assemblywoman Esmeralda Soria, a Merced Democrat, streamlines permitting for farm worker housing.

On paper, what Rivas proposes makes a lot of sense. The Legislature should have always been checking up on the effects of its decrees, rather than assuming that what it does will automatically have the desired effects.
However, it appears that legislators will have to volunteer their bills for scrutiny, which could mean that only obviously successful ones will be subjected to the process. 
It’s difficult to believe that the turkeys — measures that are publicity stunts or payoffs to campaign contributors, for instance — will be scrutinized, much less those with unintended and negative consequences. 
If Rivas is serious about oversight, the most controversial measures should be on the list even if their authors don’t volunteer.
One of many examples: a measure Gov. Gavin Newsom signed in 2023 that raises the minimum wage for fast food workers to $20 an hour. Since it took effect, labor unions and the fast food industry have jousted over its impact.
The unions, backed by research from pro-union academics, have argued that the law increases economic security for fast food workers without having negative effects on employment or food prices. The industry counters that it has reduced fast food jobs, hastened the adoption of labor-saving technology and forced outlets to raise prices.
The situation cries out for objective research as part of an oversight process. California has two watchdog entities that could provide it, the State Auditor and the Legislative Analyst’s Office.
To be taken seriously, the Assembly’s new oversight process would have to tackle the tough bills, not just the low-hanging fruit, and ensure that the measures get rigorous and authoritative examination.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/081825-RedistrictingPress-MG-CM-05.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-05 08:57:20.342611

(Photos: Richard Bednarski and Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)A Nevada law that requires lobbyists to register within two days of attempting to twist the arms of state lawmakers has no teeth, says the Nevada State Education Association, following the Legislative Counsel Bureau’s decision to let violations of state law slide against a former governor, a union boss, and a consultant who lobbied lawmakers on behalf of the current governor.   
The NSEA, which represents teachers throughout Nevada except in Clark County, filed two complaints last month with the LCB regarding the failure of former Gov. Brian Sandoval, analyst Jeremy Aguero, and Clark County Education Association chief John Vellardita to file as lobbyists during the November special session. 
Lawmakers convened to consider several bills, including Assembly Bill 5, which, if passed, would have expanded Nevada’s film tax credit from $10 million to $120 million a year. The credits, issued to companies that invest in Nevada, are often sold at a discount to casino companies which use them to pay their tax liabilities. 
“Following the confidential investigation in this matter, each of the individuals named in the joint complaint registered as a lobbyist under the Lobbying Act,” LCB Acting Director Roger Wilkerson said in an emailed response to the NSEA on Tuesday, adding he had determined the three lobbyists’ compliance, albeit late, “carries out the primary public purpose of the Act” and would issue no sanctions. 
The law allows the LCB to suspend the lobbying privileges of violators.  
NSEA is questioning whether Wilkerson followed state law, which requires him to not only conduct an investigation, but also to report suspected violations to the Legislative Commission and the Attorney General, “who shall investigate and take any action necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter.” Wilkerson did not respond to a request for comment.
A spokesman for Attorney General Aaron Ford was unaware of the office receiving a report.
Wilkerson’s assertion that the late registration resolves the matter indicates he found “suspected violations of law,” the NSEA’s legal team said via email.
Gov. Joe Lombardo’s spokesperson Elizabeth Ray confirmed Aguero worked on the film tax credit “for the Governor and consulted with state lawmakers on the potential fiscal impact of the bill. Jeremy was in compliance.”
“When an elected official reaches out and asks for assistance, I was always raised that there are only two appropriate responses: (i) “yes” and (ii) “yes sir/ma’am,” Aguero said Thursday via email, adding he learned from LCB that the current interpretation of the law suggests that providing “technical assistance” to a legislator “can require registration in Nevada. With that understanding, I was happy to make the appropriate registration as I suppose others will need to do as well.” 
Aguero did not respond to a subsequent email asking if he was paid.
Alex Marks of NSEA says Aguero’s assignment from Lombardo was to discredit the LCB’s non-partisan budget experts who warned the film tax credit would lead Nevada off a fiscal cliff. 
It’s the third time in two years that Aguero has been called out for failing to register. 
The first was in 2023, when he presented a bill with Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager to pump hundreds of millions of dollars of public money into a campus for the unhoused, and never disclosed he was working for Wynn Resorts. 
The second was when he presented Gov. Joe Lombardo’s 2023 special session bid to provide $380 million in public financing and incentives toward the construction of a major league baseball stadium on the Las Vegas Strip for the A’s, and again failed to disclose who he represented. 
Aguero subsequently went to work for the ball club, while simultaneously working for the Las Vegas Stadium Authority, a position he eventually left to avoid the appearance of a conflict.
Marks says NSEA’s complaint to the LCB “was more about the pattern we’ve seen since 2023” and the “powers that be that believe they’re above the law,” than just about Sandoval, Aguero, and Vellardita. “While the response to our complaint from LCB was largely non-responsive, they did confirm a violation.”
A complaint filed in 2023 by NSEA affiliate Schools Over Stadiums never got a response from the LCB. Wilkerson declined to provide one now, asserting it is confidential.    
The LCB’s refusal to disclose the outcome of the 2023 investigation, Marks contends, is at odds with Nevada law, which states its primary purpose is to “provide both disclosure and regulation of lobbying activities in order to promote and foster the people’s faith, trust and confidence in the honesty, integrity and fidelity of their representative government.”
The law states its provisions “must be liberally construed and broadly interpreted to achieve their intended public benefits,” and any uncertainty “must be resolved in favor of carrying out the public purposes… ”
“What would be the point of allowing any person to allege a violation and requiring the Director to investigate if the results of such an investigation were allowed to remain secret?” the NSEA’s legal team asked rhetorically.
Sandoval, who currently serves as president of the University of Nevada Reno, testified on behalf of UNR in support of the film tax credit. 
The former governor was seen meeting with legislators and “remained a presence around the building throughout Session despite being unregistered,” Marks of NSEA said via email, adding Sandoval had “just been named chairman of Resorts World the same day the Special Session was called.” 
Michael Flores, a government affairs specialist who works for Sandoval, noted the former governor has been UNR’s president for multiple legislative sessions, “and has represented the university in Carson City in different hearings on different bills, and has never been required to register as a lobbyist.”
Sandoval, as chairman of the Resorts World Las Vegas Board of Directors, now wields not only the influence of a university president and former governor, but also that of a gaming company executive with the ability to influence its political contributions. 
“I have not heard him say that he thinks there’s a conflict there,” Flores said. “He’s dedicated his life to public service in Nevada.” Nevadans can be assured Sandoval is representing UNR, not Resorts World’s interests, Flores says, by listening to his testimony.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/sandageroditta-1024x567.jpg,,,2025-12-05 08:57:20.342611

The company's old logo remains outside its former North Kansas City headquarters (Suzanne King/The Beacon).In January, hackers gained access to a cache of Cerner electronic health records stored on a legacy network.
But some patients whose sensitive health and financial information may have been exposed are only now being notified — and many others still haven’t been told.
NKC Health, formerly North Kansas City Hospital, is one of the most recent hospitals to let patients know about a cyber incident involving Cerner, now Oracle Health. The Nov. 25 notice said the hospital had only “recently learned” of the incident, which has been unraveling for months and reportedly dates back to January.
About a dozen hospitals across the country, including Mosaic Life Care in St. Joseph, Missouri, have sent similar notices to patients. Oracle has not publicly disclosed the number of hospitals involved or how many patients may have been affected.
But Elena A. Belov, a lawyer representing victims of the data breach in a federal class action lawsuit filed in the Western District of Missouri, said she has been told by Oracle’s attorneys that 80 hospitals’ patient records may have been involved. And that could amount to millions of victims.
“This is one of the most massive breaches in the health care industry in the last couple of years,” said Belov, who practices with the Almeida Law Group. “We still don’t know the entire universe. The list of affected hospitals has not been made public.”
Oracle Health, which acquired North Kansas City-based Cerner for $28 billion in 2022, did not reply to requests for comment about the incident. The company is the country’s second-largest electronic medical records vendor, managing patient data for about 20% of the nation’s hospitals and doctors’ offices.
News reports about the January data breach said it involved data on Cerner’s old network that had not yet been transferred to Oracle’s cloud network.
While details of the Cerner data breach began appearing in news reports last spring, and the company started informing customers about the incident this summer, Oracle did not announce it to the media, and left it up to its health care clients to report the breach to patients and to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Civil Rights’ Breach Portal.
“It goes to the big problem we have,” Belov said. “Even huge companies who are in the business of digital security like Oracle are not paying enough attention to security.”
 Health care data breaches are common

Data security experts said the Cerner network hack illustrates just how vulnerable patients’ health and financial information can be.
During the first 11 months of 2025, health care organizations reported 493 data compromises, which involved more than 34 million victims, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit that tracks and works to prevent such incidents.
Until 2024, health care accounted for the most data breaches of any industry for six years in a row. But last year the financial industry took the top spot and health care came in second. The trend continued this year.

James E. Lee, president of the Identity Theft Resource Center, said health care is particularly vulnerable to cyber attackers because it is so large and diverse.
“There are small providers in small towns, all the way to huge multinational health care organizations and everything in between,” he said.
Health care involves hospitals, doctors, pharmacies, labs and insurance companies, all of which have access to patients’ personal information, including identity data like Social Security numbers, names and addresses; financial data like credit card information; and personal health information like diagnoses and medications.
All it takes to break in is one legitimate login and password at one point in the system. That leaves plenty of room for weak links, Lee said.
Companies like Cerner, which digitize health records so every doctor and hospital has easy access to patient charts, have become a major part of the system. From its beginnings in 1979, Cerner’s founders promised the electronic management of health records would cut costs and bring better care.
“The idea of digitizing the records — from a patient perspective — was a good one,” Lee said. “What we didn’t anticipate, and it is true across all industries, is the level to which professional criminals would become engaged. These are professional, multinational organizations, not some kid sitting in a basement drinking Red Bull.”
 NKC Health incident

NKC Health’s statement said its patients’ records may have been accessed as early as Jan. 22, but Oracle Health only informed them about the incident recently.
In its notice to patients, NKC said Oracle Health told the hospital that “law enforcement investigators” had urged it to delay notifying patients and hospital customers “because it could have impeded their investigation.”

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), the federal law that deals with patient privacy, requires health care providers and their associates to notify patients when sensitive information has been compromised “without unnecessary delay,” and no later than 60 days after an incident. But the law makes an exception if law enforcement requests a delay.
News organizations reported in March that the FBI was looking into the attack, and in April, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued a security alert, warning that “the nature of the reported activity presents potential risk to organizations and individuals.”
Oracle has informed some of its hospital and physician practice customers about the data breach individually.
Belov called the lack of transparency “really dismaying.”
“We’re losing valuable time for people to protect their information and their identities,” she said. “This is going to be a huge problem.”
 Stolen data comes with ‘deadly outcomes’

Legal and health experts said breaches of health care information can be among the most concerning.
Beyond the potential loss of Social Security numbers, names, addresses and credit card information, victims of health care data breaches also risk much more worrisome losses, experts said.
If health records are altered or in some way compromised in a data breach, doctors might lose critical information about a patient’s medications or health history. And that could lead to medical errors or decisions that compromise care and endanger a patient.
“Stolen health data can lead to deadly outcomes,” Belov said.
That’s why many hospitals and doctors offices end up paying a ransom to get data back from hackers. Health care organizations often won’t talk about hacks. They worry that would make them look vulnerable and expose them to additional problems.
But a cybersecurity expert with the American Hospital Association has estimated that at least a third of the time, hospitals end up paying a ransom to get information back. Unlike other industries that might be able to wait out criminals or rebuild databases, they need the information right away and can’t risk waiting.
“Patient lives are on the line when something critical happens,” said Alexander Boyd, a data privacy and security lawyer with the Polsinelli law firm.
Clients across industries regularly consult him about situations in which data has been compromised. And, among those cases, ransomware attacks happen “more often than we’d like.”
In those cases, criminals break into a company, encrypt the data and demand a payment to unlock it. When one of those attacks happens to a health care provider, it can be an emergency.
“It’s not just a money issue, it’s a well-being issue,” Boyd said. “If the health care provider doesn’t have good backups, sometimes the only option is to pay the ransom.”
Coveware, a company that helps clients respond to cyber extortion incidents, reports the average ransom payment made by victims of cyberattacks has been falling. In the third quarter of this year, the average ransom payment for all industries was $376.94, a 66% drop from the previous quarter. The median payment was $140,000, down 65%.
Boyd said companies are getting better at avoiding attacks in the first place. More often they have data backed up so they don’t have to make ransom payments.
But when a client does have to negotiate with a hacker, Boyd turns to Coveware or another firm that specializes in dealing with the criminals. Those firms know through experience how much the hackers may be willing to negotiate and whether they may actually turn over an encryption key if their demands are met.
Typically, after coming to an agreement — after, perhaps, sending sample files to verify that the hackers actually can unlock them — clients pay the bitcoin ransom (there is no escrow) and then wait for the encryption key.
None of it is comfortable.
“You hope and wait,” Boyd said.

(Photo courtesy Pamela Tsigdinos)The Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) is so deep into group-think and committed to failed policies serving its pro-development partners that it has lost the ability to think critically to the detriment of Lake Tahoe.  
This bi-state agency governing Nevada and California’s Tahoe basin, ratified by Congress more than 50 years ago, was created “to adopt and enforce a regional plan of resource conservation and development” and “exercise various environmental controls and adoption of environmental threshold capacities over the Tahoe Basin.” 
In recent years, however, the agency and its layers of commission and committees have chosen to:

diminish once sacrosanct scenic quality thresholds 
dismantle once strict environmental safeguards established in the 1982 bi-state Tahoe Environmental Impact Statement 
allow ecological damage in Lake Tahoe and near its shore 
dress up pro-growth tourism policies with euphemisms like “cultivating community” and “destination stewardship” 
approve a large event center with promises that vehicle miles traveled (VMT) would be neutral yet the project’s traffic monitoring plan went uninstalled
strong arm counties into loosening land use codes.

While Lake Tahoe’s annual average clarity declined 15 feet from 2014, the agency inexplicably continues to push urbanization – increased building height, density, and coverage — along with streamlined approvals despite consistently voiced valid concerns. Some include:

radical land use changes likely to adversely impact lake clarity further; flooding due to more impermeable surfaces is as much of an issue as stormwater treatment
dramatically altering Lake Tahoe’s largely rural north, east and west communities damaging remaining fragile ecosystems 
ignoring aging limited infrastructure incapable of supporting intensified development
endangering the basin population and visitors during increasingly high-risk wildfire seasons 
foregoing income caps on intensive new development calling into serious question the agency’s claims that code changes are aimed at workforce housing. 

With TRPA’s history of caving to developers, more than a few seem to be holding out for more incentives. Others have used existing land holdings as bargaining chips tied to larger projects. 
For example, a real estate investment firm bought the north shore Tahoe Inn in 2007. It’s since become a boarded up motel near the Nevada-California state line. There have been repeated broken promises to take action. The property remains in blight. The same firm owns a large Tahoe ski resort that it’s looking to privatize. The investment firm’s founder also happens to be a founding member of the tony Tahoe Fund. Fund donors include at least one TRPA board member and many businesses with matters before the TRPA. This influential non-profit works with its resort, real estate, and business partners to generate funds through specific programs that create more tourism amenities the resort and business partners can advertise in return. 
Just inside the Nevada state line steps away from the derelict Inn sits another larger, poorly vetted, now boarded up project touted by the TRPA: a proposed Waldorf Astoria to replace an aging operating hotel. The developer shut down the hotel casino and later went into foreclosure without the promised demolition. This latest dilapidated Washoe Tahoe structure now leads in TRPA’s north shore competition for fire-risk eyesores. While Washoe County Commission Chair, TRPA governing board member, and Nevada Democratic gubernatorial candidate Alexis Hill read the motion for the now failed luxury project into the record at both the county and TRPA, she hasn’t brought it up publicly since.
At the agency’s latest governing board meeting, the executive director, in an ironic twist, sang praises for the agency’s COO. He is one of Nevada’s primary architects of the controversial 2012 Tahoe Regional Plan update that kicked off the Tahoe basin land use morass. This updated regional plan ushered in new incentive-based development without requiring environmental analysis commensurate with the proposed intensified development. It also weakened environmental standards.
TRPA’s latest move is to sweeten the pot further in phase three of its multi-phase march to continue to appease and entice deep-pocketed developers and real estate investors. Keep an eye on that Waldorf Astoria project. With phase three TRPA incentives it’s likely to resurface larger and more opulent than before. 
Reversing decades of environmental conservation
A lawsuit brought by the Sierra Club Tahoe Area Group in 2013 foresaw the folly that providing more power and influence to ambitious developers and speculators would bring. A 2013 interview in the Tahoe Quarterly laid out the worst case scenario:

“This new [TRPA regional] plan fails to recognize that an increase in buildings, rooftops and pavement will mean an increase in the amount of polluted rain and snowmelt—runoff that flows directly into The Lake,” says Laurel Ames of the Tahoe Area Sierra Club. “Stormwater from pavement and roads is the leading cause of The Lake’s loss of clarity. Allowing more pavement and roads seriously undermines efforts to clean up the once-pristine lake.”
“Ames says the TRPA never produced numbers demonstrating more clustered development will result in the critical mass necessary to fund a full-time public transportation network. She also notes that the idea of leveraging private dollars in an era of dwindling public funding is sound theory but does not want Lake Tahoe to serve as an experimental laboratory.
“What happens if they try it ﬁout at Tahoe and make a mess of it?” Ames asks. “The Lake loses. It’s a big risk. There is too much ‘don’t worry, it will work’ in this plan.”

Those words are as relevant today as when spoken 12 years ago. Well-respected environmentalist and former journalist Ames passed away earlier this year.

Current Sierra Club Tahoe Area vice-chair and retired environmental engineer Tobi Tyler noted at a recent TRPA meeting: “Conceding to development and recreational pressures will be the ultimate demise of the lake, which is already showing persistent severe summertime clarity problems. TRPA’s job is to protect the lake, not appease the hordes of tourists and moneyed interests.”
The agency’s more recent tactics and strategies include a potpourri of workshops, consultant-developed PowerPoint presentations, and a heavy dose of PR campaigns with word salads and hard to compute, fluid “bonus unit” formulas that include acronyms such as CFA, TAUs, and PAOTs. 
Persons At One Time (PAOT) are “allocations.” If new facilities involve recreation; they’re transferable (chapters 30, 33, 50 and 51). Commercial Floor Area (CFA) and Tourist Accommodation Units (TAU) became commodities to trade as laid out in TRPA’s “Sustainable Communities Program.”  Since rebranded “Cultivating Communities,” the program has taken the head-spinning formulas further.
This multi-phase, piece-meal ordinance approach, introduced in Tahoe county by county in Nevada and California have led to a series of significant land use code changes making it near impossible for the average citizen to make heads or tails of – and that’s by design. None of these changes ever make it to a ballot. Had they been put to a referendum they would never have seen the light of day. Instead, developers and privately funded quasi-governmental organizations lobby and get their way. 
Lake Tahoe faces severe risk from further urbanization
If past is prologue, the film “Lake Tahoe in Depth,” updated this year by the UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center demonstrates that the Tahoe basin formed millennia ago by volcanic activity, glaciers and still active faultlines, which have (and can), lead to earthquakes and tsunamis now face human-driven threats, development, and climate change dangers. On its current trajectory Lake Tahoe will grow murkier with toxic algae blooms, microplastics, and invasive species. The film shows how urbanized land from the one city in the Tahoe basin, which sits on the south shore makes up just 11% of the Tahoe basin, but contributes nearly three-quarters of Lake Tahoe’s fine particle pollution. Particles carried into the lake are primarily responsible for the loss of clarity. 
Why TRPA wants to urbanize with more buildings, more people and more tourism defies logic. Long-time north shore resident John Eppolito, whose earlier career was as a math teacher, made this point to TRPA’s Advisory Planning Commissioners: “I would like to explore the logic behind [how] increasing the number of units decreases the miles traveled. My middle schoolers would have had a lot of fun with this logic.” 
Adding to the agency’s illogical approach, TRPA’s plan is to scope out an EIS after, not before development changes are codified. 
The December 17 governing board hearing and potential vote on the contentious Washoe Tahoe Area Plan ignores ongoing legal action against Washoe County for approving the plan amendments in August without considering “serious threats to public safety and wildfire evacuation.” 
The existing outdated Washoe County evacuation plan never included Tahoe’s millions of year-round tourists and day trippers. Those numbers continue to escalate, jeopardizing the evacuation risk of residents, workers and visitors alike, according to a 2024 independent wildfire simulation and analysis. A missing comprehensive evacuation plan for Washoe Tahoe and the absence of a comprehensive county environmental impact statement apparently aren’t enough to stop the TRPA from moving forward on the Washoe Tahoe Area Plan. Another lawsuit is ongoing against the Placer Tahoe Area Plan to Nevada’s west.
One of the Placer Tahoe plaintiffs, the North Tahoe Preservation Alliance’s president Ann Nichols, reprimanded agency leadership Nov. 19: “You can’t claim no net growth while enabling 3,316 new units. You can’t claim environmental thresholds while removing review. You can’t claim equity while producing market-rate housing with no income cap. You can’t claim public process while making decisions in working groups that don’t reflect basin residents.”
Other public commenters pointed to the agency’s lack of analysis and shifting boundaries and promises. “Public safety must come before upzoning,” said North Tahoe resident Niobe Burden.
Resident Helen Neff asked for a realistic evacuation plan and workforce housing. She noted: “the report itself acknowledges that even with reforms, significant cost/valuation pressures remain that will skew production toward high-value housing” and called the program an “illusion of workforce housing.”
Keep Tahoe Blue warned the agency to maintain the integrity of the development rights system and the regional growth cap and not allow incentives that could be used for market rate housing or short-term rentals. Echoing that sentiment was resident Melissa Soderston: “achievable does not mean affordable.”
An agency once made up of scientists and environmentalists whose primary goal was to protect Lake Tahoe from overdevelopment and urbanization is now mainly composed of self-congratulatory toadies who continue unabated on a reckless quest for development and in pursuit of grants and funding that will grow its budget and enrich its corporate partners.
Signaling to the market that the agency plans to sweeten its incentives, fast track approvals, allow property owners to put additional cash-generating investment structures on their land, and (wink, wink) sell it to the public as “achievable housing” with no income caps and a shoddy record of deed restriction enforcement does nothing to address the workforce conditions described by Pastor Jorge Herrera of St. Francis of Assisi: “workers that support the Lake Tahoe economy are being forced to live in crowded and unsafe conditions. As a priest, I go and visit families and see the conditions, how they live. You as the board have the power to do something about this.”
A functional government agency with proper oversight would examine this series of project and policy failures as a reason to make personnel changes or move in a different direction. That seems highly unlikely.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/laketahoepg-1024x763.jpg,,,2025-12-05 08:57:20.342611

(Joshua Bowling/Source NM)When a nonpartisan organization announced it would host a town hall meeting where candidates for the highest offices in New Mexico could discuss their plans to address climate change, it posted an online flyer with 10 candidates’ headshots.
By the time more than 100 people filed into an Albuquerque community college building on Thursday night to hear the candidates, only one gubernatorial hopeful stood before them.
Former Las Cruces Mayor Ken Miyagishima, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor, used his time behind the microphone to speak about his experience leading clean-energy initiatives in the state’s second-largest city. His fellow Democrats running for the position — former U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland and Bernalillo County District Attorney Sam Bregman — sent surrogates to answer questions on their behalf.

No Republican candidates participated in the event. Rio Rancho Mayor Gregg Hull and freshman state Sen. Steve Lanier (R-Aztec) are both in the race for governor and prominent cannabis CEO Duke Rodriguez has flirted with candidacy. Republican lieutenant governor candidate Manny Lardizabal also did not attend. Event organizers said they invited “all known” candidates for both races.
Three candidates for lieutenant governor — Loving Village Mayor Pro Tem Jackie Lee Onsuarez, state Sen. Harold Pope (D-Albuquerque) and New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver — also attended in-person. 
Members of the exclusively Democrat panel disagreed on little and were not allowed to issue rebuttals during the event, which was sponsored by the nonpartisan group Healthy Climate New Mexico. All spoke broadly of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, embracing renewable energy sources and finding ways for the state to fund responses to extreme weather-related disasters.
Candidates had 90 seconds each to answer questions. An air horn signaling the end of each candidate’s allotted time often sounded before they discussed the details of their policy proposals.
The primary election for governor and lieutenant governor is June 2, 2026.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Throughout the night, candidates overwhelmingly agreed on the issues facing New Mexico. Everyone who spoke said their campaigns prioritize reducing greenhouse gas emissions across the state.

Schnurer, representing Bregman’s campaign for governor, said the state needs more regulatory oversight and enforcement of polluting developments. Miyagishima touted Las Cruces as being among the first cities in the state to install solar panels on municipal buildings and purchase electric buses.
Onsuarez, though, said the problem may lie in the Capitol building.
He praised the state’s Energy Transition Act that requires utilities to run on completely renewable energy by 2045, but said “we need to move faster.” He said implementing longer legislative sessions and term limits are important steps in doing so, echoing a November proposal from the Bregman campaign.
“We need to extend our legislative sessions — we need longer time so that environmental issues can truly be debated,” Onsuarez said.
Renewable energy
Similarly, candidates agreed the state should increasingly embrace renewable energy resources such as solar, wind and geothermal energy.
“We have the land, we have the wind, we have the sun,” Toulouse Oliver said.
Conservation Voters New Mexico CEO Demis Foster appeared virtually on behalf of Haaland’s campaign and said that Haaland believes New Mexico ought to be “the renewable energy capital of the country.” 
“She’s going to recruit more clean energy projects to our state that hire New Mexicans into good-paying union jobs, give them the training they need and lower energy costs,” she said. 
Discussions over renewable energy often do not focus on the logistics of powering homes, cars and businesses with wind, solar and geothermal sources. Modernizing the state’s energy grids and transmission capacity will be vital steps in implementing more renewable energy sources, Bregman’s campaign representative Schnurer said.
Bringing jobs to oil and gas towns
Most every candidate said that New Mexico’s elected leaders need to make in-roads to communities where oil and gas jobs are disappearing as the state transitions to cleaner energy sources. No one should have to choose between their health and a paycheck, they said.

“I think this is the story of New Mexico,” Pope said. “It’s been uranium mining, coal mining…this isn’t an option. We have to look out for oil and gas workers and those communities. We need to set up an oil and gas transition fund that would help the impacted communities with job training, apprenticeship programs and economic diversification.”
Foster said that while leading the U.S. Department of the Interior, Haaland worked to issue $775 million to 21 states to clean up orphaned oil wells and help workers transition to other careers. 
Water and extreme heat 
Moderators asked candidates how they would handle the ongoing drought affecting New Mexico’s water. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has made addressing the state’s water woes a priority and has proposed introducing treated brackish water and treated “produced water” — wastewater from oil and gas production — into the state’s strategic water supply.
Pope said he would “push back” on that, if elected. “That’s really toxic waste,” he said, calling the proposal an act of “greenwashing.”
As much as New Mexico feels the effects of drought, it also increasingly feels the effects of extreme heat. Candidates expressed interest in crafting state law similar to a recent Albuquerque ordinance, which requires landlords to furnish rental units with air-conditioning units. 
Money for climate-related disasters

Moderators asked candidates how they would respond to other extreme climate disasters, alluding to the Hermit’s Peak-Calf Canyon Fire and the fire and flooding in Ruidoso.
Across the board, candidates expressed interest in creating a state-managed “extreme weather resilience fund” that could take the financial burden off of rural and tribal communities during these episodes. 
State lawmakers passed and Lujan Grisham signed last April  Senate Bill 48, the Community Benefit Fund, which contains $210 million for communities to use for a series of projects to mitigate climate change impacts. 
“We’d (also) need to have a fund for remediation,” Pope said. “If we had something like that with what we’re dealing with with the fires up north and in Ruidoso, we could’ve done a lot to prepare but now we’re having to fund a lot of that remediation.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/townhall7-2048x1536-1-1024x768.png,,,2025-12-05 07:57:30.182853

Pennsylvania regulators will investigate a proposed rate increase by the state’s largest water and wastewater utility. The potential move could increase bills for some customers by more than 40%.
Pennsylvania American Water Co. (PAWC) filed the rate request last month, citing $1.2 billion in ongoing system improvements. The publicly traded company serves about 2.4 million people in 37 counties.
The state Public Utility Commission (PUC) voted unanimously Thursday to refer the proposal to its Office of Administrative Law Judge for investigation and recommendations on possible decisions.
The office’s process will include public hearings to gather testimony from concerned consumers and other interested parties, the PUC said in a statement. The commission will announce dates, times and locations for the hearings.

The utility’s proposal includes an increase of $168.7 million in total operating revenue. For a typical consumer (based on 3,263 gallons a month), the rate increase would translate into higher bills between $2.73 and $27.77 a month, depending on location. That’s between 9.8% and 41.1%, according to the PUC. 
Sewer bills would jump as much as $26.29 or 54% each month if the increase is approved, the PUC said. 
PAWC said in a statement when it filed the rate request that the additional revenue would support its plans to modernize and strengthen the water systems it operates throughout the commonwealth. The plans include replacement of 117 miles of aging water mains and 32 miles of sewer mains, removing and replacing lead service lines and addressing other contaminants, such as polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in drinking water.
PFAS are a type of manmade chemical used widely for nonstick cookware, stain-resistant carpets, and waterproof clothing because of their oil, water and heat resistant properties. Known as “forever chemicals,” they were also used in firefighting foam, which caused ground water contamination near military installations and firefighter training facilities. 
In addition to the rate increase, Pennsylvania American Water has also proposed a bill adjustment that would calculate sewer fees based on wintertime water use, when outdoor hoses and sprinklers are used less. It also requested permission to start a pilot program to support low-income renters in buildings without separate meters for apartments, who are not eligible for utility assistance, PAWC said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/SINK-WATER-NJ-ART--1024x669.jpeg,,,2025-12-05 07:57:30.182853

That sobering data point, shared with state lawmakers Thursday, comes as violent crime has dropped but remains far ahead of pre-pandemic figures. 
Police in Washington solved just 44% of reported violent crimes last year, said Marshall Clement, director of the Council of State Governments’ Justice Center. That amounts to solving 62% of homicides, 51% of aggravated assaults, 31% of robberies and just 25% of rapes.
“How low can this rate go before the entire criminal justice system is rendered useless?” Clement told a state House panel. “Nothing else in our criminal justice can even happen, rehabilitation, deterrence, incapacitation, unless we have a system that actually solves the majority of violent crime.”
Before the pandemic, Washington slightly outpaced the national average in its clearance rate for reported violent crime. Like the rest of the country, the percentage of cases Washington authorities were solving dropped during the pandemic, and has gradually rebounded since. 
Still, since 2022, over 49,000 violent crimes remain unsolved in Washington, including more than 400 homicides, nearly 29,000 aggravated assaults, almost 7,000 rapes and over 13,000 robberies, said Clement, citing FBI data.
Police departments in Seattle, Tacoma, Kent and Auburn are among those with particularly low clearance rates, defined as the percentage of crimes for which an arrest has been made, not necessarily a criminal conviction.
Washington isn’t alone. Half of states have slipped in their clearance rates since 2019. Nationwide, solve rates have been dropping consistently for over half a century. 
After years of rising crime since the pandemic, Washington saw some declines last year. Murders statewide dropped nearly 19% from 2023, with a total of 312 people killed, but that figure is still more than 50% higher than 2019, according to the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs.
Robberies were down 16%, creeping closer to 2019 levels. Meanwhile, a yearslong rise in assaults since the pandemic slowed but didn’t abate.
And preliminary figures show those drops continuing in 2025. 
Routinely not solving violent crimes creates a cycle of distrust in law enforcement that causes people to no longer cooperate with police, thus exacerbating the issue, Clement said. And people who commit crimes may feel emboldened to do more if they think they can get away with it. 
It’s up to the state to step in and help solve the problem, Clement said.
“This is not something local law enforcement can do alone,” he told the House Community Safety Committee. “It’s not something that state police can do or prosecutors can do alone. This is going to require leadership from you all to really make this a priority and to focus resources on improving these outcomes.”
Hiring difficulties
It’s not just about throwing money at the problem. While law enforcement expenses statewide have risen, better clearance rates haven’t come. And Washington continues to lag the rest of the country in police staffing. This contributes to longer response times, which leads to lower clearance rates, said Jeff Asher, a crime data analyst.
Asher called for creativity in using police resources to free up time to focus on these unsolved investigations. For example, New Orleans hired a civilian contractor to respond to car crashes that don’t cause injuries, so officers don’t have to.
“This isn’t the 1990s, it’s much harder to hire officers in 2025 than it was 30 years ago,” Asher told the committee. “So we need to think outside the box.”
After much strife, lawmakers this year approved a new $100 million grant program to boost police hiring. But the money can go for more than officers, like peer counselors, behavioral health personnel, crisis intervention training, emergency management planning and community assistance programs, among other spending options.
House Community Safety Committee Chair Roger Goodman, D-Kirkland, said he’d like to see more of that money go toward criminal investigations, as opposed to patrol. He thinks that would increase solve rates.
“I’m going to be making noise about that,” he said.
At this stage, it’s unclear if that would mean less state funding for the other spending ideas progressive lawmakers pushed to avoid the money solely going toward hiring more cops. 
“It’s all embryonic in its formulation right now,” Goodman said after the hearing.
To access the grants, cities and counties need to either implement a new 0.1% sales tax for public safety or have already imposed a similar tax. They also need to follow state model policies as well as collect and report use-of-force data. 
None of the $100 million has been spent yet.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/police-tape.jpg,,,2025-12-05 07:57:30.182853

Federal agents this week seized 73,000 products containing 7-hydroxymitragine, commonly known as 7-OH, from three Kansas City-area warehouses.
The seized products included things like power bars, pills and liquids shots that are made with a concentrate of 7-OH, which is the main opioid-inducing element in kratom. 
The action came out of a partnership between the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and U.S. Justice Department, according to the DOJ’s press release issued Tuesday.
“While 7-OH occurs naturally in trace amounts in the plant kratom, products containing 7-OH as an added ingredient can be dangerous,” states a civil forfeiture complaint filed on Nov. 21 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri. “In the human body, 7-OH is able to bind to opioid receptors, raising concerns about its potential for abuse.”
7-OH products are advertised as improving chronic pain and “mental clarity,” and they are sold in Missouri smoke shops, gas stations, convenience stores and online shops. 
The FDA sent warning letters in June to the facility owners, Shaman Botanicals LLC and Relax Relief Rejuvenate Trading LLC, stating the 7-OH products were considered “adulterated” and their labels were illegal under federal food laws.
On Nov. 12 and 13, FDA officials did an unannounced inspection of the three facilities, where they tagged and detained 76,000 units. Vince Sanders, who owns Shaman Botanicals LLC, said the company had the opportunity to appeal the FDA’s action, which they did. Shaman was the first company to make 7-OH products, Sanders said.
The DOJ filed a complaint to seize the detained products on Nov. 21, and officials from the FDA and U.S. Marshal Service seized the tagged boxes on Tuesday.
“The 7-OH products seized are illegal under federal law and pose risks to consumers, including children,” said R. Matthew Price, U.S. attorney for the Western District of Missouri. “We are committed to helping American consumers protect themselves from dangerous chemicals posing as health products.”
Price said the department will continue to work with the FDA “to ensure illegal products never enter the stream of commerce and pursue all possible civil and criminal remedies against those who violate federal laws.”
Missouri AG launches investigation into manufacturers of kratom, 7-OH

However, Sanders told The Independent Thursday the seized units were only a small portion of the 7-OH products that were at the warehouse during the FDA’s November inspection. And his employees were allowed to continue making products while the federal agents were tagging and later seizing products in the warehouse. 
“This is the craziest part,” Sanders said. “We literally sat there continuing to make the same products that they were taking.”
Sanders said the agents explained that they were targeting the finished packages, but there were many more finished products in the warehouse than the ones that were detained and ultimately seized. 
In the FDA’s June warning letter, the agency deemed that 7-OH is a “new dietary ingredient.” The letter states that a dietary supplement is adulterated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act if it contains a new dietary ingredient that doesn’t have enough evidence to show it isn’t dangerous.
“Because there is inadequate information available to provide a reasonable assurance that 7-OH does not present a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury, it is illegal to sell dietary supplement products containing it as an ingredient,” the release states. 
Sanders told The Independent in July that his company conducted three research studies on the products, including using rodents and beagles, which he believes shows the products are safe.
“This is just destroying something that has the potential to save hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of lives long term,” Sanders said.
He said there will likely be a hearing on the recent action in the next few weeks.
On the same day the DOJ’s complaint was filed on Nov. 21, Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway sent “civil investigative demand” letters to Sanders’ company and six other producers and distributors of 7-OH products.
The letters mandate the company hand over multiple types of documents, including lab test results, research on health risks and safety label information.
Consumers, Hanaway said in a press release, “may be exposed to unapproved, unsafe and deceptively marketed opioid-like drugs.”
According to the letters sent to each company, the attorney general’s investigation targets the distribution of products containing 7-OH or “any part of the plant Mitragyna speciosa,” which is the kratom plant.
“We are deeply concerned,” Hanaway said, “that Missourians are being sold drug-like substances under the guise of harmless supplements, with no FDA approval, no safety testing, and in some cases no meaningful disclosure of what these products actually contain.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-04-at-5.33.16 PM-e1764891668919.png,,,2025-12-05 07:57:30.182853

Tragically, she not only lost her 20-week pregnancy, her young son required hospitalization and surgery due to a severe Campylobacter and E. coli infection linked to the raw milk.
Her story illustrates a painful truth: parents trying to protect their children’s health are increasingly misled by misinformation amplified by people entrusted to lead and safeguard the public.
As we look back on 2025, the data paint a sobering picture of a nation backsliding on basic public health protections. We have witnessed a resurgence of preventable diseases, with alarming statistics:

Measles: 1,753 cases, with 12% hospitalized and three children losing their lives.
Whooping cough: 25,000 cases and three infant deaths.
Influenza: Low vaccination rates and the highest pediatric death count since national reporting began—280 and climbing.

These epidemics were preventable. Together, they underscore not only the life-saving role of vaccines, but the necessity of a robust public health system — one rooted in facts, scientific principles and transparent communication.
That system is now under direct assault. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his allies have systematically weakened the nation’s health-protection infrastructure through funding cuts, staffing reductions and sweeping personnel firings. Under the banner of “radical transparency,” they have reframed well-established scientific facts as open questions.
The effect is predictable: sowing doubt, discrediting science and undermining evidence-based medicine.
As the public is encouraged to focus on the extremely small risks associated with vaccines, genuinely dangerous products are quietly pushed into the mainstream under the banner of “natural wellness.” The messaging often aims to make parents feel guilty for relying on science rather than appearing “wholesome” or “pure.”
The consequences are already visible. The CDC website — which for decades served as the global gold standard for authoritative scientific information — now includes statements that are scientifically false, including the assertion that “vaccines do not cause autism is not an evidence-based claim.”
Such messaging distorts decades of research, depriving American families of a trusted and impartial source of truth.
When a claim is simple, anyone can evaluate it. If someone insists a cat is a dog, the truth is obvious.
But complex scientific questions require years of specialized training. Most families do not have medical experts at home to help interpret these issues. Historically, Americans relied on public-health agencies for accurate guidance on vaccines, infectious diseases, and emerging threats. Today, that option is eroding.
Layer onto this a chaotic online environment, where misinformation spreads instantly, sometimes through automated or coordinated accounts, and families are left vulnerable. Dangerous products are marketed as “natural,” while genuinely life-saving tools like vaccines are recast as suspect. In this vacuum, parents searching for answers about autism or other medical conditions become political pawns.
When government websites obscure evidence and present falsehoods, it’s simply propaganda — and it puts families at risk.
Parents today face an unusually complex information landscape. The cost of this war on science will be measured in American lives if the integrity of our public-health agencies is not restored.
Let’s breakdown some key pieces of misinformation:
 Are vaccines linked to autism?

This myth began with a discredited 1998 study by Andrew Wakefield, funded by lawyers preparing to sue vaccine manufacturers. The paper was later retracted, and Wakefield lost his medical license. Yet the myth persists.
High-quality studies — including one tracking more than 657,000 children — find no association between the MMR vaccine and autism.
Other claims focus on aluminum adjuvants. A 24-year study of more than 1.2 million Danish children found no link between aluminum-containing vaccines and any autoimmune, allergic, or neurodevelopmental disorders. For context: while children receive about 3 mg of aluminum from vaccines by age two, a breastfed infant consumes 7 mg in the first six months of life.
Thimerosal, a preservative once used in some vaccines, has also been falsely implicated. The work of Mark and David Geier, early proponents of the thimerosal-autism claim, has since been discredited for flawed methodology, and both have faced professional sanctions. A landmark Danish study compared autism rates before and after thimerosal was removed from vaccines in 1992 and found no association.
Despite this overwhelming evidence, RFK Jr. has now appointed David Geier — an individual with a long, well-documented record of scientific misconduct — to investigate whether vaccines cause autism. This is not only a reinvestigation of a question that has been definitively answered; it reflects a troubling full-circle moment.
The original autism–vaccine myth grew from research funded by those seeking to sue vaccine manufacturers. Now the individual leading the nation’s health-protection agency has himself profited from lawsuits targeting vaccines and is using federal resources to search for evidence that what decades of science show does not exist.
This cycle doesn’t advance public health—it erodes trust and diverts attention from the real work of protecting American families.
 Is Ivermectin effective for cancer or COVID-19?

No clinical trial has shown that ivermectin improves survival or outcomes for cancer patients or individuals with COVID-19. Despite this, some states, including Texas, have made the drug available over the counter, increasing the risk of misuse, overdose, and avoidable harm.
 Why do autism diagnoses appear to be increasing?

It is important to recognize that diagnostic criteria have broadened significantly from DSM-I (1952) to DSM-5 (2022). Increased awareness, expanded definitions, and better access to services may all contribute to rising diagnosis rates.
 More Changes Coming

Earlier this year, RFK Jr. dismissed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the federal advisory committee responsible for providing vaccine recommendations to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
This week, the committee is slated to review Hepatitis B vaccine recommendations. Unfortunately, vaccine experts within the CDC have been excluded from the discussion once again. It is difficult to see how implementing policy without a sound scientific basis or rationale will enhance public health. State-level leaders must carefully consider the importance of offering clear, scientifically grounded guidance in the vacuum of public health leadership.
Parents today must navigate an unusually complex information environment. As health professionals, our responsibility is to provide clear, accurate data; answer questions respectfully; and support families in making informed decisions.
Regardless of political viewpoint, our shared goal is the same: healthy children, strong communities, and a future where preventable illnesses no longer claim young lives. To achieve this, we must prioritize science, restore trust in our health institutions, and push back against misinformation.
Together, we can safeguard the next generation and ensure that preventable diseases do not take more innocent lives.",,,,2025-12-05 07:57:30.182853

(Courtesy photo)In recent years, the Indiana Commission for Women has thrown a lovely event to honor Indiana women with Torchbearer Awards.
A plated meal in a well-appointed banquet room or historical setting; women coming up on stage to be recognized for their accomplishments and efforts. It was the highlight of the commission’s year.
But this year, there was no public event. No cheesecake dessert or stage or round of applause from hundreds of attendees. Instead, the five Torchbearer honorees received their awards in a private meeting in the governor’s office. Reporters weren’t even invited.
“We believe this format was best suited to give these exceptional women a personal audience with the governor and allow time for conversations about the important work they do,” said Griffin Reid, press secretary for Gov. Mike Braun.
But it’s really a part of a larger move away from highlighting women and minorities, including state contracting programs.
The commission has been around since 1992 by executive order and since 1996 by statute. Its mission is to “elevate the well-being of women in Indiana by understanding their needs and supporting their active involvement in all areas of society.”

Similarly, the Torchbearer Awards were created in 2004 to celebrate the achievements of talented women across diverse industries and roles with Indiana.
“A Torchbearer epitomizes a trailblazer who, through her courage, resilience, and compassion, emerges as a guiding light. Leading by example, she sparks inspiration, igniting a flame that illuminates pathways for others to follow,” the website says.
“Titled ‘Torchbearers,’ these remarkable women carry forth the torch for Indiana’s women to follow. The statue of Victory atop the Soldiers and Sailors Monument at Monument Circle was chosen to symbolize these awards. Victory embodies the character and achievements of our esteemed recipients, while the flame she holds aloft not only beckons other women to follow but signifies the brilliance Hoosier women have brought to our state and communities.”
Before Braun took office in January, the Indiana Commission for Women had its own line item in the state budget of $113,601 annually. That’s now gone.
The women’s commission is ostensibly part of the Civil Rights Commission now, which provides administrative support for the group and four other cultural commissions.
The other four, though, kept their funding line items — albeit slightly reduced. The Civil Rights Commission also had its budget cut by lawmakers and the governor.
In addition, the Indiana Commission for Women hasn’t met all year — aside from a January meeting that was scheduled before Braun took over.
Brooklyn Marrs, from the civil rights commission, said a May meeting didn’t have a quorum but the executive committee met in July.
“The Indiana General Assembly did not approve an allocation for the Indiana Commission for Women for this budget biennium. There are no specific staff members assigned to the ICW, but the Indiana Civil Rights Commission team is providing administrative support.
It’s a shame that we have reached a point that programs to honor or recognize women have been scuttled.
It was only 100 years ago that women were able to vote. Heck, it was 1988 when Congress eliminated the requirement that women have their husband or another man co-sign for business loans. 1988!
It seems obvious to me that women have some more progress to make before we can reach true equality, and if that means an annual public event to tout successes I’m all for it.

(Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)For nearly a year now, state officials have been wrestling with a surprisingly difficult question: where do you put a 4-ton bronze Marcus Whitman? 
The statue, which occupies the north portico of the Washington state Capitol, is so heavy it threatens the integrity of the building. Moving it outside exposes it to the weather and vandalism. Finding a new indoor space requires costly structural engineering. And placing it next to the forthcoming statue of Billy Frank Jr. is appropriately off the table.
But after months of meetings, alternatives, and six separate location proposals, the state is still circling around the same flawed assumption: that the Whitman statue must be saved.
It doesn’t.
If we want to be honest about how we commemorate our past, Washington should consider an option officials haven’t yet put on the table: dismantling or otherwise retiring the statue.
This isn’t about erasing history. It’s about stopping the long-running mistake of elevating a myth.
A manufactured legacy
Whitman’s story is familiar to anyone who passed through the Washington public school system before the last couple of decades. The missionary-doctor who “saved the Oregon Territory” through a heroic ride east, an early frontier morality tale.
But generations of historians have undercut that myth. The story wasn’t merely exaggerated; it was manufactured. It was deployed to justify white settlement, minimize Indigenous sovereignty, and frame American expansion through a Christian nationalist lens.
The statue in Olympia was installed for that purpose. The program for its 1953 dedication spells out the message in stark terms: Washington’s political leaders openly used Whitman to elevate a factually wrong, racially exclusionary narrative of the region’s past.
The object itself embodies that propaganda campaign. Keeping it upright on our state Capitol grounds, no matter where it’s placed, keeps the old story upright as well.
Part of this quandary exists because the state never established a clear process for removing outdated monuments.
In 2022, state Sen. Sam Hunt proposed a thoughtful framework that would have given the Department of Enterprise Services clear authority to relocate or retire statues under conditions such as structural necessity, modern cultural evaluation, or legislative direction.
That bill didn’t pass. As a result, agencies are now improvising a process with committees, stakeholder groups, public comment, and months of studies. The result is we’re spending time and resources trying to preserve an object we have no public obligation to maintain.
Letting go
Statues are tools of commemoration, not historical records. We don’t honor someone in bronze so future generations can learn about them; that’s what museums, archives, books, and classrooms are for. We honor someone in bronze because we want them to literally loom over our civic space.
Whitman can and should remain part of our historical record. But the argument that removing a statue “erases history” has it backwards. Leaving a monument built to support a discredited myth actually obscures history. It keeps the lie visible and the truth buried in specialist texts.
The Legislature recognized this when it voted in 2021 to replace Washington’s Whitman statues with representations of Billy Frank Jr., whose leadership on treaty rights, salmon recovery, and environmental justice shaped modern Washington.

The owner of a Johnson property worth $240,000 was offered about $40,000 by FEMA. “I feel like the mortgage company got their money, the town’s getting our property, and we’re getting sh-t,” Mandy Lacefield said.

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in News & Citizen on Dec. 4, 2025.
Nearly two and a half years ago, Mandy Lacefield and her husband, Matt, woke in the night as dark water seeped into their home in Johnson.
Lacefield and Matt, trapped in their home on River Road West overlooking the confluence of the Lamoille and Gihon rivers, had to be evacuated the night the river broke its banks on July 11, 2023, devastating Johnson with one of the worst flooding events to hit the town in nearly a century.
In the aftermath, there was the cleanup, the dragging out of all their worldly belongings, now soaked with sewer sludge and refuse. At the same time, they had to meet tight deadlines to submit vital documents to the Federal Emergency Management Agency if they wanted any assistance from the federal government.
While the American Red Cross workers who showed up in the aftermath provided unquestioning support, Lacefield noted, FEMA gave them a checklist and a timeline. Lacefield and her husband scrambled to locate birth certificates and social security cards in the sodden wreckage.
Even after the deluge and destruction, Lacefield, who grew up in town, wanted to keep her home. After scraping and saving, she and Matt had moved into the home in the village in 2019 and spent the first few years renovating its interior, unchanged since it was built in the 1970s.
While they waited to hear from FEMA, they were effectively made homeless. Flood insurance only covered the remaining mortgage on the home. FEMA couldn’t assist them in finding temporary housing because Lacefield refused to part with her pets, which she had owned for over a decade.
After promising to park a temporary mobile home at her father’s property on Ober Hill Road on the north end of town, the agency canceled those plans after weeks of wrangling over what Lacefield said were minor septic capacity issues on the property.
She wasn’t alone. The agency had initially promised to set up 20 such homes in Montpelier but ended up backing out by the end of 2023 and providing the town with monetary compensation instead, according to VTDigger.
She ended up acquiring a camper trailer, whose owner had originally listed it for $5,000 but instead donated it to Lacefield after learning she had been displaced by the flood. Waiting on the trailer home promised by FEMA, she did not weatherize the makeshift home and spent a frigid winter in the camper.
A year after she was first displaced, Lacefield said she was informed by FEMA that the agency would not assist in restoring the home to its former state, and would only provide monetary assistance for elevating the home or through a property buyout, a process which would compensate Lacefield and make town owner of the land.
Two years after Mandy Lacefield and her husband, Matt, were evacuated as the river destroyed their home, Lacefield finally received an offer on her property. Despite her home being appraised by FEMA at a pre-flood value of $240,000, she was offered just a fraction, about $40,000. Courtesy photo
Both of Lacefield’s neighbors on River Road West have also pursued buyouts, as has the owner of the former Sterling Market on the far side of the river, through a separate federal program.
Federally aided home elevation is just as arduous, if not more, than the property buyout process, and appealed to Lacefield even less, so she went with the latter option.
Two years after she and her husband were evacuated as the river destroyed their home, Lacefield finally received an offer on her property. Despite FEMA appraising the property at a pre-flood value of $240,000, Lacefield was offered just a fraction of that — about $40,000. She said the agency justified the low appraisal based on the home’s flood insurance, which made the bank that held the mortgage whole but went no further.

“I feel like the mortgage company got their money, the town’s getting our property, and we’re getting sh-t,” Lacefield said.
Lacefield is set to close on the buyout process later this month. Earlier this year, her dad died, providing a bitter solution to her search for viable shelter — his Ober Hill home. Despite nearing the finish line of a process that was supposed to help her move on from the worst moment of her life, she said it feels like it’s still happening, and FEMA’s slow process and meager assistance at the end of the wait has offered little consolation.
“It still feels like a living nightmare, and it’s never ending, and I want to wake up from it,” Lacefield said.
Getting closure
In the aftermath of the July 2023 flood, and faced with the prospect of increasingly severe and frequent floods as the climate in Vermont warms, the state, in an effort to shift the settlement patterns in towns along once-commercially crucial rivers, pledged to provide a portion of its federal COVID-19 recovery funds to help FEMA fund property buyouts.
Lacefield is one of 17 residential property owners in Johnson who have pursued buyouts. Just five of those have concluded the process or are scheduled to conclude it soon, according to Sarah Henshaw, a coordinator with the Lamoille Area Recovery Network, a group founded in the aftermath of the flood of July 2023 — and funded by the United Way of Lamoille County — to assist people affected by the disaster.
It’s a similar picture elsewhere in Lamoille County.

Of the eight owners of single-family homes in Wolcott who pursued a buyout — five of which were funded by the state instead of FEMA — only one has not concluded the process.
In Cambridge, just one of the seven buyout properties, including three multi-family buildings accounting for 10 units, has reached its conclusion. Morristown and Elmore each have one buyout property, both still in limbo.
For some who have reached the conclusion of the property buyout process, Henshaw said, it hasn’t brought solace or left them financially better off.
In one case, FEMA offered less than the mortgage holder says is due, saddling the former property owner with debt. Another is having to seek legal remedy after a flood insurance provider mandated by the property’s mortgage holder paid out less than previously promised. One property went into foreclosure by the time the buyout process was concluded, as the former owners could not afford to keep up mortgage payments on both a habitable residence and their destroyed home.
Other complicating factors have further slowed FEMA’s progress. A home was initially misclassified by the state and federal inspectors delayed the process by six months, according to Henshaw. The agency’s assistance program for renters, which aids tenants who would be displaced by the buyout of a multi-family property, is also complicating and slowing those buyout cases.
In October, Grist, a climate-change focused nonprofit news site, reported that Vermont Emergency Management was put under increased scrutiny from FEMA after overspending millions in federal funding on an expensive consultant company after flooding in the Northeast Kingdom in 2024. Despite this, spokesperson Mark Bosma said a state program that provides support for displaced renters will continue in 2026.
“We have a group of people in our community that were very good, solid, middle-class people, contributing members of our community, that now have financial problems,” Henshaw said.

Phil Murphy launched last year.,"LaShawn Fitch was so excited to FaceTime friends after he was released from prison that he did so before even leaving the prison grounds on Dec. 4, 2025. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)BRIDGETON — For 17 years, LaShawn Fitch has fought for his freedom, saying he never participated in the 2008 murder in Eatontown that landed him behind bars on a 40-year prison term.
Thursday, he was released from South Woods State Prison to an impatient, joyful crowd of family and other supporters, after Gov. Phil Murphy commuted his sentence last month. He was one of 283 people to get clemency so far under a sweeping initiative Murphy began last year.
Although he walked out the prison doors two hours later than scheduled, he loitered in the cold sunshine across the street to hug loved ones, FaceTime friends, give a speech, change into an outfit his mom brought, make sure boxes of legal paperwork got into the right car, muse about his future, and do any other number of things besides leave.
“C’mon, you got to get off of these prison grounds,” supporter Derrick Hamilton told him after about 40 minutes. “You’ve been here long enough.”
So everyone hit the road home. But Fitch said he’s far from done with the prison system.
“I’m not going to stop until my name is exonerated,” he said. “I’ve been helping brothers with lawsuits. I still got three, four pending lawsuits against prisons right now … So just know this: This is just being written. We still going. We moving forward.”

Fitch’s fervor is unsurprising to anyone who knows him.
At New Jersey State Prison in Trenton, he became a paralegal and eventually director of the inmate legal association, a prisoner-run group in some prisons that helps incarcerated people with court filings. He has filed grievances, sued the state, and spoken out publicly over everything from better computer access for incarcerated people to solitary confinement to pandemic restrictions that lingered long after the crisis ended. He suspects he was transferred from Trenton, where he’d spent most of his time incarcerated, to South Woods, the state’s largest lockup, as retaliation for his prison activism, so he sued over that too.
Thursday, he took advantage of the moment to continue agitating for change. He thanked Murphy for his “courage and boldness” in granting more than twice as many clemencies as previous governors combined in the past 30 years — and then he called on Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill to carry on the work.
“There’s so many deserving brothers and sisters that need the opportunity that I get today,” he said.
He also blasted New Jersey’s worst-in-the-nation racial disparities in its prison population and urged lawmakers to act on Murphy’s stalled plan to stop sending technical parole violators back to prison. Those are people who break the conditions of their parole, rather than get charged with new crimes.
Two exonerees joined Fitch’s family outside the prison to cheer his release — Hamilton, who left prison 14 years ago after his wrongful conviction in a New York case, and Sean Washington, who was exonerated in 2020 in a Camden case and befriended Fitch when both were incarcerated in Trenton.
Both men beamed at Fitch as he flitted among his relatives for hugs and high-fives, remembering well the days they finally saw freedom.
“I like to say we left in the Flintstone era and came back in the Jetsons era. Everything is so fast, these phones, this technology, you know, everything’s changed over the years. It’s a rough transition,” Washington said.
Hamilton thinks Fitch will be just fine. Hamilton is now the deputy director of Cardozo School of Law’s Perlmutter Center for Legal Justice, and his center has been investigating Fitch’s case for two years with the goal of clearing his name.
“We going to do everything we can to find the evidence that we can to exonerate him,” Hamilton said. “We take our time. We want to make sure we get it right.”

Murphy has taken a categorical approach to clemency to make it fairer, considering cases that fit certain categories, including those with excessive trial penalties. That’s when a defendant refuses a pretrial plea bargain and exercises their right to trial, only to get a much longer sentence after conviction. Prosecutors had offered Fitch a 20-year plea bargain, but he opted to go to trial because of his innocence claim — and then got 40 years.
The state has also increasingly trended toward leniency for juveniles in criminal trouble. Fitch was 17 — just one year older than his son is now — when the murder that derailed his life occurred.
He’s now 35. Soon, he will join father Anthony Robinson’s remodeling business until he can resume his legal work. He aims to be a lawyer — though that is not news to his family. He represented himself at his 2014 trial after he lost faith in his assigned counsel. He also wrote a book, titled “A Prisoner’s Plight,” that he hopes to get published, and he plans to start a nonprofit called Justice for Jersey and a podcast to feature the stories of those granted clemency.
“I carry full and wholeheartedly the spirit of a fighter. I’m going to continue to fight,” Fitch said.
But first, sweet potato pie.
His aunt Tereasa Robinson was up at 4 a.m. making several pies, and his mother, Barbara Robinson, said the family planned a belated Thanksgiving celebration at her Jersey Shore home with collard greens, macaroni and cheese, fried chicken, and more of Fitch’s favorite foods.
“Today is an amazing day. I’m just so overjoyed,” his mother said. “This is surreal. It’s surreal. I don’t have many words other than this is just surreal.”

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) told the Wisconsin Examiner in a year-end interview that Democrats have spent the past year preparing to lead and she is optimistic about the chances for flipping the Assembly. Neubauer reflected on the current session and previewed what’s ahead.
The effect of smaller margins and the remainder of session
This session has been different from previous ones, said Neubauer, who was first elected to the state Assembly in 2018 and has led Assembly Democrats since 2022. 
“Closer numbers in the state Assembly and state Senate have yielded some more bipartisan work,” Neubauer said. Republicans hold a 54 to 45 majority in the Assembly, and a 18 to 15 majority in the state Senate. 
She felt the difference this year  from her first seven years in the body, she said, when Democrats were “in a position where we really were on defense and having to spend a huge amount of time just trying to prevent the worst policy ideas from going through.”
That work across the aisle, she said, was evident in the state budget, when Senate Democrats had a seat at the negotiating table and were able to secure more money for public schools. She also sees a difference in some of the housing bills that recently passed the Legislature. Neubauer said that Assembly task forces focused on children’s social media use and elder care also allowed for discussion across the aisle and she is hopeful they will yield some bipartisan legislation.
Still, she said, the session hasn’t yielded everything she had hoped for. 
“We have not seen the kind of movement that I would have hoped, especially given that we’re  all up for election next year, and everyone’s going to have to go home and answer to their constituents for what was and was not accomplished.”
Neubauer said Republicans have continued to “ignore” the core challenges facing Wisconsinites, which for the most part center on costs. 
“That’s what we hear over and over from the people that we represent,” Neubauer said, noting several issues where Democratic lawmakers have introduced proposals or advocated for action. “There’s been no interest from our Republican colleagues on addressing the cost of prescription drugs and health care, especially in light of the [Affordable Care Act] premiums going up in a significant way. We have had a bill out for the entire session on Healthy School Meals. This would save the average family with two kids $1,800 a year. People would really appreciate that money right now, especially going into the holiday season, but we’ve had no interest from our Republican colleagues in addressing that issue…. and we do need to see more movement on housing and on child care.” 
Neubauer also noted that a bill to extend postpartum Medicaid remains stuck in the state Assembly due to opposition from Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester). Democratic lawmakers tried to force a vote on the issue during their last scheduled floor session this year, but failed. 
Neubauer said she still hopes that measure could advance next year in the time remaining in the session. 
“We know that people across the state believe that new moms should have access to health care. It’s essential for mom and baby… You do have to ask why [Rep.] Pat Snyder and [Rep.] Jessie Rodriguez, authors on that bill, are not able to get it done when they are governing,” Neubauer said. “They’re in the majority, and they have been for a long time.”
Despite the gridlock on certain issues, Neubauer said Democratic lawmakers have been able to think differently this year. 
“We are able to think about what bills are we going to pass when we’re governing. How can we work across the aisle and use our numbers to get things done and put pressure on Republicans to make the bills better if they need our support,” Neubauer said. “I do think that we are preparing to govern in that way, and we’re really working over the next several months to get more input from our constituents on the things that are important to them to make sure that our agenda and our plan for the first hundred days is really tuned to the particular challenges that people are facing.” 
Democratic lawmakers have spent the session introducing and advocating for bills on a number of issues including K-12 education, higher education, local government and elections. Most haven’t advanced or received a public hearing, but they are laying the groundwork for the future. 
“The bills that we’ve rolled out this fall would be things we would absolutely do when we come into the majority,” Neubauer said. “We also know there are some pretty essential rights and freedoms that we would want, things like enshrining access to abortion in state law, in case there are further court cases that would put that at risk.” 
Neubauer said Democratic lawmakers will have additional bills coming out in the next few weeks and in 2026, addressing public safety, housing and health care. She declined to provide details on what those proposals might do.
Neubauer said her caucus will continue to push for additional education funding in the fall, including general aid. This year the state budget included additional funding for special education, but Republican lawmakers refused to provide an increase in general aid — something that public school leaders and advocates have said will strain their budgets and put pressure on property taxpayers. 
“We have failed to adequately fund our local public schools and what we see from Republicans is [a plan to] consolidate districts and close local schools. No one’s asking us for that,” Neubauer said. “They’re asking us to maintain that essential funding that will allow their kids to attend a grade school where they get a good reading and math education, they’re safe, and they’re prepared for their future career.”
Neubauer also commented on a handful of other issues that the Legislature is grappling with.

Neubauer called WisconsinEye, the independent, nonprofit service that provides coverage of Wisconsin state government similar to C-Span, “essential.” WisconsinEye has announced it will have to cease operations Dec. 15 if it does not receive more funds. She said she thinks there is a bipartisan understanding of the service the network  provides and is hopeful lawmakers will be able to make changes to the law to allow WisconsinEye to access state funds that were set aside for it. She said Wisconsinites deserved to know what’s going on in the state Capitol. “They deserve to be able to watch testimony on a bill that’s really important to them or their family and to know how their representative is responding on a certain issue or voting on the floor of the Assembly,” she said. “We should have structured their funding a little differently in the state budget, but we have an opportunity to do so now to make sure that they can provide that service.” The state initially set aside $10 million for the nonprofit in the 2023-25 state budget that it could only access if it raised the same amount, but it failed to do so. The opportunity to access the funds for an endowment was extended in the 2025-27 state budget, but the organization has struggled to raise funds for both the endowment and its operational costs.
Lawmakers have also been discussing, once again, legalizing medical marijuana, though Neubauer said she isn’t sure if Republicans, who are standing in the way, will budge this session. “The reality here is that THC products are available in Wisconsin because of the Farm Bill… so I do think that that’s shifted the conversation. People of Wisconsin have been very clear that they want access to both medical and recreational marijuana, and we should be regulating this market and taxing it, making sure that kids don’t have access to these products,” Neubauer said. “I do think it will be difficult for Republicans to go home and explain why they still have not done anything when we’re an island of prohibition here.” 
On funds that have not been released to combat PFAS contamination in drinking water, Neubauer said she hopes the Legislature can finally get something done. “There have been some productive conversations on this issue. The central conflict really remains that Democrats believe that polluters should pay for the damage that they have done, and I’m not really sure my Republican colleagues would agree with that, and so that’s been a challenge for us to move through, but we just have to do something,” Neubauer said. “We have communities in Wisconsin that cannot drink the water coming out of their tap, and that’s unacceptable.” 

2026 elections and a potential majority
Neubauer, who confirmed she will be running for another term in the Assembly, said she is optimistic about Democrats’ chances of winning the Assembly majority next year. The 2026 elections will serve as Assembly Democrats’ second opportunity under new legislative maps adopted in 2024 to try to flip the chamber for the first time in 16 years. 
In 2024, Democrats won 10 additional seats. For Democrats to win control in 2026, they’ll need to hold all of their current seats and win five more. 
The seats that they’ll be competing for are very close, Neubauer said, including some that former Vice President Kamala Harris won in 2024, even as she lost the state as a whole.
“There are people who like the vision that we’re putting forward in these districts, so the path is there. We are recruiting great candidates who are very connected to their local community and who are ready to go out and speak directly to the voters of their district from now until election day,” Neubauer said. “That’s how we win. We win by talking about the failures of Republicans and pointing out that they have been in control here for coming up on 15 years, and they have really failed to provide the essential services that people deserve.” 
Neubauer said it helps that Democrats have fewer seats that they need to flip in 2026, so they’ll be able to better focus on tough districts. 
Neubauer said Democrats have candidates from a diverse array of backgrounds including teachers, coaches, small business owners, farmers, public safety employees and union members, who she said are representative of the state.  
“We know that people want to see folks in office that remind them of themselves and of their neighbors and who understand the challenges that they’re going through. We’ve got folks running who get what it’s like to be looking at the budget and worried about how they’re going to make it to the next month or how they’re going to afford those Christmas gifts or special meals for the holidays,” she said. 
She said to look out for more candidate announcements early next year.
Neubauer also said the election results from across the country bode well for Democrats in Wisconsin. She said the results in  New Jersey and Virginia were a “really strong overperformance for Democrats.” She said it’s a sign that people are unhappy with Republican leadership and the direction of the country.
“[President] Donald Trump said that he was going to focus on the economy and making life a little easier for folks, and he has engaged in reckless trade wars, and taking other steps that have made it harder for people to get by — not easier,” Neubauer said. She also said it is “shocking” that Trump would “completely fail” to recognize how cutting SNAP funding would hurt people, and said his comments about running for a third term are “unsettling” and it is “incumbent on all of us who believe in democracy and who believe in fair elections” to push back.
“I think you’re seeing the effects of that on people across the country. Not only the federal Republicans, but their state level Republicans are just not following through on the promises that they made so I think people are looking for something different and that gives us an opportunity here.”
Wisconsinites will also make a choice next year in a high-profile open race for governor, and Neubauer said she’ll do everything she can to elect a Democratic governor. 
“I am looking for someone who understands the necessity of winning in Wisconsin next year and is focused on communicating with the people of this state a vision for how life would be better with Democrats running the state Capitol,” Neubauer said. “It’s really important that we put out a vision, and that we connect directly with the people of Wisconsin and push through the frustration that folks have with politics right now by being really clear about what we’ll do and then winning and then getting those things done.”
Neubauer said she is happy with the field of Democrats running for governor, especially given how many have legislative experience, but won’t be making an endorsement. She noted that Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan and U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore all spent time serving in the Wisconsin Legislature. 
Two current lawmakers, state Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison), and state Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison), are running along with former lawmakers Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, Milwaukee Co. Executive David Crowley and former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes.
“We’re excited that so many folks understand what it’s like to be a legislator and who will work well, I think, with our caucus in a governing trifecta,” Neubauer said. 
Former Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation CEO Missy Hughes, another Democratic gubernatorial hopeful, has no legislative experience.
In the event a Republican wins, Neubauer said Democrats in the Legislature will “work with them to the best of our ability to deliver.” 
U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, who is considered the frontrunner in the primary race, and Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann, are the current Republican hopefuls.
“We show up every day remembering that our constituents sent us here to get things done and that has to be our first priority, so we will work with anybody who wants to work with us and that would include a Republican governor if that’s the situation that we’re in,” Neubauer said. “People are struggling, and it is our responsibility to respond to that and to do what we can to help.”

Those findings were delivered Thursday in a new report from the Citizens Research Council of Michigan, which analyzed the budget bills passed by the Legislature for the current 2025-26 fiscal year, including the transportation funding deal that underpinned many of the disagreements between the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and the Democratic-led Senate.
The report looked at the sources of new revenue, as well as how the funding would likely be distributed among the Michigan Department of Transportation, the state’s county road commissions, and local road agencies.
One of the key findings is that the oversights in the funding bills make it hard to predict if the bills would fund the roads as intended, and on time to really make a difference.
“By replacing the sales tax with an increase in the motor fuel tax rate, the Michigan Transportation Fund will receive a meaningful funding increase that should be dependable for years to come,” said Eric Paul Dennis, PE, research associate for infrastructure and author of the report. “But much of the other changes in this package appear haphazard and not well thought-out. Policymakers and road agencies will have to wait and see how much revenue from the Marijuana Wholesale Tax and Corporate Income Tax will become available.”memo1183-assessment_of_2025_transportation_funding_package
Dennis said that even if all of the anticipated revenue is provided, the uncertainty “imposes new difficulties in planning and programming construction projects.”
The package was intended to provide up to $1 billion in new road funding in 2026, and $2 billion by the 2030 fiscal year.
But much of that funding could be delayed from distribution, the report said, and might not be fully available. The report also found that the funding approach was overly complicated, inefficient and ineffective at making the available funds ready for the best use.
Of note, the Citizens Research Council of Michigan determined that the package did not address any other road and infrastructure issues aside from the funding needed to make it happen.
“It is unclear if the authors of the 2025 [package] intended for Michigan’s state road program to prioritize local agencies over MDOT so drastically,” the report said. “If so, it is unclear why. Such an approach is likely to increase the reliance of local road agencies on state funding with little accountability. Further, it is unclear if funding dedicated to MDOT will be sufficient to continue to improve and maintain the critical state trunkline system.”
The council also called the formula, which will give 50% of increased revenue sharing to local road agencies, antiquated, as it will then be distributed to local agencies in a way that has been done for many years.
“This has led to some local agencies being drastically underfunded while others likely receive more state revenue than makes sense,” the report said. “The 2025 [package] did nothing to address such inequities.”
As for the policy implications, the road agencies will likely be holding their breath to see if the new wholesale 24% tax on marijuana products sold in Michigan – a key piece of the new revenue model – will go up in smoke as it is being challenged in state court.
“Even if all anticipated revenue is provided, the uncertainty imposes new difficulties in planning and programming construction projects,” the report said. “More funding may be a partial temporary solution. But when applied to a broken system, more funding is just as likely to cause more problems.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_8629-1024x627.jpg,,,2025-12-05 06:57:17.948748

As farmers face historic headwinds and market hardships, calls to the national Farm Aid hotline and the Iowa Concern hotline — where farmers can get support in times of mental health crisis or need — are increasing.
This fall the Iowa Concern hotline saw four to five times the number of calls it had in the same months last year, said Tammy Jacobs, the hotline’s manager.
The Farm Aid hotline is also seeing a change in the urgency of calls.
“We’re seeing more established farmers calling in — people who know how to play the game and how to access programs. They’re calling more often now, because even with all that institutional knowledge, they’re still running into issues for the first time that are more complex and difficult to solve,” said Lori Mercer, a Farm Aid hotline operator. “The system that’s in place is simply letting them down. There’s just no further safety net.” 
Research shows farmers die by suicide at least twice as often as people in the general population, so there’s urgency to address the uptick in need. 
“It’s a huge issue. I mean, we’ve known at least three families this year whose loved ones died by suicide,” said Emma Yerkey, who’s part of the Ag Chapter of Gray Matters, a monthly meetup for ag producers around the Quad Cities to talk about their struggles.
Farmers experience a lot of stressors and uncertainty that they can’t control — isolation, weather changes, and financial pressures — along with low access to mental health care in rural areas and stigma that may make them keep their pain to themselves. Market conditions made worse by a trade war and inflation are adding to the stress. Mental health professionals are thinking outside the box to get producers care. 
Understanding the stress
Yerkey’s family farms corn, soybeans, and hay in Geneseo, Illinois on land they’ve owned since the Civil War. The farm is filled with memories, especially of her dad, Tim Yerkey. 
She played baseball with him in their driveway, the family ate meals together in the home, and, one year, her father helped her raise a ribbon-winning calf. 
“That was a really good memory that I have with him,” said Yerkey.
But the farm could be stressful, too. Tim Yerkey worked the land with his family, but at times had to take outside jobs to make ends meet. In 2011, he’d been struggling for about a year when spring floods left fields underwater. He’d reached out to friends and visited the emergency room seeking help, only to be told there were no beds, Yerkey said. He died by suicide in June 2011.

“I miss my dad, and I don’t want anybody else—or any other family—to go through that,” Yerkey said.
But many farming families experience similar pain. Between 2003 and 2017, more than 1600 farmers died by suicide, the majority older white men.  
Experts say factors that contribute to stress and higher suicide rates among farmers include isolation, easy access to guns, a cultural expectation of toughness, stigma around seeking mental health care, worries about who will take over the farm, and a lack of recognition for their hard work.
Financial losses and stress are also significant risks for depressive symptoms. And right now, times are tough for farmers. 
Producers have endured high inflation and growing input costs on farms since at least 2020. The spread of COVID and, more recently, policy decisions like President Trump’s tariffs and increases in immigration enforcement have all increased operating costs. At the same time, prices for major commodities are low — lower than the cost to grow them. Corn prices are about $0.85 below the break even point and soybeans are about $2 below. 
This year, many states are expecting a record corn crop, but farmers aren’t celebrating.
“It’s very discouraging for farmers to think that they’ve done all the things right in their fields and have put innovations in place and made good decisions, but yet, even with strong yields, they’re gonna be facing a loss on what they’re producing,” said Aaron Lehman, president of the Iowa Farmers Union.
In 2024, the U.S. exported about 42% of its soybeans, most of it to China. With China not buying in the midst of the trade war some farmers who usually send their crop abroad have struggled to find new markets. The U.S. in November struck a new deal with China, potentially extending a lifeline to producers still scrambling to move their harvest, but it remains to be seen what China will actually buy.
Some programs that helped connect farmers to domestic markets, like the Local Food Purchase Assistance initiative, have also been cut by the USDA. 
“Since the beginning of the year, the farmers have just been thrown into a different level of uncertainty with policy things like losing access to some markets through tariffs, losing access to staff and programming with the government shutdown, and the funding freezes. A big one we’re hearing about is losing access to labor with the ICE raids, etcetera,” said Mercer, with Farm Aid. “I was just speaking to a farmer the other day who was basically watching his crops rot on the vines because his usual labor support was just too afraid to show up this year.” 
In addition to all of the financial stress, farmers say they feel the work can be thankless. 
“This work is incredibly hard, and nobody understands where their food comes from. Nobody knows that [farmers] work 20 hours a day so that they can have a strawberry,” said Anna Scheyett, a retired professor of social work who studied farmer stress and suicide at the University of Georgia.
Meeting farmers where they’re at
Despite the many struggles, some families are finding hope and community in turbulent times. To honor her dad, Yerkey joined the new Ag Chapter of Gray Matters, a Quad Cities nonprofit that provides mental health resources, education, and safe spaces 
Gray Matters hosts monthly Barn Talks, where participants can share what’s weighing on them, whether it’s stress, depression, anxiety, or other struggles, and receive support from others. The organizers hope to build a sense of community and normalize talking about mental health.

“Feeling comfortable and safe to say that — ‘Hey, I am stressed out, or I am really hurting right now. Maybe I am depressed, maybe I have some anxiety,’ — whatever it might be,” said Heather Gritton, one of the group leaders.
Offering spaces where farmers can meet and take some of that load off their shoulders can help break down the stigma around getting help, said Sara Kohlbeck, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin. 
It’s key for those spaces to be easily accessible to farmers. 
“Bringing that support to the farmers—or to the rural communities—rather than expecting those folks to come and get those resources for themselves is really important,” said Kohlbeck. “Otherwise, you know, we’ve got folks that are kind of suffering in silence because they just don’t have the time. Sometimes there’s stigma, and there’s kind of that pride issue.” 
There are also practical barriers. Telehealth isn’t a viable option for many farmers, as cell and internet reception in rural areas are limited. Driving long distances to see a counselor can also be impractical, especially during the busy harvest season. 
Another approach to reaching farmers has been to train people who farmers trust and regularly interact with — such as suppliers, lenders, large animal veterinarians, and spouses — to recognize when someone may be dealing with mental health challenges and teach them how to support them and direct them to resources. 
For example, Scheyett has trained agricultural lenders to recognize warning signs of suicide ideation and taught them how to respond. She’s also trained extension agents to take a few minutes at the beginning of agricultural production meetings to talk about stress and offer resources, something she says can make a real difference for farmers.
In one study, Scheyett and her co-authors found that farmers who were present at meetings where about 10 minutes were dedicated to talking about stress management walked away with new ideas for managing stress and a higher level of commitment to doing it. 
Sometimes, offering practical and logistical solutions to big problems can be a part of mental health services, too. 
“If a farmer has not really looked and done a deep dive into their farm financial system, we have a program that’s called farm financial associates, and they’ll come out to the farm, do a big evaluation over the farming operation to see where the hard points are and is there a way to switch things around, diversify, in order to help offset some of the farming losses and costs,” Jacobs, with the Iowa Concern hotline, said.
For farmers facing grain storage challenges, Jacobs suggested partnering with other farmers as an alternative to traditional co-op arrangements.
Scheyett suggests everybody can help by thanking farmers the same way we do with the military.
“Every time I see a farmer, I say thank you — thank you for your service, because what you do keeps us healthy, fed, and clothed,” said Scheyett.
It’s all in the hopes of providing care and saving lives.
“Even if you can save one life, I mean, that’s so worth it,” said Yerkey. “I feel very passionate about it.” 
Farmers can reach out to the 988 Lifeline or 1-800-FARM-AID for help. Help is also available in Spanish.
The Iowa Concern hotline is available 24/7 via chat, email, call, or text at 800-447-1985.

A new state law expands the exemption, however, allowing the industry a larger tax break on electricity purchased to move petrol via pipelines.
The post Wyoming Supreme Court denies $3M tax exemption claim by oil and gas company appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming oil and gas producer Merit Energy is not entitled to $3 million in tax refunds for electricity it purchased for its operations, the Wyoming Supreme Court ruled this week.
In a 20-page ruling authored by Justice Robert C. Jarosh, the high court denied Merit’s claim that electricity purchases from 2020 to 2023 qualify under a state tax exemption intended for businesses engaged in “transportation.” Rather than transporting the product to market, according to the court, the electricity expenses were associated with production — like powering submersible pumps used to bring petrol and associated fluids to the surface and distributing them to separation facilities.
Essentially, the tax exemption applied only to power purchases for transportation via pipelines necessary to transfer the custody of the product and not for production-related activities, according to the court. 
“Across its units, Merit produces over 1,000,000 barrels of water daily to yield 15,000 barrels of crude oil,” the court noted. “The fluid arriving at the wellhead is not marketable crude oil, it is a commingled stream requiring processing before custody transfer.”

The ruling overturns a Wyoming State Board of Equalization decision and spares local governments from millions of dollars in potential “clawbacks,” according to some observers who say a ruling in favor of Merit might have incentivized other oil and gas operators to make similar claims. Local officials in Park County, for example, fretted over a series of amended oil and gas tax filings under various statutes asking for refunds, potentially jeopardizing budgets that were set on revenues already distributed.
New law expands ‘transportation’ tax exemption for industry
Though Merit’s electricity purchases from 2020 to 2023 did not qualify under the exemption, the same types of purchases will qualify going forward, due to a new law passed by the Legislature this year.
House Bill 311, “Exemption for transported fuel and power sales-amendments,” which went into effect July 1, extends the tax break to “sales of power or fuel to a person transporting tangible personal property by railroad or by pipeline when the power or fuel is consumed directly in generating motive power for actual transportation purposes, regardless of ownership of the transported tangible personal property.”
The previous version of the exemption either did not apply to, or was legally obscure, regarding some oil and gas pipelines, according to the Petroleum Association of Wyoming, which brought the measure to lawmakers.
“Our argument was, some pipelines are already exempt, but not all pipelines,” PAW President Pete Obermueller told WyoFile. “And that is a major competitive disadvantage to [Wyoming] operators that have to do a lot of moving of their product through these gathering lines.”

“Gathering” refers to a web of small pipelines that originate at individual wells and funnel toward larger pipelines that take petrol to refineries and, ultimately, to regional and national market trading points.
However, the “disadvantage” Obermueller mentioned — that Wyoming oil and gas producers had endured prior to the legislation — is unclear. When asked, Obermueller said he didn’t know how Wyoming’s laws compare to similar taxation methods in competing oil and gas-producing states.
Expanding the exemption will result in less revenue for oil- and natural gas-producing counties, according to the Wyoming Department of Revenue. But just how much is unclear.
According to the bill’s fiscal note: “The fiscal or personnel impact is not determinable due to insufficient time to complete the fiscal note process.”
Both PAW and the Department of Revenue noted that even the expanded tax exemption does not apply to all electricity purchases in the oil and gas industry.
“It’s pretty small in the sense that it only affects a certain amount of electricity purchased for a very specific reason,” Obermueller said, “and the only way to get the exemption is if you know how much electricity you’re using for that specific purpose.”
Overall, the expanded exemption could result in an annual revenue loss of about $10 million, Obermueller estimated. Electrical “power costs in Wyoming, apart from labor, are the single largest expense for producing resources here,” he said. “The point is, power costs are a barrier to production.”
The average monthly cost of electricity for all “industrial” consumers in Wyoming decreased by 2.3% year-over-year in August, according to a report by the University of Wyoming School of Energy Resources, compared to a 5% increase nationally.
The spot price for Wyoming crude oil was down 15.4% year-over-year, as of October. Production for the same period had ticked up only 0.1%. Wyoming natural gas production, year-over-year in August, was down nearly 5%.

Wyoming looks to pursue a grant for $5M renovation in one of its most popular parks. In the wake of recent via ferrata snafu, state is seeking as much public input as possible.
The post In Sinks Canyon State Park, makeover opportunity rises appeared first on WyoFile .","The Middle Fork of the Popo Agie River tumbles through snow-topped boulders in a yawning canyon before veering suddenly to the east and disappearing. 
The cave that swallows the river is the Sinks — a geologic marvel that is the centerpiece of one of Wyoming’s most popular state parks. Sinks Canyon State Park attracted more than 680,000 visitors in 2024. 
The facility where visitors can learn about the Sinks, however, is small and aging. The visitor center, built in 1972, features a small second-story exhibition space filled with taxidermied snakes and mammal skulls, area maps and souvenirs for sale. The building’s water system was damaged by a long-ago high-river event, and the bathrooms haven’t been open for at least a decade. There is no classroom for student fieldtrips, and school bus drivers have to make an awkward maneuver to exit the parking lot.

Wyoming State Parks has an opportunity to pursue matching grant funds to rebuild the visitor center — with a potential project budget of $5 million. And the agency is taking pains to gather public input before proceeding. 
“We don’t have a specific plan,” Carly-Ann Carruthers, planning manager for Wyoming Department of State Parks and Cultural Resources, told a room of locals on Dec. 1 in Lander. “Community feedback is vital. We want to hear from you.”

This process is coming on the heels of another Sinks Canyon development proposal that did not go smoothly for Wyoming State Parks. The agency in 2023 pulled the plug on a contentious proposal to build a via ferrata in Sinks following years of backlash and debate. 
Much of the initial concern stemmed from the fact that the proposed project cliff was a nesting site for peregrine falcons. Others criticized the process, expressing dismay that they were unaware of the via ferrata until after the park’s master plan was finalized.

This time, State Parks collaborated with a local group to host an informational meeting, and turnout was high. The crowd appeared engaged and open as people asked questions and brainstormed ways to update the visitor center to accommodate modern needs.
State Parks staff emphasized there are no current plans and the meeting was just the beginning. Ideas that were floated included relocating the building, erecting a star-gazing perch and incorporating more Indigenous history and interpretation.

Here at home, so far, things are mostly quiet. Farmers in western Wisconsin report no ICE raids on the dairies where 60% to 90% of workers are immigrants without legal status. There have been a few high-profile arrests and deportations in Milwaukee, Madison and Manitowoc, but nothing like the scenes of chaos in the streets of Chicago and Minneapolis, where masked federal agents are aiming guns at civilians, smashing out car windows and dragging parents from their children, hustling them off to detention centers to be fast-tracked out of the country without due process.
One of the most disturbing things about this campaign of terror is that it seems to be directed by the president’s whim. In a Thanksgiving post full of invective and schoolyard insults directed at Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, Trump denounced the Somali community he claimed was “completely taking over the great State of Minnesota.” One week later, CBS News confirmed that ICE operations were underway targeting Somali immigrants in the Twin Cities.
Since we can’t count on the federal government to stay inside the bounds of reason or the law, it is critical that local and state leaders stand up to the racist, unconstitutional and unAmerican assault on immigrants. 
It was good news when, on Wednesday, the Wisconsin Supreme Court accepted a case filed by the state chapter of the ACLU on behalf of the immigrant rights group Voces de la Frontera, contending that Wisconsin law enforcement agencies do not have the authority to make arrests or keep people in jail on detainers based solely on ICE’s administrative warrants.
Tim Muth, the ACLU of Wisconsin’s senior staff attorney, said hundreds of people throughout the state are being illegally held for days.
“It is extremely important for the Wisconsin Supreme Court to determine whether any law enforcement in Wisconsin has the legal authority to put or keep people in jail when they have not committed a crime and when no judge has issued an arrest warrant,” Wisconsin immigration attorney Grant Sovern wrote in an email to the Examiner. “Anyone in Wisconsin would want dangerous people to be kept from the public. But ICE is currently making no determinations about dangerousness or the likelihood to show up for a hearing if a summons is issued. A summons is a perfectly rational and legal way to address a civil legal question like someone’s immigration status. Jailing people before any independent adjudicator determines someone to be dangerous is against the Constitution and not the Wisconsin way.”
At a press conference Wednesday, Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces, told the story of a landscaper in Green Bay who was picked up for driving without a license (immigrants without legal status are barred by a 2007 state law from obtaining driver’s licenses). He was sent to county jail and then handed over to ICE. “He was a grandfather, very active in his church,” Neumann-Ortiz said, describing him as “someone who does not represent any kind of threat to society at all” and who, on the contrary, is a pillar of his community and beloved by his family. 
Voces helped fight the deportation in a case that is still working its way through the courts. “At least he’s out and together with his family,” Neumann-Ortiz said. “But that’s an example of how people can be impacted by this.” 
As it scrambles to meet arbitrary deportation quotas, ICE sends detainers even for people who have never been convicted of a crime and have only minor charges pending in Wisconsin courts. 
Voces has been fighting at the local level since the first Trump administration for local law enforcement to refuse to collaborate with ICE unless there is a judicial warrant for someone, meaning that person is being sought in connection with a serious crime. As a result of Voces’ efforts, that is now the standard in Milwaukee County. The state Supreme Court case is an effort to establish the same standard statewide.
Neumann-Ortiz said she’s grateful the Supreme Court justices recognized the urgency of the issue in agreeing to take the case on an expedited basis, “given the current level of abuse that we’re seeing happen, and which will only escalate.”
And, she added, “We certainly very much anticipate Milwaukee being one of the cities that will be targeted for militarized occupation with these aggressive sweeps.”
Whether or not Wisconsin communities can protect people from the kind of violence we’ve been seeing in other states depends on the courageous actions of state and local officials, advocates and informed community members. It begins with recognizing that the Trump administration’s actions are wrong and then standing up.
At the press conference, a reporter asked about ICE’s assertion that the agency doesn’t have room for everyone in its detention facilities and therefore needs space in county jails. Muth responded: “Detain fewer people.”
Neumann-Ortiz added some clarifying context. “They are profiling people, they are just grabbing people without any probable cause. So it’s a very racist program that is using violence against people and is trying to hijack, through bribery and through threats, local law enforcement to be part of this mass deportation machinery,” she said. 
“We’re seeing, at the local level, community come together,” she added, “to reject these efforts to undermine local law enforcement — which is supposed to play a public safety role — into just this arm of deportation driven by xenophobia and racism. And which is making a lot of money for the for-profit prison industry.”
This year, communities across the state have pushed back on 287g partnership agreements between local law enforcement and ICE. Palmyra, Ozaukee and Kenosha counties rejected ICE’s offers of money to transform their sheriffs into agents of federal immigration enforcement.
The Kenosha sheriff’s office made its decision not to participate after the ACLU and Voces had already named it in the Supreme Court lawsuit, along with Walworth, Brown, Sauk and Marathon counties. Palmyra also reversed a decision to accept a large payment from ICE to participate, responding to public outrage.
“Resistance is happening, it’s successful, it’s building community,” Neumann-Ortiz said. “But we do need state protections to uphold our rights.”

Steve Pearce, Trump’s nominee to run the BLM, has worked to privatize and undermine our public lands, writes Aaron Weiss.
The post This Trump nominee wants to liquidate public lands appeared first on WyoFile .","This commentary was originally published by Writers on the Range.


Opinion

Do Western senators really care about keeping public lands in public hands? Steve Pearce, President Donald Trump’s nominee to run the Bureau of Land Management, is a litmus test of their commitment.
Throughout his political career, Pearce has worked to privatize and undermine our public lands. As a New Mexico congressman, he co-sponsored several bills to dispose of national public lands. This alone ought to disqualify him from running the agency charged with stewarding 245 million acres for current and future generations.
In a 2012 letter to House leadership, Pearce argued that the federal government owns “vast” land holdings, “most of [which] we do not even need,” and called for a massive sell-off to pay down the national debt. Pearce’s vision for our public lands is not conservation or even balanced management — it’s liquidation.
Trump has been down this road before: During his first term, he nominated anti-public-lands zealot William Perry Pendley to run the BLM. Pendley never even received a hearing, and the White House dropped the nomination after his record was revealed. Pendley went on to write the public lands chapter of the now-notorious Project 2025 blueprint for a second Trump administration.
Pendley spent his career as a lawyer arguing that the federal government should not own public lands. Steve Pearce has gone even further. From inside Congress, Pearce spent 14 years undermining public lands, seeking to gut wildlife protections and sell off huge amounts of public land.
Pearce’s nomination comes as our public lands are being attacked from all sides. Over the last 10 months, Trump has elevated officials such as Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, both of whom view our public lands as nothing more than assets to monetize through drilling, mining and logging. 
These officials are currently working to execute Trump’s vision of selling out public assets for private profit. Pearce would accelerate this effort, liquidating lands to the highest bidder — including corporations and luxury developers.
Even by recent standards, Pearce’s public lands record is radical. It is also unpopular. This spring, Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee tried to include a public land sale provision in the sprawling budget bill, framing it as a housing solution. The measure would have mandated the sale of 2-3 million acres of BLM and Forest Service lands.
But Lee’s amendment triggered immediate backlash from hunters, outdoor recreation groups and Western lawmakers. Within days, he abandoned the effort. If the Senate rejected Lee’s market-rate sell-off as radical, it should be easy now to reject a nominee whose goal is to get rid of even more public land.
That brings us to the Senate Stewardship Caucus, co-chaired by a Republican, Tim Sheehy of Montana, and a Democrat, Martin Heinrich of New Mexico. It launched last month to “advance bipartisan efforts to conserve the nation’s lands and waters” with science-based policy. The caucus has been applauded by hunting, outdoor recreation and conservation organizations as a promising start for defending public access and wildlife.
Pearce’s nomination is the caucus’s first real test. If its members cannot draw a bright line at a nominee who has worked tirelessly to sell off public lands and weaken laws that protect them, then its vision of “stewardship” is nothing but empty branding.
The stakes are immense. BLM’s multiple-use mandate requires balancing energy, grazing, recreation and conservation under long-term land use plans grounded in science and public input. That mission collapses if the agency’s leader believes we must “reverse this trend of public ownership” of the very lands he is charged with managing.
Westerners understand what happens when responsible stewardship is abandoned. Rural communities lose the long-term economic engine that healthy public lands provide. Hunters, anglers and campers lose access they have relied on for generations.
Steve Pearce’s nomination is a referendum on whether Congress believes our shared lands still belong to all Americans. The Stewardship Caucus and every senator who claims to care about the West’s outdoor heritage should reject Pearce’s nomination. America’s public lands are a unique legacy we pass down to future generations, not a portfolio to liquidate.

Jim Pillen listens during a summit of the governors of South Dakota, Iowa and Nebraska with business leaders in the Sioux City area. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)LINCOLN — After state officials initially denied rumors of downsizing, Nebraska’s Department of Economic Development acknowledged that it has paid roughly 22 fewer full-time employees over the past two months.
Similar workforce reductions have also impacted various other state agencies, prompting new concerns from some frontline workers that Gov. Jim Pillen and his administration are focusing on staff cuts to balance Nebraska’s budget.
The Governor’s Office initially claimed, in response to a reporter’s questions, that DED had seen “0 layoffs/reductions in force” through September and October, when the Examiner first asked in early November.
The state changed its tune after payroll records obtained by the Examiner from the Department of Administrative Services in recent weeks indicated 112 full-time employees on DED’s payroll in September, then 101 in October and 93 in November.
Justin Pinkerman, a spokesperson for the Department of Economic Development clarified this week that DED was down to just over 90 filled full-time positions by the end of November.
Governor’s Office spokeswoman Laura Strimple amended her statement to say all of the reductions in full-time staff from September to November had been voluntary. And the department, via Pinkerman, now says the downsizing is part of a winding down of pandemic-era programs.

Last month, Pinkerman had said DED eliminated only a single position this summer, that of Deputy Director of Operations Joe Lauber.
The DED downsizing comes as other cuts have impacted different state agencies, including the Nebraska Department of Revenue. The state laid off 11 revenue agents in October, closed the department’s Scottsbluff office and shrank its Lincoln-based individual income tax collections office.
At a press conference this week for a union representing state employees, the Nebraska Association of Public Employees, Executive Director Justin Hubly said reducing revenue agents when the state is short of funds was a “bananas decision” considering that State Auditor Mike Foley recently reported that unpaid state taxes had grown 15% over the past year, rising above $310 million.

Additionally, Hubly said at least four employees were cut from the state Office of the Chief Information Officer. He said smaller cuts have impacted several other departments in recent months.
At DED, evidence suggests that the majority of the downsizing was focused on managerial and higher-up positions not covered by union protections. Hubly said NAPE logged about seven voluntary departures within DED between June and November. NAPE represents roughly 55-60 DED workers, he said.
Lauber, who served as DED’s deputy director of operations and its chief legal counsel, said in August he was told his position had been eliminated due to budget cuts, and he was escorted out of the building. He had worked at DED for 13 years.
“It came as quite a shock to me,” Lauber said of his dismissal.
Prior to his termination, Lauber said there were signs of budget cuts impacting DED, like hiring freezes and directives to stop travel. He said during a management meeting he attended, then-interim director Maureen Larsen shared that it was the governor’s goal to reduce the size of DED through attrition.
Agencies often do this by not filling positions people vacated through retirements and having or encouraging people to leave on their own. Lauber said the state implemented strategies such as Pillen’s return-to-work order and enforcing a strict 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. work schedule in hopes of getting people to consider whether they wanted to stay working for the department. Lauber said employees were not allowed to end their days earlier than 4:30 p.m.
Hubly said NAPE workers in other state agencies have also seen a pattern of the state cutting jobs this year to save cash.
Pillen has discussed his intent to cut Nebraska’s two-year budget by $500 million by the end of lawmakers’ 60-day legislative session in 2026. Lawmakers will enter the 2026 legislative session needing to fill a projected $471 million budget hole.
Hubly suggested the state implement retirement incentives as a way of tightening the budget, arguing that hiring younger workers would reduce staffing costs. Hubly said the governor rejected this proposal.
Pillen recently named Larsen the permanent DED director after she had served as interim director since July following former director K.C. Belitz’ resignation. Belitz did not return a request for comment.
Prior to her appointment, Larsen served as Pillen’s general counsel and deputy director of his Policy Research Office. Hubly said he’s heard some concerns from workers that Larsen was appointed as director as part of a “hatchet job,” a term often used for someone hired to cut staff, due to a lack of outreach she did with the rest of the department.
“We did hear a lot of concerns when she was kind of installed temporarily,” Hubly said. “She wasn’t out and about, she wasn’t introducing herself to people. So I think there was kind of this general consensus from people we talked to that was like, ‘She’s here to do a hatchet job and get rid of people.’”
Larsen did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Pinkerman, reaching out on her behalf, said DED “experienced dramatic growth following the coronavirus pandemic.”
Pinkerman shared data showing that between 2020 to 2023, the department’s full-time staff grew by about 10-15 people per year. It reached a peak of about 114 filled full-time positions on June 30 of this year, which has since dropped to around 90.
Larsen took over as interim DED director on July 21.
“As DED winds down pandemic-era economic recovery programs and identifies greater operational efficiencies, not all positions that come open are being filled,” Pinkerman said in an email.
Hubly called on the Nebraska Legislature to protect frontline workers when debating budget adjustments this spring, arguing that staff cuts should be the last place state officials look to fill the deficit.
Instead, he proposed searching for new revenue sources or surveying state workers for ways to improve efficiencies.
“It is not possible to continually cut positions and increase workloads on state employees and not affect the quality of the services the employees provide,” Hubly said.

Hayes joined the Idaho Conservation League as a program director almost 25 years ago and worked on numerous conservation and environmental initiatives before being named executive director in 2018, the Idaho Conservation League announced in a press release issued last week. 
As executive director, Hayes led the Idaho Conservation League, or ICL for short, through two new strategic plans, helped launch new wildlife and water programs, opened a new McCall field office and oversaw an increase in revenue and financial performance, the Idaho Conservation League announced.
Hayes succeeded Rick Johnson, who pushed for more than 20 years to win protection for the Boulder-White Clouds Wilderness, as executive director of the Idaho Conservation League.

Hayes has accepted a new position as the North Rockies conservation director for American Rivers, where he will focus on protecting and restoring wild rivers in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming, officials said. 
“Serving as executive director has been incredibly rewarding for me,” Hayes said in a written statement. “But it has also meant spending less time personally doing the conservation work that first drew me to this field. At 57, I’m not ready to retire — but I can see it on the horizon. As I’ve reflected on how I want to spend the final phase of my career, I’ve realized that I want to be back on the ground, as a staffer, doing work focused on the rivers and fish that have always inspired me.”
 What’s next for the Idaho Conservation League?

Following Hayes’ departure, Conservation Director Brad Smith will serve as interim executive director of the Idaho Conservation League, the organization announced. Idaho Conservation League officials will conduct a search for the next permanent executive director in the coming months, officials said.

“Justin has been an exceptional leader for ICL, and he will be deeply missed,” Smith said in a written statement. “We’re grateful for all he has accomplished and wish him the very best in his next chapter. Thanks to Justin’s dedication and vision, he leaves ICL in a strong and stable position for our next executive director.”
In 2023 Idaho Conservation League celebrated the 50th anniversary of its founding in 1973. Headquartered in Boise with offices in McCall, Sandpoint and Ketchum, the Idaho Conservation League employs 24 people and focuses on protecting clean air, clean water, land and wildlife.

Ryan Zinke campaigning in Bigfork, Montana leading up to the 2022 midterm election (Photo via Ryan Zinke for Congress Twitter).Those of us who came of age during the ’60s well remember the Vietnam War, its horrific toll of human life, its cost, the division it caused, and its long-term effects upon those who served and survived.  
We also remember the phony incidents and propaganda that threw our young men and women into combat in what became our nation’s longest war…which we lost.  
As noted in 2008 by the U.S. Naval Institute in reference to the Gulf of Tonkin incident: “But once-classified documents and tapes released in the past several years, combined with previously uncovered facts, make clear that high government officials distorted facts and deceived the American public about events that led to full U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War.”  
Combined with the propaganda that the “Domino Theory” would see all of Southeast Asia under communist rule if the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, also known as “North Vietnam,” overthrew the government of South Vietnam, the Dogs of War were unleashed.
We saw a similar concocted reason for the Iraq War in the assurance from President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney that “Weapons of Mass Destruction” – or WMDs – existed, just awaiting use against the United States.  It was a flat out lie — but again, with horrifying consequences of death, destruction, cost, and long-term mental and health effects on the nation’s men and women in the military — all to virtually no positive outcome. 
Comes now the next attempt to push our nation into yet another fabricated war — this time with Venezuela, which just coincidentally happens to have the largest proven reserves of oil on the planet at 303 billion barrels.  
This time around it’s Trump’s propaganda machine that declares drugs from Venezuela are a threat to our nation on such a scale that we now have dozens of warships, planes, and 15,000 troops in the region as the president threatens to invade that sovereign nation and has already drawn international condemnation for blowing up suspected drug boats and killing more than 80 individuals — without releasing a scintilla of verification to the public.
Which begs the question:  Given that three of the four members of Montana’s Congressional Delegation are veterans, and that two of them – Rep. Ryan Zinke and Sen. Tim Sheehy are former Navy SEALS – how can they stand silent while this deadly charade unfolds?  
This is particularly poignant since other members of Congress — both Republican and Democrat — are openly questioning the fabricated rationale for the war.  They’re also critical of a violation of the international Law of Armed Conflict by a “double tap” by SEAL Team 6 that killed two survivors left clinging to the wreckage of an alleged drug boat in the middle of the ocean. 
As reported by the Associated Press: “I can’t imagine anyone, no matter what the circumstance, believing it is appropriate to kill people who are clinging to a boat in the water,” said Michael Schmitt, a former Air Force lawyer and professor emeritus at the U.S. Naval War College. “That is clearly unlawful.”
Given our past involvement in disastrous foreign wars fueled by propaganda and false information one would expect the veterans in Montana’s Congressional delegation to speak up, demand answers and proof, and honor the Oath of Office they took as soldiers and elected officials to uphold the Constitution’s mandate that only Congress may declare war.  
Moreover, they have not even bothered to ask Montanans about sending their sons and daughters to yet another foolish foreign war — a “war” which they are aiding and abetting through their unconscionable silence.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Ryan-Zinke-in-Bigfork.jpg,,,2025-12-05 06:57:17.948748

(Photo by Dan Koeck/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota expects to receive roughly $17.8 million in federal disaster relief aid related to two summer storms, but a request for another estimated $3.6 million was denied by the federal government.
The state applied for the funding as part of requests for disaster relief for multiple storms that hit the state in June and August. 
North Dakota’s requests to the Federal Emergency Management Agency seeking assistance for damage caused by the storms was approved, said Darin Hanson, North Dakota’s Homeland Security and Emergency Management director.
But in addition to seeking public assistance to address the impacts of those disasters, states can also ask for hazard mitigation money to help communities better protect themselves from future harm.
Trump approves federal disaster relief for June storms in North Dakota

Hazard mitigation funding can be used to pay for things as wide ranging as flood control infrastructure, weather warning sirens and storm shelters, Hanson said.
“Some of these are relatively small projects, but they can make a big difference,” he said.
While North Dakota’s requests for this kind of assistance are often also approved, North Dakota’s hazard mitigation requests for the June and August storms were denied, said Hanson.
Hanson said he doesn’t know for sure why those applications were denied, since the federal government doesn’t share that information with states.
It appears to be a policy decision by the Trump administration, since other states are having their hazard mitigation requests rejected, too, he said.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong said in a Tuesday Emergency Commission meeting that the denials may stem from the executive branch’s belief that FEMA has been mismanaged by previous presidential administrations.
“It seems like the response to that is just to spend less money instead of figuring out how to run FEMA better,” Armstrong said.
He said hazard mitigation may have been targeted since FEMA’s primary role is emergency response, as opposed to emergency prevention.
“I think some in D.C. would say FEMA is expanding their scope beyond what they were originally intended to do,” said Armstrong, a Republican who served three terms in Congress.
North Dakota is appealing both denials, Hanson said. FEMA will review the requests and make a recommendation to the White House on whether to grant the appeals. The president makes the final call on what to do next, he said.
Trump denies disaster aid, tells states to do more

Hanson said that in the appeal letters, the state tried to make the case that it has a track record of using hazard mitigation funding effectively.
“About 97% of the funding we receive, we’re able to get out to communities to do these projects,” he said. “We do have a list of future projects ready to go should funding become available.”
The 19 counties eligible for relief under the June storm disaster declaration are Barnes, Burleigh, Cass, Eddy, Emmons, Foster, Grant, Griggs, Kidder, McLean, Morton, Oliver, Ransom, Sheridan, Sioux, Steele, Stutsman, Traill and Wells.
Counties eligible to receive relief for the August storms are Barnes, Grand Forks, Griggs, Kidder, Nelson, Steele and Stutsman counties.
Hanson said FEMA will reimburse 75% of the costs for projects addressing storm damage, with the state government covering 10% and local communities paying for the other 15%. Communities are reimbursed for the projects after they are complete.
So far, FEMA has committed funding for one public assistance project related to the June storms, Hanson said. He said another 16 project proposals for the June disaster are under review by FEMA, and the state expects to submit an additional 59 projects for review over the next few weeks.
Hanson noted relief funding for both disasters wasn’t impacted by the government shutdown. 
The June 20-21 storms were devastating to the state’s agricultural industry and included multiple tornadoes, one of which touched down in Enderlin and claimed three lives. The Aug. 7-8 storms also caused extensive damage, especially to electrical infrastructure, state officials said previously.
Earlier this year, FEMA canceled more than $20 million in infrastructure grants for North Dakota that were part of the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program.
In August, a federal judge temporarily blocked FEMA from reallocating money originally earmarked for the program after a group of states sued. North Dakota is not part of the lawsuit.
The $20 million included $7.8 million for a regional wastewater treatment project in Lincoln, $7.1 million for a water intake project in Washburn and $1.9 million for a wastewater lagoon project in Fessenden.

Bill Lee, photographed at the groundbreaking for a Rutherford County charter school in 2023, spurred the creation of a state board authorizing charter schools. (John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)That crumbling sound you hear is not the Tennessee Vols defense falling apart brick by brick. That was more of an implosion against Vandy last weekend at Neyland Stadium.
No, this is the gradual dismantling of the “wall of separation between church and state.”
The latest disassembly involves an opinion by Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti saying the state’s prohibition on religious-based charter schools “likely” violates the free exercise of religion in the First Amendment.
Skrmetti wrote the opinion at the request of Republican state Rep. Michelle Carringer of Knoxville who has a bill relating to charter schools. Carringer said Thursday she requested the opinion for “legal clarity” on the relationship between the Constitution and Tennessee charter laws but has no plans to bring legislation related to it.
The opinion, which is not binding, points out state law requires public charter schools “to operate as … nonsectarian [and] nonreligious.” Similarly, another state law prohibits bodies that “promote the agenda of any religious denomination or religiously affiliated entity” from sponsoring a charter school.
“Those restrictions exclude otherwise qualified religious entities from participating in a public benefit, and no compelling interest is apparent,” the opinion says. Thus, the state’s restrictions “likely violate the free exercise clause.”
Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti issued an opinion that a prohibition on religious-based charter schools “likely” violates the First Amendment.
This leap of faith is supported by three U.S. Supreme Court decisions after a case called Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board v. Drummond left the question unresolved, according to the opinion. The court was divided on that matter, and Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself.
The trio of rulings found that “excluding religious entities from a public benefit ‘solely because of their religious character’ penalizes (religious freedom) and triggers ‘the most exacting scrutiny,’” the opinion says.
In applying those decisions, the attorney general concluded Tennessee’s exclusion of religious charter school sponsors “likely” violates the free exercise clause in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
The relationship between charter schools and public school boards is sketchy at best. Metro Nashville’s school board has turned down several charter requests, mainly because of concerns that the charters wouldn’t serve all students, only to see its decisions reversed at the state level. 
Under Gov. Bill Lee, the legislature formed a charter school authorizing board that has the final say on the formation of charters, which are run by nonprofit entities using public dollars and, often, public buildings. In the last three years, the state put about $67 million into charter facilities.
This blurring of lines between government and religion is nothing new around these parts. Lee started the Governor’s Office of Faith-based Initiatives, and the legislature began pouring millions into it three years ago. The total is up to $4.5 million, with about three-fourths of that going to staff.
In addition, Tennessee is doling out $144 million for a private-school voucher program, essentially an entitlement program involving religious schools across the state.
Any time someone brings up the “wall of separation between church and state,” folks argue that those words aren’t in the Constitution. They’re right. It’s only a principle designed to keep dratted politicians from controlling religion.
The U.S. Supreme Court decided more than 75 years ago that the wall “must be kept high and impregnable.”
The question is whether Tennessee will use a stick of dynamite to blow it up or a sledgehammer to knock it down brick by brick. Either way, it seems to be falling.
Backing vouchers
Two East Tennessee families represented by EdChoice Legal Advocates want to defend the state’s private-school voucher program, filing a motion seeking to intervene in a case challenging its legality. The Beacon Center of Tennessee is representing the parents as well.
The state is defending itself against a lawsuit claiming the program is unconstitutional because it diverts money from public education.
The program provides $7,300 per child to attend private schools, $144 million for 20,000 children this year, and that number could rise in 2026.
EdChoice said in a release this week the families of Denise Fair of Jefferson City and Mike and Monica Sweeney of Knoxville depend on the program to put their children in learning environments that meet their families’ “moral values.” Otherwise, they would face “significant financial hurdles.”
“Behind every legal filing are real children whose futures hang in the balance. This lawsuit threatens to take choices away from families who have done everything right – families who simply want to place their children in the learning environments where they can thrive,” said Thomas Fisher of EdChoice Legal Advocates.
The Sweeneys’ three children are using the vouchers to pay for tuition at a Catholic school this year after homeschooling them because they didn’t like pandemic procedures at their school.
TN-Motion-to-Intervene
Fair and her husband, who are first responders, worked extra jobs to send two of their six children to a Christian school. The state funding “eased that burden,” according to the release, and allowed them to keep their two girls at Lakeway Christian Academy and cut back on part-time work.
“It has allowed me more time to dedicate to attending activities with the girls and freed up enough financial resources to allow the girls to attend some school field trips,” Denise Fair said in a release.
A court ruling against the program would put “a real financial burden” on the family and keep them from affording Lakeway Christian’s tuition, she said.
Thank you for the honesty.
The state’s own financial impact analysis showed 66% of those likely to receive the vouchers were attending private schools already (Gov. Lee prefers “scholarships” even though students don’t have to earn them).
This appears to be a point of contention, because the state Department of Education won’t disclose how many of the 20,000 students receiving the money really were enrolled in private schools already, probably because it’s closer to 90%.
The demand is there, according to the governor, so the program must be expanded. He has said repeatedly his main concern is that more “scholarships” aren’t available.
Maybe it’s time to shift that concern. In the words of some worry warts, have you ever seen an entitlement program shrink or disappear? 
Maybe it’s time for the state to dispense with the niceties and stop the public schools charade. Whether it’s called a voucher or a scholarship, just give everyone a few thousand bucks and let them fend for themselves. 
We need to toughen up anyway.
Hold up on executions
A group of nearly 20 Tennessee medical professionals is asking the governor to pause executions until a court can review the state’s new execution protocol, which depends on the drug pentobarbital.
The group sent a letter to Lee this week urging him to hold up on the next execution set for Dec. 11 to give the courts more time to handle a death row lawsuit over the protocol. A coalition of media also filed suit to gain more access to executions.
The medical professionals’ letter points out Lee stopped all executions in 2022 because of concerns about the protocol for lethal injections and ordered an independent investigation. The Department of Correction came up with a new lethal injection protocol last January that relies solely on pentobarbital, “and we have grave concerns about this unreviewed method,” their letter says.
The group of medical professionals isn’t taking a stance on capital punishment but says the use of pentobarbital “creates a serious risk of a prolonged, agonizing death. It also exposes Tennessee’s correctional officers to chaotic and psychologically harmful executions,” the letter says.
An Associated Press reporter who witnessed the execution of Byron Black in August said at one point the inmate moved his head around once or twice off a gurney, exhaled a couple of times and told his spiritual advisor, “Oh it hurts so bad.”
The 69-year-old Black, the first person executed since the new protocol took effect, was wheelchair-bound and suffering from dementia, brain damage, kidney failure and congestive heart failure, according to his attorneys. He was executed for the 1988 murder of his girlfriend and her two young daughters.
The Nashville Banner also reported it took about 10 minutes to put an IV in Black’s arm, causing a puddle of blood to form on his right side.
Asked in September whether his administration would investigate problems with Black’s execution, Lee said no.

Light speed
Less than 48 hours after capturing the 7th Congressional District seat in a special election, Republican Matt Van Epps was sworn into office in Washington, D.C., using his daughter’s pink Bible for the ceremony.
Van Epps, a former Tennessee commissioner of General Services and Army special operations helicopter pilot, said, “America’s strength comes from our enduring belief that freedom is worth fighting for and from our commitment to protect and empower the hard-working families who make the American dream possible,” according to an Associated Press report. He also promised to help enact President Donald Trump’s “America First” agenda after defeating Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn by 9 percentage points. The margin of victory dipped just a tad from former U.S. Rep. Mark Green’s typical 20-plus-point wins.
Van Epps’ victory was critical in helping Republicans maintain a majority in the U.S. House as it copes with critical issues such as the Epstein files and an investigation into the bombing of an alleged drug smuggling boat off the coast of Venezuela. Hitting the vessel twice would have been illegal.
It’s amazing how fast the federal government can work when control is on the line.

Trump administration puts a hold on immigration applications from 19 nations

The Idaho Office for Refugees, which administers Idaho’s refugee resettlement program, has not received any official communication about these proposed steps or what the process would look like. 
Idaho welcomed more than 2,670 people with refugee status during the 2021-2025 timeframe under review. They are all families and individuals seeking freedom from life-threatening persecution. They have become an essential part of our state, contributing as leaders, students, neighbors, friends, entrepreneurs, and hard workers who make a positive impact.
Being subjected to scrutiny again – after being thoroughly vetted and assured permanent welcome – creates anxiety for the very people who found hope and safety in the U.S. and sends the false message that they don’t fully belong here. As someone working closely with a wide range of Idahoans from refugee backgrounds, I can say they do belong, they are deeply appreciated, and our community would not be the same without them.
 Background and impact of refugee policy in the U.S.

The Refugee Act, passed by Congress in 1980, provides for the permanent resettlement of approved refugees who have been displaced from their home country and have no safe option of returning. Before resettling, refugees undergo rigorous medical and background screenings by multiple federal agencies. Most refugees wait many years in limbo for an opportunity to resettle in a permanent home like the U.S. and become citizens. Any one of us could be in their shoes depending on the time and place we were born.
Refugee resettlement provides a secure pathway for families and individuals uprooted by persecution, bringing more stability to people’s lives, to regions experiencing turmoil, and to our own national security and economy. Resettlement brings hope of being able to belong to a country again without fear of future displacement. To put refugees’ legal status back on the table goes against what the program was designed to do.
They had tickets. A flight number. An arrival time. Then Trump’s executive order changed everything.

Other changes this year have created barriers to resettlement. An executive order in January paused the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. There’s an ongoing lawsuit seeking to honor the approval given to refugees whose flights were abruptly canceled. In October, the administration set a historically low refugee arrivals ceiling of 7,500 for the current year, prioritizing just one group of people, Afrikaners. People who were approved to resettle before the January suspension are not included.
For 50 years, Idaho’s refugee program has advanced values we all share — freedom, safety, opportunity, and lending a hand when we can help. We are grateful for the many ways newcomers have made our schools, workplaces, and community gathering spaces stronger.

,Mississippi Today,2025-12-05 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Dozens locked in Hinds County’s jails without an indictment — some for over a year,"Daja E. Henry, The Marshall Project",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/05/dozens-locked-in-hinds-countys-jails-without-an-indictment/,At least 60 people arrested in Hinds County have been jailed in its detention facilities for over three months — including at least five for more than a year.,"At least 60 people arrested in Hinds County have been jailed in its detention facilities for over three months — including at least five for more than a year — with no indictment filed against them and no pathway to a trial in sight.
One man has been in jail for 18 months on drug charges without an indictment and has no attorney to move his case along, according to court records reviewed by The Marshall Project – Jackson.
Mississippi is one of the few states where people can be jailed indefinitely without indictment, a critical step to send a case to a judge or a jury. This gap has deepened the overcrowding, violence and dysfunction that put Raymond Detention Center — the county’s primary jail — under federal control in the first place.
The lengthy detentions in Hinds County have been caused by multiple issues, including an increased Capitol Police force in Jackson, an overwhelmed state crime lab, and a shortage of prosecutors and public defenders to handle the backlog of cases. 
The federal receiver operating the Raymond Detention Center has warned the county district attorney that the jail cannot be fixed while people remain locked up without a way to get to court.
In a letter obtained by The Marshall Project – Jackson, federal receiver Wendell M. France wrote to Hinds County District Attorney Jody Owens telling him that holding so many people is costly for county taxpayers and is impeding France’s ability to fix the jail’s problems. France, who took over the jail on Oct. 1, asked Owens to address the delays in prosecution immediately. 
“Overcrowding affects housing, safety, and services,” France wrote. “Staff and funding that should be directed toward facility improvements are instead consumed managing extended pretrial stays.” 
As part of the court’s receivership agreement, France is barred from making public statements about his work. 
More than half of the unindicted detainees were arrested on violent crime charges, including rape, murder and aggravated assault. Others were charged with nonviolent offenses, including burglary and drug possession. 
One detainee, LaDarius Moore, was arrested more than six months ago and is being held on a $7.5 million bond, one of the highest in the county’s history. As of Dec. 1, he has not been indicted. 
In a handwritten note to Judge Debra Gibbs, Moore asked for his day in court. “I have lost my job after being in here for 6 months. My kids mother can’t afford to feed them without SNAP benefits on her own and they really need me to take care of them. I respectfully ask you to consider my family responsibilities.”
Moore faces charges of aggravated assault, being a felon in possession of a firearm, and 12 counts of armed robbery. His court file shows no response from the judge and no upcoming court date.
‘You’re risking life and limb in the Hinds County jail.’
Hinds County’s indictment delays reflect a statewide problem, said André de Gruy, the state public defender. The Marshall Project – Jackson previously reported on a case in Pike County, in which a man was incarcerated for nearly 18 months before being indicted.
A federal judge appointed France in 2022 after the county repeatedly failed to comply with a Justice Department agreement to address rampant violence, understaffing, a steady flow of drugs into the facility, and poor record-keeping that kept detainees there long past their court-ordered release dates. Appeals delayed France’s start until this October.
More than a decade after the Justice Department first brought its case, reports of inhumane conditions still abound. Detainees at Raymond reported living in darkness, being extorted to use the restrooms and sleeping on filthy floors. Earlier this year, a man was killed inside the jail and two others died of drug overdoses. In October, the Hinds County Board of Supervisors approved an emergency declaration because of overcrowding at the facility, which held about 450 people at the beginning of that month.
“You’re risking life and limb in the Hinds County jail. That is a serious proposition of someone who hasn’t been indicted of any crime, much less convicted,” said Hernandez D. Stroud, a senior fellow in the Justice Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, who has studied jail receivership. “That’s scary.”
Typically, after a person is arrested, law enforcement turns the case over to the district attorney, who brings the case before a grand jury. If the grand jury returns an indictment — a formal criminal charge — the case moves to a judge and potentially a jury. 
Already burdened with a backlog of cases, the county’s legal system has been inundated with arrests since the Capitol Police began expanding in July 2021, in response to what Gov. Tate Reeves called a “never-ending cycle of violent crime.” The Capitol Police force previously guarded state property, but its jurisdiction, the Capitol Complex Improvement District, has since grown to more than 20 square miles in the city. The force has also grown from 81 officers in 2021 to more than 150. By the end of 2023, the number of indictments had risen 33% from the previous year.
A receiver is “not going to be able to address those problems until you reduce the population to be more in line with the staffing levels you have, and the bed capacity,” de Gruy said. “Trying to do that in an environment where you’re now seeing a lot more people being arrested, it just makes his job that much harder.” 
Lengthy waits for case files from arresting agencies and reports from an overwhelmed crime lab also drag cases out, said de Gruy. 
In response to France’s letter, Owens wrote that he had not received case files from law enforcement on more than 100 of the approximately 240 unindicted detainees, including those held for more than three months. He also cited delays in receiving final autopsy reports, a need for mental health evaluations of defendants and “the sheer volume of crime plaguing our community.” 
Owens’ office indicted 1,264 cases last year and resolved 1,135, leaving 129 open. The previous year, grand juries returned indictments in 1,696 cases and his office resolved just 989. Cases are resolved by guilty pleas, trials, dismissals or pretrial diversion programs. 
Owens also told France that the jail roster contained misspelled names and outdated information. In some cases, people listed as unindicted had already been indicted or released. 
“This just has layers of institutional incompetence and dysfunction, such that even when you have a receiver, it is hard to disentangle everything to get to the constitutional violations,” Stroud said. “It’s stunning.”
Hinds County Sheriff Tyree Jones, who used to run the jail and also serves as the Jackson Police chief, said he was not aware of any delays in forwarding cases to prosecutors. 
“When it comes to the jail, I think everybody has their own individual opinion, and everybody has their own professional responsibility,” Jones said. “There’s probably a little bit more room for correction on all levels.”
Owens and Hinds County Public Defender Gail Wright Lowery have asked the county Board of Supervisors for $700,000 in emergency funds, split between their offices, to fund six to eight staff members to focus on reducing the jail population. 
“The only way the system works is that … as many people are getting out of our system as fast as we’re bringing them in,” Owens said at the Nov. 3 board meeting. “Our current volume doesn’t allow us to do that.” 
Wright Lowery said five attorneys have recently left her office. She requested the funds to boost her staff’s salaries and to hire experienced attorneys to work part-time to help move cases through the system. 
“Every time I lose an attorney, you have an average of over 100 people in detention who lose their attorney,” she said. Her office is funded for 14 lawyers. 
Hinds County Board of Supervisors President Robert Graham said the board would consider the request for the $700,000.

(National Archives)L.A. and Gertrude Tapp knew their son was serving aboard the USS Arizona when they heard the big battleship had sunk in the surprise Japanese air attack that plunged the United States into World War II.
Gunner’s Mate Third Class Lambert Ray Tapp was 23 and aboard the USS Arizona on Dec. 7, 1941.
But for two agonizing weeks, the owners of Shakertown Fruit Farm in Mercer County didn’t know if 23-year-old Gunner’s Mate Third Class Lambert Ray Tapp was dead or alive.
The age of cell phones and instant communication was decades away on Dec. 7, 1941, the date President Franklin D. Roosevelt predicted “will live in infamy.” Thus, the Tapps—and other stateside families with loved ones in uniform in Hawaii—suffered agonizing uncertainty for days.
For the Tapps, the terrible wait turned into weeks.
All of the families hoped or prayed for the best, while fearing the worst. Some tried to convince themselves that “no news is good news.”
Relatives, especially mothers, fathers and spouses, dreaded the knock at the door that would announce the arrival of a Western Union messenger bringing the worst possible news.
“With limits on how many words a telegram could accommodate, the military adopted distinct standardized phrasing to convey the news; hence, the common chilling phrase ‘I regret to inform you…,’” wrote Megan Harris in a Library of Congress blog.
Between Dec. 21, 1941, and Jan. 9, 1942, a Western Union courier called at L.A. and Gertrude Tapp’s home three times.
The first Navy wire said Lambert Ray was reported missing. Some families took “missing” to mean “dead.” Others believed, or wanted to believe, that “missing” meant their relative might somehow be alive.
The second cable instantly turned the Tapps’ anxiety into joyous relief. He was alive. But their jubilation was short lived; the third telegram again said he was missing.
Stories in the Harrodsburg Herald and Lexington Herald-Leader are silent about the emotional roller coaster the Tapps must have endured. In the chaos and confusion following the Pearl Harbor attack, military authorities went with the best information they had.  As a result, some telegrams erroneously listed servicemembers as missing or killed in action, necessitating another cable saying the first one was a mistake.
But the triple telegrams sent to the Tapps seem rare, if not unique.
Lambert Ray Tapp was born in Webster County on Oct. 25, 1918, the same day his mother, Helen Callis Tapp, 19, died, evidently in childbirth. L.A. married Gertrude Dossett Tapp in 1919. They reared Lambert Ray and two children of their own.
Lambert Ray joined the Navy in Louisville on March 6, 1940, and ended up on the battleship Arizona, one of the largest and most powerful warships afloat.
When the air raid began, the Arizona was part of “Battleship Row,” a procession of seven capital ships moored alongside Ford Island in the middle of Pearl Harbor.
The attack sprang from a half-dozen aircraft carriers and included 350 fighters, torpedo-bombers, dive-bombers and horizontal bombers. While some Japanese planes also struck Army Air Force and Marine air bases on Oahu, the Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor was the main target.
The enemy appeared over Pearl Harbor at 7:55 a.m. Dec. 7 was a Sunday, and most of the sailors had the day off, “liberty” in Navy lingo.
About 8:10 a.m., a 1,763-pound naval shell converted into a bomb crashed through the Arizona’s forward deck, penetrated deep into the ship and ignited powder magazines and gasoline used to fuel the battleship’s scout planes.
The blast produced a huge fireball, heaved the 32,600-ton battlewagon’s bow nearly 50 feet into the air and broke the ship virtually in half, according to Craig Nelson’s book “Pearl Harbor: From Infamy to Greatness.” The bomb killed 1,177 sailors and marines. All told, the attack claimed the lives of 2,340 sailors, marines, soldiers and airmen and 49 civilians. The enemy sank seven ships and left several more damaged.
The initial telegram said Lambert Ray was “missing following action in the performance of his duty and in the service of his country.” A Jan. 6 wire provided the Tapps “a very happy new year,” according to the Harrodsburg Herald. Lambert Ray, the Navy assured his parents, was “now reported to be a survivor” and “will doubtless communicate with you at an early date informing you of his welfare and whereabouts.”
The Navy “deeply regretted ” any “anxiety caused by the previous message.”
Three more days passed with no word from their son. On Jan. 9, the third telegram destroyed L.A. and Gertrude Tapp’s dreams of a happy reunion with Lambert Ray.
The cable said Murray Leland Tapp, also a sailor on the Arizona but evidently not related to Lambert Ray, had survived, but L.A. and Gertrude’s son was “now reported missing upon the latest casualty lists.” The Navy “fully appreciated” the family’s “great anxiety” and promised: “Any report as to the fate of your son will be communicated to you promptly when received.”
Lambert Ray Tapp’s remains were never found. But his name is enshrined in stone in the Courts of the Missing, also known as the Gardens of the Missing, which are part of The National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu.
L.A. and Gertrude Tapp had grieved over the loss of a child 10 years before Lambert Ray’s life ended at Pearl Harbor. Their daughter, Ann Marie, died as a toddler in 1931.
Their son, John Bethel Tapp, grew up to follow his half-brother into the Navy where he earned the gold wings of a naval aviator and rose to the rank of lieutenant commander. His name is also carved in stone in the Honolulu cemetery.
On March 23, 1966, during the Vietnam War, the 32-year-old carrier-based pilot’s attack jet crashed in the South China sea. Like Lambert Ray’s, his body was not recovered.
A simple stone slab memorializes the siblings on the family plot at Shady Grove Cemetery in the Poole community in Webster County. “LOST AT SEA” is their common epitaph.
While L.A. died five years before Commander Tapp lost his life, Gertrude, who outlived a second husband, survived to age 93 in 1998. She and Ann Marie also are buried on the family plot in Shady Grove.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Arizonajpeg-1024x805.jpg,,,2025-12-05 05:57:05.869857

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)George Mason University officials said Thursday that no settlement agreement has been proposed with the federal government as it navigates four civil rights investigations, which began in July and are another issue that have shaped Virginia’s tumultuous higher education landscape this year.
Scrutiny of the institution and whether it would settle intensified after the University of Virginia signed an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice to suspend multiple civil rights investigations. 
The George Mason investigations focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives at the school, its employment practices and treatment of students, as well as a separate probe into alleged antisemitism on campus. 
GMU President Gregory Washington said at Thursday’s Board of Visitors executive committee meeting that negotiations are still underway, but did not provide any timeline for a resolution. He also reiterated the institution’s plan to address the investigations head on.
“Wrong guy to throw these kinds of things at,” said Washington. “I’m not the guy that runs away from the fire. I’m the actual guy that runs into it.”
GMU Rector Charles Stimson, who faced criticism for holding a second executive committee meeting with only six voting members on the board, echoed Washington’s remarks and thanked him for his leadership during the ongoing process.
“I know these are tough times,” Stimson said. “You kept your chin up, and Mason is going to thrive when we come out the backside of this. We’re going to do the best we can for Mason because that’s our number one priority.”
Meanwhile, outside of the meeting, a group of faculty members protested against the board, accusing it of meeting improperly because it lacked the required members to form a quorum. Some also claimed that the institution has a draft settlement agreement in place. 
John Hollis, a spokesman for George Mason, told the Mercury that no draft settlement agreement exists.
“We must continue to send a very strong message to (President Washington) that there can be no settlement that compromises our academic freedom and our institutional autonomy,” said George Mason University-American Association of University President Bethany Letiecq.

Tim Gibson, president of the Virginia Conference of the American Association of University, also criticized the board for policies he said undermine academic freedom, including the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism and President Donald Trump administration’s diversity, equity, and inclusion redefinitions.
“The settlement agreement would force George Mason University to accept the Trump administration’s definitions of diversity, equity, inclusion programs,” Gibson said. “These programs would be redefined, not as what they are, which is a commitment to make George Mason University a welcoming environment for people from all walks of life, instead, these programs would be redefined as de facto discrimination against who? Against white people.”
Both educators said students, staff and university leaders should resist these policies and called for solidarity across institutions.
Earlier this week, UVA Interim President Paul Mahoney defended the university’s decision to enter into agreement with the DOPJ during a hearing with state senators.
UVA interim president to senators: Agreement with DOJ to pause probes was ‘best option available’

UVA will not have to invest any money to complete the agreement, like Cornell University will, nor repay any money to the federal government, which Northwestern University must do.
Mahoney called the decision “the best option available,” because it suspends costly and disruptive investigations and preserves institutional autonomy and academic freedom. Democratic lawmakers say the agreement would open the school up to potential conflict with existing law,and infringed on state sovereignty.
Both schools are also awaiting a court decision on the future of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s appointments to their respective governing boards. The Virginia Military Institute’s board is also named in that legal challenge.
 Protest in Charlottesville

On Friday, professors and workers at the University of Virginia will hold a rally in Charlottesville protesting UVA’s Board of Visitors, which is facing claims it lacks the necessary representatives who are Virginia residents and alumni. 
UVA also recently launched a search for a new president to lead the institution.
Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger and Youngkin diverged on whether the university should continue its search, with Spanberger asking the board to halt the process until she takes office and Youngkin accusing her of inappropriately attempting to intervene in the process. 
Friday’s protest organizers will also weigh in on the issue.
“It is disturbing if not surprising that this illegitimate UVA Board of Visitors seeks to further its power grab by rushing to appoint a new University President who will be loyal the anti-democratic agenda of Trump, Youngkin, and allied monied interests,” said Harry Szabo, president of the United Campus Workers of Virginia, a labor union of higher education workers in Virginia and one of the protest’s organizers. 
Szabo said it’s the labor union’s “democratic duty” to oppose the board and to support a “university that serves the public good and promotes scholarship independent of the needs of billionaires or the ideologies of the powerful.”
“In other words,” Szabo added, “we need to defend the idea of a university of, by, and for the people.”

Gov.-elect Ghazala Hashmi unveils plan to reduce utility bill costs. (Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)Ahead of the 2026 General Assembly legislative session, Lieutenant Gov.-elect Ghazala Hashmi on Thursday joined environmental advocates from the National Resource Defense Council and Evergreen Collaborative in Richmond to share policy ideas they believe will put money back in consumers’ pockets.
“Policies must shift so that the cost is not on the everyday rate payers,” Hashmi said.
Following rate hikes for Dominion and Appalachian Power Company, many consumers are looking for ways to ease the pressure. Research by Synapse Energy Economics found that requiring data centers to pay for energy production could be a way to reduce the amount put onto residential customers.
The groups said that tech companies should invest in renewable energy projects either near their data centers or allow them to purchase the power needed to fuel their power-hungry facilities. It would take legislative action to make those requirements, which would then have to be managed through the State Corporation Commission.
“Requiring these data centers to bring their own energy to the table helps insulate the market from the price shock that occurs when demand is so high,” said Charles Harper, senior power sector lead for Evergreen Collaborative.
The research also pushes for PJM, the regional grid operator, to add renewable energy projects onto the grid more quickly in order to help relieve power strains. While the state does not have the authority to force PJM to amp up connections, states have tried to get more representation in their decisions and called on the grid operator to speed up connections.
One challenge the commonwealth faces with trying to build up its energy profile is getting local permits to build mainly solar projects. Individual counties are left the authority to allow or deny energy projects to be built within their borders. Solar projects can often be controversial at local boards of supervisors meetings; the state is working to increase education about these projects to cut down on the spread of misinformation. 
The groups said there should be reforms to reduce the amount of widespread denials of these projects, however, local perspectives must be considered when determining where energy projects should be sited.
“We see these sort of more holistic statewide interests can sometimes trump local interests, but I think there is a balance to be struck, that there is a way to take into account local considerations and also harmonizing statewide interests,” said Walton Shepard, NRDC’s Virginia director.
Other proposed regulation changes laid out in the plan presented by Hashmi and the two groups call for adopting electric vehicle charging infrastructure, reforming utility business models that determine how much of a profit they make, and expanding energy efficiency programs to cut down on power waste.
Legislation has yet to be filed pertaining to the majority of the presented plan but there are bills to expand solar power and efficiency programs already on the docket for lawmakers to review. The legislative session begins on Jan. 14.

(Photo by Getty Images)An eviction diversion program Virginia piloted before making permanent this year is likely to be further revised in next year’s legislative session, lawmakers said at a Virginia Housing Commission meeting Thursday. 
The program — which was first tested in Richmond, Danville, Hampton and Petersburg — allows delinquent renters and landlords to negotiate before people are removed from their homes. It means that tenants who fell behind on rent may qualify for the diversion program, but certain criteria have still posed a barrier to the people who could benefit from it.
For instance, eligible people can’t have fallen behind on rent more than twice in the past six months or more than three times in the past year, can’t have previously utilized the eviction diversion program within the past year, and must be able to pay 25% of what they owe as they enter the program. They also can’t have used a right-of-redemption, when tenants pay their owed rent before an eviction court date to avoid the proceeding. 
But people who face a struggle to pay rent to the point that they need an eviction diversion program are likely to have been late on rent a few times in the months leading up to seeking the program, Housing Opportunities Made Equal policy director Laura Dobbs said.
“People have been trying to do the right thing, to catch up, and they haven’t been able to, so now they have this one last ditch program,” she said.  
Data presented to the Housing Commission on Thursday showed mixed success with the cities that have stood up eviction diversion programs as causes for evictions are often nuanced.
Richmond saw a dip in 2023 from pre-pandemic levels, but evictions rose again in 2024. Hampton saw a consistent drop while Danville was fairly level and Petersburg saw relatively static numbers before a small decrease last year. The commission reviewed pre-pandemic years along with 2023 onward; the period of 2020 through 2022 could be an outlier considering COVID-19-era protections. 
Rent in Virginia has risen by about 1% over the past year and Virginia is ranked the 12th most expensive state to rent in, according to data from Apartments.com — a leading housing search tool. 
Between inflation, rising rent and often stagnant wages, the consensus is that meeting the criteria may only become harder for people, Virginia Poverty Law Center policy director Chrstine Marra said. 
“We’re going to see fewer people take advantage (of the program),” she told members of the  commission Thursday. 
It’s why Del. Adele McClure, D-Arlington, said she plans to adjust the law in 2026. Del. David Bulova, D-Fairfax, and Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, emphasized that adjustments could mean a more successful program and how more people need it.
McClure, who is also a member of the commission, spearheaded making the program statewide and permanent in this year’s legislative session. 
In an interview after the meeting, she said that she wants to make the program “more expansive and more inclusive.” 
McClure recalled experiencing evictions herself when she was growing up, which gave her personal familiarity with how disruptive it can be. Those experiences have shaped her passion for housing policy since she became a state lawmaker. 
Addressing housing affordability and stability was a pillar of winning campaigns this year, from Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger’s race to many of Virginia’s House of Delegates candidates’ contests, setting the stage for it to become a prominent policy focus in the 2026 legislative session.
Dobbs, of HOME, noted that policies that perhaps needed more workshopping or which did pass the legislature in the past before being vetoed by outgoing Gov.Glenn Youngkin could fare better next year. 
Examples include a proposal that would extend Virginia’s five-day grace period to 14 days if someone is behind on rent and a proposal to prohibit landlords from denying housing to applicants that have an eviction proceeding on their record even if they won the legal battle. 
With holidays and the 2026 legislative session approaching, McClure said lawmakers will be fine-tuning their proposals and preparing to deliberate them. Housing, she said, is intrinsic to so many other things. 
“Housing is the foundation for access to child care, for access to education, to health care, to anything that is an essential need,” she said.

The state Court of Judicial Discipline, which hears and decides ethical misconduct charges against Pennsylvania judges, lifted an order suspending Judge Steven Stambaugh on Thursday. 
He was suspended without pay in October 2024 after a federal grand jury returned a 31-count indictment against him alleging wire fraud, mail fraud, witness tampering and related offenses.
Stambaugh entered a pretrial diversion agreement with federal prosecutors last month, which allows him to avoid a trial or a guilty plea, according to court records. Under the agreement, he will serve a period of supervised release, which is similar to probation.

U.S. District Judge Malachy E. Mannion dismissed the indictment Wednesday at the request of federal prosecutors. It was dismissed with prejudice, meaning that prosecutors cannot refile the charges. 
It’s unclear from court records why the U.S. Attorney’s Office agreed to the dismissal. Stambaugh’s lawyers argued last summer that the indictment should be dismissed because prosecutors withheld evidence that raised serious questions about the credibility of a key witness. Mannion denied that request, the York Daily Record reported.
The indictment accused Stambaugh of using fraudulent unemployment claims to pay employees of his York personal injury law firm, Stambaugh Law. According to the indictment, Stambaugh allegedly filed and instructed his employees to file unemployment claims to collect unemployment compensation payments even though they were still employed. 
The claims, during the spring of 2020, included $600-a-week Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation payments in addition to the weekly benefit the state pays those who are unemployed and unable to find work.
Stambaugh was also accused of pressuring an employee to lie in testimony before the grand jury and seeking a meeting with the witness to ensure they were “on the same page.”

(Photo by The Good Brigade/Getty Images)Starting Jan. 1, New Hampshire’s Medicaid program will stop covering GLP-1 drugs — Wegovy, Zepbound, and others — for weight loss, the Department of Health and Human Services told providers in October.
“We looked at the way that the state was supporting coverage for GLP-1 medicines and found that this was a fairly significant cost driver,” Gov. Kelly Ayotte told reporters on Wednesday. “And so we looked at the medically necessary reasons for it in terms of those who had pre-existing conditions and made the decision working with Health and Human Services to come up with a modified policy that will still allow medications in those circumstances, but then really make sure it is cost sustainable going forward.”
The Alliance for Women’s Health and Prevention wrote a letter to Ayotte Tuesday urging her to reconsider the decision. The organization noted that approximately 30% of women in New Hampshire — and a disproportionately large number of women of color — experience obesity and that obesity is associated with over 200 health complications, citing the American Medical Association and KFF.
Ayotte said Wednesday she would not reconsider the decision.
There are roughly 186,000 enrolled in Medicaid in New Hampshire, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. About 54% of them are women.
“When we’re talking about 180,000 enrollees, children and adults, that’s over 90,000 women who are Medicaid beneficiaries who may be living with obesity and could take advantage of receiving the obesity management medications basically to stem those comorbidities that are associated with living with obesity,” Millicent Gorham, CEO of the Alliance for Women’s Health and Prevention, said in a phone interview with the Bulletin Thursday. “We’re talking about diabetes and high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease and cancer. So if we can stem those diseases, then hopefully we can have more healthier people living in New Hampshire.”
Gorham said the change may provide short-term cost savings but will be more expensive in the long run.
“People are going to be living longer with obesity, which is going to lend to any number of the other 200 comorbidities that are aligned with living with obesity,” she said. “And clearly, when you’re talking about things like diabetes and cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure and cancer and fertility issues that are specific to women, they’re going to end up with higher costs specifically related to those diseases and also specifically related to higher hospitalization costs.”
Gorham pointed to the stigma surrounding obesity and weight loss drugs.
“People really may not understand that people living with obesity is not just about an alternative lifestyle,” she said. “It really is a chronic disease. That’s the first thing that they need to understand: It is a chronic disease, no different than high blood pressure, no different than diabetes, and we need to treat it like that. No other disease has to take on the kind of scrutiny that obesity takes on.”
The Alliance for Women’s Health and Prevention has launched a nationwide effort with a coalition of other health advocacy groups called Everybody Covered to push policymakers to improve coverage of GLP-1 drugs and other obesity treatments.
As of October, 16 states cover GLP-1 drugs, according to KFF. In addition to New Hampshire, California and South Carolina plan to end coverage of the drugs in January. North Carolina ended coverage last month while Michigan plans to limit coverage to people who are “morbidly obese.” The states say they can’t afford the drugs.
The Alliance for Women’s Health and Prevention has been lobbying several states to maintain coverage of the drugs. Gorham said New Hampshire’s response has been “pretty much kinda the same” as other states. 
GLP-1 drugs have been shown to be effective for weight loss, though they come with a number of side effects for some patients, including nausea, vomiting, headaches, diarrhea, and constipation, according to Harvard Medical School and the Cleveland Clinic. While some experts and researchers have concerns about the drugs’ long-term impact and safety, many argue the benefits outweigh the known risks.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/glp1drugs-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-05 05:57:05.869857

More than 10,000 Ohioans could return to homelessness due to a federal funding policy change for local homeless assistance programs, advocates warn. 
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development issued a new Notice of Funding Opportunity for the Continuum of Care program on Nov. 13 that would limit funding for programs for certain permanent housing programs to 30% of a community’s total Continuum of Care grant, instead of the current 87%. 
HUD’s Continuum of Care Program is the largest federal grant funding source for homelessness services and housing. 
It helps fund permanent supportive housing, repaid rehousing, and transitional housing, among other things.

“What’s the most critical part of this shift is that there are 10,000 people across the state of just Ohio that will potentially lose their housing because the supports will not be there any longer for them to remain in the place that they’ve called home,” said Amy Riegel, executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness and Housing in Ohio. 
Nationally, 170,000 people are at risk of going back to homelessness because of this policy change. 
“That is a lot of individuals at one time that none of our systems can absorb to be able to support them and the needs that they would then have,” Riegel said. 
The application for funds has to be submitted to HUD by Jan. 14, 2026, and funds are likely to be announced in May 2026, Riegel said. 
“On January 1, programs will start to be affected by these changes, and by May 1, almost every program receiving funding through the Continuum of Care process will be affected by the delays in funding and also then the shifts in the priorities of the program,” Riegel said. 
HUD announced $178 million in Continuum of Care funding for Ohio back in January and this federal policy change could take $80 million away from Ohio programs that house people experiencing homelessness. 
Ohio would be one of the most impacted states since it relies on federal funds for a majority of its permanent housing beds for people experiencing homelessness, according to the National Alliance to End Homelessness.  
“We were able to build great programs that are very effective and work well for people, but in this case we will be at greater risk than other states because of that,” Riegel said. 
“Because we’re doing well and because we meet the objectives of the program, we’ll actually lose out in this process.”
Louisiana was the only state that has more permanent housing beds funded by the Continuum of Care program with 75%. 
Twenty states sued the Trump administration over these cuts to federal funding for local homeless assistance programs, but Ohio was not one of them. 
Over the summer, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to get people experiencing homelessness off the streets by committing them to mental health institutions or drug treatment centers without their consent.
But Riegel said this HUD announcement runs counter to Trump’s executive order. 
“There is a mismatch in what the administration is saying and then the actual policy that they put forward that’s very confusing and makes it very difficult for communities to understand how to actually respond to the needs that they have at home,” she said.
The executive order goes against Housing First, a homeless assistance approach that was first adopted federally during the George W. Bush Administration, which prioritizes housing without any prerequisites, such as sobriety or participation in treatment. 
“Getting people access directly from streets into housing is what solves the housing crisis,” said Christopher Knestrick, executive director for the Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless. 
“If we think about homelessness, the solution to homelessness is housing. We need to continue to give people access to housing and then provide wraparound services to them.”
Winter is a volatile time for those experiencing unsheltered homelessness, Riegel said. 
“These conditions are extreme, and it is very difficult for even a person who is healthy and has proper clothing and all of those items to spend any length of time outdoors,” she said. 
“It is also a time where people may seek shelter that is unstable or unfit for human habitability, and that also creates dangers for those individuals.”
Homelessness in the U.S. increased 18% last year with 771,480 people experiencing homelessness, according to HUD. 
There were 11,759 people experiencing homelessness in Ohio last year— about a 3% increase, according to the HUD. 
Nearly 80% of those experiencing homelessness in Ohio were sheltered while the rest were unsheltered. 
There were 2,556 people experiencing homelessness in Franklin County during January’s Point-in-Time Count — a 7.4% increase from last year, according to the Community Shelter Board. 
Ohioans need to be making at least $22.51 an hour working a full-time job to be able to afford a “modest” two-bedroom apartment, according to COHHIO and the National Low Income Housing Coalition’s 2025 Out of Reach report.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)As the housing shortage pushes more Americans into homelessness for the first time, the Trump administration wants to focus federal housing aid on mental health treatment and enforcement against street homelessness, rather than on finding people permanent homes as quickly as possible.
The administration’s new plan to tie federal housing aid to work requirements and drug treatment could be a boon to states such as Alabama, Florida and Wyoming that already are pursuing that strategy. But for many other states — and nonprofit providers across the country — the rules represent a sudden pivot from past expectations. In California, the new federal funding priorities face a direct conflict with state law.
Under new rules announced last month, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development will place new restrictions on $3 billion in homelessness aid, allowing no more than 30% of federal grants to be used for permanent housing. That approach, known as Housing First, prioritizes getting people into safe, stable housing ahead of other treatment and enforcement, and had been a key focus for the federal government’s Continuum of Care Program for homelessness.
Now, HUD’s new rules — a shift to Treatment First policies — could result in a major reprioritization of who gets funding and for what purpose. Backlash from many nonprofits and homelessness service providers across the country has been swift, and 20 states and Washington, D.C., have filed suit to stop the rules, arguing they violate federal law. Several cities and counties across the country also have joined a lawsuit against the department.
Many more cities ban sleeping outside despite a lack of shelter space

While service providers point to success stories from permanent supportive housing, the Trump administration points to rising homelessness — and a perception of violent crime — as a reason to shift funding away from the long-standing approach.
But Martha Are, CEO of the Homeless Services Network of Central Florida, said the Trump administration is putting the onus on  nonprofits and service providers to fix a homelessness crisis that is propelled by a lack of housing that people can afford.
“If homelessness numbers go up, some assume the homeless-response system doesn’t work. But the real driver is the housing market, not the interventions,” Are said. “HUD is penalizing communities for following the rules they set in previous years. I’ve never seen them say, ‘You complied with our guidance, and now you lose points for it.’”
Easy transition for some states
An analysis of publicly available federal data by the National Alliance to End Homelessness found that 88% of federal Continuum of Care dollars flow to permanent supportive housing and rapid rehousing, the models with the strongest evidence of reducing chronic homelessness. The new HUD rules would force cuts large enough to cause roughly 170,000 people to lose that housing, according to the advocacy group’s projections.
But a handful of Continuum of Care programs already devote far less to permanent housing. According to the National Alliance to End Homelessness, that includes that includes certain county or state programs in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, West Virginia and Wyoming.
These programs operate closer to HUD’s new funding requirements and are unlikely to face major disruption. Some even may become more competitive for federal funding, especially in states where policymakers have already adopted enforcement-heavy approaches to homelessness.
Such states — including Florida, Georgia, Missouri, Tennessee and Texas — may be better positioned under HUD’s new grant-funding criteria, which prioritize jurisdictions that criminalize public camping, expand law enforcement involvement or restrict low-barrier shelters, which may have more flexible policies than traditional shelters.
Since the U.S. Supreme Court’s City of Grants Pass v. Johnson ruling in June 2024 allowing localities to ban outdoor camping even if there is no homeless shelter space available, roughly 150 cities in 32 states have passed or strengthened such ordinances.
Can states, and a little bit of faith, convert church land into affordable housing?

The annual point-in-time count of people sleeping outside reported that homelessness reached an all-time high in 2024, the most recent data available from HUD. The count, taken during the last 10 days of January 2024, found that 771,480 people were experiencing homelessness, an 18% increase over the previous year and the largest one-year jump in the history of the count.
HUD told Stateline the administration is shifting its approach to emphasize “long-term self-sufficiency and recovery” rather than the number of housing units funded or filled.
The agency rejected advocates’ claims that the new rules will increase homelessness, arguing instead that “failed” Housing First policies have contributed to rising numbers. HUD said it hopes communities will convert many permanent supportive housing programs into transitional housing with stronger requirements around addiction and mental-health services.
Skepticism about Housing First
The impact of these cuts won’t be evenly distributed.
Some areas with the deepest investments in the Housing First approach — including Cleveland, Ohio; Los Angeles; and New York City — stand to lose thousands of units that currently serve older adults, those leaving domestic violence situations, people with disabilities, veterans and families.
Those in favor of HUD’s funding shift argue that long-standing as it may be, Housing First has failed to reduce homelessness.
HUD’s annual counts show national homelessness rising for most of the past decade, and the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service notes that while Housing First stabilizes individuals, it has not reduced the number of people experiencing homelessness.
A 2021 Harvard University study found that while most people in permanent supportive housing remained housed in the first year, retention dropped sharply over time — with only about 12% still housed after 10 years.
Conservative think tanks such as the Cicero Institute, American Enterprise Institute and the Manhattan Institute suggest that Housing First undervalues mental health and substance use treatment. They point to Oregon’s homelessness struggles after drug decriminalization as evidence that voluntary services alone cannot stabilize the most vulnerable residents.
They further argue that permanent housing grants crowd out shelter, detox and transitional programs, and that many nonprofits defending the model are financially invested in maintaining the status quo.
At a moment when tight housing markets are pushing record numbers of people into first-time homelessness, local providers, who stand to lose grants, warn that HUD’s policy reversal will function more like a mass eviction than a funding shift — sending tens of thousands of people back into shelters, onto waiting lists, or directly onto the streets.
As homeless people become more visible, some cities and states take a tougher line

Losing trust in the system
In Orlando, Florida, many residents are experiencing homelessness for the first time. Shelters are full and a recent law in Florida allows police to arrest people for sleeping outdoors.
Are, of the Homeless Services Network of Central Florida, said the proposed HUD changes would eliminate more than 500 permanent housing subsidies that her organization offers in the Orlando area alone.
For providers, these subsidies cover the rent for units where people already live. If HUD defunds them, tenants would lose support, landlords would stop receiving payments and people would be evicted unless local governments backfill the funds, she said. And most local governments can’t afford to, she added.
Central Florida has built a system that uses data to focus on high-need individuals and keep them housed — in long-term rental units paired with voluntary support services — at a lower cost than mandated hospitalizations or treatment, Are said. HUD’s abrupt policy reversal would unravel years of progress and leave communities with “no place to put people.”
“Our permanent supportive housing costs about one-twentieth of what inpatient institutional programs cost in this region, and the outcomes are far better,” she said.
Nashville, Tennessee, had expected stable homelessness funding until HUD overhauled the rules “out of [the] blue” and at a time when it would be hard for providers to plan for sudden changes, said Wally Dietz, legal director for the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County.
When Congress approved a two-year cycle for fiscal years 2024 and 2025, localities were told they wouldn’t have to reapply for money, he said. That changed this fall.
“Nashville was given 60 days, spanning Thanksgiving and Christmas, to rewrite and resubmit its entire homelessness funding application, which is something the city typically prepares for a full year,” Dietz said.
If the changes to Nashville’s funding go through, not only will people lose their housing, he said, but a 20-year infrastructure will crumble and the164 landlords who partnered with the city will lose faith once rent aid stops flowing.
“Once evicted, people will not reengage with the system, and trust will be impossible to rebuild,” Dietz said.
Nashville is among a handful of localities, including Boston, San Francisco and Tucson, Arizona, that filed a joint lawsuit Monday to block the rule changes, accusing HUD of bypassing Congress. The suit, whose plaintiffs also include the National Alliance to End Homelessness and the National Low Income Housing Coalition, was filed in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island.
“If the administration wants to overhaul homelessness policy, it has to go through Congress,” Dietz said. “That gives cities time to prepare, to testify, to budget. But we didn’t get that chance.”

Richard Blumenthal, who is a co-author of the Senate bill.
Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee removed a core part of the Senate bill: the “duty of care” section, which would require companies to “exercise reasonable care” when designing a platform to mitigate a defined list of potential harms to minors, including certain mental health disorders, substance use disorders and physical and sexual abuse. 
Targeted design features include infinite scroll, autoplay, notifications and other features that keep minors engaged in an app or site. 
The House draft requires platforms to create “reasonable policies, practices, and procedures” related only to threats of physical violence, sexual exploitation and abuse and the distribution of drugs. It would also prevent states from enacting or enforcing their own laws on similar issues.
House lawmakers said the changes were made to address lingering concerns over free speech and potential issues in court. 
The revision drew mixed reactions at this week’s congressional hearing on the bill. Some lawmakers and experts in the field were encouraged to see the duty of care removed, while others were disappointed about what they now view as a “watered-down” bill.
Without the duty of care provision, Blumenthal argued, lawmakers are enabling major tech companies and shying away from holding them accountable. But he remains hopeful the House and Senate can figure out a compromise bill and sees the renewed attention to the issue as progress.
“Totally caving on the duty of care is an abdication of responsibility to protect kids,” Blumenthal said. “There has to be some duty of care so Big Tech will recognize its responsibility, and the House surrendering is simply a sign of Big Tech’s power.”
“I would anticipate we’ll have negotiation once they’re done with those hearings,” he continued. “But we’re unwilling to accept a bill that weakens it so much that it fails to protect children.”
This week’s hearing illustrated the challenges that have plagued various pieces of tech legislation from the start: there’s broad consensus in Congress to better protect children and teenagers online but sharp disagreements remain in how to do so.
The revised Kids Online Safety Act was one of 19 bills up for consideration before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Tuesday. The committee also debated legislation that would require age verification on app stores, an updated version of the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, and other bills on data privacy and parental controls.
But the Kids Online Safety Act, or KOSA, was a dominant focus of the hearing.
KOSA aims to put in place stricter settings by allowing children and parents to disable addictive features like infinite scroll and autoplay of videos, enable privacy settings and opt out of algorithmic recommendations. The types of platforms that would need to comply include social media, online video games, messaging sites and video streaming services.
The duty of care section, to hold platforms legally responsible for mitigating certain harms to minors, has come under scrutiny before, though it has been revised and narrowed in newer iterations of the Senate bill.
In the Senate version, platforms covered under the bill must “exercise reasonable care” in creating and implementing design features “to prevent and mitigate the following harms to minors where a reasonable and prudent person would agree that such harms were reasonably foreseeable.”
Some of those harms include eating disorders, substance use disorders, suicidal behaviors, and depressive and anxiety disorders with “objectively verifiable and clinically diagnosable symptoms” that relate to compulsive usage of the platform by a minor. Sexual exploitation and physical violence and online harassment that is “severe and pervasive” are also included.
The House GOP version instead seeks to adopt a more limited policy. It would require platforms likely to be used by minors to enforce “reasonable policies, practices, and procedures” regarding harms to minors related only to threats of physical violence, sexual exploitation and abuse, and the distribution of narcotic drugs.
A lead Republican sponsor, U.S. Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Fla., said changes were made to KOSA to make sure it’s “durable,” citing recent court cases of state-level child online safety legislation. And House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Brett Guthrie, R-Ky., said the revisions were meant to address concerns in both parties. 
“Don’t mistake durability for weakness, folks — this bill has teeth. By focusing on design features rather than protected speech, we will ensure it can withstand legal challenge while delivering real protections for kids online … and their families,” Bilirakis said.
Bilirakis also led last year’s House bill with U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Fla., which similarly contained a duty of care section like the Senate version. At the hearing, Castor called the new changes “a slap in the face” to parents and advocates pushing for KOSA.
Blumenthal rejected the characterizations from GOP House members, saying the bill is “content neutral.” He has said before it would not allow enforcers like the Federal Trade Commission or state attorneys general to sue over content or speech. And he called arguments that the bill wouldn’t hold up in a court because of First Amendment rights “totally bogus.”
“It’s not a bill about restricting content. It’s about the design of the intent so as to enable Big Tech itself to have responsibility,” he said. “So there’s nothing in our bill that restricts First Amendment free expression.”
ParentsSOS, a group representing families who have attributed the deaths of their children to harmful content viewed online, were disheartened by the changes to a bill they’ve been pushing Congress to pass for several years. The group took issue with the removal of the duty of care as well as the provision in the House bill that the federal regulation can preempt states’ own laws on children’s online safety.
They are encouraging House members to take up the Senate version crafted by Blumenthal and his Republican co-author, U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee.
“It needlessly delayed the House from advancing the wildly popular Senate version of the Kids Online Safety Act, which gives parents the tools they need to keep their children safe,” Joann Bogard, a member of ParentsSOS, said in a statement following the hearing. “If the Committee continues to advance a weak version of KOSA and preempt good state laws, we will have no choice but to vocally oppose the package.”
But some of the experts testifying at this week’s hearing were encouraged by the changes to the duty of care section.
“The tools that would be required under KOSA are definitely workable,” Paul Lekas, executive vice president of Software & Information Industry Association, said. “The requirements to establish procedures and processes and so forth seem really well-designed to address the constitutional concerns that have come up with respect to earlier drafts of this legislation.”
But there were some disagreements on the panel over broader preemption clauses in all of the bills before the House committee. Lekas said he supports a “strong and preemptive” federal regulation. But Kate Ruane, director of the Free Expression Project at the Center for Democracy & Technology, warned a preemptive federal law could override even stronger protections enacted by states on the same issues.
Critics on different sides of the political spectrum have also raised free speech issues. That was a primary concern for House Republicans when the bill was up for consideration in the last session, including for House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.
Some LGBTQ+ groups, like Fight for the Future, have also flagged concerns that KOSA could lead to censoring or limiting access to resources like gender-affirming care and reproductive health for vulnerable minors, particularly for transgender kids.
At Tuesday’s hearing, Ruane said she worries platforms will play a guessing game of what type of content that may be harmful to minors.
That dovetailed with her concerns about the independence of the Federal Trade Commission under the Trump administration. President Donald Trump fired Democratic commissioners on the FTC. A federal district court judge said the firings were illegal, but the Supreme Court temporarily upheld it in an emergency order.
“If we do not have an independent FTC that is enforcing the law fairly as it applies to all children and protects all children, we have significant concerns about how these bills would operate in practice even if the way they are currently constituted as neutral and would protect everyone,” Ruane said.
When asked about the current FTC and its prospective role in enforcing KOSA, Blumenthal said he shared similar concerns.
“I’m not sure how we would exactly address it,” Blumenthal said, while adding that they could look into other possibilities of “enabling other enforcers and also safeguards against potential infringement on rights and liberties.”
“But I’m more worried about the absence of enforcement from an FTC that has no real regard for the law,” he added.
Blumenthal and Blackburn have brought up the Kids Online Safety Act in the past few sessions of Congress. The bill saw its biggest momentum last year, when it passed the Senate in a 91-3 vote.
But even after a last-ditch push by Elon Musk and other tech company executives to address GOP concerns over free speech, it stalled in the House without getting a floor vote before the end of last year.
Some major tech companies have endorsed the Senate version of KOSA. But NetChoice, a tech trade association representing members like Meta and Snap, has lobbied against passage in previous sessions of Congress. After Tuesday’s House hearing, the group was complimentary of House Republicans’ efforts on the 19 online safety bills before the committee and said it wants to work with the committee to “refine” the various tech proposals.
That could lead to an even bigger gulf between House and Senate lawmakers involved in trying to get children’s online safety protections signed into law.
On the Senate side, Blumenthal and Blackburn reintroduced KOSA earlier this year and are hoping for another vote in the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. The bill has already advanced out of that committee several times in past sessions.
They still see a path for working out the differences in Congress and trying to get it through this time around.
“This bill has a dynamic that eventually will push it over the finish line. Whenever I talk to parents, the No. 1 concern on their mind is their kids’ safety on the internet,” Blumenthal said. “So it’s just a question of what we can get done and how quickly.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-02-at-1.14.04-PM.png,,,2025-12-05 05:57:05.869857

A resolution won’t come until at least next year for the case of Brittany Watts, a Warren resident who was criminally charged after she miscarried at her home, following multiple trips to the hospital.
She is suing the city of Warren, the hospital and law enforcement in U.S. District Court.
And, while an Ohio appeals court has heard the arguments on both sides of the state’s appeal on abortion regulations — originally stemming from a six-week abortion ban that was overturned — a decision as to whether parts of the law not related to the six-week ban will stand.
Brittany Watts
For Watts, it may be next September before she has an answer as to whether hospital staff and law enforcement in Warren County violated her rights by reporting a crime, resulting in charges of abuse of a corpse.
The charges that were rejected by a grand jury.
The lawsuit will be a year old as of January 2026, though it’s seen changes and activity throughout the year.
Watts wants compensation for what her attorneys argue are violations of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment, plus a federal law that gives anyone the right to emergency treatment regardless of insurance or ability to pay.
She’s suing St. Joseph Warren Hospital in Youngstown, the parent company Bon Secours Mercy Health, the city of Warren, and police officers from the city.
In the lawsuit, Watts said not only were her constitutional rights violated, but the staff “committed medical negligence, inflicted severe emotional distress and deprived her of her liberty without probable cause, among other misconduct.”

The story began when Watts said she went to the hospital for care during her pregnancy, where she waited a total of 18 hours over the course of two days, court documents state.
The first night she left after eight hours and “no meaningful treatment or guidance,” according to her attorneys.
The second day she was told her pregnancy was “doomed” and she was at risk of severe and life-threatening complications, but still was “effectively untreated.”
She left and suffered a miscarriage in her bathroom, before returning to the hospital.
It was at that point that she said hospital staff reported her and she was questioned by investigators who indicated that Watts had “birthed a live baby and hidden it ‘in a cabinet.’”
Since initially filing the lawsuit, attorneys have asked the court to add more hospital staff as parties to the lawsuit, including a staff member in risk management and a police officer, who Watts and her attorneys say advised a nurse, leading to her to “falsely report that (Watts) had committed a crime.”
The most recent documents in the case argue hospital staff and police officers knew Watts hadn’t committed a crime, but “saw to it that she would face criminal charges for having an experience shared by hundreds of thousands of women every year.”
All the parties named in the lawsuit have denied any wrongdoing, though the hospital has acknowledged to the court that Watts was told the fetus was “too early from a gestational age for any reasonable chance of survival,” that a doctor recommended that labor be induced, and that a delay could increase the risk of complications.
A jury trial has been scheduled in the case for Sept. 14, 2026, while document deadlines in the case range from Jan. 23 to June 1 of next year.
State abortion regulations
Meanwhile, an answer could come at any time in the case of an Ohio appeal fighting for regulations that were attached to a struck down six-week abortion ban.
The First District Court of Appeals heard oral arguments in the case in September, after a Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas Judge struck down the law that established the six-week abortion ban last October.
A key factor in the common pleas decision was a constitutional amendment passed by 57% of Ohio voters in 2023, that enshrined abortion care, including miscarriage care, into the Ohio Constitution.
The law at issue in the appeal was passed in 2019, eliminating abortions past six weeks of gestation.
It also included other provisions related to abortion record-keeping and specific punishments for failing to check for cardiac activity before an abortion.
Ohio Deputy Solicitor General Stephen Carney argued that the other provisions in the law outside of the ban on abortions at six weeks were “severable,” meaning they could act independently from the struck-down law.
He said if the appeals court struck down the entire law, including those provisions, it would be “doing something radical that no one has ever done before,” and consequences would ripple out to review of other laws.
Cassie Mitchell, who represented the women’s health clinics that sued the state to strike down the law, said the provisions are directly related to the six-week abortion ban, and therefore should go as well, as they exist to “clarify the scope of the ban.”

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images.)The Ohio Supreme Court has ruled police officers can be considered victims, and thus not subject to public disclosure, under Ohio’s Marsy’s Law privacy protections.
The case stems from a July 2023 incident in which three men robbed several car dealerships, banks, and even a GameStop before getting tracked down police.
A car chase on I-70 ended in a shootout. Two suspects fled on foot. But a third shot one officer five times and was approaching a second officer when he was shot and killed.
The fleeing suspects were caught, and in January of this year sentenced to 25 and 13 years respectively.
But the day of the shooting, reporters at the Columbus Dispatch filed a public records request for bodycam and dashcam footage.
Columbus Police eventually released redacted footage that shielded the identities of the officers claiming they were victims of a crime.
The Dispatch sued, claiming police officers acting in their official capacity can’t be considered victims because they’re representing the state.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Ohio Supreme Court Justice Patrick DeWine, writing for the court’s majority, disagreed — and he didn’t seem to think it was a hard call.
“Applying the plain text of the amendment, we have no difficulty concluding that an ordinary understanding of Marsy’s Law’s definition of victim encompasses the officers in this case,” he wrote.
To DeWine, it boils down to a simple equation: A victim under Marsy’s Law is a person against whom a criminal act is committed, and a police officer is definitely a person.
The court is not being asked “to determine whether an edge case fits within the scope of underdeterminative constitutional text,” DeWine continued. “This is a case in which the text is clear and determinative with respect to police officers.”
The police union was thrilled with the decision.
“This ruling is a bright light for common sense,” Fraternal Order of Police of Ohio President Jay McDonald said in a statement.
“Of course, Marsy’s Law protects police. When an officer is attacked, they are a victim like anyone else, and they deserve the same privacy and protections.”
But to some other justices on the bench, the case isn’t quite that simple — even if they agree police officers can meet the definition of victims.
Background
Marsy’s Law was first adopted as part of the California State Constitution in 2008.
The amendment provides several protections for victims of crime to ensure they’re heard in court, aware of developments in the case, and afforded privacy as proceedings play out.
Since its adoption in California, 13 states have adopted a version of the amendment. In Pennsylvania and Montana state courts later overturned the provisions.
Courts in Kentucky threw out that state’s version of Marsy’s Law, too. But voters approved a second version in 2020. The law is currently in effect in 12 states.
Since at least 2020, journalists have been raising alarms about law enforcement agencies use Marsy’s Law protections to shield the identity of officers involved in use of force incidents.
ProPublica noted it was particularly common in Florida, where voters approved Marsy’s Law in 2018.
But even some prominent law enforcement officials like Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri pushed back on that use of the law.
“A police officer who shoots and kills another is not a ‘victim’ of that shooting and cannot invoke Marsy’s Law to shroud his shooting in secrecy,” he wrote in an amicus brief.
In 2023, the Florida Supreme Court ruled Marsy’s Law doesn’t afford any victim, “police officer or otherwise — the categorical right to withhold his or her name from disclosure.”
The court determined that would be incompatible with the right to confront adverse witnesses in court and the state’s sunshine laws.
Ohio’s ruling, and its dissents
Among its arguments, The Columbus Dispatch said police officers, acting in their official capacity, need be treated differently under Marsy’s law because they’re treated differently under many other statutes.
“A person may commit many criminal offenses against a police officer that would not be criminal offenses if committed against a private individual,” the newspaper said.
That’s because offenses like false statements, resisting arrest, and failure to comply, are treated as offenses against the state, rather than the individual officer.
Just look at the two men charged with armed robbery in the underlying case.
The plaintiff wasn’t officer John Doe 1 or John Doe 2, as they’re identified in the Ohio Supreme Court case, and it wasn’t the businesses they robbed — it was the United States.
Granting police officers the right to shield their identity if they’re subject to any criminal offense would be a sweeping change.
It’s unlikely voters who approved Marsy’s Law, the newspaper said, “understood that they were granting state actors any rights that might result in their being deprived of their existing right to obtain information about police officers through public records requests.”
Justice DeWine brushed those arguments off.
“It may well be true that when a person has made a false report to a police officer or committed a similar crime, the police officer is not a victim of that crime under the constitutional definition,” he wrote. “But that is not the case in front of us.”
In a pair of dissents, Justices Patrick Fischer and Jennifer Brunner complicated DeWine’s straightforward interpretation.
Both agreed that officers can be victims under Marsy’s Law, but they still found fault with the police department’s stance.
Fischer said the facts of the case demonstrate Doe 1 and Doe 2 were in fact victims and the department was justified in redacting their identifying information under Marsy’s Law. But he stressed they weren’t the only officers on the scene.
“The evidence provided by CPD plainly shows that there are other records — specifically, body-worn-camera and dashboard-camera footage from other officers at the scene who were involved in the shooting — that are responsive to the Dispatch’s request and that were withheld by CPD under the victims’ rights exception,” he wrote.
Fischer noted the department conceded at oral argument that those other officers were not victims.
He contends the court should direct the department to release the remaining footage to The Dispatch.
Justice Brunner argued Ohioans have an understood constitutional right to access government records like body cam footage.
Instead of arguing a public official can never be a victim, she focused on the expectation of privacy.
Because police operate in public, with their name and badge number readily available, Marsy’s Law privacy protections shouldn’t extend to their conduct.
“Once the officers are on duty in public, they do not have an expectation of privacy in their names or identities,” she wrote.
Reactions
While the police union celebrated, Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein, who serves as legal advisor to the police department, sounded a more measured tone.
Although he respects the public’s desire for transparency, especially in use of force cases, he said city officials were simply trying to follow the law as written.
“Today’s ruling by the Ohio Supreme Court affirms that interpretation of Marsy’s Law,” he said. “If the Ohio legislature chooses to amend or clarify these important public record provisions in the future, we will of course follow those laws at that time.”
And the ACLU of Ohio, which opposed Marsy’s Law when it went before voters, is looking to the future as well.
In a statement Senior Policy Counsel Patrick Higgins wrote, “the ACLU of Ohio believes a transparent government can be an accountable government. In the wake of this decision, we stand ready and look forward to working with the state legislature to ensure that violent encounters between state actors and civilians are scrutinized under the daylight they deserve.”

(Photo by Maya Mitchell/New Hampshire Bulletin)New Hampshire’s Executive Council approved a contract to continue funding the “Get the Lead Out of Drinking Water” program for child care facilities on Wednesday.  
Since 2018, the state has required schools and licensed child care programs to test for lead in drinking water outlets, including fountains, classroom sinks, and kitchen fixtures. If lead levels in the water exceed 5 parts per billion, the system must be remediated, and the state will reimburse up to 100% of the remediation costs for the facility. 
The program allows the state to continue to enter into agreements with child care facilities to aid in remediation efforts. It is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services’ Division of Public Health, in partnership with the Department of Environmental Services. 
The program is funded by the Drinking Water and Groundwater Trust Fund, which initially allocated $400,000 in October 2024 under a 14-month agreement through December 2025. To date, over $62,000 has been awarded, according to Health and Human Services. The contract approved this week makes the remaining $337,553 of program funding available through September 2026. 
Remediation actions include replacing faucets and pipes, installing water filtration systems and stations, installing water treatment for corrosion control, and permanently removing drinking water outlets from service if necessary.
Iain Watt, director of the Division of Public Health, said on Wednesday that about half of the money will go to 10 facilities with active applications. According to Health and Human Services, another 150 facilities would qualify for funding if they applied. 
“This money was always intended as first come, first serve, and there’s no cap on an individual award,” he said. 
Watt added the agency anticipates working through all of the allocated money, and that “our intent is always to cover as many facilities as this money would allow for.” 
According to Watt, most of the awards have been for water filtration, faucet replacement, and other “fairly small-scale projects,” and the highest award was $23,000. To date, 21 facilities have had their remediation efforts funded. 
The program has been conducting “ongoing outreach” to raise its awareness of the program and will even work with individual providers to reduce application barriers. However, Watt said it is hard to test child care facilities because they are “kind of a moving target.” 
“Things start up and others shut down,” he said. “It’s a more transient universe [than schools] that we’re trying to capture.” 
By law, child care facilities and public schools are required to go through three rounds of lead testing compliance. Watt said that over 180 child care facilities had test levels at or above the allowed lead limit. 
Testing is free for licensed child care facilities that enroll in the “Get the Lead Out” program. Health and Human Services will disburse remediation funds to facilities with at least one test result at or over the action level for lead in water.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/childcarelead-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-05 04:57:02.600923

Abortion rights advocates are frustrated, but committed to fighting back.
Voters overwhelmingly chose to protect access to abortion in 2023.
Issue 1 passed 57-43%, enshrining reproductive rights into the state constitution.
It states Ohioans have the right to make their own decisions about abortion, contraception, fertility treatment, miscarriage care and continuing pregnancy.
The state is prohibited from interfering with or penalizing someone for exercising this right, as well as penalizing anyone else — including health care professionals — from assisting.
“We’re seeing bill after bill after bill trying to undo the will of the voters,” Abortion rights advocate Jaime Miracle said.
Despite the voters speaking, Miracle said this isn’t stopping Republican legislators from attempting to add barriers to access.
“We have the legislators, once again, proving why we went to the ballot, ignoring the will of the people, ignoring the pro-abortion majority in our state and trying to pass more abortion restrictions that the voters of Ohio do not want,” she said.
Republicans have introduced about a dozen bills that would impact reproductive rights.
State Sen. Kyle Koehler, R-Springfield, introduced S.B. 309, which could add steps to access the abortion pill mifepristone.
“[The bill] provides a framework for healthcare providers to educate a woman on the risks associated with a chemical abortion and makes her aware of her and her family’s rights to sue if the pill results in complications, injuries, a failed abortion, or her death,” Koehler said.
The legislation creates a speech for doctors to give patients about the dangers of Mifepristone, and requires the individual to sign an informed consent document.
It allows the patient, the father of the fetus, or grandparents if the patient is a minor, to sue if they feel the patient was uninformed when taking the pill.
In an interview on Wednesday, he said that he was focused on targeting online “mail-order” providers, not Ohio’s existing brick-and-mortar abortion clinics.
“We’re not trying to stop them, and we’re trying to stay within the Constitution,” Koehler said.
“Just [making] sure they know they have rights, and that there are unintended consequences that can and have reportedly happened to women who take mifepristone without ever seeing a doctor.
Miracle explains that the medication abortion is safe and highly regulated, which doctors are now having to defend at the Statehouse as another GOP bill tries to ban mail-order abortion pills.
“This is anti-abortion propaganda that is being forced upon providers and their patients,” Miracle said.
Another abortion-related bill that has passed the House is H.B. 485, which would require fifth graders and older to watch either “Meet Baby Olivia,” a GOP-supported fetal development animated video created by anti-abortion organization Live Action, or a very similar piece.
“Children are a gift, and we’re hoping that we can change the culture to be celebrating life instead of destroying life,” state Rep. Melanie Miller, R-Ashland, said.
The video teaches that life begins at conception and goes through each stage of growth. Miracle said that the video isn’t appropriate.
“It’s not scientifically accurate,” she said. “It is not even visually accurate.”
Kellie Copeland, who works with Miracle at Abortion Forward, explained further about the informational inconsistencies.
“It does not include the pregnant person; it includes idealized images of what fetal development looks like,” Copeland said.
“It doesn’t talk about complications, things that could go wrong. This is not about being medically accurate.”
The development cycle and graphics shown in the video conflict with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists’ research.
But Miller believes that it is accurate and can help provide insight into pregnancy since Ohio teaches abstinence-only sex ed.
“Visible, engaging tool to help them truly understand these early stages of life,” Miller said during debate on the floor before it passed.
Meanwhile, some activists are still pushing for a total abortion ban, but GOP leaders said that seems unlikely to go through.
However, when asked during the fall about abortion legislation, House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, addressed a bill that would reinstate the 24-hour waiting period for abortion services.
“Ohio did pass an extraordinarily expansive abortion rights in our Constitution,” he said, but noted that there are all types of regulations on constitutional rights.
“The 24-hour rule — is that prohibiting somebody from obtaining an abortion? Probably not,” Huffman said. “What if it was 12 hours? What if it was 1 hour? You know… at some point, absolutism can’t rule the day with whatever it says in the constitution.”
Still, all of these are bills that Miracle said continue to be unconstitutional.
“We will be fighting it every step of the way,” Miracle said.

Restrictions on solar and wind farms are proliferating around the country, with scores of local governments going as far as to forbid large-scale clean-energy developments.


Now, residents of an Ohio county are pushing back on one such ban on renewables — a move that could be a model for other places where clean energy faces severe restrictions.


Ohio has become a hot spot for anti-clean-energy rules. As of this fall, more than three dozen counties in the state have outlawed utility-scale solar in at least one of their townships.


In Richland County, the ban came this summer, when county commissioners voted to bar economically significant solar and wind projects in 11 of the county’s 18 townships. Almost immediately, residents formed a group called the Richland County Citizens for Property Rights and Job Development to try and reverse the stricture.


By September, they’d notched a crucial first victory, collecting enough signatures to put the issue on the ballot. Next May, when Ohioans head to the polls to vote in primary races, residents of Richland County will weigh in on a referendum that could ultimately reverse the ban. It’s the first time a county’s renewable-energy ban will be on the ballot in Ohio.


From the very beginning, ​“it was just a whirlwind,” said Christina O’Millian, a leader of the Richland County group. Like most others, she didn’t know a ban was under consideration until shortly before July 17, when the commission voted on it.


“We felt as constituents that we just hadn’t been heard,” O’Millian said. She views renewable energy as a way to attract more economic development to the county while reining in planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.


Brian McPeek, another of the group’s leaders and a manager for the local chapter of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, sees solar projects as huge job opportunities for the union’s members. ​“They provide a ton of work, a ton of man-hours.”


Many petition signers ​“didn’t want the commissioners to make that decision for them,” said Morgan Carroll, a county resident who helped gather signatures. ​“And there was a lot of respect for farmers having their own property rights” to decide whether to lease their land.


While the Ohio Power Siting Board retains general authority over where electricity generation is built, a 2021 state law known as Senate Bill 52 lets counties ban solar and wind farms in all or part of their territories. Meanwhile, Ohio law prevents local governments from blocking fossil-fuel or nuclear projects.


The Richland County community group is using a process under SB 52 to challenge the renewable-energy ban via referendum. Under that law, the organization had just 30 days from the commissioners’ vote to collect signatures in support of the ballot measure.


All told, more than 4,300 people signed the petition, though after the county Board of Elections rejected hundreds of signatures as invalid, the final count ended up at 3,380 — just 60 more than the required threshold of 8% of the number of votes in the last governor’s election.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE


 Deference to townships?

Although the Richland County ban came as a surprise to many, it was months in the making.


In late January, Sharon Township’s zoning committee asked the county to forbid large wind and solar projects there. After discussion at their Feb. 6 meeting, the county commissioners wrote to all 18 townships in Richland to see if their trustees also wanted a ban. A draft fill-in-the-blanks resolution accompanied the letter.


Signed resolutions came back from 11 townships. The commissioners then took up the issue again on July 17.


Roughly two dozen residents came to the July meeting, and a majority of those who spoke on the proposal were against it. Commissioners deferred to the township trustees.

“The township trustees who were in favor of the prohibition strongly believe that they were representing the wishes of their residents, who are farming communities, who are not fans of seeing potential farmland being taken up for large wind and solar,” Commissioner Tony Vero told Canary Media.


He pointed out that the ban doesn’t cover the seven remaining townships and all municipal areas. ​“I just thought it was a pretty good compromise,” he said.


The concerns over putting solar panels or wind turbines on potential farmland echo land-use arguments that have long dogged rural clean-energy developments — and which have been elevated into federal policy by the Trump administration this year. Groups linked to the fossil-fuel industry have pushed these arguments in Ohio and beyond.


“It’s a false narrative that they care about prime farmland,” said Bella Bogin, director of programs for Ohio Citizen Action, which helped the Richland County group collect signatures to petition for the referendum. Income from leasing some land for renewable energy can help farmers keep property in their families, and plenty of acreage currently goes to growing crops for fuel — not food. ​“We can’t eat ethanol corn,” she added.


Under Ohio’s SB 52, counties — not townships — have the authority to issue blanket prohibitions over large solar and wind farms, with limited exceptions for projects already in the grid manager’s queue.


In Richland County’s case, the commissioners decided to defer to townships even though they didn’t have to.


The choice shows how SB 52 has led to ​“an inconsistently applied, informal framework that has created confusion about the roles of counties, townships, and the Ohio Power Siting Board,” said Chris Tavenor, general counsel for the Ohio Environmental Council. Under the law, ​“county commissioners should be carefully considering all the factors at play,” rather than deferring to townships.


Even without a restriction in place, SB 52 lets counties nix new solar or wind farms on a case-by-case basis before they’re considered by the Ohio Power Siting Board. And when projects do go to the state regulator, counties and townships appoint two ad hoc decision-makers who vote on cases with the rest of the board.


As electricity prices continue to rise across Ohio, Tavenor hopes the state’s General Assembly will reconsider SB 52, which he and other advocates say is unfairly restrictive toward solar and wind — two of the cheapest and quickest energy sources to deploy.


“Lawmakers should be looking to repeal it and make a system that actually responds to the problems facing our electric grid right now,” he said.
Commissioner Vero, for his part, said he has mixed feelings about the referendum.


“It’s America, and if there’s enough signatures to get on the ballot, more power to people,” he said. However, he objects to the fact that SB 52 allows voters countywide to sign the petition, even if they don’t live in one of the townships with a ban, and said he hopes the legislature will amend the law to prevent that from happening elsewhere.


Yet referendum supporters say the ban matters for the entire county.


“It affects everybody, whether you live in a city, a township, or a village,” McPeek said. As he sees it, restrictions will deter investment from not only companies that build wind and solar but also those that want to be able to access renewable energy. ​“To me, it just is bad for the county — the whole county, not just one or two townships.”


Renewable-energy projects also provide substantial amounts of tax revenue or similar PILOT payments for counties, helping fund schools and other local needs. ​“I think it’s important for my children to have more clean electric [energy] and all the opportunities that go along with having wind and solar,” Carroll said.


Now that the referendum is on the ballot, the Richland County group will work to build more support and get out the vote next spring. ​“Education and outreach in the community is basically what we’re going to focus on for the campaign coming up in the next few months,” O’Millian said.


“So now it goes to a countywide vote, and the population of the county gets to make that decision, instead of three guys,” McPeek said.

Friday, Dec. 5, is the day we will find out. 
FIFA, the worldwide soccer cabal, is hosting the World Cup Draw in Washington, D.C. At the event, teams will be put into groups of four. Those groups will determine what nations play each other in the first round. 
It will also determine what nations come to Kansas City to compete, particularly in the initial games. 
We already know a few things about who won’t compete in these World Cup matches in Kansas City. The first four Kansas City games are part of the first round (or group stage, as FIFA calls it) of the tournament. The host nations — the United States, Canada and Mexico — have already been assigned to venues for the first round. Sorry, American Outlaws, Kansas City is not a venue for any of the three North American teams. 
For that reason, the host nations would only play at Arrowhead if they advanced to one of the matches that is part of the knock-out stage. (In other words, don’t hold your breath. Seeing the U.S. men’s national team in KC is very unlikely.)
If the host nations aren’t coming to Kansas City for any of the four first-round games, then who is? 
We won’t know that until later Friday. (If you read the fine print, we will likely need to wait one more day, until Saturday, to find out all of the pairings and locations.)
But that won’t prevent me from reckless speculation. How improbable are my predictions? There will be 48 teams in the tournament field, some who haven’t even been selected. Slotted into 12 groups, those dozens of teams will play at 16 venues. 
The odds of me getting the KC matches correct are the same as California Gov. Gavin Newsom winning a Republican primary in Goodland. 
Really, this is simply my dream list of match-ups that we might host in the heartland. In doing so, I hope to preview some of the best teams and storylines coming to the tournament in 2026. 
(I have also tried my best to obey the bonkers number of stipulations that FIFA creates in grouping teams, such as the number of neighboring countries that can be in the same group.) 
 
Dream game #1: Tuesday, June 16, 2026: Group J
I’ll get greedy right away: Argentina vs. Scotland. The defending champions feature Lionel Messi, a player so good that my son wore his jerseys to middle school virtually every day. A player so beloved that sports giant Adidas struggled to produce enough Messi jerseys when he signed to play at Inter Miami. 
If previous Argentina legend Diego Maradona played “like the ball was tied to his shoe,” Messi is said to play like “the ball is inside his shoe.” The best player ever, by my estimation, playing in Kansas City for a consecutive World Cup would be incredible.
Not delicious enough for you? I am matching them with Scotland, a team that qualified in one of the most entertaining games I have seen this year. Watch the highlights and marvel at the Scottish commentator losing his mind not just once but four times. 
Kansas City could not luck into two more entertainingly rabid fan bases. Could the bars, hotels and city handle it? I would love to find out. This game would electrify the city at any point in the tournament, but to have it played as the first game? Truly a dream.
 
Dream game #2: Saturday, June 20, 2026: Group E
Consider Spain vs. Japan. Spain, the world’s No. 1 ranked team, boasts superstar talent, especially Lamin Yamal, the nimble highlight reel who lines up as a right wing. Still only 18 when my fantasy game is played, Yamal might be the best player in the world. If not, he is among the most charismatic and promising. 
Why match Spain with Japan? First of all, the team from Japan features a playing style that would be interesting to see opposite Spain. The team works well in tight spaces with short passes and intricate footwork. Since they would have trouble matching Spain, I must have another reason. 
Here it is: I would love to host Japan in Kansas City. Their fans are known for their devotion to leaving stadiums and cities cleaner than they found them. In 2022 in Qatar, a story from the Associated Press noted that the Japanese soccer association supplied “8,000 trash bags to help fans pick up after matches with ‘thank you’ messages on the outside written in Arabic, Japanese, and English.”
Let’s be clear. I’m not asking the Japanese fans to come pick up after the Argentinians and Scots from my Fantasy Game #1. I just love the idea of hosting the most fantastic guest nation. 
 
Dream game #3: Thursday, June 25, 2026: Group F
This game is personal: England vs. Norway. 
If Kansans know a soccer league in the world, it’s the Premier League, the top soccer competition in England. The league is generally regarded as the best quality soccer, from top to bottom, especially this year, when “middle” teams in the league are anything but middling. 
U.S. fans watch Premier League games more than any other European league because of NBC’s broadcasts each weekend. Therefore, I know who Jørgen Strand Larsen is (a promising forward for Wolverhampton) and what nation he represents (Norway, if his name didn’t give it away). 
This fantasy game of mine would be a riot for all Premier League fans. Only the best domestic players in the league will earn a spot on the England roster: international superstars such as Bukayo Saka, Jude Bellingham and Harry Kane. 
Meanwhile, the best scorer in the Premier League would lead Norway into Arrowhead Stadium, the Norse goal-scoring goliath Erling Haaland. He has shattered Premier League records for his club team Manchester City. Many of his teammates feature for English teams as well, from Arsenal to Brentford. 
The familiarity of these players with one another would make the game unmistakably personal. Personally, it’s just a treat for me, a guy who checks on his fantasy team in the Premier League a bit too often. 
 
Dream game #4: Saturday, June 27: Group J
The fourth game dips into the same group as the first game: Group J. I’m rooting for two new teams in Kansas City for the sake of variety. 
However, that also means that I must select from lower-ranked teams, since I was so greedy at the start. (Greedy indeed! I selected three of the top four teams worldwide to play in KC.)
My fourth game might feel like a bit of a comedown: Paraguay vs. Cabo Verde. But hear me out. 
The exceptional team here is a nation you might have never heard of. The island nation of Cabo Verde, also known as Cape Verde, sits off the west coast of Africa with less than 500,000 people, meaning that Kansas City’s metro population is about four times as large. 
I promise that a “Kansas City National Team” would not qualify for the World Cup. 
The nation’s total land area? Roughly three Kansas counties. 
Readers, this is your underdog, if not by ranking. The squad is ranked No. 68 of 210 teams in FIFA’s current rankings. (That’s 18 slots above No. 86 New Zealand, which is the lowest-ranked team to qualify so far.)
Why pit them against Paraguay? Mostly because I had to find a relatively weak team from the South American federation to complete Group J. 
Two relatively unknown teams would also give Kansas City a gift for the final game: more reasonable ticket prices. As I have written before, FIFA is wringing every last dollar from ticket sales with dynamic pricing, so bargains will be rare. 
This match, however, would create the least demand on ticket prices, allowing Kansans a chance to enjoy the novelty of a lifetime: World Cup soccer in the heartland.

(Courtesy of the University of Nebraska)When the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s Faculty Senate voted overwhelmingly in November on a resolution of no confidence in UNL Chancellor Rodney Bennett, it was not done lightly.
Grounded in evidence and in the governing policies of the university and NU Board of Regents alike, the vote called out serious concerns about the accuracy and fiduciary integrity of the financial claims being used to justify the proposed elimination of four academic departments.
Nebraskans and their elected regents are being sold a bill of goods. The numbers the administration is using do not hold up, and once the fuller financial picture is examined, the proposed eliminations produce no real savings. As the regents prepare to vote on Friday, the public deserves a fair accounting of the real cost of this elimination package.
Mythbusting: the financial illusion
The case of the Department of Educational Administration (EDAD) shows how the numbers fall apart under scrutiny. The chancellor claims the department’s elimination will save $1.69 million, but that figure counts only salaries, not the revenue its faculty generate, nor the costs that will persist.
EDAD estimates show $1.23 million a year in tuition from programs slated for elimination (including its Ph.D., Ed.D., and P–12 School Leadership master’s program), revenue that starts to vanish on Day One.
At the same time, the Higher Education master’s programs the chancellor plans to keep must still be staffed, at a reasonable estimate of $450,000 per year all told. Add those up, and the
alleged $1.69 million savings becomes a $27,000 net loss.
A similar picture holds up across targeted departments.
The true cost: sacrificing growth and prestige
The Chancellor’s proposed elimination of EDAD runs directly counter to NU President Jeffrey Gold’s aspiration to rejoin the Association of American Universities (AAU), an elite club of prestigious universities where research intensity is the core measure of membership. EDAD is already advancing that goal: its faculty productivity ranks in the 79th percentile nationally, ahead of seven current AAU universities.
At the same time, the department has designed new credential and online programs projected to generate $250,000–$450,000 annually— growth that vanishes the moment the unit is dissolved.
Even with conservative assumptions, the combined loss of revenue and the unavoidable instructional costs leave UNL with a net loss of roughly $275,000. Dismantling a healthy and nationally competitive program in Nebraska that trains scholars and leaders who are prepared to navigate a changing higher education landscape is the opposite of an “Odyssey to Extraordinary.”
Ceding a competitive niche to rivals
A major long-term consequence of these cuts is the loss of a competitive niche Nebraska had built in doctoral education. UNL’s Ph.D. program in Educational Administration, aside from being the only one in the state, was a pioneer: for decades virtually the only top-tier university offering a research-focused doctorate through hybrid and online delivery, providing access to professionals statewide and competing nationally for students.
Now that peer universities such as the University of Alabama, University of Kentucky, and University of Louisville are launching similar online Ph.D. programs, Nebraska is forfeiting its first-mover advantage and sending tuition revenue and talent to rival states. This forces Nebraska’s educators to pursue research-oriented doctorates elsewhere and leaves the state dependent on outside institutions to train its future education scholars.
Financial self-deception and strategic self-sabotage
The chancellor’s proposed slate of departmental eliminations is an exercise in financial self-deception and strategic self-sabotage. The faults in the data, analysis and procedures behind these cuts are now thoroughly documented, leaving the proposal without a credible foundation.
These kinds of failures carry serious consequences. As the Chronicle of Higher Education recently reported, Portland State University recently attempted a similar round of cuts while bypassing its shared-governance requirements. An independent arbitrator ruled that the administration had violated policy and ordered the university to reinstate the fired faculty and redo its entire budget-cutting process.
Nebraska is displaying the same warning signs: rushed decisions, procedural shortcuts, and error-laden analyses used to justify irreversible cuts. Advancing such a proposal invites external intervention and exposes the university to legal and financial liabilities that could readily outstrip any real savings.
The Board of Regents, charged with safeguarding fiscal integrity and public trust, must meet this moment with clear-eyed scrutiny. They should preserve the four departments, recognizing that the financial claims underlying the proposal have been discredited and that the plan as a whole would result in further costs and profound losses for Nebraska’s economy, workforce and academic standing.

Raelynn Franklin 
Raelynn Franklin is a marathon runner and certified yoga teacher.


Four years ago, I was drinking alone in my apartment, unable to imagine anything beyond survival. Today, I wake up before dawn to run toward a life I once thought was impossible. 
Recently I ran the New York City Marathon. It was my seventh marathon in the four years that I have been in recovery from alcoholism.
In traditional recovery programs there is a saying, “Fake it ‘til you make it.” I was great at faking it. But you can’t fake a 26.2-mile run.
Running is not a byproduct of my recovery; it is one of the main reasons I’ve stayed sober. 
Many people need clinical rehabilitation to stop drinking, but it wasn’t enough for me. Once my treatment ended, I was thrown back into the same lonely environment that caused me to drink in the first place. 
I needed something more, a community that provided support, accountability and goals.
In 2018 I was devoid of all three. That year my marriage ended abruptly, and I lost my job shortly after. Those back-to-back blows sent me into a spiral of addiction.
I would wake up, intending to apply for jobs, and make a drink that I told myself would help me get started. But it was never only one drink, and often I would end up passed out by the afternoon.  
I entered treatment in 2019, thinking I could learn to drink like a normal person — only socially, not when I was sad or angry. 
I didn’t yet understand that that’s not how addiction works. And while I may have learned new tools in treatment, I had no structure and no supportive community where I could practice them.
48 hours of sobriety
In 2020, a friend invited me to a hike with The Phoenix, a “sober active” nonprofit organization that provides connection-based activities and community to anyone sober for at least 48 hours. Activities might include yoga, weightlifting, rock climbing or coffee meet-ups. 
It was the first model that made sense to my goal-oriented brain. You become a member of a supportive team, put in the effort and see proof that you’re moving forward.
Still, I wasn’t ready to let go of drinking. 
I volunteered — rolling out yoga mats and helping set up events — while secretly scheduling my drinking around the group’s 48-hour sobriety rule. I’d stop drinking Sunday night to make it to a Tuesday class, drink afterward, and stop again for Thursday.
But, slowly, the model began to change me. I became intertwined with The Phoenix community. Char, who became my sponsor, relentlessly invited me to events and training sessions, and I became more involved. 
In early 2021, I resolved to truly get sober. A few months later, I committed to running the Long Beach Marathon. 
I wasn’t excited about it and thought it would be a one-time thing. But running took my recovery to another level. 
I had never liked running, but it gave me what I was missing: structure, purpose and accountability. It made me keep promises to myself. All my excuses were stripped away.
Nobody was making me get up at 5 a.m. or checking my miles. It was just me and the road. Each run built confidence I hadn’t felt in years. That discipline began to spill into the rest of my life. 
Since that first marathon, I’ve become a certified yoga instructor. I regularly lead classes through The Phoenix and help others find their footing in recovery. 
I’ll be featured in an upcoming documentary, SOBER, about how connection and physical activity can help people rebuild their lives. We filmed during my first year of sobriety, which I hope helps others taking their first steps into recovery. 
Now I live in a condo on the same stretch of beach where I used to train when I first started running. Most importantly, I’ve been able to help others in recovery. And I’ve found extraordinary friends who cheer me on in every aspect of my life.
I want the same success for the 5.6 million other Californians who struggle with a substance use disorder. The blueprint to aid them already exists — build and fund more communities where connection and self-belief replace despair. 
Individuals, nonprofits and community leaders can all play a role by supporting recovery programs that bring people together instead of isolating them. The solution can start with each of us: volunteer to lead a sober activity like yoga, invite sober friends to an open mic night or start a running club. 
Recovery begins when we create spaces that replace isolation with belonging, where people can rediscover the confidence to change their lives.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/112025-Raelynn-Still-SOBER-Film-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-05 08:57:20.342611

While policymakers assure work requirements will promote responsibility among able-bodied adults, one thing remains clear: many politicians do not know what disability actually looks like. 

Elizabeth Caldwell

At the free clinic where I used to volunteer, I met a patient who could barely stand due to severe diabetic neuropathy. He wasn’t “disabled enough” to receive benefits. Yet, he was too ill to fill any position requiring physical labor, accounting for most non-degree positions available. 
I know that reality too well. I have a physical disability, use a cane and wheelchair for mobility, and rely on a continuous glucose monitor for hypoglycemia management. With access to these interventions, I’ve been able to thrive while pursuing higher education. But I have seen others denied those opportunities. 
So I founded a Mobility Aid Program. My friends and I sold grilled cheeses late into the night in our college town to raise funds for essential medical equipment often deemed a “luxury.” Many university groups used these grilled cheese fundraisers for functions or travel.
We were the only group fundraising for someone’s right to healthcare.
That care made a difference. I saw improvement in the patient’s mobility and independence, ultimately allowing him to reenter the job market. However, under the BBB work requirements, many will lose Medicaid before ever getting the chance to heal, meaning I’ll have to sell a lot more grilled cheeses to fill the gap that our government has widened.
The BBB is advertised as a way to encourage self-sufficiency, with Republicans assuring that it will improve support for people with disabilities. In practice, it punishes people who fall through the cracks of how our government defines disability. The bill’s description of who counts as disabled or medically frail leaves room for subjectivity and access issues. These individuals are often capable of work under the right conditions, but the bureaucratic rigidity of disability classifications makes this lived experience invisible to policymakers. 
Work requirements frame health as an individual responsibility: if you can’t work, you must not be trying hard enough, overlooking many factors that shape health. Physical barriers and stigma prevent many people with disabilities from securing job placements. It also ignores that people with disabilities experience these social barriers at a higher rate, suffering more from the relentless cycle of poverty and social exclusion when compared to non-disabled peers. The BBB institutionalizes the belief that those who can’t work deserve less care, turning bias into law. 



We already know how this ends. When Arkansas imposed Medicaid work requirements in 2018, over 18,000 people lost coverage within four months without a significant increase in employment. Reports show that 64% Medicaid recipients already work at least part-time, often in low-wage jobs without benefits. For those unemployed, disability, caregiving, the job market, or school attendance were cited as barriers. The remaining group lost coverage due to bureaucratic hurdles or policy confusion. Despite claims that work requirements save money, they actually lead to higher rates of non-coverage, medical debt, and national healthcare costs.
Some supporters argue that work requirements ease system strain and shorten wait times. However, stripping people of care until they collapse does not reduce costs. It shifts people to emergency rooms, prisons, and morgues. The BBB would increase disparities for many with disabilities who fall outside the mold of what policymakers believe disability looks like. 
Instead of using work requirements as artificial disability allyship, policies should take an upstream approach to address factors preventing many Americans, disabled and non-disabled alike, from working. Health status, age, and educational level all predict employment. How can you work when your employer refuses accommodations? How can you secure a non-laboring job when you cannot afford the education required in the application? And if you believe the ADA would prevent this discrimination, I envy your naïveté. 
I also urge fellow disability advocates to consider: what if you are next? You may qualify for assistance today, but what if tomorrow the government decides that your disability is not “burdensome enough” for coverage? Then you’ll join the line at the free clinic, made longer by the BBB, where services rely on a student flipping grilled cheeses. 
The deeper issue is how the government defines “disabled enough.” It rarely captures reality, and the system demands proof of incapacity from people too sick to keep proving it. 
Health should never depend on a bureaucrat’s definition of “able to work.” The BBB doesn’t promote independence; it punishes vulnerability. It will deepen inequity by erasing agency, institutionalizing stigma, and redefining healthcare as something to be earned.
If I must, I’ll keep making grilled cheeses. But we deserve a country where a fundraiser doesn’t determine survival.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Changes to Nebraska’s federally funded broadband expansion plans that Gov. Jim Pillen celebrated as a victory faced questions and criticism from state lawmakers and others concerned it will hinder internet quality.
The Nebraska Legislature’s Transportation and Telecommunications Committee heard an update Thursday from the Nebraska Broadband Office on the status of broadband expansion in Nebraska.
The update came a day after Pillen announced that just $44.5 million of the $405 million Nebraska was awarded through the federal Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) program would be used to connect unserved Nebraskans.
Pillen said an additional $21 million in pledged private investments would support reaching the remaining 2% of Nebraska households and other properties still waiting to gain access to a broadband connection.
The Pillen administration plan has received initial approval for its approach, but approval of the actual spending requires an additional step of federal approval, a Pillen spokeswoman said Wednesday night.
“This is a tremendous victory for Nebraska,” Pillen said in a statement. “Reliable broadband is essential for daily life, from schoolwork and healthcare to running a business or managing a farm. With this approval, rural Nebraskans who have been left waiting will finally have access to the same online opportunities and services as everyone else.”
But some lawmakers and other Nebraskans viewed the governor’s announcement differently. In a social media post, Charles Herbster, a possible Republican challenger to Pillen’s gubernatorial re-election bid, criticized why only a small fraction of Nebraska’s initial BEAD allocation would be used, with no guarantees that the state would be allowed to hold onto the remaining funds.
“No amount of spin can hide the truth: Nebraska gave up,” Herbster said. “The Pillen administration failed our rural communities when given every opportunity to succeed. The only honest way forward is to admit it.”
Nebraska was awarded the $405 million under the Biden administration in 2023, money that prompted the creation of the Nebraska Broadband Office the same year. BEAD funding is the only revenue stream supporting the office, director Patrick Haggerty said.
The Nebraska Public Service Commission, the state’s catch-all elected regulator, had managed all broadband expansion efforts up to that point, using funds from the state’s Broadband Bridge Program and Universal Service Fund. The Legislature defunded the Broadband Bridge Program this year.
As the Broadband Office evaluated the first round of broadband project applications this summer, Haggerty said the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), now led by the Trump administration, announced significant changes to the BEAD program.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The changes, among other things, prioritized lower-cost plans and adjusted the eligibility requirements for existing unserved and underserved locations.
The changes cut the number of program-eligible locations in Nebraska still lacking broadband access in half, from about 29,600 to just over 14,000. Haggerty said the roughly 15,600 removed locations either already had internet connections through private investments or were covered by unlicensed fixed wireless access broadband.
While Haggerty argued unlicensed fixed wireless is a reliable form of internet connection, State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, who has led past broadband expansion efforts in the Legislature, disagreed. He compared the reliability to that of a cellphone hotspot.
Brandt also criticized the NTIA’s updated guidance for eliminating the program’s previous preference for fiber internet, which was described as the “gold standard” for internet connectivity at Thursday’s hearing. Brandt said Nebraska is limited to using just 10% of its current $44.5 million allocation for fiber.
In Nebraska, about 4,600 locations are proposed to be served by satellite internet, for about $1,000 per location or $4.7 million. By comparison, it would cost about $14,600 per location to service similar locations via fiber because of the cost of burying lines to remote locations. The cost for fixed wireless is about $2,200 per location.
Advocates say Nebraska missed golden opportunity to expand rural broadband

Because Nebraska had excess funds, it was able to propose awarding money for broadband at 54 so-called “community anchor institutions,” such as fire halls, hospitals and nursing homes. But advocates said the 54 were short of how many such institutions could have been served.
Haggerty, who previously worked in the fiber industry, vouched for the other forms of technology that can be used to establish broadband internet connections. Though most of the methods are newer than fiber, he said they are competitive both from a market and technological perspective.
Multiple committee members shared frustrations about the updated NTIA guidance and potential loss of federal funds, saying that they often hear complaints from their constituents about the lacking quality of their internet service.
Pillen’s statement said his administration is advocating for Nebraska to retain its unspent BEAD funds. Haggerty told the committee his office is “fighting like heck” to make that happen. A Pillen spokeswoman said the state hopes to hear around the end of the year whether it will be able to access those funds.
State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln questioned what the remaining funds could be used for if Nebraska is able to keep it. Haggerty said his office kept alternate ideas broad in the state’s federal proposal but listed investment opportunities like precision agriculture and artificial intelligence.
Pillen vouched for similar measures in his statement.

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — The Omaha Inland Port Authority likely will get $2.3 million of the $11 million it expected from state coffers to boost its plans for housing and entrepreneurial programs, officials said Thursday.
The port authority, formed to spur and oversee economic development in a disenfranchised area of northeast Omaha, has been pressing state officials to release $11 million in state interest funds the port authority believed it was due under a previously passed state law.
Representatives of the port authority met Wednesday with new State Treasurer Joey Spellerberg. His predecessor, Tom Briese, had held up release of the funds, saying that a release at that time would not be “prudent” as the relevant law was vague.

Spellerberg, who just weeks ago assumed the treasurer post, said he had a positive and productive meeting with port authority officials. By then he had a better understanding of the issue and relayed that $2.3 million would be made available to the port authority once the group reapplied for the funds.
Neil Sullivan, state budget administrator, said that after the end of fiscal year 2025 reconciliation, the interest amounts in the applicable fund and available to the port authority was $2.3 million.
“It’s frustrating,” State Sen. Terrell McKinney of North Omaha, who also heads the nine-member mayoral-appointed port authority board, said in an interview after the group’s monthly meeting. 
At this point, he said, the port authority will reapply for the smaller amount but look into how it might still claim the larger amount of interest money the group believed it was due.
He said the housing and entrepreneurial efforts that the money is to be used for will move forward, perhaps in a modified way. 
The port authority oversees a separate $120 million investment from the state for a business park and an innovation district to be developed within the port authority boundaries.

Harris' House seat will soon be open, as he is moving up to the Senate, and Long may have competition for his seat next year. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)If you’re keeping score in legislative District 27, we hope you’re using a pencil and not a permanent marker.
The shakeup began when Democratic Sen. Michael Jackson left his seat to become superintendent of the Maryland State Police on Nov. 12, opening the Senate seat in the district that sprawls over Prince George’s, Charles and Calvert counties. A race between District 27A Del. Kevin Harris, District 27B Del. Jeffrie Long Jr. and District 27C resident Jason Fowler ended last week after the Democratic central committees for all three counties settled on Harris as their Senate nominee.
That means a new delegate for District 27A, representing Charles and Prince George’s counties, will need to selected. But Rachel Jones could stir things up even more.
Jones, who held the District 27B (Calvert and Prince George’s) before being unseated by Long in the 2022 primary election is looking f0r a rematch. Jones, who turns 41 on Dec. 18, will make a formal announcement Saturday, supported by Harris and by Del. Adrian Boafo (D-Prince George’s).
Former Del. Rachel Jones.
“I’m going to be 1,000% behind her. I’ve been in meetings with her in Calvert and Prince George’s and I’ve seen how she just delivers for her community,” Boafo said Thursday. “You need a representative who knows how to be a consensus builder in that district, and frankly that’s Rachel Jones.”
Jones, who currently works as government relations director for the Maryland Department of Agriculture, would give up that job if elected. She says her legislative priorities include protecting civil rights for all Marylanders, economic development and environment and agricultural policy.
Education is also a priority, with a personal connection: Her husband is a middle school teacher in Anne Arundel County.
“I have a passion for public service. I don’t take that lightly,” she said Thursday. “I don’t see no reason not to pursue what I know I’m good at and have a passion for just because someone else is in the seat.”
Before she arrived in Annapolis, Jones worked as a legislative aide to former state Sen. Nathaniel McFadden (D-Baltimore City), as a field representative and assistant to former U.S. Sen. Barbara Milkulski (D-Md.), and a field representative to former U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.).
While in Annapolis, Jones sponsored legislation in 2022 that would have required the Motor Vehicle Administration to include a notation on identification cards that a person had a disability. That initiative became law this year, named after Eric Carpenter-Grantham, that requires the MVA to add a butterfly logo above the words “hidden disability” on ID cards for those who request it.
Michael Bennett, a Coast Guard veteran and founder of Bennett Global Strategies, filed for the District 27B seat in September, but says that if Jones get in the race, “I will be withdrawing my candidacy application and throwing all my support and finances behind her. That’s how serious I am about Rachel.”
Vince Schiraldi is returning…
… to New York, where he will serve on one of the many transition committees set up by New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.
Where did you think we meant?
Not Maryland, where Schiraldi spent several tumultuous years as secretary of Juvenile Services before resigning in June — or being encouraged to leave, according to the Moore administration at the time. Maryland Republicans, in particular, had long called for Schiraldi’s ouster, pointing to staff shortages, high rates of recidivism among youths released from the department’s care and high-profile shootings by juveniles who had been in the system, among other issues.

But Schiraldi, who was appointed to the job when Gov. Wes Moore was sworn in, said at the time of his departure that he was pleased with the department’s progress, noting gains in staffing and the success of a program aimed at gun-violence prevention, among others. When he left Maryland, Schiraldi said he planned to do some fishing and hiking while he figured out his next act.
Now comes word, first reported by the Baltimore Sun, that Schiraldi was one of more than 400 people appointed to 17 transition committees by Mamdani, the income democratic socialist mayor. Schiraldi was one of 20 people named to the Committee on the Criminal Legal System. He did not respond to a request for comment, but posted on his Linkedin profile that he was “honored” to be on the committee, where he will be “working alongside a stellar group of criminal justice leaders.”
Schiraldi is no stranger to New York. He previously worked as a senior criminal justice adviser to former New York Mayor Bill De Blasio (D) and was a leader of the New York City Department of Corrections, during which he tried to close the notorious Rikers Island jail complex and end solitary confinement. He also worked as a senior researcher at the Columbia School of Social Work in New York and, immediately before Maryland, was director of the Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services in Washington, D.C..
They are the Champions, my friend
The Chesapeake Conservancy last week announced its three newest Champions of the Chesapeake, the organization’s award to honor those “whose accomplishments have significantly advanced the protection and restoration of the Chesapeake Bay’s natural and cultural resources.”

The 2025 Champions include former National Park Service Director Robert G. “Bob” Stanton, who got the Lifetime Achievement Award; Maryland conservation advocate Ann Holmes Jones, honored as a Land Preservation Leader; and Lysle S. Sherwin, an advocate more than 50 years in wildlife conservation and watershed restoration, named a Watershed Stewardship Leader.
“From leading the National Park Service and ensuring the nation’s history is shared with future generations to protecting thousands of acres and restoring damaged waterways, these Champions prove how creative, committed and collaborative people can make a real difference for the Bay,” said Chesapeake Conservancy CEO Susan Shingledecker in a prepared statement. “Their decades of service inspire us and give hope for a healthier, more resilient Chesapeake in the years ahead.”
Stanton, the 15th director of the National Park Service and a former member of the Chesapeake Conservancy Board of Directors, has played a central role in national efforts to protect the Chesapeake Bay, in addition to decades of leadership in conservation, historic preservation and public service. The conservancy said he has also served with the National Parks Conservation Association, the Student Conservation Association and the Rosenwald Schools Park Campaign, among others.

Jones was recognized for more than four decades of leadership in land preservation and her advocacy for Maryland’s Program Open Space, monitoring and working with others to ensure full support for the program, which creates local and state parks, helps protect important habitat and preserve agricultural lands. A private consultant since 1987, Jones currently administers the Piney Run Rural Legacy Program in Baltimore County, a $48 million purchased easement program that has protected more than 8,700 acres, according to the conservancy release.
Sherwin, a retired Penn State University educator and former director of the Center for Watershed Stewardship, has led academic, nonprofit and federal initiatives to restore streams, protect wildlife habitat and improve water quality across the Chesapeake Bay watershed, the conservancy said. It said he works today as an affiliate biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Partners Program, working with private landowners to enhance wildlife habitat and improve water quality in impaired streams.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Ron Halber, the CEO of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington, have been trading barbs this week over their respective positions on Israel, a debate that has now spilled over into other organizations.
It began Wednesday, when Halber said Van Hollen has “dramatically lost his way” on Israel — a remark that led Van Hollen’s office to fire back that Halber has become “an apologist” for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Halber, speaking with reporters after the JCRC’s Lox and Legislators breakfast, defended two of the lawmakers who spoke at the event, Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) and Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th), even though both had taken votes critical of Israel. But he then volunteered that Van Hollen has “become the leading senator agitating against Israel in the U.S. Senate.”
“It’s almost like he cannot wait for the next opportunity to jump down Israel’s throat,” said Halber, who said Van Hollen’s statements and social media postings are “filled with a lack of empathy for Israel’s strategic position.”
“I’m very upset about it, as are many people in this room,” Halber said. “Because that’s not the Sen. Van Hollen that so many people in this room worked hard to get elected. He’s really hurt himself with the Jewish community.”

Van Hollen’s office responded, in an exchange first reported Thursday by Jewish Insider, that the senator “holds our friends and our adversaries to the same standards. That’s why he continues to support the people of Israel, but the actions of the Netanyahu Government have increasingly not aligned with our values.” the spokesperson said in a statement.
The statement said Van Hollen has met with families of Hamas victims and “often speaks with Marylanders who hold varying perspectives here … Instead of representing the diversity of views that, in the Senator’s experience, are held by the Jewish community of Maryland, Ron Halber has become an apologist for the Netanyahu government.”
Halber said Thursday that he can handle criticism, but the Van Hollen comments were “a punch I didn’t see coming.”
“Nobody’s telling Chris he needs to be a cheerleader for Israel,” Halber said. “I just asked him to be a little bit more empathetic, more balanced.”
He rejected the suggestion that he’s not hearing a diversity of views from the community, noting that more than 100 institutions are affiliated with JCRC and they span the political spectrum.
Van Hollen’s office declined further comment Thursday, referring back to their Wednesday statement. But that didn’t stop others from weighing in.
The JCRC’s executive committee decried what it called “undignified, unwarranted and untrue” attacks on Halber, and linked to other statements of support like the Jewish Federation of Greater Washington. It said in a Facebook post that at a “time of extreme divisiveness in our society, our public officials should not be contributing to these divides through personal attacks.”
Hadar Susskind, president and CEO of the progressive New Jewish Narrative, defended Van Hollen in a series of social media posts that said the senator has always been there for his Jewish constituents and the people of Israel. But if he disagrees with Israeli policy, “he is 100% right to do so and to say so.”
For his part, Halber said he expects JCRC and Van Hollen’s office to continue to work together on issues of mutual interest, but, “We’ll agree to disagree, I suspect.”

(Maps data: Google, Airbus, CNES/Airbus, Landsat/Copernicus, Maxar Technologies)The massive Red Dog mine is grappling with a problem that’s spreading across the Arctic: thawing permafrost.
A glimpse of the mine’s challenges emerged in 2020, when its operator said efforts to address thaw-related impacts to wastewater management were costing some $19 million.
Five years later, permafrost is still thawing, and Red Dog’s problems appear to be getting more expensive. The mine’s operator, Teck Resources, now says permanent solutions could take a decade to develop and cost hundreds of millions of dollars, according to newly released permitting documents.
The problems stem from one of the more aesthetically jarring signs of climate change: Arctic streams are turning orange as thawing permafrost releases minerals once trapped in frozen ground.
The phenomenon, known as river rusting, is occurring across the Arctic, and scientists say it’s accelerated by global warming. It looks just like acid runoff from poorly managed mines — but it’s not caused by mining.
Nonetheless, it’s causing trouble for Red Dog. And it’s a potential preview of new obstacles to resource development more broadly in Alaska, as the Arctic warms three or four times faster than the rest of the planet.
Red Dog pumps treated wastewater into a nearby creek when levels of dissolved particles downstream are below specific limits set by state regulators. As permafrost thaw has accelerated in recent years, those levels have surged beyond the limits — even though levels in the mine’s discharge haven’t changed.
Regulators had temporarily adjusted Red Dog’s permit to allow the mine to keep discharging treated water while its operator studied long-term solutions.
But that temporary approval is set to expire soon. And Teck is now saying it could be forced to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on additional studies and upgrades over the next decade to return to compliance.
Such investments would come at a critical time for Red Dog.
The mine is set to run out of ore by 2032 if it doesn’t develop new deposits that it’s studying nearby. Teck, meanwhile, is in the middle of a pending merger deal with another major mining firm, Anglo American.
The permafrost-related challenges could pose an expensive complication for Red Dog: One idea Teck is considering is a wastewater pipeline that would run some 50 miles from the mine to the ocean. It could cost $279 million, according to Teck — more than half of the company’s gross profit from Red Dog last year.
The mine has invested “plenty of money and plenty of effort” to address the issue, said Tim Pilon, a regulator at the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, which oversees Red Dog’s discharge permit.
“Their livelihood is at risk here,” he added.
Orange creeks “all over”
Scientists are still working to understand what, exactly, is making Arctic rivers turn orange. But a basic theory is that thawing permafrost releases water and other particles and minerals, which can create acid through chemical reactions. The acid, in turn, can leach metals, like iron, into streams.
In a paper published last year, researchers identified dozens of affected streams across Alaska’s Brooks Range.
Some of the creeks around Red Dog, at the western edge of the range, have long contained high naturally occurring levels of minerals, given their proximity to the mine’s zinc and lead deposit. But scientists started noticing stark changes six or seven years ago.
Some creeks “went from clear one year to very turbid and orange and kind of milky the following year,” said Chelsea Clawson, a biologist with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game who surveys streams near Red Dog each year.

“These changes are happening upstream of any particular mine influence as well as downstream — just kind of all over,” she added. “So it’s very clearly not being caused by the mine and the associated development.”
The rusting near Red Dog is just one example of how climate change is affecting infrastructure across the Arctic.
Thawing permafrost could cause as much as $51 billion in infrastructure damage in Alaska over the next four decades, scientists calculated in a paper published earlier this year in a Nature journal.
That figure is likely an underestimate, too: It excluded projected impacts to the oil and mining industries and from rusting rivers and streams, according to one of the paper’s authors, Anna Liljedahl.
“The assumption that things are going to function the way they have is not always a solid approach,” said Liljedahl, a Homer-based permafrost scientist who works with the Woodwell Climate Research Center.
The challenges at Red Dog show that permafrost thaw can affect infrastructure in unexpected or indirect ways, Liljedahl added.
Any impacts to Red Dog could be significant for the region: It’s one of the largest zinc mines in the world and an economic engine in Northwest Alaska, where high-paying work can be hard to find. The mine employs hundreds of people and accounts for more than 80% of the borough government’s revenue.
And it sits on land owned by the region’s Alaska Native corporation, NANA, which collects substantial royalty payments from Teck and shares a large portion of profits from Red Dog with Alaska Native corporations across the state.
A threatened waste pond
To prevent pollution, Red Dog collects water that comes into contact with the site and diverts it into a large pond, where other waste from processing ore, known as tailings, is also stored.
The mine then treats the water with lime and other compounds to get rid of potentially toxic metals and to balance acidity, and pipes the treated stuff into nearby Red Dog Creek.
A Clean Water Act permit regulates Red Dog’s discharge based in part on levels of dissolved particles in Red Dog Creek and a larger stream that it flows into, Ikalukrok Creek.
In 2019, thawing permafrost began boosting those levels beyond permit limits, hampering the mine’s ability to release water.

That caused a backup in the tailings pond, which was compounded by another symptom of climate change: increased precipitation
As global weather patterns shift, Red Dog has reported several years over the past decade with rain and snowfall above historic averages. Since heavy rain can cause the tailings pond to swell quickly, Teck has said relying on the reservoir to store excess water is an “increasingly risky strategy.”
Between 2017 and 2021, the volume of wastewater stored in the pond increased by some 60%, or 2 billion gallons, according to permitting documents.
In 2021, as the creeks’ rusting limited Red Dog’s discharge and the waste pond neared capacity, state regulators temporarily modified Teck’s permit. The move effectively allowed the company to continue discharging with a cap on the amount of dissolved particles in the treated mine water — even as natural levels in the creeks remained high.
That modification expires next year. Teck, in a request to regulators released by the state earlier this month, said it needs a 10-year extension to maintain “safe water management,” while it studies permanent solutions.
The capacity of Red Dog’s tailings pond “will be threatened again,” the company said, unless it can continue releasing water.
State regulators earlier this month proposed granting the extension. Doing so, they said in a recent notice, “prevents an increased discharge of any pollutants” and “ensures safe operation” of the tailings pond and the dam holding it back.
“The last thing anybody wants is for that dam to overtop,” said Pilon, with the Department of Environmental Conservation.
A “unique situation”
Teck is considering several possible responses to its wastewater predicament.
Among the priciest is the pipeline, which could carry treated wastewater to Red Dog’s mineral shipping port on the Chukchi Sea, more than 50 miles to the southwest.
Teck studied a similar concept more than a decade ago as part of a legal settlementwith several residents of the Iñupiaq village of Kivalina, downstream of the mine. Community leaders there have long worried about Red Dog’s wastewater affecting drinking water and fish.

Teck ultimately chose, in 2014, not to move forward with the pipeline, saying its benefits would be limited.
The company says it’s now revisiting the idea. But it’s also looking at other options to return to permit compliance, like proposing changes to permit regulations.
The company says it plan to study several possible upgrades at the mine, including expanded use of reverse osmosis, a filtration method that could reduce the amount of dissolved particles in the treated water that the mine pumps out.
If Teck gets renewed approval from the state and continues to discharge into Red Dog Creek, current data suggest it’s unlikely to significantly diminish the water quality downstream, since upstream levels are already high, according to Srijan Aggarwal, a professor and environmental engineer at University of Alaska Fairbanks.  The treated mine water has lower levels of metals than some of the rusting creeks, he noted.
Aggarwal said Teck’s request for an extension “seems reasonable” under the circumstances.
“It’s a very unique situation,” he added.
Some scientists say that Red Dog’s treated wastewater might even dilute the mineral-rich creek water and benefit fish, which biologists say are avoiding some of the rusting areas.
“The discharge — which is very clean water, without metals in it — is actually improving the water quality,” said Clawson, the state biologist.
Tribal leaders from Kivalina declined to comment on Teck’s request for an extension, saying they are still studying it.
Teck officials also declined an interview request. In an email, a corporate spokesperson, Dale Steeves, called Teck’s existing permit modification “minor” and said “there is no risk to human or aquatic health downstream of Red Dog” in relation to it.
“More work is needed to identify a permanent solution,” Steeves said.
The company’s “overall goal” still is to extend the mine’s life, he said.
Teck received a key federal approval late last year to build an access road to the new deposits that could keep Red Dog operating past 2032.
But the company is still studying whether they’d be profitable to dig up, and it says active mining there is several years away.

Miller said he appreciated Ware as a political colleague and that he would have “big shoes to fill” while completing her unexpired term in the 25th District.
“Silas Miller is a forward-thinking leader who brings a wealth of life and legislative experience to the table,” said Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes, a Johnson County Democrat. “We’re grateful that he has decided to step into the Senate chamber in this new capacity.”
Miller serves on the House education, election and insurance committees. He’s been the ranking Democrat on the House Federal and State Affairs Committee. In 2024, Miller proposed an unsuccessful amendment to a bill that would have removed cannabis from a list of illegal drugs in Kansas.
Ware, a retail store owner, announced her decision to resign Nov. 13. In 2018, she replaced Sen. Lynn Rogers in a precinct committee election. Rogers had stepped down after elected lieutenant governor on a ticket with Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly.
Ware was elected to a full term in the Senate during 2020 and reelected 2024. Last November, she carried the district with 57% of the vote against Republican Keenen Smith. She served on tax, commerce and agriculture committees in the Senate.
“While my time in the Senate is at an end, I will remain an involved private citizen and an advocate for the people of Wichita in this next era of my life,” Ware said.
Kristi Kirk, chair of the Sedgwick County Democratic Party, said Ware was known for her involvement with the community and as a unifying force in the Democratic Party.
“Mary could always be counted on to support not only her constituents, but was a champion for creating a full and safe future for Kansas children since joining the Senate,” Kirk said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/P2130946-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-04 21:57:06.263480

Bob Ferguson has approved a 1,300-acre solar farm in south-central Washington, calling the project a “win for our state.”
The Carriger Solar project in Klickitat County is expected to generate enough power for thousands of homes. Ferguson informed the Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council on Tuesday that he was giving it the go-ahead. This is the first large-scale energy project Ferguson has acted on since taking office.
“Building more clean energy will provide affordable, carbon-free electricity to Washingtonians, create much needed construction jobs, boost economic development and keep our air clean,” Ferguson, a first-term Democrat, said in a statement.
Ferguson’s decision isn’t a surprise. When he turned down the council’s initial recommendation to proceed with the Carriger project in August, he made clear that he viewed the undertaking as “consistent with state policies.” 
And he stressed the importance of moving swiftly so developers could secure federal clean energy tax credits before they are ended by the Trump administration. Solar and wind projects must begin construction by July 4, 2026 to fully qualify for the credits.
But Ferguson told the council to talk further with Yakama Nation leaders about their concerns that protections for cultural resources were not strict enough. 
What emerged was the revised site certification agreement inked by Ferguson. It requires the developers provide $100,000 in one-time grant funding to the Yakama Nation Cultural Resources Program once the project is operational. Tribal access to traditional and cultural properties must be maintained during construction.
Even with the grant funding, the tribe remained opposed to the project, state officials said.
Ferguson, in his Dec. 2 letter to the Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council, said the final agreement “balances the need for affordable clean energy with mitigation requirements that protect Washington’s environment.”
He also reiterated the urgency of acting to take advantage of the federal credits.
“Our state already faces real challenges in building renewable electricity, and we now contend  with a federal government that is hostile to renewable electricity development,” he wrote. “All of these elements factored into my decision.”

Cypress Creek Renewables, based in Santa Monica, California, plans to build the solar farm north of State Route 142 along Knight Road, about two miles west of Goldendale in unincorporated Klickitat County. The firm applied for state approval for the project in February 2023.
The company is “grateful” for Ferguson’s support, a spokesperson said Thursday.
“We are proud to play a role in advancing the state’s clean energy goals,” Angeli Chandler, Cypress Creek’s director of communications, said in an email.
“We are moving with urgency to ensure we retain federal tax treatment, which is critical to keeping this project on track,” she said. The project is expected to begin delivering power in the summer of 2028, she said.
When completed, Carriger Solar will have 160 megawatts of solar generating potential, enough to power up to 32,500 homes, according to the company’s website. The project, which also includes a 63 megawatt battery energy storage system, will tie into the Bonneville Power Administration transmission system.

Jim Himes said, “what I saw in that room was one of the most troubling things I've seen in my time in public service.”","A Navy admiral commanding the U.S. military strikes on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean told lawmakers Thursday that there was no “kill them all” order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, but a stark video of the attack left grave questions as Congress scrutinizes the campaign that killed two survivors.
Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley appeared for a series of closed-door classified briefings at the Capitol as lawmakers conduct an investigation after a report that he ordered the follow-on attack that killed the survivors to comply with Hegesth’s demands. Legal experts have said such a strike could be a violation of the laws of military warfare.
“Bradley was very clear that he was given no such order, to give no quarter or to kill them all,” said Sen. Tom Cotton, who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee, as he exited a classified briefing.
While Cotton, R-Ark., defended the attack, Democrats who were also briefed and saw video of the survivors being killed questioned the Trump administration’s rationale and said the incident was deeply concerning.
“The order was basically: Destroy the drugs, kill the 11 people on the boat,” said Washington Rep. Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee.
Smith, who is demanding further investigation, said the survivors were “basically two shirtless people clinging to the bow of a capsized and inoperable boat, drifting in the water — until the missiles come and kill them.”
The classified sessions with Bradley, alongside the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine, provided fresh information at a crucial moment as Hegseth’s leadership comes under scrutiny. But they did little to resolve growing questions about the legal basis for President Donald Trump’s extraordinary campaign to use war powers against suspected drug smugglers. So far more than 80 people have been killed in some 20 strikes.
Late Thursday, U.S. Southern Command announced it had conducted another strike against a small boat in the eastern Pacific Ocean following a pause of almost three weeks. There were four casualties, according to the social media post.
Lawmakers have not yet specifically authorized the use of military force against the alleged drug boats, and the Republican-controlled Congress has turned back attempts to put a check on Trump’s power to engage in the missile campaign, which Hegseth has vowed will continue. Several Democrats have called for Hegseth to resign.
Congressional investigation gets underway
Lawmakers want a full accounting of the Sept. 2 strike, which was the first in what has become a monthslong series of U.S. military attacks on vessels near Venezuela believed to be ferrying drugs. The Washington Post had reported that Bradley ordered the follow-on attack on the survivors.
But lawmakers who lead the House and Senate’s national security committees in Congress came away with different descriptions of what the two survivors were doing when they were killed.
Cotton said he saw them “trying to flip a boat loaded with drugs bound for United States back over so they could stay in the fight.”
He said there were “several minutes” between the first and second attacks, which consisted of four missile strikes. He said it was “gratifying” that the U.S. military was taking “the battle” to cartels.
But Connecticut Rep. Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said, “what I saw in that room was one of the most troubling things I’ve seen in my time in public service.”
“You have two individuals in clear distress, without any means of locomotion, with a destroyed vessel,” he said, and who “were killed by the United States.”
The survivors did not issue any distress call or other communications, though lawmakers were told it appeared the people had a hand raised, “waving” at one point during the attacks, Smith said.
Smith acknowledged there was likely cocaine on the boat, but he objects to the Republican administration’s rationale for continued attacks on alleged drug runners who may or may not be heading to the United States. “That’s really the core of the problem with all of this,” he said. “That incredibly broad definition, I think, is what sets in motion all of these problems about using lethal force and using the military.”
Who is Adm. Bradley?
At the time of the attack, Bradley was the commander of Joint Special Operations Command, overseeing coordinated operations between the military’s elite special operations units out of Fort Bragg in North Carolina. About a month after the strike, he was promoted to commander of U.S. Special Operations Command.
His military career, spanning more than three decades, was mostly spent serving in the elite Navy SEALs and commanding joint operations. He was among the first special forces officers to deploy to Afghanistan after the Sept. 11 attacks. His latest promotion to admiral was approved by unanimous voice vote in the Senate this year, and Democratic and Republican senators praised his record.
Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., has described Bradley as among those who are “rock solid” and “the most extraordinary people that have ever served in the military.”
But lawmakers like Tillis have also made it clear they expect a reckoning if it is found that survivors were targeted. “Anybody in the chain of command that was responsible for it, that had vision of it, needs to be held accountable,” he said.
What else are lawmakers seeking?
Underpinning Trump’s campaign against suspected traffickers is his argument that drug cartels amount to armed combatants because their cargo poses a threat to American lives.
Democrats are demanding the release of the full video of the Sept. 2 attack, as well as written records of the orders and any directives about the mission from Hegseth. None of the written orders or audio of verbal commands was shared with the lawmakers.
A White House Office of Legal Counsel memo providing a rationale for the strikes was dated after the fact, on Sept. 5. That memo remains undisclosed, and Democrats want it released.
Obtaining further information, though, will largely depend on action from Republican lawmakers, who have majority control of the committees, a potentially painful prospect for them if it puts them at odds with the president.
Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said that he and the Senate Armed Services Committee chair, GOP Sen. Roger Wicker, have formally requested the executive orders authorizing the operations and the complete videos from the strikes, among other items. The Trump administration has repeatedly denied their requests for basic information about the operation, Reed said.
Republican lawmakers who are close to Trump have largely stood by Hegseth and the administration’s decision to conduct the strikes.
Elsewhere, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and others see the U.S. military operation as part of an effort to prompt a government change in the South American country. Maduro on Wednesday acknowledged speaking last month by phone with Trump, who confirmed the call days earlier.

(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)RAPID CITY — No other place in the world incarcerates women at a higher rate than South Dakota, according to research by a prison-focused nonprofit, and the construction of a second women’s prison in the state could be viewed as a continuation of that trend.
The new leader of the state’s prison system said Thursday it’s the start of a turnaround.
“It’s not going to show overnight,” said Nick Lamb, “but it will show in a few years. You’ll see a substantial decrease.”

 The location of a women’s prison under construction in Rapid City.

The staff and space devoted to programming in the Rapid City women’s prison will help inmates turn their lives around, Lamb said. A task force on rehabilitation appointed by the governor is also developing ideas to help people stay out of trouble after their release.
Lamb began working as secretary of the Department of Corrections last month after his appointment by Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden. Lamb succeeded Kellie Wasko, who resigned after three and a half years in the job.
During a press conference at the construction site of the new women’s prison in northeast Rapid City, South Dakota Searchlight asked Lamb and Rhoden about a September report by the Prison Policy Initiative. It said South Dakota incarcerates 338 of every 100,000 women in the state, which is the highest rate in the nation and would be the highest in the world if South Dakota was a country.
Lamb’s prediction that the rate will come down was the only response to the question. Neither he nor Rhoden disputed the report’s findings.
In prepared remarks, Rhoden said 51% of imprisoned women in South Dakota have drug convictions, and more than 90% have substance use disorders. He was referring to incarcerated women in Pierre, where the state has a women’s prison that will continue to operate and a minimum-security facility that will close after the Rapid City prison opens. The state also contracts for extra space in the Hughes County Jail. The combined female inmate population among those three locations was 543 as of Thursday.
South Dakota locks up women at a higher rate than any other state, report says

The Rapid City prison, designed for minimum and medium-security inmates, will house up to 300 women.
“This is an area we have to do better,” Rhoden said, “and this facility will allow us to.”
The state is paying $87 million to construct the Rapid City prison, which is scheduled to open in July. Rhoden is asking lawmakers to budget $13 million for its first year of operations, plus $2.4 million in one-time funding for staff training.
The facility will need 139 employees, including 96 for security, 23 for health care and 20 for education, programming and administration.
One of the buildings on the campus will have space for services including a kitchen and laundry, and programming including behavioral health services, classes and spiritual activities. There are three housing units, plus a unit containing 12 beds for mothers with babies. Another building will house administrators and a visitation area.

But the truth is that both liberals and conservatives are failing our children. The village has eroded—and parents are being left to figure it out alone.,"AN OLD AFRICAN proverb says: “It takes a village to raise a child.” Yet America’s public education system is drifting away from shared responsibility. Federal policies and state reforms are shifting us from collective accountability to individual survival. Oversight of special education is weakening, graduation requirements are loosening, and student performance has fallen to historic lows.  
It’s tempting to blame one side of partisan politics. But the truth is that both liberals and conservatives are failing our children. The village has eroded—and parents are being left to figure it out alone.  
For decades, the federal government protected students with disabilities through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services once served as a vital safeguard, ensuring every child had access to a free and appropriate public education. Now, staff cuts and potential transfers of oversight threaten that protection.  
To most, this might seem like just another headline from the Trump administration. But for families, it means those with resources will hire tutors or lawyers, while those without will lose out. At the same time, states are lowering expectations at the other end of the academic spectrum.  
In 2024, Massachusetts joined others in eliminating the requirement that students pass a standardized test to graduate. For over two decades, the MCAS served as a baseline for college or workforce readiness. Supporters say its removal promotes equity and reduces test anxiety; critics argue it devalues the diploma. Both reveal the same truth: The meaning of academic mastery is shifting.  
Parents can no longer assume that graduation equals readiness. The data confirm the crisis. The National Assessment of Educational Progress—the nation’s report card—shows only about one-third of fourth graders read at or above grade level. Math scores have dropped to their lowest levels in decades, particularly among middle and high school students.  
Behind those numbers are real children—students who will apply to college, seek employment, and navigate a world where literacy and numeracy determine opportunity. When young people cannot read fluently or think mathematically, their futures narrow before they begin.  
To be fair, Massachusetts is trying to respond. The House of Representatives recently passed a bill requiring evidence-based literacy instruction, and the K–12 Statewide Graduation Council, on which I serve as a member, has developed recommendations for new graduation standards to replace MCAS.  
Yet the uncomfortable reality remains: Parents cannot wait for systems to stabilize. The landscape has shifted, and families must act now to keep children on track.  
Start by engaging directly with your child’s education. Request concrete data on reading and math progress—fluency rates, writing samples, and problem-solving skills—not just report cards. If your child has an IEP or 504 plan, ensure services are delivered on time and are effective. Document everything.  
With federal oversight shrinking, parental vigilance becomes the new enforcement mechanism. In short, parents must rebuild the village from the ground up.  
If federal and state agencies retreat, local families and communities must fill the void. Trusting systems without demanding accountability has never worked—and the data prove it. When states loosen standards or districts cut back on progress monitoring, parents must ask:  
• How are schools ensuring literacy and math proficiency?  • What evidence-based curricula are being used?• How is progress being measured and reported?  
The stakes could not be higher. As government guardrails weaken, families must step in as stabilizers. Parents are not powerless. Our voices, questions, and insistence on excellence are the new infrastructure of accountability. When institutions falter, families must anchor. As oversight fades, advocacy must rise. 
In the end, children should not be simply socially promoted through school. They need skills, knowledge, and hope. Amid shifting systems, the parental voice remains their strongest protection.

Burt Jones’ $10 million loan to his gubernatorial campaign didn’t violate the law, the Georgia State Ethics Commission ruled on Thursday, effectively putting an end to a legal fight from rival Republican gubernatorial candidate Attorney General Chris Carr
Jones made the loan through a financial structure called a leadership committee, which was created by a 2021 state law. 
As lieutenant governor, Jones is one of a handful of legislative leaders who can form such a committee, which is allowed to collect unlimited contributions and raise cash during the annual legislative session, unlike the regulated limits of a standard campaign committee. Carr, as attorney general, does not have access to this powerful fundraising tool.
The commission’s position was that a personal loan from a candidate to a leadership committee is permitted because when the loan is repaid by the leadership committee, the candidate is simply receiving their own personal funds back, meaning no excessive or illegal contribution has occurred. The commission also stated that this analysis does not change if funds are loaned to the candidate committee during a primary election.
“The money in this scenario is, and always has been, the candidate’s personal funds, so there’s no liability for a candidate to loan the money,” said Steve Knittle, the commission’s deputy director and general counsel.

Carr and Jones, along with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, are set to face off in the May primaries for the Republican nomination.
This advisory opinion follows an earlier, separate ruling in which the Ethics Commission declined to investigate a complaint filed by Carr’s team regarding the source of a $10 million loan Jones made to his campaign in 2022, according to a July report from the Associated Press.
Carr’s campaign had questioned how Jones, whose 2022 financial disclosure showed a net worth of $12.4 million but only $700,000 in cash and securities, could instantly produce $10 million in cash. The complaint suggested Jones may have falsely reported his finances or the source of the cash.
Carr also filed a complaint in federal court, but U.S. District Court Judge Victoria Marie Calvert dismissed the case in August due to lack of standing, according to a Capitol Beat report.
Julia Mazzone, a spokesperson for Carr’s campaign, said the advisory opinion “raises more questions than it answers.”
“It’s troubling that the commission shows no interest in understanding how Burt Jones went from claiming a net worth of $700,000 to loaning himself $10 million. As governor, Chris Carr will bring true reform to address public corruption,” Mazzone said in a statement.
The Jones’ campaign did not address the commission’s opinion, instead taking a jab at the Carr campaign with a previously given statement.

(Photo: Wes Muller/LA Illuminator)Louisiana leaders have recently touted a string of major industrial projects with the promise of creating thousands of jobs, but critics say these business negotiations lack transparency and pose great risk to the health and prosperity of the communities where this investment is taking shape. 
They also believe state officials have shut them out of trade deals with businesses that stand to benefit far more than them.      
The critics included residents and community activists from across Louisiana who spoke out Wednesday at a state agency hearing, where they asked officials to stop secretly brokering trade deals that give taxpayer money to large industrial companies. 
Numbering around a dozen, the group aired their concerns at a Louisiana Economic Development rules hearing, which are normally sparsely-attended and mundane bureaucratic processes with just two staff members there to record public comments.  
Louisiana Economic Development had published a notice on Oct. 20 stating that it planned to “hold a public hearing for the purpose of receiving comments on any rule of the agency.” The notice contained no further details about the reason for the hearing and didn’t specify which rules the agency is reviewing. Staff members did not discuss any particular rules at the hearing.
The residents and activists — which included members of community and environmental groups such as the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, Rural Roots Louisiana, the Descendants Project, Inclusive Louisiana and Fishermen Involved in Sustaining Our Heritage — used the hearing as an opportunity to air a variety of complaints about the impacts industrial expansion has had on their neighborhoods. They all signed a letter that summarized their complaints and then took turns speaking at the hearing. 
In their letter submitted to Louisiana Economic Development, the group criticized the hearing notice as “vague” and wrote that it provided “no meaningful notice of what the agency is considering.”
They wrote and testified that the notice appeared to be part of a pattern of secrecy at the agency to fast-track industrial expansion in the state. They pointed to Gov. Jeff Landry’s Sept. 16 executive order, which he dubbed the “Louisiana Lightning Speed Initiative.” It directs Louisiana to push state agencies to fast-track permitting and regulatory processes to attract new businesses and spur industrial expansion, mentioning recent deals with Meta, Hyundai, Woodside Energy and CF Industries as examples.
In December 2024, the state announced that Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, was coming to Louisiana to build the world’s largest data center in Richland Parish. Construction of the facility began almost immediately.
Richland Parish residents Joe and Robin Williams also signed the letter submitted to LED. They live across the street from the Meta site and have reported rust-colored tap water and power outages at their home since construction activity began. 
While the rapidly approved Meta project came as a surprise to Williams and the public, a small circle of Louisiana politicians had known about it and kept it under wraps for nearly a year. Several top leaders — including the governor, House Speaker Phillip DeVillier, LED Secretary Susan Bourgeois and Revenue Secretary Richard Nelson — quietly collaborated with corporate executives and local officials on the project, holding closed-door talks and rewriting state laws for reasons they withheld from the public and most of the Louisiana Legislature. 
During the 2024 legislative session, Landry and DeVillier carried out plans to “hijack” another lawmaker’s bill, rewriting it in a way that would give a massive tax break to Meta without other legislators realizing it, as detailed in a Times-Picayune report. Bourgeois told the newspaper everyone involved in the negotiations signed “blank NDAs” (nondisclosure agreements) before the talks began. 
Louisiana Economic Development officials often sign nondisclosure agreements with local government leaders and corporate executives to keep negotiations secret. In a phone interview Thursday, Bourgeois said it’s a common practice at the agency whenever a company requests it. 
“It’s really just an industry standard,” Bourgeois said. “I understand there’s some people who don’t agree with it or like it, but go to any state and this is how it’s done.”
Companies often ask for the agreements so competitors don’t undercut or foil their plans, she said. For example, if a company knows about its rival’s plans to build at a certain location, they could rush to purchase the land out from under them, Bourgeois explained.
The Rev. Harry Joseph Sr., an Ascension Parish resident and church pastor, took part in Wednesday’s LED hearing. Speaking with the Illuminator before the meeting, he questioned the agency’s use of nondisclosure agreements and said his local elected officials routinely cite them as a reason they can’t answer questions about projects in his area.
“We elected them. We should be able to talk to them about anything,” Joseph said. “The secrecy has gotten out of hand. Enough is enough.”
Another example of secret negotiations, Joseph said, is the industrial RiverPlex MegaPark being built in the Modeste community of Ascension Parish. The area targeted for development had previously been zoned as a “conservation district” because it is “environmentally fragile” and lacked roads that can handle large traffic increases, according to the parish zoning code. Despite this, the state offered the MegaPark as a site for Hyundai’s new steel mill and two ammonia facilities.
Louisiana Economic Development signed nondisclosure agreements with Hyundai executives and Ascension Parish officials, preventing them from speaking about the projects, according to William Most, an attorney representing Rural Roots and the Louisiana Bucket Brigade. 
In an email, LED spokesperson Emma Wagner pushed back against the other criticisms lodged at Wednesday’s hearing, calling them part of an “ambush not based in the actual work of economic development” and job creation in Louisiana.
“This state has long suffered from a failure to diversify our economy,” Wagner wrote. “What we have done over the past 23 months is unprecedented and transformational economic growth that has finally turned the tide of losing our people.”  
State and local leaders have touted industrial expansion as a way to bring new jobs to economically depressed areas. In exchange for the jobs, the state and the parishes typically offer the companies lucrative tax breaks and grants.
Joy Banner, co-founder of the Descendants Project, called on the state to require objective data on job creation and wage claims before incentivizing companies with Louisiana tax dollars. 
Hyundai has said its steel mill will bring an estimated 1,300 jobs to Louisiana. In exchange, the state promised the company a $100 million grant and other incentives estimated to cost taxpayers $600 million, according to a Times-Picayune report. 
CF Industries estimates it will bring 103 new jobs to its proposed ammonia facility in Ascension Parish. In exchange, the state offered the company a $6 million grant for the proposed ammonia plant in Ascension Parish. The company is also expected to be exempt from paying most parish property taxes through the Industrial Tax Exemption Program and receive a payroll tax rebate from the state via the Quality Jobs program. 
In his Sept. 16 executive order, the governor pointed to low jobs numbers as the reason for his fast-tracking initiative while deflecting blame for Louisiana’s sluggish economy. He claimed the state lost 12,000 jobs from 2016-23. Although the figure is technically accurate, by framing the data between those years without context, Landry’s executive order implied his predecessor, Gov. John Bel Edwards, was responsible for the job losses. 
Louisiana actually gained about 7,000 jobs during Edwards’ first term and, like other states, suffered a sudden employment drop in March 2020 as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The state’s employment numbers rebounded during Edwards’ second term, though the job market didn’t fully recover to its pre-pandemic mark until this January.
Federal data shows Louisiana’s employment numbers under Landry have so far hovered around and slightly above peak figures during Edwards’ tenure at around 2 million jobs. The state has slowly but steadily added jobs from January 2024, when Landry took office, through at least August 2025. The jobs market has become murkier in recent months because the Bureau of Labor Statistics did not collect monthly employment data during the six week government shutdown that began Oct. 1. 
“I’m tired of hearing ‘jobs, jobs, jobs,’” Joseph told LED officials at Wednesday’s hearing. “We don’t get these jobs. They’re not for us.” 
Modeste resident Twila Collins, who works with Rural Roots, told the agency the jobs claims often don’t benefit long-time local residents. Instead, she said, they see the ill effects of heavy pollution that often comes with industrial facilities. 
Ascension Parish lies in an industrial corridor along the Mississippi River referred to as “Cancer Alley” for its high concentration of industrial pollution containing carcinogens. Scientific studies have linked cancer rates in its communities to the toxic pollution, though the state Department of Environmental Quality rejects such findings.
“I had to watch my child die in the same area,” Collins said at the hearing. In a later interview, she explained that her 9-year-old son, Denzel, died of an asthma attack more than two decades ago.  
Gramercy resident Gail LeBoeuf, who was diagnosed with liver cancer in 2022 and founded the activist group Inclusive Louisiana, told agency staff industrial expansion isn’t worth the risk it poses to the people. 
“Economic development has not happened for us,” LeBoeuf said. “These deals don’t do anything but give money back to the people that promised to bring economic development.” 
Anne Rolfes, executive director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, said the Louisiana Economic Development agency is “pretending” that Hyundai and CF Industries are the solutions to poverty. 
“This is destruction masquerading as economic development,” Rolfes said.
Wagner, the spokesperson for Louisiana Economic Development, said the Landry administration will “never apologize” for attracting jobs, wages and new opportunities to the state.
“The Governor and Secretary both firmly believe the absolute best way to lift people out of poverty is by giving them access to ever-growing wages,” Wagner said via email. “Anyone who would reject those opportunities clearly does not have the best interest of Louisiana citizens at heart.”

The substance of a revision ordered by the Trump administration remains under wraps, though changes will be confined to “special management areas.” It’s widely expected that the updated plans will deemphasize conservation.
The post BLM’s heated Rock Springs plan took 12 years to finish. Now the feds must redo it in one. appeared first on WyoFile .","ROCK SPRINGS—Two years ago, employees of the Bureau of Land Management’s Wyoming office encountered misinformation-fueled hysteria during public meetings about a conservation-heavy draft plan for managing a 3.6 million acre swath of southwest Wyoming.
Then, just nine months after the BLM’s especially controversial plan was finalized, the Trump administration ordered the agency to redo the process. On Wednesday, the BLM’s staff reconvened with the public in Sweetwater County’s largest city to hear what locals make of the revision. This time, however, tempers were noticeably cool. There was no likening federal land management planning to the tragedies of historical American wars — comparisons argued publicly in 2023. 
Instead, BLM-Wyoming Acting State Director Kris Kirby and her staff encountered a much more typical reception. There was some displeasure voiced, but mostly decorum in a room filled with a few dozen inquisitive locals, elected officials and advocacy representatives who wanted to know what was going on. And at this point in the process — an early stage known as “scoping” — there wasn’t a whole lot to report. 
“The intention here is not to have a proposal,” Kirby said from the Sweetwater Events Complex. “The intention here is to ask the public what we should be analyzing.”

The BLM has some parameters for changes to the resource management plan for the Rock Springs Field Office. Poster boards illustrated the various special management areas in the field office. There was one showing a dozen “areas of critical environmental concern” and another outlining a handful of special recreation management areas. Changes will be confined to these designations. 
“Areas with special protections and special designations, that’s what we’re analyzing,” Kirby said. “Really nothing in the checkerboard, because there’s not a lot of special management areas there.” 
Some aspects of the ongoing revision are more ironclad. The tool that BLM is going to complete is an “environmental assessment,” which is less exhaustive than the “environmental impact statement” the agency published ahead of the 2024 revision. And the timing has already been decided. The BLM will have a signed record of decision on the amended plans by Oct. 2, 2026, to comply with updated National Environmental Policy Act guidelines, Kirby said.

Although the Bureau of Land Management hasn’t shown its hand on specifics, it’s reasonable to expect that the agency will seek to scale back the size and/or number of special designations in the Rock Springs Field Office. While protesting the final plan, several state agencies urged BLM to reduce the areas of critical environmental concern, which increased from 226,000 acres to 935,000 acres during the 2024 update. 
Some locals who attended Wednesday’s public meeting want BLM to slash those conserved landscapes. 
“Some of them just need to go away,” Sweetwater County Commissioner Mary Thoman said. The Golden Triangle area, which is protected by the South Wind River ACEC, is an example of a protected landscape that ought to go away, she said. 
“It’s got to be multi-use for sustained yield,” Thoman said. “They totally diverged and made it one use: conservation. That’s the biggest issue.”

Rock Springs resident Glenn Lehar, a retired Jim Bridger Power Plant mechanic, also believed that the BLM’s 2024 plan tilted too far toward conservation at the expense of the economy. 
“The people who decided on this, they don’t even live here,” Lehar said. “They don’t even got a clue what goes on out here.” 
But not everyone wanted to see federal land managers roll back special protections and move the needle toward oil and gas drilling, mining and other forms of industrial development.

Duane Kerr, a retired game warden, took issue with a BLM proposal to lease out portions of the Golden Triangle for oil and gas drilling, including near the world’s largest sage grouse lek. Under the existing management plan, leasing and drilling aren’t allowed in the area, but those activities could be permitted if the South Wind River area of critical environmental concern goes away. 
“That’s a horrible thing, in my opinion,” Kerr said. “If you care about wildlife, you can’t do that.”

 Other parties who attended the Rock Springs meeting will be pushing BLM to maintain the status quo. Joey Faigl, who presides over the Muley Fanatic Foundation alone after co-founder Josh Coursey’s Trump administration appointment, said that he doesn’t want to see federal land managers mess with special designations in the Greater Little Mountain Ecosystem — there is both an area of critical concern and a special recreation management area in that area.
“The way it sits now, we’re supportive of it,” Faigl said. “It came to where we wanted it, and we’re all good with where it sits.”
Faigl has been engaged in the resource management plan revision since its onset, he said. He partook in his first related field trip back in 2008.
The Rock Springs resident offered one more thought. 
 “I want it over,” he said.

(Screenshot of Idaho Secretary of State's website) Idaho is seeing more money, and more out-of-state money in lobbying than it likely ever has. 
Secretary of State Phil McGrane told attendees at the Annual Associated Taxpayers of Idaho Conference Wednesday that more than $2.5 million was spent on lobbying in 2025. 
McGrane highlighted new data visualization tools available online at voteidaho.gov, including to track lobbyist spending. 
During the 2025 session, lawmakers approved changes to lobbying reporting that now require “indirect lobbying” to be reported, which would capture activity like social media or texting campaigns during the legislative session to encourage residents to support or oppose certain bills. The new bill also requires monthly reporting year-round, instead of just during the three-month legislative session. Around $700,000 has been spent on lobbying since the 2025 legislative session ended in April, McGrane said. 
There are 392 registered in-state organizations that lobby in Idaho, and there are 300 out-of-state organizations registered to lobby in Idaho.  
The new data visualization runs through each month of 2025, as the lobbying money gets spent. The state legislative session this year ran January through April 4. By the end of the year, the top spender was Modern Ag Alliance, based out of St. Louis, Missouri. The group spent over $620,000 lobbying on one bill, House Bill 303, which would have largely granted legal immunity to pesticide manufacturers. The bill never advanced out of the committee. 
“Most of the spending comes right at the end of February into March,” McGrane said Wednesday. “So in the heat of the session is when money starts to really trickle in. It starts off slow, and then comes in strong.”
The second-highest spender of the year was the American Federation for Children, a Washington D.C.-based organization that advocates for public subsidies for private school education. The entity has spent more than $200,000 in Idaho, with a large focus on House Bill 93 — a private school choice tax credit that provides a total of $50 million for families to go toward private school tuition or other educational expenses. The governor signed HB 93 into law on Feb. 27. 
There are around 400 lobbyists registered in Idaho, McGrane said. 
“For all of you legislators, that means there’s four of them for each one of you,” he said. 
The second new data visualization dashboard available online depicts the close legislative races the state has seen since 2018. All 105 seats in the Legislature are up for election every two years. 
There have been 49 legislative primary races decided by 435 — the number of attendees registered for Wednesday’s conference — or fewer votes since 2018. 
“Fifty races were determined by just the people here,” McGrane said. “So if we can get more people to participate, more people to show up, they can have a big impact.”

Josh Shapiro’s cabinet to serve as executive director of the Pennsylvania School Employees Retirement System (PSERS).
Monson, who is a longtime associate of Shapiro, will bring broad experience in public finance to the agency, which manages nearly $80 billion in investments for the pensions of more than 500,000 teachers, school staff and retirees, PSERS said in a statement.
“We chose Uri Monson as our next executive director because of his extensive public sector financial experience, which is well-suited to guide PSERS in the years ahead,” Board Chair Richard Vague said.
The PSERS board selected Monson after a nationwide search to succeed interim Executive Director Ben Cotton after former Executive Director Terrill Sanchez retired in June.

Monson said he is honored to be selected and have the board’s trust to lead PSERS.
“I have spent my career managing public finances with care and accountability, and I look forward to working with the board, staff and stakeholders to ensure the system continues to deliver on its promise of retirement security for Pennsylvania’s public school employees,” Monson said
Monson earns about $211,000 as budget secretary. Sanchez earned $317,000 before his retirement.
Shapiro will appoint Zachary Reber, who currently serves as deputy secretary for fiscal policy and program coordination, to become budget secretary, the governor’s office said. The PSERS board is expected to finalize its selection of Monson at its Dec. 12 meeting.

Shapiro’s office highlighted Monson’s work with the Budget Office through three budget cycles during which Shapiro’s team negotiated with Republicans in the divided legislature to fund cash strapped public transit agencies, school vouchers and other policy goals, amid a process that extended beyond the deadline each year.
Monson presided over the debut of the commonwealth’s first ever debt management plan, which clarified guidelines for debt authorization and repayment. He also oversaw a bond refinancing that will save taxpayers $193 million, according to the governor’s office.
Before joining Shapiro’s administration, Monson served as deputy superintendent and as chief financial officer for the School District of Philadelphia. Before that, he was CFO for Montgomery County, where Shapiro once served as commissioner.
Shapiro said Monson helped him as he inherited a deficit as commissioner. Together, they balanced the county’s budget, returned it to financial stability and restored the county’s bond rating to AAA status, the highest available.
Monson also served as assistant budget director for Philadelphia where he was responsible for policy analysis for the finance director and Mayor Ed Rendell’s cabinet. 
A graduate of Columbia University, Monson holds a bachelor’s degree in political science and a masters degree in public policy from Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs. Monson also earned a bachelor’s degree in Midrash from the Jewish Theological Seminary of America.
Reber has worked for the state for nearly a decade, serving in multiple senior roles in the governor’s office and the Department of Community and Economic Development. As a deputy secretary in the budget office, Reber manages coordination with the governor’s office and plays a key role in shaping the commonwealth’s annual budget, Shapiro’s office said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Uri-Munson-1024x896.jpeg,,,2025-12-04 18:58:34.398665

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — For the first time in Epic Charter School’s history, its next superintendent will be a newcomer hired from outside the virtual charter school.
Epic’s governing board, with four of its five members present, unanimously voted Thursday to hire Shaun Ross from Oklahoma City Public Schools, where he is senior executive director of student support and accountability.
Ross, who wasn’t present for the vote, will earn an annual salary of $250,000. He will start at Epic “as soon as possible,” but the date of his first day on the job is still uncertain, board chairperson Trevor Hammons said.
In a news release issued an hour after the board made its decision, Ross said it’s an “honor” to be selected. He plans to lead the long-embattled school system into a new era of stability, continuity and academic excellence, according to the announcement.
“Epic has been through what it’s been through and learned so many valuable lessons,” Ross said. “It’s time to move forward, leave the past behind and double down on our commitment to student success.”

The Oklahoma City district didn’t immediately return a request for comment Thursday afternoon. Ross formerly worked as an instructional leadership director and a principal in the district before stepping into its senior administration this year.
Interim Superintendent Justin Hunt will continue leading Epic until Ross arrives. The board voted Thursday to award Hunt a $15,000 stipend, set his salary at $235,000 a year and gave him a new title of assistant superintendent.
Hunt, Epic’s deputy superintendent of instruction, took on the interim role in June after Superintendent Bart Banfield resigned amid mass layoffs at the school. Banfield became Epic’s second-ever superintendent when he was promoted into the role in 2019, succeeding school co-founder David Chaney.
The $15,000 stipend rewards Hunt for “doing two jobs” for the past six months, Hammons said. He’s been leading the school system while continuing the duties of his original position.
“Justin has done an incredible job as the interim, keeping the ship afloat,” Hammons said after the board meeting. “And as you saw today, we still have a lot of confidence in Justin and want him to stay on and continue helping Epic into the future.”

Epic, with nearly 30,000 students, is Oklahoma’s third-largest public school district and the biggest of the state’s virtual charter schools, which use primarily online instruction. 
Its open superintendent position attracted 54 candidates from 17 states, said Erin Hatfield, the school’s director of public relations. The “exhaustive” six-month search involved three rounds of interviews that culminated in the board’s decision Thursday between three finalists, she said.
Hammons declined to confirm any of the finalists’ names besides Ross, nor would he say whether Hunt was one of them.
The board wasn’t expressly searching for a superintendent from outside the organization, Hammons said. Rather, Ross impressed the board in each of his three interviews as “incredibly qualified” and “really personable.”
“Shaun just happened to be from the outside and happened to be the best candidate, as the board voted,” Hammons said. “It’s going to be a challenge. We’re a school unlike any other in the state, maybe in the nation, but his background and his willingness and his attitude and also the people that are here that are going to help him, it’ll bring a new perspective to Epic, and hopefully that will really help us grow and just kind of move forward and get back to doing what we do best, which is educate the students.”

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Florida Phoenix)Anti-abortion activists have the right to hand leaflets to women in the driveway of a Clearwater abortion clinic, a federal appeals court ruled Thursday.
In a 2-to-1 decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit tossed a trial judge’s decision preventing the Florida Preborn Rescue organization from entering within five feet of the Bread and Roses Women’s Health Center’s driveway. 
Instead, the lower court must pause the Clearwater ordinance preventing the group — and any other pedestrians — from entering the center’s “buffer zone” — a 38-foot stretch of public sidewalk, 28 feet of which cross the clinic’s driveway.
“The Ordinance seriously burdens Florida Preborn’s speech … by restricting the sidewalk counselors’ ability to distribute leaflets to patients as they arrive at the clinic,” the majority opinion reads. 
“The controlling question is whether the challenged buffer zone — be it five, 10, or 35 feet—burdens substantially more speech than necessary to achieve the government’s asserted interests,” it continues. 
“We think it likely that Clearwater’s buffer zone does so.”
Although abortion-related topics have divided the nation for decades, the conversation reached a fever-pitch in 2022 when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. 
This turned abortion regulation over to the states, sparking dramatically different pro-choice or anti-abortion laws from state to state. Since then, states like New Jersey, Colorado, and Kentucky have all seen their “buffer zone” ordinances contested.
What happened?
The case centers on a 2023 city ordinance passed to prevent anti-abortion protesters impeding vehicles’ and patients’ access to the clinic. 
According to the Clearwater Police Department — which backed the ordinance — it received 73 calls in one year from the clinic to handle “continuing and recently escalating confrontation.”
The ordinance banned all pedestrians from crossing within five feet of the clinic’s driveway, exempting emergency services and clinic staff escorting women into the building, as part of a buffer zone.
Florida Preborn Rescue soon after asked a federal district judge for a preliminary injunction, alleging a free-speech violation and noting that its ability to hand out leaflets and have “close, personal conversations” had been dramatically chilled.
U.S. District Judge Mary Scriven denied their request that October. 
Now, as ordered by the appellate court, Scriven will have to dissolve the buffer zone while litigation continues on the underlying merits of the case. 
‘Herculean efforts’
The appellate decision was not unanimous. Judge Nancy Abudu, a joe Biden appointee, disagreed with judges Kevin Newsom and Britt Grant, both appointed by Trump. 
“The First Amendment does not demand that patients at a medical facility undertake Herculean efforts to escape the cacophony of political [messages],” she wrote, citing federal precedent. “The right to be let alone is one of the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men.”
Abudu argued that FPR can still speak with patients driving into the clinic because their counselors are just five feet away from the driveway. 
“It is diﬃcult to even visualize how a distance of five feet seriously burdens FPR’s ability to leaflet and otherwise communicate with those entering the clinic,” she added, arguing patients interested in speaking with FPR could always walk over and accept a leaflet.
This conflicts with Newsom and Grant’s reading of the ordinance. 
Because the measure bans all pedestrians except for clinic staff and emergency management, they said, this technically means patients intrigued by FPR’s message wouldn’t be allowed to walk through the buffer zone to accept a leaflet.
Moreover, they argued, that the ordinance is unnecessary and over-burdensome because Florida already has a statute preventing the obstruction of traffic ways.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022_may24_protesters2-1024x585.jpg,,,2025-12-04 18:58:34.398665

(Photo: Senate.gov)The U.S. Senate confirmed four of President Donald Trump’s nominees to North Carolina federal courts this week, twice as many as in his entire first term.
Senators voted to approve Lindsey Freeman and David Bragdon to serve the Middle District of North Carolina on Tuesday, and Matthew Orso and Susan Courtwright Rodriguez to serve the Western District of North Carolina on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.
Though Trump had an outsized influence on the federal courts in other states during his first term, he appointed just two federal judges for North Carolina.
However, Trump entered office for his second term with twice as many vacancies to fill in North Carolina because Republican senators Thom Tillis and Ted Budd refused to negotiate with President Joe Biden on vacancies that opened in the state during his presidency.
Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) blocked President Joe Biden from appointing judges in North Carolina in 2024, allowing Trump to enter office with four vacancies on the state’s federal bench. (Photo: Senate.gov)
That standoff began when Biden nominated North Carolina Solicitor General Ryan Park for the Fourth Circuit. Tillis and Budd were staunchly opposed to Park’s nomination, and vowed to withhold their “blue slips” for any nominees in the state afterward. (Senate protocol requires the support of at least one senator for district judge nominees in their home state.)
After losing the 2024 election, Biden ultimately rescinded Park’s nomination in a deal to advance several district court judges in other states.
With this week’s confirmation of the four Trump nominees, all active judges in the Middle District of North Carolina are Republican appointees, as are all but one in the Western District.
Each of the new judges has prior experience with the federal judiciary, either as clerks or through litigation, with Orso and Rodriguez succeeding judges they clerked for. All but Bragdon were able to win the support of several Democratic senators in addition to the unanimous support of Republicans.
Orso and Rodriguez, both approved with 57 votes, received the backing of five Democratic senators: Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Az.), Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.).
Freeman’s 60-39 vote was the most bipartisan, with eight senators who caucus with Democrats supporting her: Durbin, Kaine, Shaheen, Whitehouse, Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Sen. Angus King (I-Maine), and Sen. Jackie Rosen (D-Nevada).
Bragdon was confirmed in a 53-45 vote with only Republicans in favor.
Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond and an expert on the federal courts, said North Carolina will benefit from having a full complement of judges after more than a year of vacancies.

“It’s good for the courts. It’s good for the judges,” Tobias said. “It was important to get them filled. It’s just unfortunate that Democrats didn’t get to put any through because they made it all contingent on [Park’s nomination].”
He added that Democrats should “feel pretty good” that three of the four nominees received bipartisan support in the Senate, and that their backgrounds reflect the level of experience of traditional judicial nominees. “They’re probably more like establishment conservatives.”
Bragdon, a former clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas, faced progressive backlash on reproductive rights and capital punishment. The progressive nonprofit Alliance For Justice wrote to the Judiciary Committee to condemn Bragdon’s hardline positions on both issues in online writings as a law student, which contributed to his lack of Democratic support.
In a Dec. 2 statement, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and Sen. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) praised the Senate for swiftly confirming Bragdon and Freeman.
“Throughout this process, I’ve remained committed to advancing judges who uphold the Constitution, apply the law fairly, and serve with integrity,” Tillis said. “I appreciate the White House’s partnership in identifying strong candidates, and I look forward to seeing both Judge Bragdon and Judge Freeman bring their experience and dedication to the federal bench.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Senate-NC-Judges-Hearing-e1758222170242-1024x767.png,,,2025-12-04 18:58:34.398665

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)A Senate panel unanimously advanced legislation Thursday that would expand the definition of motorized bikes, despite staunch opposition from cyclists and hesitation from some of the lawmakers themselves.
Sen. Pat Diegnan (D-Middlesex), chair of the Senate’s transportation committee, voted in favor of the bill while conceding he does not think it is the solution to what some officials have said is a rise in dangerous use of e-bikes.
“But we have to do something. It’s absolutely scary,” Diegnan said.
https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/11/27/hudson-river-rail-tunnels/
The bill would remove all existing classifications of electric bikes and redefine and expand the classification of motorized bicycles to include pedal bikes with electric motors that assist the rider. By redesignating low-speed electric bikes as motorized bikes, people would be required to license, register, and insure them to use them in New Jersey.
Bill Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) said in October he planned to propose legislation to overhaul e-bike laws soon after a 13-year-old boy riding an electric bike in Scotch Plains was killed when a truck crashed into him and a 22-year-old man on an e-bike died after a car struck him in Orange. At the time, Scutari said he wanted to create another class for bikes that can exceed 28 miles per hour, reclassify some bikes that can get up to 18 miles per hour, and mandate licensing and insurance for bikes not classified as low-speed electric bicycles.
Under current state law, low-speed e-bikes that go up to 20 miles per hour — classified as Class 1 or Class 2 — require no license or registration. Class 3 e-bikes, which have a maximum speed of 28 miles per hour, are treated as a motorized bicycle, and already come with some regulations, like registration, a driver’s license, and insurance.
Critics who testified to the committee Thursday said the bill Scutari introduced in November is completely different than what he first suggested. They said they support the version of the bill as he originally described it, but oppose jettisoning bike classification.
“Putting aside the legal and procedural issues, merging these classes is just a bad idea on its face,” said Corey Hannigan of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign.
He raised concerns about whether New York cyclists crossing the George Washington Bridge could face citations for lacking registration or insurance. He also noted a major incentive of low-speed e-bikes is their accessibility compared to higher-speed bikes that require training, licensing, and registration.
Karen Manovich uses an electric bike with a 200-watt motor that doesn’t hold a charge for more than an hour. Manovich said the legislation would conflate her bike with one that has a 2,000-watt motor and can exceed 25 miles per hour.
“That’s what you guys need to go after. Not after my little bike that I really need to get up that hill in Jersey City,” she said.
She has no license, and noted that obtaining a license requires six points of identification, an additional hurdle for some cyclists. Licensing and insurance requirements would put serious limits on who can ride an electric bike in New Jersey, she added.
Bruce Fletcher, a retired state corrections officer who regularly rides his electric bike along the Delaware canal, said the bill would make New Jersey an outlier, with most states following the three-class e-bike system. He also said his insurance company told him they would not insure his e-bike.
“No insurance company wants to do this,” he said. “If you combine it with electric, moto, moped, along with the rest, you’ll be hurting everybody.”
Hannigan said he’d prefer lawmakers increase enforcement of existing laws requiring registration, educate vendors and parents of teens on requirements, and crack down on illegally modified devices.
Attorney Richard Albuquerque supports the bill, citing pedestrians who are being “severely injured.” With no insurance requirements for e-bikes, families are stuck with significant medical bills and little recourse, Albuquerque said.
“If the bikes had liability insurance, there’d be an opportunity for them not to be so personally devastated and impacted by these accidents,” he said.
Nationally, e-bike injuries rose by 293% from 2019 to 2022, according to Columbia University researchers.
The bill is scheduled for a hearing in the Senate Budget Committee Monday. It does not have a companion in the Assembly.

(Photo by Janie Osborne/Getty Images)The Montana Environmental Quality Council at its Dec. 2 meeting, approved a letter requesting federal funding for projects aimed at extracting rare earth and critical minerals from legacy mining sites in the state. 
The letter, addressed to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, asked for funding through the Army’s Research, Development, Test and Evaluation account for the Montana Mining Association’s Rare Earth and Critical Minerals Extraction Demonstration project.
While the letter was approved 14-1, some legislators sought to put limits on the projects included in the funding request. 
As part of the federal push to secure domestic critical and rare earth mineral supply chains, the federal government has pushed to fund mining projects and technological advancements to maximize extraction in the U.S. 
In Montana, a state built on a history of mining, there has been a recent push to revitalize old legacy mines to extract high-priority minerals from waste sites, including the iconic Berkeley Pit in Butte. 
“There’s billions of gallons of metals lying in the water in the Berkeley Pit and hundreds of millions of tons of smelter waste (near Anaconda) all bearing appreciable levels of metals with many of those being critical in those two sites,” said Montana Mining Association director Matt Vincent said during a presentation at the EQC’s October meeting.
Vincent highlighted some of the critical elements on the federal priority list, including zinc, germanium, copper, cobalt, tungsten, manganese, nickel, bismuth, antimony and others. 
Recent studies by Montana Tech University and other geological research entities have focused on extracting rare earth elements from coal waste, mining wastewater, and specifically, the Berkeley Pit, where it’s estimated extraction processes could produce 40 tons of rare earths annually. 
The Montana Mining Association is working on extraction projects at existing mines and waste sites, including the Berkeley Pit, the Anaconda smelter waste complex, the Sibanye-Sillwater mine, Black Butte mine and Antonioli-Contact mine.
“The sites that we select are based on legacy sites and operating permit sites where they have conducted initial sampling that’s identified, what the critical elements are, that they’re appreciable amounts of that would lend themselves to being priority target sites,” Vincent told the EQC on Tuesday. 
Rep. Josh Seckinger, D-Bozeman, raised some concerns that the letter did not list the specific sites Vincent discussed, and leaving it open-ended could lead to misunderstandings as to what kinds of mining the EQC was supporting. 
Several conservation organizations provided public comment at the meeting, and said while they supported projects repurposing existing mines, they also were concerned about any new mining operations. 
“We too think that looking at critical minerals and rare earth elements in places such as the Berkeley Pit and the Anaconda smelter site makes sense,” said Julia DalSoglio, representing the Montana Sierra Club. 
DalSoglio and a representative of the Montana Environmental Information Center did point to recent opposition to a new exploratory mining operation in the Bitterroot Valley that drew hundreds of members of the public in a meeting this week and led to Montana’s federal delegation going on the record about not supporting a fast-tracked mining project.  
“It’s quite easy to leap to conclusions and by inference as to what sort of projects they might be pointing towards,” Ben Cotton with MEIC said. “Some of the language at the end of the letter talking about other shovel-ready projects. I’m really reassured hearing these comments about what this is actually targeting and and fully support that, but think that the letter could be drafted in a way that’s more specific.”
The letter was ultimately approved with an added line listing out the five priority projects of the Montana Mining Association as well as “future legacy sites.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-811976670-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-04 18:58:34.398665

Over the past few months, VTDigger and Vermont Public reporter Carly Berlin has been looking into the changing landscape of transitional housing in Vermont. We’re excited to be able to share the results of that reporting in this podcast, produced by the Brave Little State team at Vermont Public.
Note: Brave Little State is made for the ear. We recommend listening to the audio. We’ve also provided a transcript. Transcripts are generated using a combination of robots and human transcribers, and they may contain errors.

Josh Crane: From Vermont Public and the NPR Network, this is Brave Little State. I’m Josh Crane.
Every episode of this show begins with a question asked by a listener. Sometimes people submit those questions online — you can do that at bravelittlestate.org — other people ask them in person at one of our live events. But for this episode, we did something different.
Reporter Carly Berlin covers housing for Vermont Public and VTDigger. You might remember the BLS episode she did last year about the state’s motel voucher program. In that episode, she addressed, and ultimately disproved the idea that Vermont’s recent spike in homelessness is caused by out-of-staters coming here for a motel room.
That story was driven by questions she was hearing from readers and listeners who have housing about people who don’t. And the whole time she worked on that piece, she wondered: What if we went directly to people experiencing homelessness and asked what they thought we should investigate? Where might that lead us?
So, for this episode, that’s exactly what we did. Carly takes it from here.
What are you curious about?
Carly Berlin: It’s kind of unusual as a news reporter with regular deadlines to begin a story with a simple, open-ended question: What are you curious about?
I made that pitch with Brave Little State producer Burgess Brown at a Burlington homeless shelter and at a daytime resource center that gives food and supplies to people who live outside.
We held office hours. And we repurposed a suggestion box for people to submit their ideas to us after we left.
Burgess Brown: And we’ve got these notecards that says, “What’s a question you have about housing and homelessness in Vermont? And why’s that question important to you?“
Carly Berlin: On one of those question-gathering days, I spent a few hours at the resource center cafeteria during the morning breakfast rush.
I pulled up a chair at a crowded table, and made my ask: What are you curious about?
The people at the table started batting around their questions — questions about lengthy housing waitlists and city policies around encampments in public parks. And then the man sitting next to me, who introduced himself as Manny, asked me this one: “Why are there no halfway houses anymore?”
Halfway houses. Not a term that gets used a whole lot these days. But historically, these were places for people leaving prison or rehab to live half way on their path back to society and independence.
I spend a lot of time covering Vermont’s response to homelessness. And sometimes I think about that response as links in a chain. There are all of these links in our housing system, in a person’s life, where things can fall apart that can land someone sleeping in a tent, or in a shelter or motel.
Manny’s question struck me because I didn’t know a lot about this particular link in that chain, when someone’s just gotten clean, or served their time, and now it’s their moment to start piecing together a new life.
Manny was in this moment when we met. He had been released from prison just two weeks before. He was looking for housing, and he wanted to find somewhere he could stay sober. He was worried about overdosing. A halfway house, he seemed to imply, would be the right place for him to get back on track. Or at least to have a place to sleep inside.
There’s an implication in Manny’s question that halfway houses in Vermont have disappeared altogether. Spoiler: That’s not quite true. What I learned is a lot of group homes for people leaving prison or drug treatment have closed up, just in the last couple years.
But soon after that wave of closures crested, an effort to open up more of these homes is picking up momentum.
So there’s some yo-yoing happening. And that’s because there’s not a clear consensus about the best way to get people back on their feet — people who are experiencing homelessness and addiction, who’ve committed crimes. The debate centers around priorities: whether sobriety is priority number one, or getting people into housing.
Looking at the story of halfway houses in Vermont, and particularly in Burlington, is a way of examining how we’ve sorted through those priorities in the past and how we’re trying to do that now, in the middle of a historic housing shortage and an opioid epidemic. It’s a way of looking at how we try to balance accountability, and compassion, and giving people choice.
A mirror to the present
(Public access TV intro music)
Carly Berlin: Burlington in the 1980s feels like a mirror to the present.
Bernie Sanders: There is a housing crisis in Burlington. People can’t afford new housing. People can’t afford skyrocketing rent. People are sleeping out on the streets.
Carly Berlin: That is then-Burlington mayor, Bernie Sanders, speaking on public access TV in 1987.
Burlington was experiencing a housing crunch that would feel very familiar to residents today. And it’s critical to understanding why halfway houses started springing up all across town.
Erhard Mahnke: Burlington was making its name on the map. People were excited to come move to Burlington.
Carly Berlin: Erhard Mahnke is a longtime affordable housing advocate. He says this was a time of intense real estate speculation. People were buying old houses, fixing them up and flipping them. Lower income residents were getting displaced. Rents doubled over the course of the decade.
Erhard Mahnke: The 80s were, you know, a time of rapidly rising rents, much as we’ve seen over the last few years.
Carly Berlin: And at the same time, then-President Ronald Reagan slashed funding for public housing across the country. Here’s Bernie again.
Bernie Sanders: They are stopping federal aid for low-income housing. They are stopping federal aid for Section Eight. So the bottom line is that in terms of future housing programs, the situation regarding Washington is totally dismal.
Carly Berlin: Erhard says it didn’t take long for more and more people to become homeless.
Erhard Mahnke: What we look upon and consider as modern-day homelessness was basically created under the Reagan administration. 
Carly Berlin: Newspaper stories started to note the existence of, quote, “street people” in Burlington — people who were sometimes drinking and using drugs, who were sometimes mentally ill.
And business owners on Church Street were not happy. A few of them got fed up with the homeless people who they said harassed their customers and staff. So, they decided to get rid of the problem themselves.
They started a nonprofit called “Westward Ho!,” which gave unhoused people in Burlington a one-way ticket out of town. Erhard says the business owners were roundly criticized.

In 1988, Burlington business owners started a group called Westward Ho! that provided unhoused people with one way tickets out of town. Image from Burlington Free Press, December 30, 1988.

Erhard Mahnke: It was a lot of outrage around that. It’s like, oh yeah. Let’s ship our problems somewhere else. No, we should deal with it here.

Carly Berlin: And Burlington did decide to deal with it here. The city’s first homeless shelters opened during this time. Its leaders came up with new ways to fund affordable housing that relied less on the feds.
And organizations started opening up group homes for people who were leaving prison, or recovering from addiction. These were different than the shelters popping up. Their purpose was not just to put a roof over people’s heads, but to rehabilitate people back into public life. Recovery meetings were often required. Sometimes prayer. Volunteering.
These places were often called “halfway houses.”

CCTV video: (music) While I was locked up, one of my biggest fears was where I would go and what would happen to me when I got out. And I don’t know what would’ve happened to me if I hadn’t come to Dismas House. It scares me to think about it.
Carly Berlin: That’s from a video made by Dismas House, a home for people without a place to stay after being released from prison. It opened up in Burlington in 1986.
And then in ‘89, a homeless shelter announced plans to open, quote, “northern Vermont’s first halfway house for alcoholics and drug abusers,” claiming it would be a place to, quote, “confront the causes of their homelessness.”

The Burlington Emergency Shelter set out plans to open “northern Vermont’s first halfway house for alcoholics and drug abusers.” Image from Burlington Free Press, February 14, 1989.

The same year, Burlington got its first Oxford House, a recovery home run democratically by residents. By the early 90s, there were seven of these in town. Similar houses popped up around the state too.
But it was hard to keep these houses open. They faced budget shortfalls and pushback from neighbors. Even when some of them closed, though, new houses sprouted up in their place to meet demand.
And then, just a couple years ago — another spate of closures happened. A big one, centered in Burlington, just as a new homelessness and substance use crisis was beginning to reach a boiling point.
WCAX: An update to a home for mothers and babies in crisis facing financial troubles. Today, the Lund Center announced Independence Place will be closing after 20 years…
WCAX: Two homes in Brattleboro and this one here in Burlington will be closing after losing a majority of their funding. Now, residents tell me that this is disappointing … There’s nothing out there, there’s no vacancy anywhere. All the programs are full or overcrowded. So, basically, they’re on the streets. 
Carly Berlin: There’s no comprehensive count of halfway houses in Vermont — and the term itself has fallen out of favor. But based on our research, as recently as 2019, there were about 30 group transitional houses for adults across the state — the vast majority of them clustered in Burlington. By 2025, of those 33 homes, more than a third have closed.
We’re going to come back to why this string of closures happened a few years ago. But first, I want to take you to Buell Street in Burlington. Because, in the face of all sorts of pressure from NIMBYs and tenuous funding, one of the original transitional homes from the ‘80s is still welcoming new residents.

Dismas House
It’s one of those November nights that started in the afternoon. Snow is already blanketing everything. I walk up to a big Victorian house and knock on the door. Inside, there are deep, comfortable couches and the table is set for dinner.
This is the Burlington Dismas House. Since the mid-80s, its mission has been to reconcile former prisoners with society, and society with former prisoners.
Every weeknight, volunteers bring a meal here to share with the residents, all recently incarcerated men.
Tonight, one of them — Ryan Laflin — is acting as our host.

Ryan Laflin: Thank you for coming to Tuesday night dinner everyone. I’m your host, Ryan. I’d like to thank the cooks, Dean and Valerie. (Clapping)
We can go around and introduce each other. I’m Ryan…
Valerie: I’m Valerie …
Carly Berlin: There are about a dozen people sitting around the table. Ryan serves us plates full of chicken, potatoes and squash.
Ryan Laflin: Now we’ll go around and whoever has gratitude they could share it. I’ll go first. I’d like to thank the house, the program, everyone here, the guys. Salt for the roads.
Other resident: I’m grateful for the house, for second chances, getting out of jail and all that stuff. You know, it’s good to be here.
Carly Berlin: Living here comes with a lot of structure. Residents pay $85 a week to stay here. They’re expected to come to group dinner three nights a week. They all have assigned chores. Staff help them find jobs. They volunteer in the community.
When I ask what volunteering has been most meaningful for them, Ryan pipes up.
Ryan Laflin: I don’t know. Probably the laundromat. I like the laundromat. 
Carly Berlin: Every Wednesday, the laundromat has a free laundry day geared toward people experiencing homelessness.
Ryan Laflin: It’s pretty nice, you know, everyone was like, so happy, you know, excited to do it, you know, to be there to get their laundry done.
Other resident: When you don’t have anything, it’s amazing the little things that make you happy, right?
Ryan Laflin: Put a smile on my face, just watching them be happy.
Carly Berlin: I ask how many of the guys have been homeless before, and hands fly up around the dinner table.
And they know many other people in prison who are waiting to be released but don’t have a home to go back to, they say.
According to Department of Corrections data, as of late October, 72 people were held past their minimum release date because they lack appropriate housing to move into.
Other resident: It’s crazy the amount of people that sit there on lack of residence. 
Ryan Laflin: Yeah. There’s a lot of them. 
Carly Berlin: When someone’s leaving prison, they might have a home to go back to with a parent, or a spouse. But other times, there’s nowhere for them to land. In those cases, the state helps fund two routes.
One are group homes like Dismas. The other are subsidized apartments. Both routes are just temporary places to live – for a couple months, or a couple years, before people move on to, hopefully, a permanent home.
Many of the guys say Dismas was just convenient, that it had a shorter waitlist than the apartments.
But it’s clearly more than just a way to avoid sitting in prison longer. Ryan says there’s a lot of support baked into living here.
Ryan Laflin: We all have each other’s backs, you know. Someone needs something, or, you know, whether it’s emotional or whatever, physical, we’re there to support everyone. It’s kind of nice. 
Carly Berlin: After eating hearty slices of carrot cake, I sit down with Ryan on the deep couches in the living room. I ask him to tell me the story of how he ended up here. Around twenty years ago, he says he got into a snowmobile accident.
Ryan Laflin: I was holding up the back of it and the track broke. And a chunk of it took me in, the leg broke in, ripped out a bunch of muscle and tendons and stuff. So they gave me a lot of painkillers, and then when they stopped giving them to me, that was, you know, because I was abusing them. I found the next best thing. You know, it was cheap and everywhere. And I did that, I did heroin for probably a year, and then got on Suboxone. 
Carly Berlin: He was clean for a while. He got married, had two kids. Then his dad died. He fell into a depression, and one day he decided to get high again. Things went downhill fast.
Ryan Laflin: We lost our house. You know, we ended up losing our kids. 
Carly Berlin: He was sentenced for a burglary he committed in 2019, among other charges. In prison, Ryan says he realized he’d chosen drugs over his children. He says he got sober. And when it was time to figure out where to go after prison he heard about Dismas from someone inside.
Ryan Laflin: I looked into it and, you know, realized how good of a program this really is, you know, and if you put your mind to it, you really want to do it, you can succeed. You know, you could stay clean in here, you know, they help you, and they have all the tools. 
Carly Berlin: Staying sober is one of the rules at Dismas House, though using drugs or drinking doesn’t automatically get someone kicked out. Dismas staff say they work through options with residents.
Ryan says every once in a while, someone moves into the house who’s just not ready to be clean.
Ryan Laflin: You just got to, you know, avoid it, go to your room, or, you know, go for a walk or something, just to, you know, clear your head and you know, so it doesn’t trigger you.

From zero tolerance to ‘Housing First’
Carly Berlin: This conundrum — what to do when someone relapses while living in sober housing — it played a big role in why many of these homes closed their doors a few years ago.
The Vermont Department of Corrections was seeing a pattern. People were being released from prison into these sober houses. And then they’d relapse, violating the zero tolerance policies that many of these homes had towards substance use, says Jill Moore, the housing program administrator for the Department of Corrections.
Jill Moore: Zero tolerance, in plain language, looks like: You’re given a drug test, and even if you test dirty for something like marijuana, you were kicked out of the program.

Carly Berlin: After someone was kicked out — or ran off — they’d often be homeless. That would mean they violated the conditions of their release from prison, which stipulated that they have housing. That violation would often land them back in prison.
One study found that those sorts of violations were the main reason people on furlough — who were finishing their sentences outside prison, in the community — were put back behind bars, rather than people committing new crimes.
So in 2021, the department decided that the zero tolerance stance in transitional housing was not working. Officials made a decision that caught a lot of people off guard. They decided to drastically reduce the number of beds the state funded in these group homes and put the money toward that other route — transitional apartments.
The theory here was the top priority for people leaving prison should be stable housing. Meaning, having housing shouldn’t be a condition of staying sober.
Jill Moore: Really as a department, as a whole, we shifted to harm reduction, right? And saying, like, we understand that relapse is a part of the process.
Carly Berlin: This philosophy — that getting access to housing should come before sorting through other problems, like drug use — it’s a major idea that’s guided the response to homelessness and addiction across the country over the last two decades. It’s called “Housing First.”
When the Vermont Department of Corrections embraced “Housing First”, and pulled funding for many groups homes in favor of individual apartments, the dominoes started to fall.
Phoenix House, a Rhode Island based nonprofit that had been the largest sober living provider in Vermont, closed all five of its homes in the state following the funding cut in 2021.
So did Northern Lights, a transitional housing program in downtown Burlington for women struggling with substance use.
And, right around this same time, as housing prices were starting to soar, some owners of other sober houses in Burlington shuttered because it was just too expensive to keep them running.
The Department’s pivot away from sober houses wasn’t absolute. It kept funding Dismas House. The DOC’s shift on zero tolerance pushed Dismas to change how it handled relapse and drug use in its houses, the Dismas of Vermont director told me. The homes have a less punitive stance now. They give residents more options for treatment, more second chances — and third and fourth ones.
By some metrics, this big shake up at the Department of Corrections brought success. The number of people landing back in prison because of violations like loss of housing has dropped over the last few years.
But just avoiding prison isn’t the only goal of transitional housing. It’s also to find permanent housing. And by that measure, not a lot has changed. The share of people who’ve been able to move out of transitional housing into permanent homes has held steady.
Right now, this push and pull between “Housing First” and zero tolerance — between prioritizing housing, and prioritizing sobriety — it’s playing out at the policy level.
Meanwhile, people are caught in this balance. People who are navigating the reality of relapsing in the early stages of recovery.
Relapse in sober houses
One person I spoke to for this story used to live in a sober house. We agreed to keep his identity anonymous because he’s still under state supervision and fears getting re-incarcerated.
He told me that when he first moved in there, after leaving prison, his roommate was actively using drugs. He claimed substance use was common in the house, despite the rules.
This person said he’d struggled with substance use since he was a teenager, but he’d gotten clean again while in prison.
Within a week of living at this house, though, he relapsed. He started to spiral. He was sent to inpatient treatment for a couple days, but when he came back to the house, all the same problems remained.
He felt stuck. Between keeping a roof over his head and staying sober.
Tom Dalton: People very commonly say that when they go to a recovery residence that they immediately encounter multiple people who are using in the house. 
Carly Berlin: Tom Dalton is the director of Vermonters for Criminal Justice Reform.
Tom Dalton: You know, we have to understand what the real context is, and what risks we’re putting people in if we don’t make sure that there are mechanisms in place to keep them safe. 
Carly Berlin: As part of his advocacy work, Tom regularly meets with people who are looking for help while living in sober houses — or “recovery residences,” the current term of art.
Some have struggled to maintain their recovery when they’re living under the same roof as people who are still using when, Tom says, there should be a more robust system to stabilize people and keep the house environment safe. Other people have been kicked out after a relapse — or because they were simply told they weren’t a good fit for the house, he says.
Tom Dalton: We need to make sure that there’s adequate oversight so that if decisions are being made in unfair ways, people have real recourse, because what’s at stake for them is very, very high. Often somebody, if they lose their housing, might lose the ability to parent. They might be forced into a setting where they have to return to an abusive partner. They might have to sleep outside. They might be returned to incarceration.
Carly Berlin: Tom thinks the “Housing First” model is often the better option for people. He was happy to see the Department of Corrections make its big shift a few years ago, toward individual apartments and away from zero tolerance in the recovery houses that remained.
He still sees a lot of room for improvement, though. And now, he’s watching as officials in other realms of state government are pouring resources into opening new recovery residences.
About ten of them have opened up in the last couple years, and more are in the works. They’re spread across the state, not concentrated in Burlington like the earlier era of sober homes — something many recovery residence advocates say is a good thing, even if it leaves fewer options available in the state’s most populous city than there once were.
David Riegel: The power of recovery residences is in the peer to peer connections.
Carly Berlin: That’s David Riegel. He’s the executive director of one of the biggest recovery residence organizations in the state, called the Vermont Foundation of Recovery.
Today’s recovery homes are different than the ones David looked at back when he was leaving treatment and looking for a sober house in Burlington, in 2007.
This newer crop of recovery residences, they’re generally not zero tolerance. They tend to have some fallback systems in place for when relapse happens.
But David says that doesn’t mean handling those situations is straightforward.
David Riegel: Yeah, it’s not easy. It’s not black and white. It’s very nuanced and complicated.
Carly Berlin: Dealing with someone relapsing in one of these houses takes balancing the needs of the individual struggling — with that of their housemates. And some recovery residence operators have pushed for legal loopholes they say are aimed at protecting the housemates, though not everyone thinks those loopholes are best for protecting the individual.
David says all of this is like walking a tight rope.
David Riegel: It’s not terribly dissimilar from the tightrope you know that Burlington has pretty publicly been struggling with for a period of years now, right, where they’re trying to say, how do we have policies that, you know, are not stigmatizing, they, you know, respect individuals as they are experiencing homelessness, as experiencing substance use disorders, experiencing, you know, mental health challenges. How do we also acknowledge and understand the impact that that has on our community as a whole?
Carly Berlin: To David, offering people choice is the key. For some, the structure of a group house might be exactly what they need. Others might be ready for an apartment of their own.
David Riegel: We owe it to our citizens to have as many different smaller steps as possible, to have as many different “Choose Your Own Adventure” paths as we possibly can.
Carly Berlin: Offering real options can be really challenging when our whole housing system in Vermont is as gridlocked as it is now. When David tells me this, I think about Manny, our question-asker, trying to find a place to live after coming out of prison, and wondering if a halfway house would be a good option.
And I think about someone else I met on my question-asking search, who told me he’d recently been offered an apartment — a ticket out of the shelter where he was living — but he was so worried about slipping into alcoholism due to the isolation of living alone that he turned it down.
David says not seeing a way out of your circumstances, that can lead to despair. But presenting people with actual options — it’s the basis for giving people hope.
David Riegel: I’m a firm believer that hope is the most powerful thing that we have, and that hope is contingent on seeing a linear path between where we are now and what our dreams are. Like, this belief that I am able to grow, my life is capable of improving, there are tangible actions that I can take. And if I do these things, it is a logical outcome that I’m going to achieve my goals.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana House Republicans on Thursday almost unanimously rejected a slate of Democratic revisions to the contentious mid-decade redistricting bill.
House Bill 1032 would disassemble the state’s two Democratic-held congressional districts to create an 9-0 Republican map ahead of the 2026 midterm elections — as sought by President Donald Trump.
House Democrats labeled the legislation an “extraordinary unfunded mandate,” noting it doesn’t grant state or county election administrators any financial help to make the changes by this spring.
They offered a pair of amendments to reimburse county clerks for costs, like updating election processes and materials. Republicans defeated both on procedural grounds.

“The majority is gonna come up and say the reason this isn’t germane is because it has an appropriation in it,” said Rep. Blake Johnson, D-Indianapolis. “But this … is not in our rule book. It is based solely on precedent. But I think we can all agree … this is an unprecedented moment.”
Johnson said the funding is relevant because, without it, “counties cannot perform the duties” required.
Rep. Alex Zimmerman, R-North Vernon, argued the bill “has nothing to do with an appropriation” and is focused on redistricting.
In the current congressional maps, drawn in 2021, Republicans maintained a 7-2 GOP advantage. Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan holds the 1st District in northwest Indiana, while Democratic Rep. André Carson holds the 7th District in Indianapolis.
The House Republican proposal would break up the Lake Michigan shoreline area into two districts and splinter Indianapolis across four wide-reaching districts. Of the districts receiving slices of the capital — Indiana’s most populous city — one would extend west to Illinois and two would reach the Ohio River.
The expansive changes are intended to maximize the GOP’s political advantage, said bill author Rep. Ben Smaltz, R-Auburn.
Democrats unsuccessfully offered several other amendments designed to track spending.
One would’ve required the Secretary of State’s Office — which houses the Indiana Election Division — to tally the total amount of money and staff hours spent to implement the redistricting and list projects “delayed or abandoned … as a result of redirecting resources” to those efforts. The report would’ve been made to the State Budget Committee.
Another would have urged lawmakers to study the costs following the 2026 legislative session.
Minor and major changes suggested
Democrats also proposed tweaks to the process — alongside wholesale transformations.
All failed, largely along party lines.
One amendment would’ve required public hearings in each congressional district. Several Democrats noted just 43 Hoosiers made it to the single Indianapolis meeting, held with less than a day’s notice on a snowy Tuesday.
Smaltz said the bill gets one public hearing in the House and Senate, like “any other bill.”
“Respectfully, Rep. Smaltz, this is not the same,” said Rep. Carolyn Jackson, D-Hammond. She noted that during 2021 redistricting, hearings were held across the state.
“They had ample enough time; it was warm outside,” Jackson said. “They were able to come, bring their neighbors, to engage in constructive conversation. There was no threat of flipping off the highway and ending up in a fatality.”
Another amendment would’ve mandated that the people or groups involved in drawing the maps be identified.
Smaltz said the House and Senate GOP worked with the National Republican Redistricting Trust. He didn’t want to set a precedent by adopting the amendment, arguing that people who work on other bills don’t have to identify themselves.
“Who are these people?” pressed Rep. Ed DeLaney, D-Indianapolis. “… Tell us who’s doing this to us!”
Democrats also suggested putting redistricting on a statewide ballot, reviving a longstanding effort to put more decisions directly before voters.
“They want a voice. They want a vote, and frankly, they deserve one,” said Rep. Mitch Gore, D-Indianapolis. “If you’re confident in this map, if you believe this is good for Indiana, then you should have no objection to letting the people confirm.”
Smaltz said Indiana is not a public question state, except in narrow categories provided for in the state’s constitution.
“You are the voice,” he told lawmakers. “You are the vote.”
A proposed amendment to ban mid-census redistricting — which also deleted the bill’s redistricting language — received support from two Republicans: Reps. Ed Clere of New Albany and Danny Lopez of Carmel. The proposal included a plea for Congress to prohibit partisan gerrymandering. Clere joined Democrats to support several other amendments as well.
Bill winds its way through Legislature
Indiana lawmakers returned to the Statehouse this month under heavy public pressure from Trump and Gov. Mike Braun, who have attacked GOP holdouts and threatened to help primary them.
House Republicans released the proposed maps Monday morning. On Tuesday, the election committee held its single public hearing and advanced the legislation — with one Republican “no” vote — to the House floor for amendments Thursday.
The House is expected to approve the maps Friday, and move to the Senate next week.
It’s unclear how the legislation will fare in the Senate, which initially declined to meet for redistricting before reversing. Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray has repeatedly said his caucus doesn’t have enough supportive votes.

Andy Beshear. (Kentucky Lantern photos by Liam Niemeyer)With a little over a month before the GOP-controlled Kentucky legislature begins deciding whether to again reduce the state’s income tax rate, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear is warning lawmakers against disregarding fiscal “guardrails” that they previously established. 
A big decision facing lawmakers when they convene on Jan. 6 for a 60-day session is whether to continue to reduce the state’s income tax rate, which provides billions of dollars in revenue to support state services.
Republican lawmakers, through a landmark law passed in 2022, created a system of fiscal triggers based on state revenues and the size of the “rainy day” fund to determine when the state can afford to lower the income tax rate by a half-percentage point. Since then the Republican-controlled legislature has lowered the personal income tax rate from 5% to 3.5%, working toward a goal of eventually eliminating it.  
The benchmarks for another half-percentage point reduction were barely missed in the most recent fiscal year, but some Republican lawmakers are expected to press for another income tax cut nonetheless.
Beshear during a Thursday press conference appeared to warn Republicans against disregarding the fiscal guardrails that are part of the 2022 law. “We’re going to figure out if our Republican state legislators are people of their word or not,” Beshear said. 
The governor also cautioned that state revenues are expected to rise little while costs will be up. 
“What we’re going to see in this next budget is that revenue is flat or just up a little bit, but the costs are up a lot more than that. That would further exacerbate that situation,” Beshear said. 
“We need balanced sources of revenue because we have programs that are so important.”
Beshear at his Thursday press conference renewed calls for the legislature to expand pre-kindergarten education to more Kentucky children. 
Republican Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Mancester, told reporters that his caucus is discussing the possibility of approving another income tax cut in 2026 this week.
Stivers noted that in this year’s session the legislature changed the fiscal trigger system to allow for more incremental cuts. The changes allow lawmakers to potentially reduce the income tax rate by less than a half-percentage point. 
But Stivers also said the legislature should follow the “policy and process” it established for deciding when to further reduce the income tax.
“We just want to keep following our policy. If we hit it, we hit it. If we don’t, we don’t. But we follow the policy we set,” Stivers said. 
Stivers spoke alongside other GOP senators in Bardstown where the Senate Republican caucus was meeting. 
House Majority Floor Whip Jason Nemes, R-Louisville, who argued last month that the fiscal triggers were actually met, has said the legislature should move forward with another income tax reduction in 2026, saying state revenues were measured at the wrong time.
Beshear has a history of mixed support for income tax cuts. He signed into law this year the latest half point reduction, going against some Democratic lawmakers who worried it would hamper the state’s ability to offer services in the future. The Democratic governor also signed into a law another reduction in 2023 as he was running for reelection. But he vetoed the  2022 reducing the income tax rate.
The safeguards in the 2022 law were intended to prevent state revenues from quickly plunging and creating a financial crisis — similar to what happened in Kansas when state lawmakers there slashed income taxes  — and instead allow for a more gradual decrease in the income tax rate to zero. 
The state legislature will likely be grappling with less tax revenue to allocate next year in the state budget.
Sen. Chris McDaniel, R-Ryland Heights, the chair of the Senate Appropriations and Revenue Committee, said last month the state will take on a $180 million “hit” because of increased costs for federal food assistance shifted to the state. Congress’ passage of the Republican-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act this summer shifted more administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which provides nearly 593,000 low-income Kentuckians with funding for food. The amount of SNAP program costs shared with states will also change depending on how often a state makes an error in allocating SNAP benefits for a recipient. 
The Consensus Forecasting Group, a group of economists charged with creating state government revenue forecasts, during its meeting in September projected state revenues would fall over $300 million short of what is budgeted for the new fiscal year that began in July. 
That projected shortfall amounted to approximately a 2% decrease of the more than $15 billion budget for the fiscal year. The chairman of the forecasting group cited uncertainty with trade and tariffs for the revised revenue projection, while Beshear also pointed to decreases in income tax revenue.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Untitled-design-1-1024x576.png,,,2025-12-04 18:58:34.398665

Tim Walz addresses reporters after a budget forecast presentation on Dec. 4, 2025. (Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota’s finances look good for now, but lawmakers will need to address a future multi-billion dollar budget shortfall, Minnesota budget officials announced Thursday.
The state is currently sitting on a $2.5 billion surplus through June 2027, but could end up nearly $3 billion in the red in the following two years. Minnesota is spending more than it generates in revenue, and slow economic growth and increased special education and health care spending are driving up costs.
Minnesota still has a massive rainy day fund, so policymakers aren’t sounding the most severe alarms about Minnesota budget outlook.
The outlook has improved in the nine months since the state projected a $6 billion deficit in 2028 through 2029, as federal policies so far haven’t greatly impacted the state’s finances.
“Policy changes at the federal level, while concerning and even devastating for some Minnesotans, so far have not had as large an impact on Minnesota’s state budget as we worried that they could’ve back in February,” Minnesota Management and Budget Commissioner Erin Campbell said after a budget presentation.
Minnesota lawmakers last year passed a biennium budget, and they aren’t required to do anything budget-related when they return to the Capitol in February. But lawmakers in off-budget years typically make amendments to the two-year budget in what’s known as a “supplemental budget.”
Gov. Tim Walz told reporters to expect budget adjustments in the upcoming session that include similar cuts made in the last budget, when he tried to curb spending on disability services. Lawmakers will have to make some cuts or raise taxes if they want to make a dent in the projected deficit. The Minnesota House is expected to be 67-67 at the beginning of the session, so any deal would have to be bipartisan.
Although federal prosecutors say scammers have likely been defrauding Minnesota public programs for years, this was the first time fraud was discussed extensively during a budget forecast.
Fraud has captured the attention of President Donald Trump, who has been unleashing anti-Somali bigotry this week while his administration is launching an “intensive immigration enforcement operation” targeting the Somali-American community in Minnesota.
Trump’s renewed focus on Somali immigrants comes following the publication of an article claiming — with little evidence — that Somali-American immigrants accused of defrauding Minnesota’s public programs are providing the money to the terrorist group al-Shaabab.


Rising Medicaid costs drove up spending forecasts
Officials predict Minnesota will spend more on health care and human services in the next four years than previously expected. In 2024 and 2025, the state spent a total of around $21 billion on health and human services. In 2026 and 2027, that number is forecasted to jump to $25.8 billion and then $27.6 billion in the two years after that.
Underscoring Minnesota’s worrisome demographic trends, health and human services is on track to surpass education spending in a few years.
The cost is driven largely by the state’s Medicaid program. Minnesota pays around 36% of Medicaid costs, while the federal government covers the rest. Minnesota is grappling with an aging population in need of more care — Medicaid covers the poor and disabled but also nursing home care for the elderly — as well as rapidly increasing health care costs.
Campbell said that human services fraud or actions from the government on fraud do not factor into their budgeting process at all. In other words, they do not account for the possibility that current efforts to crack down on fraud could help decrease future spending.
She added that Minnesota’s rising costs aren’t because of fraudulent activity: “I would not attribute it to fraud.”
How much Medicaid state money has been defrauded is an open question, though the answer seems to be, at minimum, millions.
Walz said that he expects that a third-party audit of 14 Medicaid programs will give a better picture of how much fraud has affected the state’s finances. He seems to have misunderstood how the audit — first announced via confusingly worded press release — actually works, though.
Optum, a third-party auditor, will review, beginning this month, claims as they are submitted and pause them — for up to 90 days — only if “an anomaly is detected” and needs review, Minnesota’s Department of Human Services has said. Walz indicated incorrectly that the audit shuts down the 14 programs for 90 days, after which, he said, “We’ll get the audits back.”
“We have third-party auditors out there,” said Walz. “We shut the program down for 90 days. We will have the first clear picture, I would argue, in Minnesota history of exactly what the extent of this is.”
The drive in Medicaid spending forecasts is largely from higher costs in direct basic care — think: going to the doctor’s for an injury or illness — which leads to higher fees that governments pay to insurance companies to cover Medicaid recipients.
The other culprit of higher health care spending is long-term care waivers — programs that allow the elderly and disabled to live at home or in group homes and get assistance instead of being institutionalized. DHS is addressing fraud and waste in long-term care by pausing payments for Integrated Community Supports providers, a Medicaid waiver program for disabled adults, as well as hiring Optum to review payments for the 14 Medicaid programs.


Walz vs. Demuth
Officials quickly pointed fingers at who was to blame for a potential future budget deficit. Walz and Democrats, unsurprisingly, blamed Trump. GOP House Speaker Lisa Demuth and Republicans, unsurprisingly, blamed fraud, and, by extension, Walz.
The public received its first glimpse of what is likely to be a combative relationship in the upcoming session between Walz and Demuth. Both are running for governor next year and they both hold high-level positions that will influence the legislative session. Walz and Demuth, even though they won’t admit it, will be using their elected positions to campaign against one another.
Walz said Trump’s policies are to blame for Minnesota’s projected deficit.
“The uncertainty that’s being reflected, the chaos that’s coming out of Washington, the things that are happening there — we can’t control that. But in Minnesota, we can control the ability to do what we do every single year: create good, solid budgets based on factual data,” Walz said.
The governor, who is running for a third, four-year term, began his budget remarks by condemning Trump’s xenophobic remarks about Somali-Americans, whom he called  “garbage.”
Walz then challenged Minnesota Republicans to condemn Trump’s remarks.
Demuth didn’t condemn Trump’s comments about Somali-Americans, but said that “there is not an entire community that is bad and there is not an entire community that is good.” She emphasized that the state needs to hold people defrauding Minnesota’s programs accountable and laid the failure to do that at Walz’s feet.
She also blamed the deficit on the DFL’s 2023-2024 trifecta, when they spent down a $17 billion budget surplus.
“We are, as it has been said by the governor, a very generous state. That doesn’t mean, though, that we should sit back and turn a blind eye when people are taking advantage of Minnesota’s generosity,” Demuth said. “We have, again, both a spending problem and a fraud problem.”
Federal uncertainty puts budget predictions at risk
Federal policies are fleeting, which puts Minnesota’s budget predictions at risk of error. Officials said that uncertainties around trade, tariffs and immigration could impact Minnesota’s economic outlook.
MMB said that even though trade uncertainty has improved since April, tariff levels have frequently shifted. The overall tariff rate is about 18%, and this can create uncertainty for consumer prices and inflation.
The Trump administration’s immigration policies also affect Minnesota’s economy. The state’s unemployment rate rose to 3.6% in August. Without an in-flow of migrants internationally or domestically, Minnesota’s employers might struggle to fill jobs. Some industries are highly dependent on migrants, and costs for employers may go up due to labor shortages.

Relatives still traveled home. Dozens still set up grills and canopies at games. Mississippi Today produced a collection of stories of homecoming events in the Delta, where traditions have evolved over time.
INDIANOLA — Local law enforcement tended to a newly installed checkpoint at Perry S. Price Memorial Stadium. Even with the added security for the Gentry High School homecoming, the line out front of the stadium paled in comparison to the one at the concession stand.
Across the stadium from the field house, which boasts air conditioning, the concessions shack was equipped with an electronic fan whose blades sluggishly propelled air toward the candies and cashier. Familiar candy and hot chip brands were available, but the crowd-pleasers were mostly homemade: popcorn, nachos and, especially, the pickles soaked in Kool-Aid. Kids as young as six clutched cash in one hand and a superhero backpack in the other in a line that stretched to the chain link fence that lined the field’s perimeter. Other parents and teachers stood parallel to the concession line with relatives on the phone, calling their orders from the road. It was a majority of attendees’ first stop during a day of festivities.
Gloria McDuffy Jimison has been making Kool-Aid pickles, also called Koolickles, for Gentry High School homecomings for over two decades. She sometimes makes bucketfuls, at $34 each, for one Chicago family that makes the homecoming trip each year. One repeat customer is a mother who buys 10 bags at most games. 
“They say, ‘Let me taste one.’ And then they’re hooked,” McDuffy Jimison said.
McDuffy Jimison has perfected the recipe. She experimented with adding sugar from Sno Balls snack cakes.

To try a quality Kool-Aid pickle is to taste its slippery sweetness and not be turned off by the vinegar aftertaste. It should be both refreshing and hearty, like a more flavorful, firmer and slippier gummy.
McDuffy Jimison first tasted a Kool-Aid pickle at a homecoming game in Greenville in the early 1990s. At first intrigued by the fare, she soon resolved to make it better. Back then the concession stand offered two longtime Kool-Aid flavors: tropical punch and cherry. McDuffy Jimison serves two clear favorites: cherry and grape.
Kool-Aid pickles originated in the Mississippi Delta. They grew so popular that gas station chain Double Quick, which started in the Delta, began to sell Koolickles in stores. Kool-Aid pickles are most commonly found as pickle spears, but McDuffy Jimison’s version uses hamburger slices. She said they absorb the Kool-Aid sweetness more completely.
“If you don’t want to buy candy, it’s the quickest way to get a sugar rush,” she said, citing customers. 
As the stadium filled up with fans and families, guards moved from the security checkpoint to the bleachers, guns and tactical gear in tow. The crowd of students, faculty and families split as the men in black and navy took their posts around the stadium.

An armed sheriff’s deputy wearing an armored vest stood outside the concession stand. Other deputies with bigger guns and more tactical gear patrolled the grounds. Their presence was a new feature of the homecoming this year. The previous weekend, multiple shootings marred homecoming events across the state. That included a mass shooting after Leland High School’s homecoming.
Officials moved the Gentry High homecoming game from 7 p.m. to 2 p.m., which made for a sweatier experience. Many spectators strode in with umbrellas to shield them from the sun.

Free.,Federal appeals court extends National Guard presence in D.C.,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-appeals-court-extends-national-guard-presence-dc,,"WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court Thursday paused a lower court’s order to remove the National Guard from the streets of Washington, D.C., eight days after two members were attacked in broad daylight in the district.The three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit granted the Trump administration’s request that the Nov. 20 decision finding the Guard presence illegal to be stayed “pending further order of this court.” “The purpose of this administrative stay is to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the motion for stay pending appeal and should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of that motion,” wrote Judges Patricia Millett, Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao.Millett was appointed by former President Barack Obama, and Katsas and Rao were appointed during President Donald Trump’s first term.Roughly 2,000 National Guard troops in D.C. were originally expected to remain in the district through February, according to the lower court’s order.Appeal considered after shootingThe stay comes just over a week after two West Virginia National Guard members were shot on Nov. 26 just blocks from the White House. U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died from her injuries the following day, Thanksgiving. U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, underwent surgery for critical injuries and remains hospitalized.The suspected shooter, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national who was living in Washington state, pleaded not guilty from his hospital bed during a virtual hearing in D.C. Superior Court Tuesday. Lakanwal is charged with first-degree murder while armed,  possession of a firearm, and assault with the intent to kill. The Trump administration filed the emergency motion to stay the lower judge’s order on the day of the shooting. The administration requested the circuit court issue a decision by Dec. 4.Judge Jia Cobb, for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, found the administration’s deployment of more than 2,000 guard troops in the city illegal but stayed her Nov. 20 decision until Dec. 11 to give the administration time to appeal and remove the guard members from the district’s streets.Guard armedTrump initially mobilized 800 National Guard troops to the nation’s capital in August after claiming a “crime emergency” in the district, despite a documented three-decade low in crime.Many were instructed they would be carrying service weapons, The Wall Street Journal reported on Aug. 17. The White House effort was accompanied by a heightened U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement presence in the district.Trump also federalized the district's police force for 30 days as part of a district-wide crackdown. While the federalization of the police force expired, Trump has kept the National Guard in the district.Since then, Republican governors from Louisiana, Ohio, South Carolina and West Virginia, among others, have agreed to send their own Guard members to the district. The mobilization had been tied up in court for months.",,,,2025-12-04 18:58:34.398665

The ruling by Judge Shane Vannatta said that the a minor, known […]","A sample of a Montana driver's license on the MVD website. A Missoula County District Court ruled that the state’s refusal to issue a driver’s license to a nonbinary minor violates the Montana Constitution and that attorneys for the Montana Attorney General’s Office also misinterpreted state law by refusing the license based on sex.
The ruling by Judge Shane Vannatta said that the a minor, known as “M.B.,” has a birth certificate that says “nonbinary,” but state officials refused to issue a license — forcing M.B., to declare either “male” or “female,” which they refuse.
The judge said the state had the ability to issue a driver’s license to M.B., but instead refused to do so because it wouldn’t accommodate the nonbinary status, therefore discriminating against the minor, solely based on sex. M.B. had otherwise completed all the requirements to obtain a license, according to court records.
In his ruling, Vannatta said the Department of Motor Vehicles (and its parent division, the Montana Department of Justice) is prohibited from denying driver’s licenses to residents based upon their legal sex.
Originally, attorneys for the state had argued M.B. had failed to complete the application, and therefore it couldn’t process it because M.B., would not choose between male and female. Moreover, the state had also argued the software system would only produce a license if one of the two options was selected.
The case began as a Montana Human Rights Bureau complaint. During the investigation conducted by it, a hearing officer determined that the state had indeed discriminated against M.B, but attorneys for the state appealed to the Montana Human Rights Commission, five members of the public selected by the governor, in this case, Gov. Greg Gianforte, a Republican. That commission ruled in favor of the state, overturning the hearing officer, because it stated M.B. had not completed the application in full.
However, Vannatta ruled members had misconstrued the statutes regarding licensing drivers in Montana which requires the legal name, date of birth, and sex. The judge said the birth certificate listed M.B. as nonbinary and is the document that gives the legal name and date of birth.
“The DOJ does not cite to law that only an applicant that can indicate that they are either male or female is a ‘qualified’ applicant,” Vannatta said.
Furthermore, Montana law defines who may not be issued a driver’s license, and nonbinary is not included, court documents said.
“Whether the Motor Vehicles Division could enter M.B.’s ‘sex’ information of nonbinary into the (software system) is not determinative of M.B’s qualification as an applicant,” the court ruling said. “M.B. accurately completed the form. It was the MVD that did not accept the nonbinary designation (M.B.’s legal sex) and that did not enter the information in the system.”
Vannatta said the case raised constitutional issues as well, namely equal protection of the law.
“The equal protection clause requires that ‘all persons be treated alike under like circumstances,’” Vannatta said. “…The State of Montana issued M.B., a birth certificate with designation of nonbinary. Then the DMV denied M.B., the ability to obtain a driver’s license when they listed their legal sex as nonbinary while, at the same time allowing applicants who list their legal sex as either male or female to obtain a driver’s license.
“This is arbitrary and discriminatory state action that does not treat all applicants for a driver’s license under like circumstances and therefore it is unlawful under Montana’s equal protection clause.”
Vannatta also cited Montana law which said a government agency cannot deny a license or charter due to a person’s sex.
“The plain language of the statutes is that it is unlawful discriminatory practice for the state to deny a person privileges because of sex unless based on reasonable grounds,” Vannatta said.
The judge said the state has no reasonable grounds for denying a driver license based on sex, and indeed, having different options — male and female — proves that sex is not a reasonable ground to deny a license.
Subsequently, the state argued that changing the software would cost an estimated $50,000 to add other options. Vannatta’s order noted that since the case began, Montana had switched software systems. During the bidding process, it had the option of making the change, but still declined. It now said it would cost between $30,000 and $40,000 to make the change to the sex category, even though the entire software system was reported at $100,000.
Vannatta also awarded M.B., and their parents, attorney’s fees and costs as part of the lawsuit.
The Montana Attorney General’s Office did not respond to requests for comment before publication, including whether it planned to appeal the decision to the Montana Supreme Court, the state’s only appellate court.
“Transgender and nonbinary people should not be forced to choose choose inaccurate gender markers, while cisgender residents face no such barriers,” said American Civil Liberties Union Executive Director Akilah Deernose. “Today, the court agreed that the practice of gender identity discrimination violates our constitution and our state Human Rights Act by unlawfully singling out transgender and nonbinary Montanans for unequal treatment.”

Border Patrol sweeps began this week Southeast Louisiana as part of the Trump administration’s Operation Catahoula Crunch. (Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)NEW ORLEANS — The Louisiana Attorney General’s office and Louisiana State Police say a new state law that criminalizes any act intended to “hinder, delay, prevent, or otherwise interfere with or thwart federal immigration enforcement efforts” will not be used to prosecute speech, such as guidance on how to respond to immigration enforcement agents during raids and arrests.
The assertion came in response to a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana on behalf of the Immigration Services and Legal Advocacy, which argued that the law, passed earlier this year, is overly vague and could be used to criminalize protected speech, such as “know-your-rights” trainings and presentations, in violation of the First Amendment. Civil rights groups and, as of this week, even the New Orleans City Council, have offered such guidance in response to operation “Catahoula Crunch,” the stepped-up immigration enforcement action that began on Wednesday.
As written, Act 399 of 2025 does not specify which acts could be interpreted as interfering with immigration enforcement. It purports to criminalize “any act” that could “hinder, delay, prevent, or otherwise interfere with or thwart federal immigration enforcement efforts” with penalties of as much as $5,000 in fines and a year behind bars.
“This case is about the State of Louisiana’s unlawful attempts to use the threat of vague and overbroad felony charges to silence the residents of New Orleans, Louisiana, from speaking out about the rights of immigrants during the federal operation dubbed ‘Catahoula Crunch’ or ‘Operation Swamp Sweep,’” the ACLU’s complaint said.
When news broke last month that hundreds of Border Patrol agents would be deployed to the New Orleans area, ISLA — which provides pro bono legal services to people in immigration detention — began receiving a large number of requests for know-your-rights training sessions. Such sessions typically offer legal guidance on how to assert your constitutional rights, including the right to remain silent or to demand a search warrant, in the event that a federal immigration officer stops you or comes knocking at your door.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But the group recently stopped providing such trainings, according to the suit, out of fear that they could face arrest — or that their advice could make others vulnerable to criminal prosecution — under the new obstruction law.
The group cited a series of statements from Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill in recent weeks warning that the law could be used against people who oppose or challenge immigration enforcement agents.
However, in a Thursday court filing Murrill’s office said that the law does not cover “pure speech” such as know-your-rights presentations. According to the filing, the law was intended to prevent “violent scenes where defendants have physically inhibited a law-enforcement officer from carrying out his duties.”
“There’s an understanding and agreement as to how this statute will be applied and that it will not be applied to violate your client’s constitutional rights,” U.S. District Judge Nanette Jolivette Brown said on Thursday, at the end of a court hearing.
The subject of the hearing was a request from ISLA and the ACLU for the judge to issue a temporary restraining order prohibiting the defendants — Murill’s office, the Orleans Parish District Attorney’s Office, the New Orleans Police Department and the Louisiana State Police — from using the law to prosecute know-your-rights trainings.
Jolivette Brown did not rule on the motion on Thursday, but the plaintiffs said Murrill’s assurances constituted a victory.
“ This is a win today,” said Nora Ahmed, the legal director of the ACLU of Louisiana. “That filing that is now in the record is a win. No matter what happens to this case, that filing sits there, that filing now becomes the manner in which this law is going to be used, and it provides necessary clarity to so many people.”
According to Ahmed, a number of community organizations submitted a letter to Murrill’s office last week asking for clarity on how the state law would be used. According to Ahmed, that clarity wasn’t offered until the state’s filing on Thursday.
“What we ended seeing this morning was something you don’t see often … which was that the Attorney General as a defendant in this case, and also defendant Hodges, who is the head of the Louisiana State Police, ultimately agreed that the law would not be used to prosecute ISLA in any way as it relates to their trainings and presentations,” Ahmed said.
“Importantly, they went even further than that and they actually provided some very important and critical parameters around the law,” Ahmed added. “And those parameters included that the law was ultimately, apparently conceived for addressing violent conduct. And that particular understanding on the part of the people of New Orleans and the state of Louisiana is critical because now they can engage freely in protest activities.”
Asked for comment, a spokesperson for the Louisiana Attorney General’s Office referred Verite News to a social media post from Murrill. In the post, Murrill said that the ACLU of Louisiana had “filed a lawsuit over nothing—there is no First Amendment problem with Act 399” and that her office was grateful that the court had declined to issue a temporary restraining order, as initially requested.

(Photo by Caity Coyne/West Virginia Watch)Proceedings wrapped Thursday for a hearing regarding a requested appeal of the Department of Environmental Protection’s Air Quality Board’s decision to grant a permit to Fundamental Data for the construction of a natural gas power plant in Tucker County.
The request for an appeal came from the three organizations — the West Virginia Highlands Conservancy, the Sierra Club and Tucker United, a grassroots organization that formed in Tucker County earlier this year to fight against the power plant as well as the proposed data center that it could one day power.
The citizen groups — represented by Mike Becher, a senior attorney with Appalachian Mountain Advocates — requested the appeal in September. In filings to the board, they allege generally that the permit granted to Fundamental Data in August fails to meet standards set by the state’s Air Pollution Control Act. 
The citizens cited numerous specific objections to the permit. The most pressing objection questions the DEP’s determination that the proposed project qualifies as a “minor” source of pollution, which means it would be subject to laxer regulations regarding emissions. In filings, the organizations question whether this designation from the Air Quality Board was “arbitrary, capricious or otherwise contrary to the law given the ability (and likelihood) of the facility to operate well above the limits established …” Other similarly sized and operated power plants, they continue, are “typically” permitted as “major sources.”
The proposed power plant would use gas-fueled turbines with heat recovery steam generators to operate, according to Fundamental Data’s permit application. Diesel would be kept on site in three 10 million gallon storage tanks as a backup power source in case of gas line interruptions. Those tanks would be 66 feet tall and 180 feet in diameter. Leaks from pumps and valves, among other pieces of equipment, are to be expected per the application. Operations for the facility should begin by 2028.
Annually, the facility would have the potential to emit 99 tons of nitrogen oxides, 56 tons of carbon monoxide and 44 tons of volatile organic compounds.
And aside from the emissions, the complex — once completed — could take up more than 10,000 acres between the outdoor tourism-dependent towns of Thomas and Davis.
The citizen groups have argued that heavy redactions within the permit application used to calculate potential annual emissions make it impossible for the public to understand the “practical effect” of the actual emissions.
Fundamental Data — which acted as an intervenor in the appeal case — has said these redactions are necessary due to the information being “confidential business information.” Earlier this year, the DEP agreed that the company met standards that allow it to keep that information secret.
Last month, the Air Quality Board  — a type of judicial panel responsible for ruling in these kinds of cases — issued a protective order allowing some of the redacted information to be made available to parties in the appeal case. Anyone who was allowed access to the information, per the order, was required to destroy it upon completion of the hearing. That order came after a previous board hearing was held in the case in November. 
This week, discussion of the redacted information was kept under seal during the proceedings, meaning the public still was not able to hear any arguments or testimony regarding its contents. Redacted information in the case includes emissions data, the number and size of the turbines that will be on site and details regarding the make and model of some equipment.
In their appeal, the citizen groups are essentially asking the board  to revoke Fundamental Data’s permit and make information that was used to grant the permit in the first place available to the public.
The hearing took place from Wednesday into Thursday morning, with numerous witnesses ranging from Tucker County residents and local political leaders to engineers familiar with the technical aspects of the proposed project.
‘We deserve to know those basic things’: Residents speak out against permit
Taking the stand Wednesday morning, Canaan Valley resident Amy Margolies told members of the board she lives about an eight minute drive from where the proposed power plant would be located. She said she moved to West Virginia — and specifically the Canaan Valley region — in June 2016 to be closer to nature.
“I moved here to be in the outdoors, in this great area and in a small community with tight relationships, a place where you don’t have to lock your car,” Margolies said. “… I think anyone who has been to Canaan Valley or Blackwater Falls, Davis or Thomas knows how much of a gem this area is. It’s really special in the United States and even with the state of West Virginia.”
A mother of two and with a background in public health, Margolies said she’s acutely concerned about her family’s health and what could happen if this power plant is built less than two miles from her 5-year-old son’s school, where she coaches his soccer team.
“There is information in my brain from my education and my experience that makes me legitimately concerned for my children, for my family,” Margolies said. “… I have health issues in my family that provide certain vulnerabilities. We all know that comorbidities can be a concern for many people. For children, the elderly — air quality is a huge part of that, and exposure over a period of time is really a concern.”
Recently, she said, her husband who is in his early 40s suffered a pulmonary embolism. Since chronic exposure to air pollution — specifically from fine particulate matter and nitrogen oxides — has been linked to increased risks of blood clots, she said she’s concerned about what having those emissions in the air around their home would mean for him.
“That’s something I can’t stop thinking about,” she said. 
Margolies, in response to questions from Becher, told the board that the redactions in the air quality permit application have made it difficult for her and her neighbors to gauge the real risk that could come with this power plant. Essentially, she said, they’ve been asked to trust a company — Fundamental Data — that has refused to work with or hear directly from concerned residents.
“… Basically what we’re being told here as the public is that we should take someone else’s word [that this is safe],” Margolies said. “I don’t even know this person. We’ve invited this person to our community, and they won’t come and I’m just really concerned. Why should I take someone else’s word for it, when they won’t even tell us, in plain words, with basic information, how tall will smokestacks be?”
She said that if the power plant becomes reality and if no effort is made to allow community members to know more about its operations, she will have to strongly reconsider moving her family.
“It would break my heart, but I can’t allow my children to be exposed to that risk,” Margolies said. “… I think, as a mom, we deserve to know those basic things, because I coach soccer right there [and] I moved here for my child to play soccer in front of a forest, not in the shadow of a smoke stack. I think we deserve the minimum amount of information to understand how that will impact our lives.”
Davis Mayor Alan Tomson took the stand following Margolies. Tomson told the board that he did have concerns over the proposed power plant and was put off by the way the project came to be. The decisions and actions by Fundamental Data, he said, made it difficult to fully trust the company or understand how his community could change if the power plant and data center complex were built.
Tomson said he only learned of the project when a resident called to inform him of a notice in the local newspaper. From there, he said, it was difficult to get further information and the redactions in the air quality permit application made the true scope of the project hard to grasp.
He told the board that he would have felt more confident without those redactions. It’s not right, he said, that worries from residents aren’t being treated seriously and he himself holds grave concerns over how the operation could impact his town’s tourism revenue, quality of life and more.
Marilyn Shoenfeld, a Davis resident who serves as board president for the West Virginia Highlands Conservancy, echoed the concerns of Tomson and Margolies. Shoenfeld said she’s lived in Tucker County since 2007. Now, almost two decades later, she still greatly enjoys and takes advantage of the outdoor recreation opportunities around her.
“We moved here because of clean air, the healthy environment, the natural resources, the protected public lands, the availability of hiking, of access to Dolly Sods and the wonderful small towns of Davis and Thomas,” Shoenfeld said. “My concern is that the air quality will be deteriorated, and that it will affect the various habitats and environments, including the Canaan Valley National Wildlife refuge … as well as the towns of Davis and Thomas.”
She also worries that emissions — even if they don’t exceed the levels listed in the air quality permit application — will impact her health. Further, she said, it’s been impossible to accurately gauge what the effect will be from the development since critical information is redacted.
“The permit was so thoroughly redacted that you really could not tell what was going on,” Shoenfeld said. 
In an effort to learn more, Shoenfeld said the Highlands Conservancy offered to hold a meeting with Fundamental Data in Canaan Valley. The company, she said, refused. The organization then proposed to produce and pay for dispersion modeling to learn more about how the emissions and potential haze from the facility would spread. Again, she said, they were turned down.
Without knowing more, Shoenfeld said she would feel better seeing the project dedicated as a major source so it would be subject to higher regulations and testing standards.
The efficacy of potential annual emissions
Ron Sahu, a mechanical engineer with a Ph.D. in coal combustion from Caltech, was next to testify in the hearing, taking the stand as an expert witness.
Sahu told the board that he’s consulted on many air quality permits nationwide and was surprised to see that the application from Fundamental Data was for a “minor” pollution source. He said that while he understands that’s the preference of the company, it’s difficult for him to understand how that would work in practice, especially given the size and scope of the power plant.
Sahu also said he’s dealt with hundreds of air quality permits in his line of work and had never seen redactions allowed to the extent that they have been in this application. While Sahu was allowed to view and testify upon redacted information in a closed session for the hearing, the information was not able to be discussed publicly.
Based on his own scaling and calculations, Sahu testified publicly that it’s unlikely the emissions from the power plant would remain within the limits provided on Fundamental Data’s permit application.
There is too much variability, he continued, to say with any confidence that emissions would not exceed the standards that define a “minor” or “major” source. He used examples of how weather could impact how hot fuel is burnt, changes to emissions during start-up and shut-downs of a cycle and the kind of gas — methane or diesel — that would be used at different times. 
Without more specifics, he said, there’s no guarantee that emissions would be capped where they need to be.
“So this is a permit by algebra, and it means nothing because the variability can overwhelm you,” Sahu said. 
Sahu said the decision to treat this plant as a minor source and not doing major source modeling — especially without having continuous emissions monitoring, which is not required of the project — is giving misleading results. 
“You are pretending here that you can actually demonstrate that you will be below the major source threshold, but even under the best of times, even if you had continuous monitoring — and here you don’t even have that — you’re truly flying blind,” Sahu said.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced that its operation is targeting “criminal illegal aliens.”
The Associated Press initially reported in November that 250 Border Patrol agents would conduct immigration sweeps in Louisiana and Mississippi starting Dec. 1. The operation will last two months and DHS plans to arrest 5,000 people, according to the AP.
The threat of increased immigration enforcement has created unease for New Orleans’ service industry, which relies on immigrant workers. Restaurants and other hospitality businesses are facing the possibility that they might be targeted by federal agents in raids and other enforcement operations. For hospitality workers who are vulnerable, going to work poses the risk of being arrested.
“I can’t even imagine the [question] of, ‘Do I go to work and risk being taken, or do I stay home and not make money and then my family suffers.’ That is such a crazy choice to have to make,” said Jolie Gautreau, a bartender at Blue Oak BBQ.

Immigration sweeps in Chicago created staffing shortages and safety concerns, according to reporting from Block Club Chicago. In Charlotte, it brought widespread fear among restaurant employees and patrons, the Charlotte Observer reported.
“I’m just hoping it’s not as bad as we’re all concerned about. I don’t have high hopes for that, though, based on what we’ve already seen elsewhere,” Gautreau said.
At least one restaurant has closed its doors in response to the heightened enforcement in New Orleans when Taqueria Guerrero, a Mexican restaurant in Mid-City, announced on Sunday (Nov. 30) that it would temporarily close as to not put anyone at risk.

“I think it’s fair to say that what makes the New Orleans dining scene as a whole so incredibly unique is being threatened,” said Kristin Sparks, co-owner of Annunciation Restaurant.
Latino communities have been most targeted by federal immigration sweeps in other cities. The same is expected in New Orleans.
In 2024, 14% of the population in metro New Orleans was Hispanic, according to census data cited in a report from The Data Center. Nine percent of New Orleans’ population was Hispanic, and Jefferson Parish had the highest Hispanic population at 20%. Hispanics accounted for the vast majority of growth in the metro area from 2010-20, according to the report.
Hispanic workers made up 15.7% of workers in greater New Orleans’ service industry in 2024, according to the Louisiana Workforce Commission.
“New Orleans is basically a melting pot, and so the contributions that they lend to our community, whether it’s, you know, in the workforce or in our culture and our food. I mean, they play a vital role in that,” Sparks said.
Sparks said she hasn’t received much guidance from elected officials, the New Orleans Police Department, or hospitality industry leaders on how to prepare for law enforcement potentially targeting restaurants.
New Orleans & Company, the city’s marketing arm for tourism, sent a statement to its hospitality members on Nov. 19 addressing the impending crackdown. The statement emphasized that New Orleans is accustomed to local, state and federal law enforcement coordinating their efforts.
“New Orleans is committed to being a safe and welcoming city for our residents and visitors.  Many crime statistics are at record lows and we applaud the ongoing efforts of the NOPD, Louisiana State Police and all the other local, regional, state and federal partners that support their efforts,” New Orleans & Company President and CEO Walt Leger said in the statement.
“Local businesses and organizations are required to comply with the lawful requests of law enforcement officials, including CBP and ICE agents, but it is ok to ask what agency they represent and validate their credentials,” Leger added.
Restaurants are preparing for the possibility that federal agents could enter their establishment to conduct an audit of its employees or carry out a raid.
When Caitlin Carney, owner at Porgy’s Seafood Market, first heard reports about federal agents coming to the city, she was initially uncertain how to prepare and protect her employees who could be vulnerable.
She considered joining other businesses by putting signs in the windows saying that ICE and other federal agents aren’t welcome inside, or that immigrants are safe in their restaurants.

“At first I was like, I didn’t want to put anything up outside because, like, I didn’t want to be encouraging any entry [by agents]. I wasn’t really sure, and so I was just putting up ‘do not enter’ signs and making sure everybody had protocol in their pockets,” Carney said.
But she was encouraged to post signs as a show of unity. She also received guidance from the Immigrant Legal Resource Center on how to prepare for a visit from federal agents.
“They gave me a lot of facts about what’s legal and what’s not, and what’s working in other cities and what’s not, and also I was then able to have them tell my Spanish speaking employees exactly what they told me, so that it was very, very clear,” Carney said.
Others have taken a tougher stance against federal agents potentially entering their establishments.
“We’re instructed not to let them in the building, not to serve them any food. They’re not allowed in here, they’re not welcome in here,” said Shawn Clark, a manager at Toups’ Meatery.
The Louisiana Restaurant Association published a news release addressing potential immigration enforcement at businesses. The release said that federal agents can legally enter public areas such as dining rooms, but cannot enter back-of-house areas like kitchens without a judicial warrant. LRA says agents will likely request I-9 forms and employers should be prepared to present them upon request.
“Business owners and managers should know their rights and be prepared to document any interactions with enforcement agents,” the news release said.
Guidelines published in January by the National Restaurant Association’s Law Center outline how hospitality establishments can prepare for heightened immigration enforcement, specifically from Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The organization encouraged employers to be in I-9 compliance and establish a rapid response plan in the event of an ICE visit. It said that if enforcement occurs, it’s likely that law enforcement will only initiate an audit of employees. In this case, it said employers should contact legal counsel immediately and gather and verify documents.
If a raid occurs, the organization suggests that employers request a warrant from agents, and to monitor but not interfere with the raid.
Protests in opposition to the operation have already begun in New Orleans. Mass ICE arrests have recently occurred in New Orleans at the Lowe’s on Elysian Field on Dec. 3, at a Home Depot in Gretna on Nov. 26 and at a boat launch in Kenner on Nov. 8.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A member of a governing board said Thursday he won’t recuse himself after a utility company complained he was biased against them. 
Corporation Commissioner Todd Hiett said he was simply doing his job and that his fellow, and future, commissioners should be concerned if a utility is trying to silence a member of the board. 
Oklahoma Gas & Electric Company, or OG&E, requested that Hiett recuse himself from a case that would allow the company to expand its power generation sites because of “unacceptable bias” against the utility.
The Oklahoma Corporation Commission is a three-person statewide elected board that regulates the state’s oil and gas, utility and transportation industries.
In a November filing, OG&E attorney Chase Snodgrass said Hiett called OG&E “evil” and a monopoly spreading “propaganda.”
At a Corporation Commission meeting Thursday, Hiett said he won’t apologize for “doing his job.”
“I find it to be very disturbing that a regulated utility would take action to intimidate and squelch the voice of one of its regulators, for simply doing his job,” Hiett said. “I think rate payers will be outraged, and rightly so, to find out that a monopoly utility of which they are captive customers is using bullying tactics in an effort to cut off the voice of the regulators charged with ensuring reasonable cost of electricity.”
He said OG&E sent out mailers with “propaganda” to ratepayers. OG&E has denied sending mailers. 
“I’ve done my job and I cannot, I will not, apologize for doing what my oath of office and the state Constitution requires of us, and that is to provide oversight of regulated monopoly rates,” Hiett said.
Snodgrass attempted to respond to Hiett’s comments twice at Thursday’s meeting, but was denied. Hiett said the agenda item was “his posting” so OG&E’s attorney would not be recognized. 
Kim David, chair of the commission, told Snodgrass that OG&E could file a written response.
OG&E attorneys declined to comment after the meeting, instead referring questions to their communications division. 
Christi Woodworth, vice president of marketing and communications for OG&E, said in a statement that the company has “confidence” that the other commissioners will support the projects for “much-needed generation capacity.” 
“Commissioner Hiett’s attacks even today clearly demonstrate an unacceptable bias against and hostility towards the company, which is why OG&E was forced to request his recusal,” she said. “Commissioner Hiett did not deny any allegations made against him.”

DemasTwo days out from their next scheduled meeting, members of Michigan’s energy regulatory body held an online comment session regarding a set of proposed contracts between one of the state’s largest energy companies and a massive data center slated for construction in Washtenaw County. 
Shortly after the announcement that the controversial project – spearheaded by ChatGPT creator OpenAI, tech giant Oracle and developer Related Digital – would move forward in Saline Township, DTE Energy filed a request with the Michigan Public Service Commission seeking approval of two contracts to supply 1.4 gigawatts of power to the facility.
The utility requested ex parte approval of both contracts, which would allow the deal to move forward without public hearing requirements. However, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel filed a request to intervene in the case, as did several environmental and consumer advocacy groups, asking the public safety commission to treat the matter as a contested case, allowing different parties to intervene, request discovery and file testimony for the commission to review before making a decision on the contracts.
While DTE argues its request would not increase rates for existing customers, making it eligible for expedited approval, Nessel along with several other intervenors have called that claim into question, demanding an opportunity to further review the proposal and ensure DTE ratepayers will not face extra  costs as the company supplies power to the facility.
Though the commission has yet to make a decision on whether to allow a contested case, it did host an online public comment period Wednesday evening. While Nessel criticized the move noting that without a contested case declaration the forum would “amount to little more than performative listening” she noted in a statement following the forum that the commission can consider comments offered at the forum and online in its decision on whether to open the case up to scrutiny – but not in approving or denying the contracts. 
“It is overwhelmingly clear from both the comments shared tonight and the majority of the nearly 5,000 public comments submitted online that Michigan’s residents share in our concerns and demand transparency,” Nessel said. “I again urge the [commission] to listen to the people of this State, to whom they should feel dutybound to represent and defend, to do the right thing and deny DTE’s request to approve these special contracts without a full, contested hearing.”
Ahead of the meeting, a group of 23 Democratic lawmakers sent a letter to Commission Chair Dan Scripps opposing DTE’s request to fast track approval while asking Scripps to move forward with a hearing on the matter.
“Expert witness testimony is necessary to ensure that information provided to the [commission] is accurate and that the proposed contracts do not harm ratepayers and the people of this state,” the letter reads. “The [commission] cannot make an informed and fair decision in this matter without conducting a contested proceeding.”
Among the comments submitted to the commission – many of which are in opposition to DTE’s approval request, or the data center in general – Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer submitted her own comments in support of the multibillion dollar project, which her office has touted as the “largest investment in Michigan history.”
“Right now, time is of the essence. There is a shortage of global computing capacity, and China is moving aggressively to build their own centers and get a leg up on America. At the same time, other states are moving fast too, competing against Michigan to land similar projects with far less oversight,” Whitmer said in her comment. “This is a matter of national security and economic competitiveness, and if we do not act, it will cost us thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of investment in our economy.”
According to DTE’s application, the project will create 2,500 construction jobs and 450 permanent jobs on-site. 
DTE has asked the commission to make a decision on its requests by Dec. 5. Though the Commission is slated to meet on Friday, the agenda it shared Thursday afternoon does not list the special contracts as an item for consideration.
With another large energy company, Consumers Energy, recently receiving approval from the commission to adjust its rate structure for facilities demanding large amounts of energy – like data centers – DTE’s attorneys argue regulators do not need to engage in another contested case as the terms of its contracts are “equally protective” as those laid out in the Consumers case. 
Nessel, however, remains skeptical, arguing the company fails to implement terms required by the Consumers Energy case, while criticizing its application for offering “insufficient explanation of ratepayer impacts.” She also slammed the company for heavy redactions in the publicly available version of the contract.
“DTE continues to push for a rubber-stamp approval of a secret deal, but time and again, my office has contested their filings – and time after time, the utility has shown it is not a trustworthy partner, routinely filling cases with unjustified costs,” Nessel said. “We must be able to scrutinize DTE’s ability to sell this massive amount of electricity without negatively impacting residents. No matter how DTE tries to explain it away, this case – involving hundreds of millions of dollars in costs just to connect the data center to DTE’s power grid – should be treated as contested like any other.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_3478-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-04 17:59:39.308220

(Photo by Kenneth Zirkel/Courtesy of Brown University)Dr. Ashish Jha — one of the most recognizable public health experts during the COVID-19 pandemic, and at one point a leader of the federal response to the virus — is leaving his post at Brown University’s School of Public Health. 
Jha will step down at the end of December to spearhead “an initiative that aims to bolster the nation’s defenses against emerging pandemic and biological threats,” the school announced Thursday. The unnamed initiative will continue the work Jha started in April 2022 as the White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator.
But that was all the information available Thursday about Jha’s new venture.
“At this time there are no additional details to be shared on what he is doing next,” Rob Hancock, a spokesperson for the School of Public Health, said in an email.
Jha said in emailed comments Thursday evening that his new venture will be informed by his time at Brown and as a face of the federal response to COVID — experiences which taught him how to communicate public health challenges to non-scientists.
“That starts with recognizing that communication is a two way street,” Jha said. “It’s easy to think about what we want to say but it’s more important to understand what questions people have and how we can meet their needs with clear, reliable information.”

In the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, Jha was among the most public-facing health experts. Jha told STAT News in 2021 that at his busiest, he was making between 10 and 12 TV appearances a day, which amounted to thousands of appearances overall.  
Jha took temporary leave from Brown to work at the White House. Jha was the third coronavirus response coordinator, following Jeff Zients, who was also appointed by Biden, and Deborah Birx, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in his first term.
Jha has continued to think about health care in a federal context, especially during the second iteration of the Trump administration. In recent months, Jha has published opinion pieces in the Boston Globe and he continues to write A Moment in Health, a blog on Substack about public health issues. Posts have explored issues like “What Should We Learn from an Anti-Vaccine Conference?” and “The real danger isn’t Tylenol, it’s bad information.”
Jha’s essay on the latter was meant to counter U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s comments linking over-the-counter pain relievers to autism. Jha joined the chorus of scientists and medical professionals who discredited Kennedy’s comments, and added that Kennedy’s “insinuation” was “false and profoundly cruel.”
In another piece he criticized Kennedy for “openly and consistently disregard[ing] scientific evidence.” 
The pandemic’s successes in public policy, Jha wrote, “came from effectively and respectfully pursuing the scientific process.” 
“Even the pandemic’s most controversial policy — vaccine mandates — was reasonable in April 2021, when health experts believed that vaccination would prevent most infections and transmission, but certainly did not make sense by April 2023, when we knew that vaccinations had only a modest impact on transmission,” Jha wrote.
Still, Jha remains an advocate for vaccines as a necessary instrument for public health, especially mRNA vaccines, which he described in an August essay as “the technology best positioned to defend its people against future biological threats.”
Jha’s new gig comes amid changes in national Health and Human Services policy initiatives under Kennedy, changes that often directly contrast Jha’s own public assertions about health policy. The most recent example is an attempt to tweak hepatitis vaccine guidance for infants by rolling back universal shots for newborns. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention committee meeting Thursday to decide whether to change the guidance postponed the vote until Friday. 
Kennedy’s office has also tried to limit COVID-19 vaccine recommendations and mRNA vaccine development by cancelling contracts and solicitations.  
Contemporaneous with Jha’s pandemic experience was his five-year tenure at Brown. Jha arrived right around the same time that COVID hit, and in the subsequent years, Jha oversaw growth in enrollment and the launch of a new School of Public Health space in Providence plus a satellite location in Washington, D.C. 
“His legacy at Brown will be his cultivation of high-impact initiatives that improve the health and lives of millions of people around the world,” Brown President Christina H. Paxson said in a statement Thursday. “We have strengthened our reputation for leveraging data and science to develop solutions to complex public health challenges.”
Graduate student enrollment at the School of Public Health has more than doubled since 2020 under Jha’s tenure, according to Brown.
Dr. Francesca L. Beaudoin, a professor of epidemiology and emergency medicine, will serve as the public health school’s interim dean starting Jan. 1, according to Brown. The School of Public Health includes 150 faculty, 800 graduate and undergrad students, and 13 research centers. It receives about $90 million in outside funding annually.

(Photo by Tim Lambert/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)An automatic cost of living adjustment bumped state lawmakers’ salaries to $113,000 per year, for rank and file members. 
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, Pennsylvania legislators are among the highest paid in the country. The average pay for a state lawmaker nationally is $47,904, but that includes part-time legislatures.
The commonwealth’s legislature is full-time, convening in Harrisburg throughout the year. This year, there were 75 scheduled session days for House members, with three more on the calendar for later this month. The Senate met for 51 days, and has two more scheduled for before the year ends.
The raises are doled out automatically each year based on consumer price metrics. Legislation enacting the cost-of-living raises was enacted in 1995 and, as it stands, the pay bumps do not require a vote by lawmakers. Though some would like to change the practice.

In a now-infamous episode, lawmakers voted on a raise for themselves in 2005, during a 2 a.m. session. Legislators would have received raises of between 16% and 34%, depending on their position. However, the law was ultimately repealed. There was significant backlash from the public, and it resulted in a tidal wave of resignations and reelection losses.
A number of bills have been introduced over the years that would get rid of the automatic raise, including several this year. One introduced this session is sponsored by Rep. Stephanie Borowicz (R-Clinton).
Another introduced by Sen. Lisa Baker (R-Luzerne) in January would allow lawmakers to refuse their cost-of-living wage.
Rep. Jeremy Shaffer (R-Allegheny) introduced a bill that would suspend automatic pay raises for legislators, the governor and the lieutenant governor any year that a budget is not passed by the constitutional deadline.
This year’s budget, which was due on June 30, was passed on Nov. 12.
“I think it’s completely unacceptable that it’s become the norm that our budget is late,” Shaffer said. “There needs to be some consequences”

Shaffer, who was elected on a reform platform that included support for term limits, also opposes the automatic raises more broadly. Moreover, he would like to see the legislature changed a full-time one to a part-time. 
As it stands, state lawmakers have a handful of session days scheduled every month, and often spend the rest of their time performing constituent outreach. Generally, a part-time legislature meets for one fixed block of time, spending weeks or months in the capital each year, to pass a budget and any new policies. The pay, too, is reflective of a part-time job, and many lawmakers hold other jobs.
“It helps people stay more focused,” Shaffer said. “And it helps when they return to their districts, they have a regular job and have to interact with their community more.” 
One lawmaker, Rep. Perry Stambaugh (R-Perry), introduced a resolution directing the Legislative Budget and Finance Committee to conduct a study on the possibility of such a change. Shaffer was a co-sponsor.
“In the private industry, pay is tied to performance, and right now there’s no such linkage for the state legislature,” Shaffer added. “Tying pay raises to actually delivering a budget on time seems like a very simple first step to try to tie pay to performance.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0878-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-04 17:59:39.308220

The state comptroller’s office, which manages financial transactions and long-term investments, confirmed the transaction to The Dallas Morning News. The purchase followed bipartisan legislation that passed this year creating a state cryptocurrency investment fund. 
Similar legislation has been approved in several red and blue states, according to tracking from the National Conference of State Legislatures. This year, at least 40 states saw legislation proposed regarding cryptocurrency, digital currencies and other digital assets.
While other states, including Michigan and Wisconsin, have made pension fund investments in cryptocurrency, Texas became the first to invest state dollars, according to The Dallas Morning News.
“The industry is maturing and growing — it’ll continue to become more mainstream, and I think Texas staking out a leadership position will be very beneficial to Texans over time, similar to what the oil and gas industry has done over the last century,” Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council that championed the legislation, told the Dallas newspaper. In a social media post, Bratcher said the transaction occurred late last month.
Citing potential for fraud, blue and red states pass new crypto ATM laws

Cryptocurrencies are digital assets, including bitcoin, that offer an alternative payment method without control of a central bank or government like other currencies. As with other assets, cryptocurrencies are purchased by governments, individuals and institutional investors in hopes that their value will rise over time. But the still-emerging market can be more volatile than traditional investments such as stocks and bonds.
New Hampshire officials recently celebrated the creation of the first municipal bond offering backed by bitcoin. State leaders there already created a cryptocurrency investment fund, though the state has not purchased any of those assets.
“We continue to evaluate our options regarding cryptocurrencies, but we are not ready to move in that direction at this time,” State Treasurer Monica Mezzapelle, told NHPR last month.
In Texas, the sponsor of this year’s legislation said the new crypto fund would help diversify state investments and provide a hedge against inflation and economic volatility.
This year, Texas lawmakers dedicated $10 million to the new fund. In a fiscal note on the legislation, the Legislative Budget Board noted the new fund would be created outside of the state treasury. The fiscal note says that “may limit the Legislature’s ability to make appropriation decisions concerning these funds in the future.”
States Debate Whether to Restrict — Or Invite — Crypto Mining

State interest in crypto comes as federal leaders are increasingly embracing the market.
This summer, President Donald Trump signed into law the GENIUS Act, the first major law governing digital currency. In establishing a regulatory framework for the industry, the president said he hoped the measure would instill more confidence in the industry that spent heavily to lobby federal leaders, according to the Associated Press. 
“This signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit,” the president told crypto executives.

(Photo by Getty Images)Senate lawmakers are mulling legislation that would require county executive superintendents to consolidate small school districts in their jurisdiction, but the fate of mandatory consolidation appeared unclear after the measure’s sponsor indicated Thursday he may require voter approval for the mergers.
The bill sponsored by Sen. Vin Gopal (D-Monmouth), who chairs his chamber’s education committee, would require executive county superintendents to create plans to merge districts with fewer than 500 students who live in the district and establish or grow regional districts.
“We have a lot of government in New Jersey, and I’m hoping this is going to be the start of that conversation on how we can do this humanely and at the same time improve the quality of life and education and also make life better for taxpayers financially,” Gopal said.
School board member sues NJ officials, alleging they stifle free speech

Officials have long considered school consolidation as a means of lowering the cost of public education by eliminating duplicative services and aligning disparate curricula from elementary or middle schools that send older students into combined regional districts. 
But the state’s long-running efforts at voluntary consolidation — including financial incentives and state support for feasibility studies — have created only a handful of mergers, while school expenses continue to drive property tax growth.
School taxes accounted for 52% of local property taxes collected in 2024, according to state data, and the roughly $15 billion in school aid in the current state budget accounts for more than a quarter of all state spending approved for the current fiscal year.
Numerous witnesses who spoke before the education committee Thursday about the bill, called S4861, raised concerns about how mandatory consolidation could cut local officials and parents out of decisions about schooling.
“While the goals of S4861 are understandable, its mandates — particularly the removal of voter approval and the prescriptive consolidation requirements — can produce significant disruption without guaranteed cost savings for education improvement,” said Melanie Schulz, director of government relations for the New Jersey Association of School Administrators.
Backing voluntary mergers, incentivizing shared service agreements, and offering state-funded efficiency audits to districts would be a better path, she said.

The current version of Gopal’s bill would see county executive superintendents draft consolidation plans, which the state education commissioner would approve or deny. If those plans are approved, the bill would require the county superintendent to commission a state-funded feasibility study.
If that study finds a merger would not increase school segregation or create overlarge separations between districts and bring potential for cost savings, a better learning environment, and better-coordinated curricula, the participating schools would merge after five years.
Gopal said he shares concerns about a lack of local approval for school mergers and indicated the bill’s requirement for small districts to merge could change.
“I’m all with you on the voter approval,” he said. “My hope is a county executive [superintendent] or someone is going to show a scenario or a neutral figure: This is what your taxes will be if you do consolidation, this will not. If folks in that community say ‘OK, x, y, and z are going to happen, we want to pay more,’ that’s up to them.”
Some who cautioned against mandatory mergers acknowledged that New Jersey’s non-operating school districts — typically small districts that have a school board but send students to schools in other districts because they do not have any of their own — are ripe for mandatory consolidation.
New Jersey had 16 non-operating school districts in the 2024-2025 school year, according to the Department of Education, out of 695 local education agencies, including 89 charter and renaissance schools.
“It seems like it should be pursued, and I think that was the intent of the law that was passed back in 2007 to start to phase them out. We probably should take another look at that,” said Jonathan Pushman, senior director of advocacy for the New Jersey School Boards Association.
Some others warned that the cost savings from mergers could be overstated, citing state law that requires consolidated districts to use salary guides from the most populous of the districts that would be combined unless each district agrees on another framework.
Salaries in more populous districts tend to be highest, Pushman said.
“Any savings are often offset by necessary investments in existing positions that have to take on more responsibility and new positions to serve the regional,” he said. “It should be noted that 70 to 80% of a school district’s budget is wrapped up in those labor costs, and they won’t go down due to regionalizations.”
Officials from some of the state’s consolidated districts gave a more favorable view of mergers.
The Henry Hudson Regional School District, which absorbed districts in Highlands and Atlantic Highlands following a 2023 referendum, saw improved curriculum continuity, greater purchasing power, increased grant access, and lower costs following the merger, said Tara Beams, the district’s superintendent.
Bob Morrison, a member of the Watchung Hills Regional High School District’s board, cautioned against allowing individual districts to disrupt regionalization studies, warning they have too much ability to slow or complicate the process under the current system.
Watchung Hills last month released a study on the feasibility of merging with nearby districts in Watchung, Long Hill, and Green Brook. Morrison said delayed data reporting, uneven engagement, inconsistent messaging, and leaked draft communications complicated the study process.
“To be direct, I have never seen so many grown adults afraid of what may be revealed in a study, ever,” he said. “The incentive today is to do nothing, to keep the status quo, to do things the way they’ve always been done, and that should be unacceptable when improving our students’ education is at stake.”
The bill did not see a vote Thursday, and Gopal indicated he intends to pass the measure — which is expected to see changes — next year.
Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill, who takes office on Jan. 20, has said she favors incentivizing mergers but views compulsory consolidation as an option.
“I’d start by offering the carrot to help the areas that want to consolidate, but when there are areas that are not putting enough money into students, into educators, into the buildings, and then they are taking a lot of money in property taxes and from the state level, then we’ll have to start to look at compulsory movements,” Sherrill said during a debate in September.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/studentsinclassroom-1024x686.jpeg,,,2025-12-04 17:59:39.308220

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma higher education officials allocated $3.4 million in grants to seven colleges and universities to fund artificial intelligence innovation. 
The grants provide “seed money” to implement artificial intelligence technology across Oklahoma higher education institutions. The funding for the Innovations with AI Program comes from the State Regents’ System Innovation Fund, which is appropriated dollars. 
The program aligns with the long-term goals of the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education, according to a meeting agenda. The State Regents received 20 proposals from higher education institutions. 
“Providing these ‘seed money’ grants for comprehensive AI-driven projects represents a bold step to position state system colleges and universities to maximize the impact and sustainability of AI applications in higher education,” said Courtney Warmington, chair of the State Regents. “By investing in technology innovations today, we are preparing our campuses and the students they serve for new workplace frontiers tomorrow.”
Southeastern Oklahoma State University is the recipient of nearly half a million dollars and representatives for the school spoke to the Regents at a meeting Thursday about their proposal. 
“This fund will be a game changer for Southeastern,” said Eric Kennedy, a professor at the university. “These types of dollars for an institution like us don’t come along every day.” 
The funds approved for the school will fund the creation of an AI tool for a “learning management system” to evaluate online classes and professors as well as physical AI workstations and tools available to students, he said. 
“The whole goal of this is to make our students better agents for their employers when they get out of Southeastern and they enter the workforce,” Kennedy said. 
The University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma, University of Central Oklahoma, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center and Rose State College each received a $500,000 grant. 
Murray State College and Oklahoma State University each received grants just under $500,000. 
Other proposals include projects “AI agents” for admissions support and student guidance, integrating “realtime” market analytics into curriculum, training secure artificial intelligence models with patient data for “clinical research and professional training,” and to use the technology to automate “low-level tasks.” One proposal would use AI to extract, validate and transfer information from documents like transcripts, applications and other forms. 
Nick Hathaway, vice chancellor for budget and finance, said the program has encouraged institutions to innovate with AI to “enhance the student experience” and monitor online instruction. 
“What we received through these proposals, as I’ve heard the chancellor say, is evidence that Oklahoma’s colleges and universities are leading the way in deploying artificial intelligence to achieve efficiencies and answering the call to educate our state workforce about artificial intelligence,” he said.

(Photo courtesy Magdalena Public Library)Six of New Mexico’s rural public libraries recently received grant funding to expand programming and services offered to children.
The New Mexico libraries were six of the 39 small libraries that received a combined total of $220,050 in grant funds through the Ohio-based John Henry Eldred Jr. Foundation. Awardees are located in states across the country. The New Mexico libraries include the Magdalena Public Library; Truchas Library; Silver City Public Library; Moise Memorial Library in Santa Rosa; the Lordsburg Hidalgo Library; and Socorro Public Library.
According to a news release from the foundation, grant requests ranged from books and educational tools to expanded access to technology and opportunities to engage with youth.
“Rural libraries are more than buildings with books. They are lifelines for their communities,” Mike Deetsch, executive director of the John Henry Eldred Jr. Foundation, said in a statement. “We are proud to invest in the innovative ways these libraries foster belonging, literacy, and opportunity.”
Grant awards were between $1,500 to $10,000, based on the scope of each library’s project description. The Magdalena Public Library received $5,500, Director Jerri Hurd told Source New Mexico. She said the funding will go toward expanding the library’s juvenile, youth and young adult collection; expanding the section of Navajo-English publications; partnering with the local public school district to promote early literacy through story time; and launching gardening programs to help meet nutrition needs in the community.
“By applying for the grant, it really helps you focus on what you want to do and get really specific about it,” Hurd said. “Most of our budget goes towards just keeping things going. You know, building the collection, bringing in a few authors. So this [grant] lets us really help expand our programming.”
Lisa Shepard, treasurer for the Truchas Services Center, which includes the community’s library, told Source that the Rio Arriba County library received more than $5,000 through the grant. She explained that the funds will be used to create the capacity to offer e-books for youth and adults.
“Because we’re a rural library, we’re totally reliant on grants and some funding [from the state],” Shepard said, adding that the board wants to grow other aspects of the library’s programming as well. “We kind of want to expand our youth section of our library a little bit. And we also are…trying to figure out how we can maybe get some ability to do 3D printing here and have that available for our youth to learn how.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/magdalena-library-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-04 17:59:39.308220

For initial employment authorization, fees are now $550 and $275 to renew. Following the shooting, U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died. A second guard member, U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains critically wounded but hospitalized in stable condition. In response, the Trump administration has ramped up its crackdown on legal immigration and highlighted the need for its mass deportation campaign. The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, pleaded not guilty to several charges in court on Tuesday. This week, all immigration applications from 19 countries listed on Trump’s “high-risk” countries or travel ban from earlier this year, were paused — a move that freezes processing for green card holders and citizenship applications.",,,,2025-12-04 17:59:39.308220

The Milken Foundation is honoring 30 U.S. educators in the 2025-2026 academic year. (Submitted)TOPEKA — Turner Elementary School teacher Lexcee Oddo is recognized as a highly skilled, family-focused and whole-brain educator who taught second-graders before focusing on students learning English as a second language.
Those traits of educational devotion made her Kansas’ latest recipient of a $25,000 Milken Educator Award, which was presented Thursday during a surprise schoolwide assembly in Kansas City, Kansas.
“Drawing from her curriculum knowledge and classroom experience, Lexcee helps students shine by building confidence, a passion for learning and a determination to achieve their goals. She is a valued teacher leader, mentor and trainer, and we are so proud to honor her,” said Jennifer Fuller, vice president of the Milken Educator Awards program and a Texas recipient of the honor in 2017.
Fuller said Oddo’s approach to driving excellence among Turner Elementary’s English language learners incorporated both compassion and kindness.
Oddo earned a bachelor’s degree in elementary education at Kansas State University in 2018. Two years ago, she completed a master’s degree in education administration at Emporia State University.

Oddo was the sole Kansas recipient of a Milken Educator Award in 2025-2026. She was the state’s 74th since Kansas joined the program in 1992.
Nationally, Oddo and 29 other educators coast-to-coast were selected to be honored this academic year. They join a group of more than 3,000 K-12 teachers, principals and specialists singled out for recognition through a program established in 1987 by philanthropist Lowell Milken.
“Talented educators play a critical role in preparing students to move successfully to the next stage of learning and life,” Milken said. “For  39 years, the Milken Educator Awards have been calling attention in a very public way to the essential work of educators — all in an effort to attract and retain high-quality talent to the teaching profession.”
The objective has been to highlight educators while in early- or mid-career for what they achieved and for the promise each possessed. Nominated educators don’t receive notice of their candidacy, and awards are presented at events organized to surprise winners. No mandate for a winner’s use of the $25,000 prize existed, but some spend money on their children’s or their own education, to finance dream field trips or establish scholarships.


The Milken Foundation said Oddo was known for creating a learning environment where multilingual learners were empowered to grow in reading, writing, listening and speaking. Her prescription for student success blended high expectations, individualized support and a sense of purpose, the foundation said.

Oddo, who serves as a first-year buddy to new teachers, relied on student assessments to refine instruction and provide real-time interventions. She performed this work with a “culture of joy and collective efficacy” that led to consistent student advances, the foundation said.
The foundation said Oddo was regarded as a whole-brain teacher who valued academic strength and social-emotional development of students. She hosted student recognition assemblies and an after-school tutoring designed to support students’ academic goals, the foundation said.
“Lexcee represents the best of Kansas education,” said Randy Watson, commissioner at the Kansas State Department of Education. “She believes every child can learn and creates a classroom where high expectations and meaningful support help students thrive. Her leadership strengthens her colleagues, and the trust she builds with families reflects her deep commitment to every student’s success.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Lexcee-Oddo-milken-recipient.png,,,2025-12-04 17:59:39.308220

That’s the decision Commissioner of Political Practices Chris Gallus issued Wednesday regarding allegations Public Service Commissioner Brad Molnar[...],"Montana Public Service Commission (via PSC Twitter account). Montana Public Service Commissioner Annie Bukacek offered a “more plausible explanation” for why she brought documents from her medical office to the public agency — and it doesn’t amount to an ethics violation.
That’s the decision Commissioner of Political Practices Chris Gallus issued Wednesday regarding allegations Public Service Commissioner Brad Molnar made that Bukacek was copying medical records on the public agency’s dime.
Bukacek is a medical doctor based in Kalispell, in addition to being a Public Service Commissioner. She is on the Logan Health Medical Center receptionist directory.
In a letter rejecting the complaint, Gallus said Bukacek explained she doesn’t have enough disposable material to require pickup at her medical office, so she brings recycling to the Public Service Commission.
“None of the facts provided support a finding that Commissioner Bukacek ‘used public time, facilities, equipment, state letterhead, supplies, personnel, or funds for [her] private business purposes’ in violation of MCA 2-2-121,” Gallus wrote.
In the complaint filed in October, Molnar alleged Bukacek brought a valise full of medical records to the Public Service Commission, and he said she tied up the copy machine for “long periods of time.”
Molnar said he found stacks of medical facility fax cover sheets, and he alleged Bukacek was copying the records that came with them, then tossing the cover sheets. He alleged her use of state equipment was improper, for personal business.
Bukacek, however, said she couldn’t remember copying anything, nor does she likely ever have reason to copy medical records; rather, she uses equipment in the copy room to print articles and other documents “germane to her work as a public service commissioner,” according to the letter from Gallus.
Gallus said Molnar provided a lot of documents, but they didn’t amount to evidence Bukacek was copying medical records to take back to her private office — a theory he described as “pure speculation.”
Given the lack of evidence, Gallus said he was returning the complaint to Molnar as “insufficiently supported.”
Although “legal gymnastics” may allow others to conclude Bukacek’s use of the recycling service at the Public Service Commission is a use of public resources for personal gain, Gallus said “that is a jump I refuse to make.”
He said the benefit would be “de minimus at best,” it didn’t promote a business purpose, and it’s easily outweighed by the environmental benefits provided to the people of Montana by recycling.
Gallus acknowledged that an employee routinely bringing outside recycling to a public workplace could create issues if it increases costs or interferes with workflow.
However, he said that problem does not indicate a violation of the Code of Ethics, but would be a matter for agencies to address as they deem appropriate.
“No evidence provided adequately supports an allegation that Commissioner Bukacek is conducting her private business from her PSC office or otherwise using the PSC copier/printer to further her private business purposes,” Gallus wrote.
Molnar also alleged some of the records contained private patient information contrary to HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which protects patient privacy.
In the letter rejecting the complaint, Gallus said he and Molnar discussed potential evidence in the case, and he advised Molnar it would be inappropriate for the Commissioner of Political Practices to accept anyone’s private information.
Gallus said Molnar provided one record that appeared to have a patient’s name and birthdate, both “properly redacted” by Molnar.
But Gallus said that matter is not under his jurisdiction.
“While some materials retrieved from the Public Service Commission’s recycling bin potentially contain names and other identifying information, if the single item provided to COPP is subject to HIPAA, COPP is not the proper venue to address any potential HIPAA violation or related issues,” Gallus wrote.
In a text message, Bukacek said cover sheets may indicate underlying documents are confidential, but the cover sheets themselves are not confidential. And she said she brought only the cover sheets for recycling, not the underlying documents.
By her estimation, the HIPAA accusation “is fulfilling the role of distraction from the lack of evidence in this case.”
In a statement, Bukacek said she believes the allegations by Molnar amounted to “workplace retaliation” for her admission she had filed a complaint to human resources against him.
In July, Molnar announced he was under investigation at the agency for professional misconduct. The investigation includes multiple allegations of misconduct, and it remains pending.
Bukacek, however, said the ethics complaint Molnar filed against her, although unfounded, already has had repercussions, including false statements from political opponents and questions from “beloved patients.”
Bukacek said she fears the complaint will have consequences for agency staff as well.
“(Molnar’s) unjust actions against me sends a further chill to staff’s willingness to come forth with complaints about Brad Molnar’s unprofessional conduct,” Bukacek said in an email. “After all, if he can retaliate against a fellow commissioner and get away with injurious conduct, what protection is there for our wonderful, dedicated PSC staff.”
Molnar most recently took office at the Public Service Commission in January, but he served previous terms, and this year, he was elected president of the five-member commission.
In October, however, his colleagues ousted him as president, alleging he repeatedly interfered with the investigation and accusing him of retaliation.
In her statement, Bukacek said she raised concerns about what she felt was “an abuse of power” by Molnar, and she is experiencing the consequences.
“The complaint filed against me by Commissioner Molnar was eight days after I made the motion to remove him as president and one day after the PSC voted to seat his replacement as president. A coincidence? I think not,” Bukacek said.
Molnar has admitted to being unpolished, a “red neck wearing a white shirt,” and to using his First Amendment right of free speech, but he denies retaliation. He argues a polygraph he took clears him of such accusations.
In an email, Molnar said he isn’t satisfied with the conclusion by Gallus.
Molnar said he wanted to know who besides Bukacek “hauls their trash 200 miles to work to recycle,” and why she would do it when Kalispell has a drop-off service.
“Commissioner Gallus may have bought the above story, but I am pretty sure a jury of six average people would find Commissioner Bukacek’s story pretty darn goofy,” Molnar said.

Saturday’s referendum on whether to shutter high school grades at Danville School cannot compel the Danville School board to move forward with closure, according to a legal opinion the Caledonia Central Supervisory Union received Tuesday.
The opinion, sent to Superintendent Matt Foster just days before a controversial vote to end Danville School’s high school grades, makes the results of Saturday’s town-wide vote nonbinding, and gives the school board the final say on whether to close the high school grades.
The vote was first spurred by a citizen’s petition to close high school grades by June 30.

The board will take Saturday’s results into consideration, said Clayton Cargill, the chair of the Danville School Board. He added that the decision to shutter high school grades will remain with board members—regardless of the results of Saturday’s vote.
But, when asked if the board could vote to keep the grades open even if the community votes in favor of closing high school grades, Cargill said that he “rejected that hypothetical.”
“I can’t speak for the entire board in this case, because I don’t know the will of each board member,” he said. “I don’t know how the vote’s going to go, and so there are too many variables in that for me to consider that hypothesis and give it proper consideration.”
The upcoming vote in Danville echoes considerations at other school districts to close schools or shutter grades, as district officials wrestle with what Act 73’s proposed reform would mean for their communities. In the Bennington-Rutland Supervisory Union, board members there went against the results of a public referendum last month when they voted to close two elementary schools with declining enrollment.
Tuesday’s legal opinion, first reported on by The North Star Monthly, complicates what has been a tense situation for the Northeast Kingdom town. Danville School serves as a hub for upper-grade students in surrounding towns. Closure would otherwise leave the region a public high school desert, officials with the district said previously.
If high school grades were to close, the district would then pay tuition for those high school students to attend other public or private schools. 
The new legal opinion, drafted by attorneys with Burlington-based law firm McNeil, Leddy & Sheahan, says that the board has the discretion to refuse a petition “if the subject matter of the article concerns a matter outside of the voters’ authority.”
The board sought a second legal opinion after hearing from residents who disagreed with the board’s initial decision to schedule a referendum, Cargill said. Attorneys with Lynn, Lynn, Blackman & Toohey initially told the board it had to hold a binding vote on the matter.
The document reads that the petition to shutter high school grades “exceeds the authority of the electorate under Vermont law.”
Cargill said that the legal opinion means the board can treat the petition as null and void, or as advisory. “But because we’re going through so much effort,” he said, “we need to treat it as advisory.”
“We have a warned article,” he added. “If we cancel our meeting, we would probably be subject to a lawsuit or something.”

Shri Thanedar has introduced articles of impeachment against U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, the Detroit Democrat announced in a press release on Thursday. The articles of impeachment are charging Hegseth with Murder and Conspiracy to Murder, and for Reckless and Unlawful Mishandling of Classified Information.
The articles of impeachment come as Hegseth is under increasing scrutiny from both sides of the aisle about strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean, including one in September where Hegseth allegedly gave a verbal directive to “kill everybody,” according to Washington Post reporting.
“Pete Hegseth is uniquely unqualified to serve as Secretary of Defense,” Thanedar said in the release. “Every day he serves in this role, he puts American servicemembers and their families in danger. He gave direct, unlawful orders to kill every single person on a civilian boat from Venezuela, violating the Defense Department’s Law of War Manual.”
Thanedar also referenced the March incident in which Hegseth, along with a number of other top Trump national security officials, discussed specific details of a U.S. attack on Houthi rebels in Yemen in a Signal group chat, as further reason for Hegseth’s impeachment.
“His mishandling of classified information, leaking war plans in a Signal chat which included sensitive operations details, including target systems and attack times, has put American lives at risk,” Thanedar said in the release. “He can no longer serve as our Secretary of Defense, which is why I am introducing these articles of impeachment.”
Thanedar was criticized earlier this year for putting forward articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, which he introduced in April before cancelling a vote on them after facing significant pushback from party leadership.
When asked on Monday if articles of impeachment against Hegseth would be considered, Axios reported that House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) said, “Republicans will never allow articles of impeachment to be brought to the floor of the House of Representatives, and we know that’s the case.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/petehegseth-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-04 16:57:33.605016

New Mexico senators this week called on the Forest Service chief to account for a reported steep decline in wildfire prevention efforts since President Donald Trump took office in January. (Alice Fordham/KUNM)United States senators from New Mexico joined Democratic colleagues this week in calling on the federal Forest Service to account for a reported steep decline in wildfire prevention measures, including forest thinning and prescribed burns, in New Mexico and other states during President Donald Trump’s first term.
U.S. Sens. Ben Ray Luján and Martin Heinrich sent a letter Dec. 2 to Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz along with 10 other senators, calling on Schultz to “provide clear answers” about the Forest Service’s staffing to reduce wildfire risk across the West. 
The letter cited an analysis of publicly available data from Grassroots Wildland Firefighters finding a 38% decrease in the removal of hazardous fuels as of September 2025 when compared with the same period over the last four years. 
Between 2021 and 2024, the Forest Service completed hazardous fuel projects covering 3.6 million acres a year, according to the analysis. In the first nine months of 2025, the group found that the Forest Service treated less than 1.7 million acres.
Wildfire mitigation in New Mexico down 53% since Trump took office

“The steep decline in hazardous fuels reduction efforts on Forest Service lands poses a serious risk to public safety, public health, and the economy,” the senators wrote. “It is imperative that the Forest Service works closely with Congress to address shortfalls in wildfire mitigation and ensure staffing and budgetary resources are sufficient to fulfill the agency’s mission.”
The letter says Schultz previously provided misleading answers in response to criticism about his agency’s wildfire prevention efforts, including counting work done during President Joe Biden’s term as evidence that the agency was adequately staffed. But that data included staffing figures from before Trump’s “mass staff firings, forced retirements, and unnecessary pauses on projects,” the letter states. 
In New Mexico, the analysis found wildfire prevention efforts are down by 53% since President Donald Trump took office in January.
The letter ends with a list of questions to Schultz about where staffing currently stands and what  his plans are to address the “current wildfire risk environment.” It also asks for updated numbers on treated acres, how many such projects were delayed this year, and for quarterly updates on progress going forward. 
It also asks for Schultz to respond to the letter by Dec. 12.

Congress has not passed the bill. Durbin, 81, spoke about his legacy on immigration at a Thursday press conference.“We are a nation of immigrants. I am proud to be the son of an immigrant,” the No. 2 Senate Democrat said. “This is a proud son of an immigrant who's doing everything he can to help the next generation of immigrants be part of America's future. The fight has just begun.”While Congress is again unlikely to approve the measure this year, younger Senate Democrats Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Alex Padilla of California said Thursday they would carry on the effort.“The dream is still alive,” Padilla said. “We are committed as ever to get it across the finish line.”Cortez Masto agreed. “Some day, with the hard work of everyone, we (will) get it across the finish line,” she said. Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski co-sponsored the latest version of the legislation.Temporary fix now 13 years oldThe Dream Act would create a path to citizenship for immigrant children who came into the country with their parents without legal authorization.The bill has nicknamed more than 530,000 immigrants in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program as Dreamers. The Obama administration created the program in 2012 as a temporary measure to allow recipients to obtain work permits and drivers licenses while Congress created a pathway to citizenship.DACA’s legality is tied up in the courts, throwing its recipients into limbo. For now, existing DACA recipients can continue to renew, but the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in January upheld deportation protections for recipients, but found the work authorization portion unlawful. The appeals court limited its ruling to Texas, which spearheaded the suit, meaning that DACA remains in full effect in every state and U.S. territory except Texas.Many immigration policy experts have called DACA outdated because there are now thousands of undocumented youth who are not eligible for the program because they were not even born by 2007, the year a recipient must have started residence in the United States. A federal judge in 2021 blocked new applicants from being accepted.Trump crackdown adds urgencyMany DACA recipients have been caught up in President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign. Dozens of recipients have been detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, despite their legal status, according to immigrant advocacy groups tracking the issue. “This moment in the history of our nation is a terrible, challenging moment for so many people, not just the Dreamers, but immigrants in general,” Durbin said.

“I've been both angry and heartbroken to watch masked federal agents parading in their combat uniforms with automatic weapons in the city of Chicago,” he continued. “I’ve seen them wreak havoc in these communities and sow fear among people who are afraid to even go outside, to go to church or to go shopping.”The executive director of the immigrant advocacy group United We Dream, Greisa Martinez Rosas, said that while DACA has allowed some immigrant youth to obtain work authorization and deportation protections, more needs to be done, especially under a second Trump administration.“We are currently facing unprecedented attacks that pose the greatest threat to… the future of the DACA program, and in doing so, the future of this country and those millions of people who would make our country stronger every single day,” she said.Immigration reform elusiveDurbin said the Dream Act would be a “key step toward true, positive, bipartisan change” in immigration policy.  ​​The last time Congress came close to bipartisan immigration reform was in 2013. That year, the bipartisan “Gang of Eight” senators, including Durbin, crafted a bill to create a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented people who had resided in the country for years. The Senate passed the measure, but then-House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, never brought the bill to the floor for a vote.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-12-04 16:57:33.605016

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)Building upon efforts underway in their home state, Maine’s congressional delegation on Thursday renewed its push for federal support for farmers affected by forever chemicals.
U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, a Democrat, and U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican, reintroduced legislation that would offer grants to states that could be used in a variety of ways to address per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS, in farmland. The money could be used to test for and remediate PFAS, as well as help farmers relocate from contaminated land, according to a news release from Pingree’s office.
The bill, known as Relief for Farmers Hit with PFAS Act, was originally cosponsored by the other members of Maine’s delegation, independent U.S. Sen. Angus King and Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden.
Collins said the U.S. Department of Agriculture “must provide support to our nation’s farmers, who through no fault of their own are at risk of losing their livelihoods,” adding that the federal government’s response has failed to keep pace with the problem. 
Maine is regarded as a national leader for its work to implement policies that stymie the spread of PFAS, which is a known carcinogen linked to an array of health issues. Many farmers have seen their land, and even their own bodies, contaminated by the substance because of the historic practice of spreading sewage sludge as a fertilizer. 
In addition to responding to high levels of PFAS in agricultural land, Maine was the first state to pass a rule requiring manufacturers to report intentionally added PFAS in products. Earlier this year, state lawmakers also worked on proposals to expand testing for contaminants in private wells and rid the state of PFAS-laden firefighting foam, which is another significant source of contamination. 
Additionally, Maine lawmakers passed legislation to codify programs that support farms with high levels of PFAS into state law to ensure the assistance for farmers and remediation can continue. In August, Massachusetts lawmakers visited the Pine Tree State to learn more about how they can replicate those efforts back home.
“The state of Maine has been on the forefront of these efforts, but additional federal investments are vitally needed,” King said in a news release.
The federal bill that Collins and Pingree reupped could provide those additional investments. If passed, the money authorized by that legislation could increase capacity for soil and water testing, monitor individuals’ blood levels for PFAS contamination or even upgrade equipment to help farms stay profitable.
That money could also be used to develop education programs that would inform farmers on what to do if their land is contaminated or research the viability of new remediation systems for soil and water on farms.
The federal legislation would also create a USDA task force that would identify ways to bring more resources to farmers through existing programs. It would also provide technical assistance to states so they can coordinate effective responses to contamination.
“For farmers already navigating thin margins, discovering ‘forever chemicals’ on their land can mean lost income, unusable land, and questions about the safety of their crops and livestock,” said Pingree, who is also a longtime farmer. “They deserve federal support that matches the scale of the crisis.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_6868-scaled-e1744833308558-1024x747.jpeg,,,2025-12-04 16:57:33.605016
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-04 21:28:47+00:00,CT Mirror,Officials: Man who assaulted correction officer died by suicide,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/04/jaishon-bellamy-suicide-prison/,"Jaishon Bellamy was discovered in his cell at MacDougall-Walker Correctional Institution at 2:30 a.m. on Thursday, officials said.","An incarcerated individual who allegedly assaulted a correction officer earlier this week died by what officials said was an “apparent suicide” early Thursday morning.
Jaishon Bellamy, who had been in state prison since 2015, was discovered in his cell at MacDougall-Walker Correctional Institution at 2:30 a.m. on Thursday with a bedsheet tied around his neck, according to a Department of Correction press release. He was pronounced dead just over an hour later after being transported in an ambulance to St. Francis Hospital.
“He was the only person in the cell at the time of the incident,” the press release states, adding that the state medical examiner will be determining the exact cause of death and that DOC and state police are investigating. 
Correction ombuds DeVaughn Ward said in a statement Thursday that Bellamy’s death “raise[s] substantial questions regarding DOC policies, supervision and mental health and safety practices.” 
Bellamy had been transferred to MacDougall-Walker from Osborn Correctional Institution a few days earlier, after he allegedly assaulted a female correction officer there. 
A DOC press release following the assault earlier this week said an unnamed incarcerated individual had assaulted a female correction officer “without warning or provocation … choking and punching [her] in the face.” 
A press release from AFSCME Local 391, the union representing correction officers, referred to the incident as an “attempted sexual assault” in which an incarcerated person came upon the female officer from behind and “dragged her” into an area of the facility that was invisible to surveillance cameras. 
According to the union, the officer sustained a fractured eye socket, bruising to her upper body and “significant abrasions.” She was taken to the hospital and later released.  
Ward, the correction ombuds, said he’d spoken with Bellamy the night before his death, and that while Bellamy admitted to assaulting the officer, he “strongly denied attempting to sexually assault or rape her,” Ward said.
Ward told the Connecticut Mirror that Bellamy said his birthday was Nov. 30, and he had been feeling unhappy. Bellamy said he was working his job as a custodian the following day when the female officer called him a “rapist,” which upset him and led to the assault. Bellamy was serving a sentence of 20 years for first-degree sexual assault. 
“Mr. Bellamy was serving sentences for extremely serious offenses, including violent sexual assaults committed at a young age. While his criminal history is significant, it does not diminish the Department of Correction’s responsibility to protect the safety and welfare of staff and individuals in custody, nor does it lessen the need for transparency and thorough review when a person dies while incarcerated,” Ward said. 
In response to Ward’s statement, union officials reiterated the gravity of the assault, calling it “one of the most heinous staff assaults in recent memory.” 
“For the Ombudsman to cast doubt on the word of our officer erodes the faith that AFSCME Council 4 and our officers (who selflessly put their lives on the line every day in order to keep our state safe) have in the Ombudsman as an independent and impartial investigator,” they said in a statement to CT Mirror.  
Ward reiterated that his office condemned any violent attacks against correction officers and said that Bellamy’s version of events, even if true, did not excuse his assault on the female officer — but it offered context. 
“My job in terms of being impartial is to try and weigh all of the evidence and all of the facts,” he said. 
State Sens. John Kissel, R-Enfield, Paul Cicarella, R-North Haven, and Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, said in a joint statement that the investigation into Bellamy’s death needed to be done “thoroughly and transparently.”
“The safety and health of our brave Correction Officers — as well as incarcerated individuals — must be our top priorities,” the statement read. 
Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, a co-chair of the legislature’s Judiciary Committee, declined to comment on the incident. 
Union President Robert Beamon said in a statement earlier this week that the assault was the consequence of DOC cutting back on officer positions in order to save on costs. 
“For over a year, we have documented these hazards, pleaded for additional staffing, and demanded security upgrades in precisely this area. These are not luxuries; our officers are asking for the basic tools required to go home to their families alive and uninjured at the end of their shift,” Beamon said. 
The union pointed in particular to the area where the female officer was working. They said that in March 2024, the department eliminated a security position in that area, dropping the number of officers tasked with patrolling from two to one. The union filed a grievance over the elimination of the position, which was ultimately denied. 
According to union numbers, as of May 2025, DOC was short-staffed by approximately 570 correction officers. 
According to data from the state Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, 15 people died by suicide while under the care of the Department of Correction between Jan. 1, 2023 and May 19, 2025. 
Ward said medical and mental health care in the Department of Correction was “at crisis levels.”
“At some point, we have to reach a tipping point where this is no longer acceptable,” Ward said. 
Barbara Fair, executive director of Stop Solitary, said she was suspicious about the nature of Bellamy’s death. She called for more cameras in the facilities and “honest investigations” into deaths that were alleged suicides.
“This is just crazy that people go in there to serve a sentence and come out in a body bag,” she said.
The Department of Correction and the Connecticut State Police will both be investigating Bellamy’s death. Asked for comment, the state police referred CT Mirror to the Office of the Inspector General, which they said would be taking the lead in the investigation. That office confirmed in a statement that they would be investigating.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/20210402_MacDougallWalkerCI_YK_029.jpg,,,2025-12-04 16:57:33.605016
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-04 21:24:12+00:00,CT Mirror,CT small business owners turn to TikTok: ‘You can build a great community’,P.R. Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/04/tiktok-business-marketing-cbia-ct/,"At CBIA event, business owners joined local and state officials to talk about how TikTok is transforming business activity.","For Somers business owner Adam Rivard, everything started with a toy bearded dragon. 
Rivard’s son had asked for the toy, which was made using a 3D printer in his basement.  With a day job in airplane manufacturing, Rivard didn’t initially think much of the request, viewing the toy as part of his 3D printing hobby. 
But when the toy dragon became a hit with his son’s friends, a new business idea came into focus.
Rivard printed out more toys, taking them to a birthday party, where they were instantly a hit. Inspired, he opened up a small Etsy shop to sell a few trinkets here and there. 
He was also inspired to try out TikTok Shop, an ecommerce feature on TikTok that allows brands and creators to sell items directly to users. To get acquainted with the platform, in the fall of 2023 Rivard posted a video of a small dinosaur. By the end of the night, he had more than 30 orders. 
The demand led Rivard to buying more printers. In four months he went from one printer in the basement to 70. His 3D-printed toy business, affectionately called “Bumpa Built” in honor of Rivard’s father, was taking off.
TikTok became a key part of his business, with Rivard regularly posting videos in the hopes of going viral. 
“You’re just getting these surges of orders,” he said. 
Within a year, Bumpa Built had 60,000 followers. The demand for the business encouraged Rivard to open a storefront in Somers. But TikTok, where the company has amassed more than 1 million likes on its business page, is still a key aspect of how he markets and tests products. 
“I can 100% say we would not exist today if it wasn’t for TikTok,” Rivard said. 
This week, Rivard joined a group of small business owners in Hartford to speak about how TikTok has propelled his business. The event was hosted by the Connecticut Business and Industry Association and TikTok, the popular social media platform where users post short videos ranging in length from a few seconds to 10 minutes.  
The event offered a chance for business owners, local and state officials, and the broader community to better understand how the platform is transforming business activity across the country. That includes in Connecticut, where more than 50,000 businesses are using TikTok to promote events, sell products and connect with potential customers.
“We’ve got to think about the way in which we communicate with people, and reach people, whether it’s their living rooms, in their cars, on the go,” said Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam, who delivered opening remarks at the event. “TikTok provides incredible opportunities to reach people right where they are, in a way that is digestible, that makes sense.”
The social media platform — which has found itself at the center of controversies around national security, data collection, and social media use by children — has grown considerably in the years since its official US launch in 2018. By the first quarter of 2024, the site reported having some 170 million users. One-third of adults in the U.S. and nearly two-thirds of teenagers use the platform, according to the Pew Research Center. 
Some of TikTok’s biggest stars, like the D’Amelio sisters and model-influencer couple Nara and Lucky Blue Smith, have ties to Connecticut.
But the platform is also a key tool for small business owners like Rivard, who have used TikTok to grow their customer base and revenue, and have also leaned on TikTok staff for additional support. They say the platform’s tools are crucial in marketing and sales strategies. And as media and advertising continues to shift, business users say TikTok has become a key way to get in front of an audience.
The power of viral moments
During a discussion moderated by CBIA policy director Danielle Cloud, panelists at Wednesday’s event shared similar stories, all noting that the social media platform has become an invaluable tool in their business outreach strategies, giving them a no-cost way to organically connect with brand lovers and potential customers alike.
“We’ve been around for a very long time, and we’ve always had a great product, but we didn’t have great distribution,” said Bryan MacDonald, director of ecommerce for Oma’s Pride Pet Food, a decades-old poultry operation that transitioned into selling pet food during the 1990s. 
The Avon-based company has built its brand on TikTok using skits and parodies, often riffing on the popular 2000s comedy series The Office. In one sketch, MacDonald and other employees debate whether moose can be found in Montana. In another, they stage an impromptu fire drill as one employee looks on with concern.

“It had nothing to do with pet food, but it showed how crazy we were in the office,” MacDonald said of the sketch series, which has grown to more than 40 parts. “It allows consumers to fall in love with the creator.”
“And then ultimately, that brings them down the funnel to buy the product that the person that they fell in love with is selling,” he added.
For others, like Elm Street Diner owner John Moshos, TikTok has become a tool for reinvention and innovation. The restaurant, which was founded in 1987 and has locations in Stamford and Norwalk, has become a viral sensation with posts of extreme milkshakes and its popular waffle towers. Elm Street Diner’s 221,000 TikTok followers, along with followers on other platforms like Instagram make it the most followed small business account in the state. 
When it comes to the restaurant’s posts, “the virality of them just went out of control,” Moshos said. “We had one hit 25 million without even trying. And then you’re like, ‘All right, now we got to top this. We got to go bigger. We have to get better.'”
The company has since launched a “Social Media Superstars” section on their menu, encouraging visitors to try some of their most viral offerings and upload their meals to Instagram and TikTok. And the restaurant has become a pilgrimage site for aspiring foodies from around the globe, becoming a part of Connecticut’s state marketing and tourism efforts.
“People say, “I drove eight hours to come see you guys,'” Moshos said. “They passed thousands of restaurants on the way. That means the world to us.”
It’s the sort of success that inspires new restaurateurs like Chris Allen. A local tech entrepreneur, Allen is preparing to launch Gas Burgers, a retro burger restaurant that will operate out of a rehabilitated North Haven gas station.
While the business won’t open until March 2026, Allen said TikTok has helped him to start building his customer base now. He’s been able to collect feedback on what types of burgers customers want, provide updates on an old tow truck that parked outside called “Towmater” and he has even let people vote on what colors they want to see the gas pumps out front painted.
Allen also uses the account to host giveaways of shirts and other items, promoting the brand further.

“It’s been a great way to prove the concept out,” Allen said of his approach to gathering input. “You really get them bought in, and it becomes, realistically, very much like a TV show, right? They’re looking forward to the next episode, or the next content, the next piece of content that they want to see and they yearn for it.”
“If you do it that way, you can really build a great community,” he added.
TikTok says it is a powerful resource for business owners
Building a community, and then providing the means for that community to generate sales, is just how TikTok promotes its value for business owners in Connecticut and around the country. 
The company has offered original research to further make this case. In a recent study TikTok released in 2024 as a collaboration with Oxford Economics, researchers noted that the social media platform offered several advantages to businesses that maintained accounts. In the first quarter of 2024, there were more than 7 million businesses operating on the platform.
The study authors surveyed some 1,050 small and midsized businesses, defined as businesses with less than 500 employees, from around the country. The study also included surveys of 7,500 TikTok users.
The study found that TikTok can have a big impact on businesses, with 49% of those surveyed saying TikTok helped them with exposure. An even greater percentage, 73%, said the platform helped improve their business’ exposure to new diverse audiences across the country. 
TikTok says that its economic impact goes even further. Last year, the company claimed that 5 million jobs benefitted from the platform, and that between its marketing and research support as well as other free services provided to TikTok users, the platform “supported a $24.2 billion contribution to the US GDP in 2023.”

In updated data from earlier in 2025, TikTok and Oxford Economics provided state-level data. In Connecticut, the social media company said some 56,000 businesses use TikTok and that 43,000 jobs in the state benefit from business accounts on the platform. Much like the larger national study, most Connecticut businesses surveyed reported that using TikTok has helped them with promotions, sales and finding new customers.
TikTok said that its use by small and midsized businesses added an estimated $310 million to Connecticut’s GDP in 2023 and $42 million in federal, state, and local tax revenue in the state. 
“While Tiktok is a global platform, the impact is actually local,” said Julien Nagarajan, state public policy manager for TikTok. 
And for Connecticut’s small business owners, like Moshos of Elm Street Diner, who now gets visitors from multiple states and countries across the globe, the platform is about more than profits and free ad space. It is a chance to expand his business’s reach in ways he never imagined.
“This platform has essentially made it possible for a local, neighborhood place in Stamford, Connecticut, to become a global brand that’s seen all over the world,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/TIKTOK-BUSINESS-ASSISTANCE_4_3-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-04 16:57:33.605016

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island General Treasurer James Diossa has committed $60 million in state deposits to help first-time homebuyers secure 30-year mortgages under a pilot program unveiled Thursday.
For RI AnchorHome the state is partnering with three local financial institutions. Once a potential home owner qualifies for a loan, the state will deposit matching funds into their mortgage account to offset any debt.
“While this is not a solution to the housing crisis, I firmly believe it is a step in the right direction,” Diossa told reporters, lawmakers, housing advocates, and bankers gathered in the State House library. “This helps families put down roots, stabilize neighborhoods.”
While billed as a pilot program, Diossa declined to say how long it will be active.
To qualify for the program, Diossa said applicants must meet the following criteria:

Be a first-time homebuyer
Have a minimum credit score of 660
Have a household income no higher than 110% of statewide limits. Rhode Island’s median household income in 2025 was $86,372, according to the latest factbook published by the housing policy research group HousingWorks RI.

With those deposits, the participating lenders pledge to offer those first-time homebuyers a starting interest rate of 3.99% (subject to market conditions) on a fixed-rate 30-year mortgage, no private mortgage insurance, and assistance for down payments and closing costs.
“That’s a big deal in today’s times,” Diossa told reporters after the press conference.
Homebuyers participating in the program are capped at taking on a maximum loan of $525,000 for a single-family building or $575,000 for a two-family unit. The median cost for a single-family home in 2025 was $475,000, according to HousingWorks RI’s factbook.
Samuel Alba, a realtor from Providence-based Innovations Realty, said he’s had to pass on many clients because of the state’s high housing costs.
“They’re priced out of today’s market,” he said.
With the new pilot program, Alba said he can start calling those families back to let them know they now have a chance of getting that first home.

Funding for the accounts comes from the state’s BankLocal Community Deposit Program established by the General Treasurer’s office in 2017, which itself is made up of cash assets in big national and international banks. The money had previously been designated to help Rhode Island’s local banks provide loans to small businesses looking to get a start in the state.
“[Now] we’ve evolved it to address the issue of our time, which is the housing crisis,” Diossa said.  
Normally, the state caps the treasurers’ deposits at $50 million, but the State Investment Commission recently gave its OK to raise the limit to $60 million.
But only about half of what is committed will be deposited. 
Carla Rojo, spokesperson for Diossa’s office, noted in an email that the state can only allocate up to $10 million per institution. With the three participating banks in the pilot program, this allows an initial investment of up to $30 million, which Rojo projects would fund the purchase of up to 90 homes.
“This amount would be expected to increase as other financial institutions join the program,” she said.
So far participants are Navigant Credit Union, BankNewport, and Centreville Bank. Representatives of those institutions were at the State House to speak of the importance of being able to provide further financial help to first-time buyers.
“Probably the most important decision you make for your whole financial future is buying a home,” said Leland R. Merrill, chief lending officer for Centreville Bank.
It’s the same perspective shared by Gov. Dan McKee, who praised the program as a way to keep young families in the state.
“Homeownership is part of the American dream, that should be part of Rhode Island’s goals,” McKee told the crowd.

(Photo by Eric Vryn/Getty Images)Property insurance rates have spiked since 2021 due to the increasing frequency of climate-related natural disasters, inflation in the cost of building materials and supply chain issues. The typical homeowner saw an average increase of $648 in their annual premium from 2021 to 2024. And those rates are expected to increase by an average of 8% nationwide this year — with homeowners in some states facing much higher increases, such as a projected 27% hike in Louisiana.
An increasing number of American homeowners are linking those increases to climate change. A majority of them (72%) say that natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods and wildfires exacerbated by climate change are somewhat or very responsible for the rise in homeowner insurance costs, according to a poll by Data For Progress.

There is a bipartisan consensus that prices are rising too fast — nearly 80% of homeowners in Texas, for instance, want to see rates reduced, and one-third of Florida homeowners say that rate increases are the most important issue for them (even ahead of inflation and housing costs) — though Americans are torn on the role of climate change.
Insurance companies are regulated on the state level, and there have been heated debates in states as diverse as Idaho, Minnesota, Louisiana and Colorado about policies and regulations to slow the increase in rates. In Iowa, which was expected to see a 19% increase in home insurance rates this year, nearly 180 researchers and educators signed a statement calling  attention to the role of climate change in driving up insurance costs — and calling for better building standards and a faster transition to more renewable energy sources in the state, such as solar and wind.
The federal government plays a role in all this through its funding of programs to share the risk of losses such as the National Flood Insurance Program and disaster relief efforts. It also provides access to climate data used by insurers to foresee potential risks and formulate rates.
The Trump administration’s policies on climate, cutting funding to key programs, reducing access to and limiting the collection of climate data, and slashing the ranks of federal regulators are contributing to an increase in property insurance rates for homeowners, said insurance industry analysts and experts.

“At a time when homeowners are struggling to afford home insurance premiums, the Trump administration has a bunch of policies that are all driving up insurance costs,” said Michael DeLong, the Consumer Federation of America’s research and advocacy associate.
Asked about the Trump administration’s plans to help reduce property insurance rates, a White House spokesperson declined to speak on the record, but provided Capital & Main with a statement from an unnamed official:
“More people are living in Florida than ever before, which naturally causes an increase in rates,” the statement said. “It’s inaccurate and silly to pin this on climate change. The Administration is working to lower costs across all industries for Americans.”
Consumers likely to hear tariff costs
The steep tariffs on materials like lumber, steel and aluminum are raising construction and repair costs, which will likely be passed on to consumers through higher home insurance premiums. First, insurance coverage limits  “may no longer provide enough protection as the cost of materials and labor needed to rebuild your home increases,” noted Wawanesa Insurance in a blogpost. “Second, repair costs following claims will be higher, potentially influencing future premium rates.”
The main insurance industry trade group, the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, has been actively lobbying against tariffs because of their impact on home insurance.
Cuts to disaster relief funding, resiliency programs
The administration has cut disaster relief funds at the Department of Housing and Urban Development that are given to local governments and states following natural disasters. The money is used to repair or reconstruct homes and finance housing. Without those resources, communities devastated by such catastrophes won’t be able to rebuild homes and infrastructure in more resilient ways, “and these communities will pay higher insurance premiums as a result,” writes DeLong, the Consumer Federation advocacy associate, and Ethan Weiland, another CFA research associate.
In April the Federal Emergency Management Agency terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities Program, which provided grants to states and communities to fund projects that reduce the risk of damage from flooding, tornadoes and other natural disasters. Ending the program “means terminating mitigation projects that would have saved lives, lowered the risk of property loss, and reduced homeowner, farm, and business property insurance premiums,” DeLong and Weiland noted.
Reduced access to critical climate data
In May, the administration stopped updating the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration database for weather and climate disasters that cause more than $1 billion in damage. The database has historically been used by insurance and reinsurance companies to assess risks and project future losses. The loss of that data is likely to lead to less accurate pricing, and cause insurers to hike rates in response to unquantified risk.
In addition, the administration has deleted reports on rising homeowners insurance from the Federal Insurance Office’s website — making it more difficult for insurance regulators, insurers and consumers to get data.
One of the reports, which was uploaded by the Consumer Federation of America, on rising homeowners insurance costs from 2018 to 2022, showed how this increase outpaced the rate of inflation and that policy nonrenewal rates were higher in areas with higher-than-expected losses from climate-related disasters.
“We need reliable, long datasets,” said Kieran Bhatia, head of climate and sustainability for North America at the global reinsurance broker Guy Carpenter. “Without them, you basically are kind of putting your finger up to the wind a little bit about what is a realistic [extreme weather] event.”
Bhatia and other climate risk specialists expressed their concerns during  a panel discussion during New York Climate Week in September.
“If you want to promote economic growth, the best way to do that is to have good information,” said Alexandra Thornton, senior director of financial regulation at the Center for American Progress. “Capitalism relies on good information to make an efficient economy and insurers are subject to that rule as well. But now no one has this essential climate information.”
Rollback of renewable energy initiatives
The administration’s rollback of renewable energy initiatives — such as the Environmental Protection Agency’s $7 billion Solar for All initiative — has directly impacted the underwriting market for clean energy projects. That has increased insurance costs as insurers become more cautious about underwriting such projects, citing increased risks.
And President Donald Trump’s executive orders to block state and local climate change measures — such as those that seek to limit carbon emissions or require oil and gas companies to pay for climate damage — could escalate future litigation risk for insurers as climate change worsens.
“We’re going backwards because we’re not doing the things at the federal level to tackle climate change and lower insurance costs for consumers,”  Thornton said.
Hindered federal climate risk regulation
Federal financial regulators have withdrawn policies that required climate risk disclosures from financial firms, including insurers, in response to the administration’s anti-environmental, social and governance stance.
By reducing federal oversight, the administration is downplaying climate-related financial risks. This leaves property and financial markets more exposed and increases the instability that can be caused by higher costs and limited insurance availability.
Approval of new fossil fuel projects
The administration’s strong push to increase oil and gas production, such as approving six new liquefied natural gas terminals along the Gulf Coast, will likely accelerate the pace of climate change and lead to higher insurance premiums, said Ethan Nuss, senior campaigner with the Rainforest Action Network.
“The Trump administration’s fast-tracking of dirty energy mega-projects — like the Calcasieu Pass 2 LNG (CP2) methane export terminal — increases the risk exposure of both insurers and neighboring communities that will be stuck paying out larger claims and skyrocketing premiums or be forced out of their ‘uninsurable’ homes.”

It lasted less than 25 minutes and featured no public comment.
Rep. Mike Redondo, R-Miami, chairman of the Select Committee on Congressional Redistricting, explained to a packed hearing room that the meeting would focus only on an “education and introductory scope,” and it mostly consisted of an explanation about the process by Andy Bardos, an attorney with the Tallahassee office of GrayRobinson.
The hearing took place more than four months after Gov. Ron DeSantis first said it would be “appropriate” for Florida lawmakers to redraw their congressional map ahead of the 2026 midterm election, because he believes that the state was “malapportioned” following the 2020 U.S. Census.
But his comments came just weeks after President Donald Trump directed Texas to redraw its congressional map to add as many as five GOP seats to Congress, and that he’d like other states to follow suit.
Both blue and red states have since engaged in the congressional redistricting process, including California, Missouri, and North Carolina.
When should redistricting take place?
Gov. DeSantis said earlier this week that he wants the Legislature to work on congressional redistricting in a special legislative session to take place sometime after the regular session ends in mid-March. But Redondo said Thursday that with the state’s federal qualifying candidate deadline set for April 20, the issue must be dealt with by the end of the regular session.
“This committee was formed by the speaker ahead of the 2026 session, so that if we do decide to propose a new congressional map, we may do so under our traditional process of lawmaking, and with enough time to enact a map, if passed by our Legislature,” he said.
“Given the fact that we are less than a year away from the election, not to mention the fact that the candidate qualifying period for federal offices is in late April, it would be irresponsible to delay the creation and passage of a new map, especially until after session. It would also be irresponsible to any who are called for civil service, and most importantly, it would be irresponsible to the citizens of Florida.”
The House redistricting committee is next scheduled to meet again on Dec. 10.
Florida Senate President Ben Albritton had remained relatively silent but weighed in on the side of DeSantis on Wednesday.
“The Governor has expressed a desire to address this issue next Spring. As such, there is no ongoing work regarding potential mid-decade redistricting taking place in the Senate at this time,” Albritton told senators in a memo.
Florida Democrats and voting rights advocates have blasted the process, saying a plan to redraw the state’s congressional map to support getting more Republicans elected to Congress would be a direct violation of the 2010 Fair Districts amendments, which says that no reapportionment plan or individual district can be drawn “with the intent to favor or disfavor a political party or incumbent.”
However, DeSantis said Wednesday that the state’s hand will “be forced” because of an expected ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court regarding the 1965 Voting Rights Act which he says would implicate Florida’s existing congressional map.
“No matter what else, that is going to have to be addressed,” he said.
Redondo referenced the fact that lawsuits were filed after the state’s most recent congressional map was enacted in 2022, and so far it has been upheld in both state and federal courts. The Florida Supreme Court upheld the DeSantis-approved map in July, writing that the old Congressional District 5 likely constituted an illegal race-based gerrymander that violated federal equal-protection rights.
“While that decision upheld our current congressional map, it raises new and important questions about the interplay of redistricting requirements in federal and state law, which we’ll delve further into next week,” Redondo said. He also mentioned that the U.S. Supreme Court’s coming ruling on the Voting Rights Act “may also factor into our work as a committee.”
Redondo received derisive laughs from the audience after he said that he wasn’t “naïve to the fact that there is much public discourse around mid-decade redistricting. Let me be very clear — our work as a committee and as a legislative body is not directed by the work of other states, or partisan gamesmanship.”
Critics call the plan ‘illegal’
Before Thursday’s hearing, a coalition of voting rights, civil rights, and community organizations gathered at the Capitol to denounce the redistricting, saying it was being done for clear partisan advantage.
“The only reason this is happening is because Republicans and Democrats across the country are redrawing maps to get their party more seats in Congress in next year’s election. That’s illegal in Florida. Floridians overwhelmingly rejected partisan redistricting 15 years ago, and they still reject it today,” said Amy Keith, Florida executive director with Common Cause, in a written statement.
“The number one issue facing Floridians is our affordability crisis. Legislators should be focused on that. Playing with map rigging is a waste of time and a sign they won’t put Floridians first.”
“Florida’s governor and legislative leaders are attempting something unprecedented, dangerous, and fundamentally undemocratic: a mid-decade redistricting process designed to tip the scales of political power and weaken the voice of everyday Floridians,” added Genesis Robinson, executive director with Equal Ground.

Board of Education meeting, Nov. 6. 2025 (Photo: Ahmed Jallow/NC Newsline)The North Carolina State Board of Education on Wednesday focused on increasing pay for teachers and other school staff as it discussed its legislative priorities for the upcoming 2026 short session.
Geoff Coltrane, senior director of government affairs at the Department of Public Instruction, warned that he expects “very limited revenue” in the year ahead and that legislators in Raleigh may not even pass a full budget for the 2026-2027 fiscal year. He urged members to narrow their requests for a better chance of success.
“Our plan is, when possible, to really prioritize our budget legislative request based on the new strategic plan and those sort of critical must-have items,” Coltrane said, “so that we’re taking to the General Assembly a very narrow, tailored and strategic list of items that we hope to get across the finish line.”
Rachel Candaso, the 2025 North Carolina Teacher of the Year, said she worked two extra jobs in 2023-24 to supplement her income. Jason Johnson, the 2025 Principal of the Year, said some of his teachers also work nights at stores like Walmart, Costco, and Old Navy.
“Teacher pay has to be a focus, because as a school leader, I need teachers planning and I need teachers giving feedback to students,” Johnson said.
North Carolina currently ranks 43rd in the nation for average public school teacher pay, according to the latest data from the National Education Association. North Carolina’s average salary of about $58,292 is nearly $14,000 below the national average of $72,030.
The General Assembly adjourned in late July without a two-year spending plan, passing a resolution to meet just one day each month until the 2026 short session begins in April.
The governor’s 2025-26 budget proposed a 10.6% raise for teachers and 6% for principals, while legislative versions ranged from 2.3% to 8.7% for teachers. But with no final budget passed into law, educators received no across-the-board raises — only salary step increases.
Candaso also noted the $13 billion needed for school repairs and renovations. “Students need to attend schools that are equipped for 21st-century learning and provide heat, air conditioning, and other basic needs,” she said.
Candoso said she teaches at a school built in the 1970s that will cost half a billion dollars to renovate. “I can only imagine what it’s like across the rest of the state, especially in schools built before the 1970s,” she added.
Johnson called for more mental health staff, noting social workers and nurses are often the first adults students confide in. “I cannot imagine running a school without a social worker or a nurse. Students sometimes come to school just to see them.”
Other board members called for more funding for support staff, statewide telehealth networks, and literacy programs.
Coltraine said DPI will bring a proposal to the board early next year in anticipation of the short legislative session, which begins in April.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/PB064885-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-04 16:57:33.605016

Iowa’s Rural Development Deputy State Director Henry Kummerer announced the grants Thursday, which will impact Butler, Carroll, Decatur, and Webster counties. 
The funding comes from USDA’s Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant program, which helps local utilities establish revolving loan funds to support projects that will create or retain jobs in their communities. According to USDA, the loans to the local utilities are interest-free.

USDA awarded $1 million each to Raccoon Valley Electric Cooperative and Corn Belt Power Cooperative to establish pass through loans to Iowa Corn Processors for the purpose of updating equipment and a packaging line at a milling facility in Glidden. 
According to the news release from USDA, the pass through loans to Iowa Corn Processors will create five new jobs and spur economic development in Carroll County.
USDA awarded a $1 million loan to Central Iowa Power Cooperative to pass through to Industrial Hardfacing Inc., a Lamoni-based manufacturer that makes custom parts for rendering, meatpacking, oil seed and pet food production. The pass through loan is expected to create six jobs, fund a building expansion and equipment purchases. 
Two pass through grants, each for $300,000 will help establish a dental practice in Fort Dodge. One grant will go to the Dumont Telephone Company in Butler County and another to Lehigh Valley Cooperative Telephone Association Inc.
Both utilities will use their $300,000 to establish a revolving loan fund to Erika and Thaylan Bowman as White Oak Dental, to purchase a dental practice in Fort Dodge. 
A news release about the grants said this project will “promote employment, expand dental care options, and support economic development” in the rural area.
Lastly, USDA is funding a $83,333 grant to Rockwell Cooperative Telephone Association for the creation of a revolving loan fund that will partially finance a new fire department and emergency services facility in Bristow. 
The release said the repayment of the loan will be used for “future business and community development loans” to spur economic activity in Bristow and surrounding Butler County communities. 
Kummerer said the local utilities receiving the pass through grants and loans help “unleash innovation and entrepreneurship” in their communities. 
“Under the leadership of the Trump Administration, USDA is continuing to partner with co-ops to support job creation and to promote economic development in rural Iowa,” Kummerer said in the release.

He said WSU is celebrating record fall semester enrollment, but warns “headcount alone does not always translate into revenue growth.” It's likely public universities in Kansas face comparable budget constraints. (Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Wichita State University president Richard Muma alerted faculty Thursday to prepare for a minimum 3% budget reduction and likely dismissal of campus employees despite celebrating the overall highest enrollment in university history.
Muma said in a message to the university community that nearly six months of internal debate on the budget centered on ramifications of a crash in international student enrollment, the nationwide decline in high school graduates, failure of state funding to keep pace with rising operational costs, the increasingly competitive fight for research funding and surging monetary demands of collegiate athletics.
He indicated budget adjustments at WSU would be targeted and occur in the current fiscal year as well as the the fiscal year starting July 1, 2026. The Kansas Board of Regents, which has authority over WSU and other public state universities in Kansas, submitted a reduced budget request to the 2026 Kansas Legislature in response to political pressure to hold down expenditures in the upcoming fiscal year.
“We are projecting a minimum 3% general use budget reduction,” Muma said. “While the specific steps will differ across (WSU’s) divisions, this will likely require a reduction in our workforce in some areas.”
Muma’s disclosures about WSU’s budget follow statements by University of Kansas chancellor Doug Girod about plans to cut spending by $32 million on the Lawrence campus and reduce spending by $39 million on the KU Medical Center campus in Kansas City, Kansas.
Approximately half of the reduction on the Lawrence campus would be rolled into bringing compensation for some faculty or staff closer to market rates of pay, he said. For example, he said, the Board of Regents approved KU’s proposal to provide maintenance workers on the main campus in Lawrence and a satellite campus in Overland Park with at least a 4% pay raise.
Girod said the 2026 session of the Legislature would be important, and early indications were that it would result in another tight budget year for state universities in Kansas.
The announcement by Muma came on heels of Wichita State’s Oct. 1 report that touted “record-breaking enrollment this fall, continuing a decade of extraordinary growth.” He said the student headcount at WSU and WSU Tech hit 25,147 this fall. He said the tally reflected five consecutive years of growth at WSU.
“This surge in enrollment reflects what we’ve known all along,” Muma said two months ago. “When you prioritize access, affordability and student success, students will choose Wichita State.”
In Thursday’s statement, however, Muma said the reality of higher enrollment was “headcount alone does not always translate into revenue growth.” He said WSU wasn’t the only university in the region experiencing comparable challenges.
In the commentary shared with WSU personnel, Muma emphasized the erosion of international student enrollment at WSU and linked it to problems with securing student visas. WSU typically enrolled graduate students from about 100 countries but recently placed an emphasis on recruiting engineering students from India.
“Because of changes in the way student visas are issued, we have experienced declines in international students and are predicting an acceleration of this dynamic for the foreseeable future,” Muma said.
The administration of President Donald Trump made it more difficult to obtain a student visa in 2025, and the change had an influence on first-time graduate student enrollment in the United States. The Institute of International Education’s survey of 800 U.S. higher education institutions said enrollment by new international students fell 17% this fall.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Muma-6-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-04 16:57:33.605016

(Sharon Sullivan for Colorado Newsline)Tina Peters, the former Mesa County clerk who is serving a Colorado prison sentence, has applied for a pardon from President Donald Trump, according to her lawyer.
Peters was convicted for her role in a scheme to breach the security of her own election equipment in 2021, part of an effort to find evidence that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. 
An application for a presidential pardon was filed “about two weeks ago,” Peter Ticktin, her Florida-based attorney, told Newsline Wednesday.

Presidential pardons are universally understood to apply only to federal cases. Peters was convicted on state charges. But Ticktin argues that the Constitution’s references to the United States apply to the individual states as well as the country as a whole. 
“So when the Constitution speaks of the United States in terms of the power of pardon, they’re speaking of the states and the crimes that are done against the states, as well as any that would be against the federal government,” Ticktin said during a recent appearance on Steve Bannon’s podcast.

Newsline has not been able to verify that the Trump administration has received a clemency petition from Peters. A request for comment to the U.S. Department of Justice had not been answered by the time of publication.
The Colorado attorney general’s office was not aware that Peters had submitted a petition for a pardon, according to a spokesperson. 
“One of the most basic principles of our constitution is that states have independent sovereignty and manage our own criminal justice systems without interference from the federal government,” Phil Weiser, the Democratic attorney general, said in a statement. “The idea that a president could pardon someone tried and convicted in state court has no precedent in American law, would be an outrageous departure from what our constitution requires, and will not hold up.”
Ticktin acknowledges that the question of state-level presidential pardon power has never come up in American legal cases. But he pointed to reasons the Peters request might gain momentum.
“I can tell you that there’s one lawyer in the White House, that works in the White House, that understood the argument and realized that it was viable,” Ticktin said.
Colorado governor’s office affirms rejection of Tina Peters transfer request

He declined to identify the lawyer or specify the lawyer’s role.
But Ed Martin, the U.S. pardon attorney, whose job it is to oversee federal clemency petitions, has expressed sympathy with Peters. 
“We’ve been fighting for two months to figure out a path on Tina Peters,” he told Bannon during a Nov. 10 podcast appearance.
The previous day, Martin announced on social media the mass pardon of Trump allies who allegedly were involved in the attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. In response to the question, “Where is Tina Peters?!?!?” Martin replied, “We are working on it!”
Trump has repeatedly demanded that Colorado officials release Peters, threatening “harsh measures” if they refuse. Trump posted his latest call for Peters’ release Wednesday.
Trump has been willing to challenge other assumptions about foundational law, such as with his rejection of birthright citizenship.
The pardon question should ultimately be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court, Ticktin said. The Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority and has sided with Trump at a rate that court observers say is unusual.
“It doesn’t make any sense for the president not to give this pardon to me, because all that could happen is that his powers could be defined to be larger, in that he would be able to pardon state offenses as well as federal. If I lose, if the Supreme Court doesn’t agree with me, well then he’s no worse off, right?” Ticktin said.
Peters, 70, is incarcerated at La Vista Correctional Facility in Pueblo. The Republican was convicted by a Mesa County jury and sentenced in October 2024. There is no credible evidence that the 2020 election results were compromised or that her prosecution, which was led by a Republican district attorney, was flawed.
She has appealed her conviction in state court and she is pursuing a habeas corpus petition in the U.S. District Court of Colorado, where she argues she should be released on bond. The federal Bureau of Prisons has requested that state officials transfer custody of Peters to federal authorities. Gov. Jared Polis rebuffed the request.

(Photo by John McGauley)The bill before Indiana House members Thursday might have been about creating a new casino license for Fort Wayne, but the discussion was far more complicated.
Rep. Ethan Manning – chair of the House Public Policy Committee – said he knows of four or five competing casino bills this session with different ideas. He encouraged the hearing as a starting point of the overall discussion.
Indeed, some of the testimony focused instead on transferring an existing casino license from southern Indiana to northern Indiana.
And other locales, including Indianapolis and Steuben County, don’t think they should be left out of the conversation on the best location.
A study released by the Indiana Gaming Commission in October found that Indianapolis was the top location for a casino relocation, followed by northeast Indiana.
While the Indianapolis region would bring the state more tax revenue, it would also hurt the two casinos nearby in Shelbyville and Anderson that help support the horse racing industry. Northeast Indiana was seen as more of an open market, impacting casinos in Ohio and Michigan.
Rep. Craig Snow’s legislation, House Bill 1038, would add a 14th casino license in the state and create a competitive bidding process for that license. A minimum $50 million license fee would be paid to the state by the casino operator.
The committee will return in January to amend and vote on the bill.

“This opportunity is too big of an opportunity for the city of Fort Wayne to pass up,” said Fort Wayne Mayor Sharon Tucker. “We recognize and see that the economic investment, the economic development that could happen because of a license being located in the city of Fort Wayne is tremendous.”
Tucker and the three Allen County Commissioners submitted a letter on Dec. 1 to legislative leaders with an agreement on how money from any local development agreement would be split. These agreements are generally between casino operators and local government to put money into growing a community.
Sixty percent of the revenue would be distributed to communities in Allen County based on population. The remaining 40% — estimated at about $11 million a year — would be put into a designated humanitarian fund for non-profits to help improve mental health and combat homelessness, addiction and other challenges. A board would be appointed by elected officials to oversee the distribution of these funds.
“Whether it’s in the city of Fort Wayne, or whether it is in the county … everyone in our community would have an opportunity to benefit,” Tucker said.
Tom Kelley, a prominent Fort Wayne businessman, said the proposed economic impact of a casino is more than $200 million annually.
“I believe very strongly that’s the vitality that our kids and our grandchildren need to keep moving forward. The city, the county, the state, have put Fort Wayne and northeast Indiana in a very enviable state to attract businesses,” he said. “And the more money we have for economic development, the more jobs we’re able to create, the more income for the state of Indiana.”
The bill does not include a referendum for voters to approve having a casino – something that all other gambling communities have passed.
Tucker said she is “never in opposition of allowing the public to speak” but she is concerned about slowing the process with a referendum. She and others acknowledged a tribal casino in the area is also a possibility, but a state-regulated facility would be better.

Several Hoosiers testified against a casino coming to the area, including Allen County resident Kristen Bissontz. She said it doesn’t match the family-friendly character of the area and will hurt local residents who become addicted to gambling.
“No one is talking about the social impact of what’s about to happen here when you bring a casino into virgin territory,” Bissontz said. “I have one study that says 83% of the revenue for casinos is from residents, my neighbors. You’re coming to pillage my village.”
Matt Bell, president of the Casino Association of Indiana, opposed the bill. He said adding a new license would bring instability to the industry.
“If y’all make the decision to create new licenses in Indiana, then you are injecting tremendous uncertainty into that investment market. You’re making it much harder to bring capital to the state of Indiana,” he said.
But the association doesn’t have a position on moving an existing license.
That is the route some believe makes more sense as the Rising Star Casino in southeastern Indiana’s Ohio County — owned and operated by Full House Resorts — has seen revenues plummet since casinos opened in Ohio and gambling has expanded in Kentucky.
Full House supported a bill last year to move its license to New Haven Indiana but the legislation died.
“We definitely agree that northeast Indiana should host a destination casino … we just disagree with the approach,” said Alex Stolyar, senior vice president for Full House. “We would rather see allowing us to relocate our license, rather than expanding.”
He also promised a high-quality casino resort that will be used to grow the region.

BRATTLEBORO — Brattleboro Memorial Hospital is projecting to end its current budget with a $14.5 million operating loss, potentially extending a string of annual shortfalls since 2020.
“This is not the budget outcome we had hoped for,” Elizabeth McLarney, one of two acting co-CEOs, said in a written statement Thursday.
The 500-worker hospital, the main health care provider for about 55,000 people in southeastern Vermont, initially proposed a $121 million budget for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. Under the plan reviewed by the state this summer and fall, the not-for-profit facility expected to close out spending next Sept. 30 with a $244,529 surplus.

But regulators at Vermont’s Green Mountain Care Board questioned the accuracy of those figures in August and ordered the hospital in October to recalculate its budget or risk becoming the first health care facility to receive state intervention under a new law.
Administrators have blamed the hospital’s fiscal problems on everything from too many unpaid patient bills to their own staff’s rising health insurance costs. Submitting an updated $130 million budget to the state this week, they also cited about $5 million of coming losses due to federal and state changes in pharmaceutical prices and payments.
Regulators have yet to say whether they’ll hold another review hearing but believe the $14.5 million projected loss is “an accurate representation,” spokesperson Kristen LaJeunesse said in a written statement.
The new numbers come as the 61-bed hospital has launched a hiring freeze, let go of six administrators and hired two outside advisers — Ovation Healthcare, a national consultant, and David Sanville, a former chief financial officer at Windsor’s Mt. Ascutney Hospital.
The facility also is searching for a new CEO after its most recent leader, Christopher Dougherty, took an unexplained leave of absence in October and permanently exited his post last month.
“The parties agree that under the current circumstances it is best for Chris to depart and for the hospital to bring in new leadership,” the not-for-profit facility said in a written public statement.
The hospital, one of Brattleboro’s three largest employers, currently is being led by McLarney, an orthopaedic surgeon, and fellow acting co-CEO Tony Blofson, a primary care physician.
“We will continue to thoroughly monitor our finances with a focus on maximizing patient access and closely evaluating all expenses,” Blofson said in a written statement Thursday. “We also stand by our earlier promise to our staff and our community to remain open and transparent about BMH’s financial challenges as we move forward.”

(Photo provided by the S.C. Department of Transportation)COLUMBIA — South Carolina’s transportation agency wants to get rid of about 20 pages’ worth of regulations it considers unnecessary. But the bureaucratic process to undo the bureaucracy could take at least six months.
Amid calls from legislators and advocates to remove duplicative and outdated rules, the Department of Transportation has spent nearly two years reconsidering its 69-page code of regulations, Secretary Justin Powell told the agency’s oversight commission Thursday.
Getting rid of those regulations will “make sure that we’re as nimble, as effective and as good of stewards of the taxpayers’ dollars as we can be,” Powell said.
To get there, the agency will need to go through another set of bureaucratic hurdles.
The department plans to submit the proposed regulations to the State Register later this month. After that, the proposals will go through two separate 30-day public comment periods, giving the agency a chance to make any changes in between. If more than 25 people request a public hearing, the agency will need to host an open meeting to hear the public’s opinions.
And then the DOT Commission will have to vote. Once the agency has a final version of its proposal, any changes need approval from the state Legislature, which has 110 days to vote them up or down. If legislators do nothing in that time period, the changes will then take effect automatically.
That could mean around six months of waiting to get the regulations off the books. If the Legislature rejects the proposal, the agency would have to rewrite it and start the clock over — though that’s highly unlikely.
“It’s a long process to go in and revise regulations, as you can see,” agency attorney Barbara Wessinger said.
Among the rules department staff found redundant was the Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Program, which dates to 1989. To get federal funds, the agency was required to spend 10% of its money on companies considered disadvantaged, including those owned by women and people in racial minorities.
The Department of Transportation’s regulation applies only to contracts up to $250,000, which the agency rarely issues because construction costs are typically much higher, Powell said Wednesday. And the 10% rule is double the requirement in state law regarding contracts with minority-owned businesses.
SC governor halts carve outs for minority-owned businesses in state agency contracts

Gov. Henry McMaster directed all state agencies Wednesday to stop signing contracts with companies based on the owner’s race. They were essentially instructed to ignore state law until the Republican-dominated Legislature can remove those sections entirely next year. That would potentially pull the transportation agency’s regulations even further out of alignment with state law.
The regulation will soon conflict with federal rules as well. A proposed federal change would remove sections from the program that automatically consider woman-owned and minority-owned businesses disadvantaged.
Instead of trying to keep up with all those incoming changes, department staff decided it would be better to remove the regulation entirely, Wessinger said.
“Considering there are going to be some dynamic changes in the federal process, a lot of these regulations become outdated,” she said.
The long process will be worth the wait, said commissioner Thomas Rhodes, a businessman who also leads the state Chamber of Commerce.
“In this season of election that’s coming up, reducing red tape and modernizing DOT is going to be at the forefront of a lot of people’s minds,” Rhodes said. “Reducing regulations to make the department work better is a step in the right direction.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/winter-storm-warning-1024x637.jpg,,,2025-12-04 16:57:33.605016

(Photo courtesy of the North Dakota University System)The North Dakota State Board of Higher Education on Thursday named an interim president at Valley City State University but delayed naming an interim leader at North Dakota State University. 
The University System will send out a request for letters of interest from potential interim candidates. 
Board Chair Kevin Black said an interim president could be named in January. 
North Dakota State University President David Cook last month was named president of Iowa State University. 
A presidential search committee will meet Friday in Fargo. The committee is co-chaired by Black and Jace Beehler, chief of staff for the NDSU president. 
Black said the meeting will include discussion of a search firm and a timeline. 
Valley City State president leaving for South Dakota college

Allen Burgad will lead Valley City State University, a four-year college with an emphasis on training teachers. Burgad is the dean of the Department of Education.
Burgad is a 1989 graduate of Valley City State. He has previously served as an administrator in K-12 schools systems, including West Fargo, Stanley, Northern Cass and Napoleon.
President Alan LaFave is leaving Valley City to take over the Northern State presidency in January. 
“Dr. Burgad brings both deep institutional knowledge and broad experience in education, which ensures a seamless transition in leadership,” Black said in a news release. 
Black said LaFave’s tenure was “marked by steady growth and advancements in teaching and technology.”
The University System said it is expected Burgad will serve as interim president until a new president is hired, likely in late spring 2026.
Board member D.J. Campbell and Erica Buchholz, vice president for business affairs at Valley City State, are chairing the search committee. 
The board also is searching for a president at Bismarck State College. A job description is expected to be posted next week.

The theme for this year is “the Learning Tree,” with ornaments made by students at public and private schools across the state. 
“We encouraged them to think about what learning means to them, and we encouraged them to reflect on all the people who made learning possible and fun,” Evers said. “The librarian who helped them find a new favorite book. The school nurse who helped them when they weren’t feeling well. The school bus driver who gets them [to school] and gets them home safely. The teacher who helped them learn something they really didn’t think they could learn, and so many others who played a role in helping our kids bring the best and fullest selves to the classroom every day.”
The students’ handmade ornaments decorate a 30-foot balsam fir donated by Dave and Mary Vander Velden, the retired owners of Whispering Pines Tree Farm in Oconto County. It was harvested by Henry Schienebeck and members of the Great Lakes Timber Professionals Association. 
Ellie Mason, an eighth-grader from John Muir Middle School in Wausau, spoke about what the Learning Tree means to her and helped Evers flip the switch to turn the tree lights on. 
“I picture a tree with many branches reaching out in every direction, each one helping me climb a little higher. The tree is strong with many branches, each one supporting the others,” Mason said. “That’s what school feels like to me.” 
Mason said her mom and other members of her family are teachers, and they have shown her that being a teacher “means caring about people so much that you believe in what they become.” She thanked Wisconsin teachers, custodians, principals, nurses, cafeteria workers and office staff for all their hard work. 
“You are the branches of the Learning Tree, lifting us up into helping us reach our whole potential,” Mason said.
“You slay” states one of the student made ornaments on the “Learning Tree.” (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)
Other speakers at the lighting included Rodney Esser, also known as “Mr. Peanuts,” who is the head custodian at Park Elementary School and has spent 60 years with the Middleton-Cross Plains Area School District, Green Bay West High School Teacher Ellie Hinz-Radue, and CEO and Executive Director of the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority Elmer Moore Jr. The lighting also featured performances by the La Crosse Central High School band and four members of the Kids From Wisconsin, an audition show choir group made up of students from across the state. 
Not everyone had a positive reaction to the “Learning Tree.” Republican gubernatorial hopefuls criticized Evers for not calling it a “Christmas tree.”
“They won’t even call it a “Christmas” tree. Time to replace woke nonsense with Wisconsin common sense in 2026,” U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany said on social media. He tagged Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, one of the Democratic gubernatorial hopefuls, in his post.
Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann wrote about the announcement of the tree theme on social media, saying “it’s a Christmas tree, Tony. I look forward to highlighting all our wonderful Wisconsin Christmas traditions as Governor, and having the best, biggest, most impressive CHRISTMAS TREE in the Capitol!” 
Evers is not running for reelection next year. 
The state under Evers’ leadership started referring to the tree in the Capitol as a holiday tree in 2019 to avoid perceptions that it was endorsing any religion. Each winter season since then has been marked by complaints from Republicans about ecumenical terminology for the time of year and traditions. In 2020, a pair of Republican lawmakers went so far as to set up their own tree in the Capitol rotunda in protest.

(Photo by Lori Kersey/West Virginia Watch)West Virginia state employees will see another increase in their health insurance costs beginning this summer. 
The finance board for the West Virginia Public Employees Insurance Agency on Thursday approved 3% rate increases for employees, employers and retirees during the 2027 fiscal year, which starts in July 2026. 
The board last month held a series of public hearings around the state about its plan to increase costs again this year. The board approved the plan as presented during its October meeting, with no changes.
For state employees, a monthly spousal surcharge will increase by an average of $200 per month. The surcharge is for families that have a spouse who chose a PEIA plan despite having the option of a health insurance plan offered by their own employer. 
PEIA director Brent Wolfingbarger said the spousal surcharge increase was the most contentious topic during the meetings. Wolfingbarger said state law requires PEIA to charge families the cost of the actuarial value of the spouse’s plan. 
“The proposed spousal surcharge increase of $200 is mandated based on the opinions given to us by our actuaries,” he said. “So the Legislature has established this policy, and if any changes are to be made, that would be a legislative decision to make.”
An employer administrative fee will increase by $2.50
Non-state agencies would be required to have at least half of their employees enrolled in a PEIA health plan. 
In July, PEIA raised rates by 14% for state employees and by 16% for local government employees. Retirees also saw a 12% increase in premiums.
PEIA leaders have said that the rising cost of health care — particularly inflation on prescription GLP-1 drugs that treat obesity and diabetes — are a major driver of the rate increases.
Leaders have also pointed to a report from the firm BDO that indicated that the sharp rate increases that public workers have had in recent years had been caused in large part because between the years 2018-2022, rates had been frozen. Former Gov. Jim Justice had vowed not to increase the rates during his time as the state’s chief executive.
Speaking to the finance board Thursday, Dale Lee, co-president of Education West Virginia, said the Legislature should take PEIA’s rising costs seriously and make the spousal charge more fair for state employees. 
“I know of people, service personnel, who are making in the first or second tier and paying the same amount for spousal surcharge as the superintendent, making $180,000 a year,” Lee said. “There’s something wrong. There’s something philosophically wrong, in my opinion.”
Lee thanked the board for researching the spousal charge so that the public knows what the answer is.  
“Now we know where to turn our attention, and we turn our attention to the Legislature, because that has to be changed,” Lee said. “There are other things that have to be changed in this we are more than happy to sit down and start the discussions, be a part of the discussions, be part of the solutions.”

Henry McMaster at the state's inaugural nuclear summit. (Photo courtesy of USC)COLUMBIA — State utility executives, legislators and the lead investor in the reboot of South Carolina’s abandoned nuclear reactors will tell the story behind the multibillion-dollar deal during a nuclear-focused conference in Columbia next week.
The state’s second annual nuclear summit will feature a panel conversation with Santee Cooper CEO Jimmy Staton, president of the utility’s governing board Peter McCoy, House Speaker Murrell Smith, R-Sumter, and state Sen. Tom Davis, R-Beaufort.
Separately, attendees will hear from the executives of Brookfield Asset Management, the New York investment firm in negotiations with Santee Cooper for the purchase of two partially built reactors at the V.C. Summer nuclear station in Fairfield County.
The event is something of a celebration of actions taken over the past year and a half, according to Ethel Bunch, the founder of a nuclear advocacy group — the Palmetto Nuclear Coalition — made up of large energy-using companies and nuclear-related firms that is co-hosting the conference alongside the University of South Carolina.
After all, it was during the state’s inaugural nuclear summit in August 2024 that Davis, one of the project’s most vocal cheerleader in the Legislature, publicly broached the idea of a V.C. Summer restart.
“He came out on the stage after the breakout sessions and said, ‘We’re all talking around this opportunity. We need to talk about this opportunity,’” Bunch said.
Those remarks set into motion a chain of events: a scouting trip by a state advisory group to see the condition of the unfinished reactors, Santee Cooper putting them on the market, Gov. Henry McMaster’s calls for a “nuclear renaissance,” legislation supporting the effort, and now a pending deal for the sale.
A nuclear history
Whispers about rebooting V.C. Summer’s expansion had begun a year earlier, Bunch said, as tech giants and major manufacturers looked for sources of low-to-no carbon power. Nuclear became the answer.
South Carolina’s four nuclear power plants already supply 55% of the state’s total electricity and the state is the third-largest producer of nuclear power in the nation, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
The state also is home to nuclear fuel-maker Westinghouse’s U.S. facility. And the Savannah River Site, which once produced weapons-grade plutonium and tritium for the U.S. nuclear arsenal during the decades-long Cold War, now recycles the radioactive materials for reuse.
SC’s state utility enters negotiations on deal to restart failed nuclear project

Now state leaders want to double-down and make South Carolina a nuclear stronghold.
The V.C. Summer expansion, fraught with fraud and cost overruns, continues to be a black mark on the state that has left power customers footing the bill for the reactors that have never produced a megawatt.
But in the past year, restarting construction has gone from a far-fetched idea to one politicians and industry executives are championing.
At the conference Tuesday, Santee Cooper leadership is expected to talk in depth about the closed-door meetings where the decisions were made.
Executives from Brookfield will then take the stage to talk about their interest in the South Carolina power plant and other national trends. Brookfield now also owns Westinghouse, the company that designed the V.C. Summer reactors, having bought it when the nuclear debacle sent it spiraling into bankruptcy.
What’s next
In October, Brookfield, its subsidiary Westinghouse and Canada-based Cameco inked a partnership deal valued at $80 billion, with the U.S. government. The companies will build 10 reactors identical to those at V.C. Summer.
Under the agreement, the federal government will help secure financing and permits for the reactors. In return, the government could take a 20% share of any profits after Brookfield and Cameco take a $17.5 billion share.
If Westinghouse’s value surpasses $30 billion by 2029, the government could turn those profits into a 20% equity stake in the company.
Final executive punished for VC Summer failure to spend at least 10 months in prison

South Carolina’s reactors would be the first and second on the list, with construction starting by 2030.
“When you’re an engineer, all problems become opportunities,” said Hossein Haj-Hariri, the dean of USC’s engineering and computing school. “V.C. Summer was a major egg on the face of the state. But we have (the reactors.) They’re sitting there. They are partly done.”
The project still has a long way to go, Haj-Hariri acknowledges, but USC also wants to be part of the solution.
The state’s largest university system is offering up its technological expertise.
“The thing that has made nuclear struggle is not the design of the reactor. It’s how do you put it together so that you come in on time and on budget?” Haj-Hariri said.
His suggestions: use modern tools, such as artificial intelligence and sensors, to gather data and learn as you build; make use of new, more advanced building materials; and use drones to manage the construction site.
“We are going to develop construction engineering with a focus on nuclear so that we can help the eventual builder of V.C. Summer,” Haj-Hariri said. “We are not just building two reactors. We are building the infrastructure that helps build future reactors. We come up with processes.”
To ensure the plans will work, USC has the technology to create virtual simulations to test them out before building begins, something the school has been doing for years at its McNair Aerospace Center, alongside Columbia-based Integer Technologies, on contracts for the U.S. Department of Defense.
Other opportunities
In addition to the Trump administration’s push for 10 new, large-scale reactors, Haj-Hariri sees opportunity in another of the president’s executive orders.
That order calls for small-scale, micro reactors at nine U.S. Army bases by 2028: Fort Benning in Georgia, Fort Bragg in North Carolina, Fort Campbell in Kentucky, Fort Drum in New York, Fort Hood in Texas, Fort Wainwright in Alaska, Holston Army Ammunition Plant in Tennessee, Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington, and Redstone Arsenal in Alabama.
Smaller nuclear reactors spark renewed interest in a once-shunned energy source

USC already has a head start. The college has worked on micro reactor projects in the past, Haj-Hariri said.
The Army previously explored them as a way to replace the need for diesel generators used to power battlefield outposts for deployed troops. The school also was developing mini reactors for fueling naval ships until the Trump administration defunded the project in its DOGE-led purge of clean energy grants, Haj-Hariri said.
USC hopes to channel this momentum around nuclear into a new innovation center planned for the south end of campus. The five-story building would house reactor-related research on three floors while renting out the remaining space to industry partners.
And more nuclear in the state could spell more jobs of USC engineering graduates.
Of the 1,700 South Carolina college students who graduated in 2021 with a bachelor’s degree in engineering, only 54% were working in the state a year after graduation, according to data from the state employment agency.
“It’s not because our graduates don’t want to stay here,” he said. “But if there are no jobs, then where do they go? They go to North Carolina, Georgia, somewhere else.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Advanced_Nuclear_Summit_2024-137-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-12-04 15:59:06.616715

A recap of VTDigger’s live conversation with education reporter Corey McDonald.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Act 73 explained: 10 things to know about Vermont’s education reform law.","Vermont’s new education reform law, Act 73, sets in motion a multi-year effort to restructure how the state funds and governs its public schools. During a live conversation on Dec. 2, 2025, I sat down with VTDigger education reporter Corey McDonald to hear him break down the new law and answer reader questions about what it all means. 
Below is the full recording of our conversation and a summary of ten key points Vermonters should know. 
Watch the full recording


Ten key takeaways
1. Why did lawmakers pass Act 73?
Vermont has been grappling with several long-term trends:

The state consistently ranks among the highest spenders per pupil in the nation.
Student enrollment has declined over the last two to three decades.
Property taxes have increased more than 40% in the past five years.

These pressures led to widespread concern about the sustainability of the current system. After one-third of school budgets failed to pass in 2024 and following shifts in the political landscape, lawmakers pursued broad reform.
2. What does Act 73 aim to change?
Act 73 lays out a multi-year plan to reexamine how Vermont funds and organizes its public school system. It creates several committees and task forces to study areas including school construction, transportation and special education services.
A central goal of Act 73 is to move Vermont toward a foundation formula, the funding model used by most states.
Under this formula, the state would set a base funding amount per student and adjust for students requiring more support. This would shift significant decision-making authority from local districts to the state.
3. Why does the law require school district consolidation?
Vermont currently has 52 supervisory unions and supervisory districts and 119 individual school districts.
Act 73 states that implementing a foundation formula will require substantial consolidation. Lawmakers are tasked with reducing the total number of districts to 10–25.
The state’s redistricting task force recommended moving toward regional service entities and made a recommendation against forced mergers, but the Legislature is not obligated to adopt the task force’s recommendations.
4. Will consolidation actually save money?
Evidence is limited.

The governor’s administration estimates that switching to the foundation formula could save around $180 million annually, but only if districts are consolidated.
A 2024 study of the 2015 reform law, Act 46, found limited savings from previous district mergers.
The redistricting task force has said that they found little to no evidence for or against the claim that consolidation itself saves money.

5. What changes have already gone into effect?
One significant change is the tightening of eligibility for independent schools receiving public tuition. Independent schools must now meet two tests:

Be located in a district without public schools for some or all grades as of July 2024
Have had at least 25% publicly funded students in the 2023–24 year.

Only 18 independent schools currently meet these requirements. But students already enrolled may continue receiving public tuition through graduation.
6. How are school districts responding to the law so far?
While the implementation timeline spans several years, the uncertainty has prompted some districts to take action on their own including:

Considering changes to grade configurations, including possible closures.
Reviewing the viability of their elementary schools as they plan for long-term enrollment and governance changes.
Exploring voluntary partnerships to prepare for possible structural changes.

These steps are not mandated by Act 73 but reflect efforts by some school administrators and communities to prepare for potential future requirements.
7. What will happen to small, rural schools?
Act 73 acknowledges that some schools are “small or sparse by necessity” and signals lawmakers intend to preserve some of them. What qualifies a school for that protection is still being defined.
Research shows school closures often harm community cohesion and local economies, a concern weighing heavily on rural towns.
8. How does the law address special education needs?
A state report recently found that special education needs in Vermont are rising, and many districts lack the necessary staffing or specialized resources to meet those needs.
Act 73 requires the Agency of Education and the State Advisory Panel on Special Education to create a three-year statewide strategic plan for delivering services. That report is scheduled to be released this month.
9. Does the law address health care costs?
In short, no. Employee salaries and health insurance make up the largest portion of district budgets, and health care costs continue to increase each year. Act 73 does not include any measures directly aimed at addressing this cost driver.
10. What decisions do lawmakers need to make next?
The upcoming legislative session will determine whether Act 73 proceeds as envisioned. Act 73 hinges on drawing up new school district maps, and new governance configurations.
If the Legislature cannot reach agreement during the 2026 session, it could significantly undermine the law. At minimum, implementation would be delayed beyond the timeline envisioned when the law passed.
Even so, there is broad recognition among lawmakers that the current system is under strain and that some form of change is needed. Ongoing increases in property tax estimates are likely to heighten the pressure for action as the session unfolds.

Wintersteen will retire as president in early January 2026. (Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa State University President Wendy Wintersteen, who will step away from her position and the institution at the start of the new year, said Thursday her last days have been spent preparing for a presidential transition.
Many people have thanked Wintersteen and touted what she’s leaving behind when she retires, including decades of service to the university in different roles and the plans and partnerships she helped cultivate during her time. Both candidates for the university presidency spoke about the foundation Wintersteen has built at ISU, and incoming president David Cook told community members before his selection that he wouldn’t “reinvent the wheel” that she got rolling.
When it comes to Wintersteen’s own thoughts on her legacy, however, she said she’ll leave that up to the people who are connected to, and impacted by, her decisions and actions.
“I always say that I don’t think it’s up to individuals to say what their legacy is going to be, that others will determine what their legacy is. I think that really is correct,” Wintersteen said. “I would tell you, though, that from my point of view, what I really have enjoyed and felt good about is my work to support the students at Iowa State University, and my focus has been on how we ensure that the students have an excellent experience at Iowa State.”

Student success at ISU is evident in the metrics and rankings published on retention, graduate outcomes and more, Wintersteen said. Year-over-year retention for new students topped 89% this year and job placement within six months for graduates is around 94%.
The university is happy with these numbers but there is always room for improvement, Wintersteen said, and there are outside factors ISU doesn’t control that impact whether a student continues their education.
While state and federal actions have caused greater uncertainty among students and institutions, Wintersteen said, “we still have a tremendous ability to make sure that our students are welcome to Iowa State University, that they’re supported.”
This support comes from a variety of areas, she said, from student government and other student-run organizations to the divisions of student life and academic affairs, which use a “hand-in-glove” approach to connect experiences both in and outside of the classroom.
“Gone are the days like when I was in college, where you’re in organic chemistry and they say, ‘two-thirds of you are going to fail,’” Wintersteen said. “Now it’s, ‘how do we help you be successful?’”
One concern brought up by a student to then-presidential candidate Cook was that faculty were worried about bringing up certain topics or discussions in class due to fear of administrative decisions and policies at the state and federal level.
When asked about this issue, Wintersteen said Provost Jason Keith and General Counsel Michael Norton have held “educational sessions” with college deans, department heads and faculty members to go over academic freedom and faculty responsibilities. These talks have been “well received,” she said, and she believes they have reduced faculty members’ worries.
“I think we’ve done the right thing at Iowa State by addressing the concern in an open and transparent way and by having these sessions,” Wintersteen said. “And I know that the provost and the general counsel will continue to have these conversations so that … the faculty can continue to feel confident that they understand — and if you understand, then you can do your job in a way that you do not have to have any concern.”
Another area of potential change sweeping through Iowa higher education is the possibility of public universities offering shorter degree programs and community colleges launching four-year degrees.
Wintersteen said universities are “constantly evolving,” using an ongoing “evaluation of different majors” by faculty leaders, the provost’s office and academic advisory committees as an example of how ISU responds to workforce needs and changing industries.
“Now the pace of evolution may be changing, and that’s something that we just all need to understand again and be ready for and and be engaged in the conversations, because if you’re not in front of the ball, so to speak, then you’re behind it,” Wintersteen said.
Wherever Wintersteen goes, whether it’s outside of her office in Beardshear Hall or another country altogether, she said people will recognize and greet her with a friendly “President Wintersteen,” or more typically, “Wendy.” She’s often found alumni on campus finding their way back to see old teachers and mentors, and they always have stories to tell from their time at ISU.
Beyond the students, Wintersteen said she’ll miss the instant connections being the face of ISU brought her way. She plans to travel, both to new places and places she loves, for a while after retirement before deciding what she wants to do next.
“Honestly, I think people will still talk to me, so that’ll be kind of nice — I love that part of the job,” Wintersteen said. “To let them share their stories with me, that’s been special.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Two Oklahoma City Board of Education members won’t seek reelection next year, clearing the way for one unopposed candidate and two other contenders running to succeed them.
Mike Shelton, of District 5 in Oklahoma City Public Schools, and Meg McElhaney, of District 7, chose not to enter the 2026 board of education elections during the three-day candidate filing window this week.
Shelton’s District 5 seat, representing Oklahoma City’s northeast side and Spencer, drew one candidate, Vernona Dismuke, 59, a longtime area resident who works at a licensed insurance agency. Her lack of opponents signals she will succeed Shelton, 52, when his term expires in April.
Two candidates filed to run for McElhaney’s District 7 seat in south Oklahoma City — University of Oklahoma student Natalie Roman, 22, and nonprofit worker Galilea Martinez, 28.
Roman and Martinez will appear on District 7 ballots in the school board general election April 7, skipping the need for a primary election Feb. 10.
McElhaney, 34, joined the board in 2019 as an appointee to fill an unexpired term and twice ran unopposed for reelection. She announced in a Nov. 28 social media post that she wouldn’t seek another four-year term.
Her tenure has spanned COVID-19, the passage of a nearly $1 billion bond, the departure of Superintendent Sean McDaniel and the board’s hiring of Jamie Polk to replace him. McElhaney also cited the revival of the district’s Legislative Breakfast — which brings together Oklahoma City students, teachers, district administrators and state lawmakers — as a highlight.
“Our district is in great hands, our bond projects are coming to life, and it feels like the right moment to make space for someone new to continue this work,” McElhaney wrote in her announcement.

Shelton said he chose not to run for reelection so he could focus on other time-consuming responsibilities, including a new job as executive director of Oklahomans for Criminal Justice Reform. The former Democratic state lawmaker was appointed to the board in June 2024 to replace former board member Adrian Anderson, who resigned when moving out of District 5.
Shelton said he will continue living in northeast Oklahoma City, but his job requires frequent overnight stays in Tulsa, where the criminal justice advocacy organization is based.
Throughout his year-and-a-half tenure on the board, he’s been willing to split from the majority, even if it meant casting the lone dissenting vote. He openly expressed disagreement with a new statewide school cellphone ban, the level of pay for Polk and a policy allowing non-OKCPS residents to serve on a committee overseeing the district’s bond-funded projects. The policy permits those who live or work within the district’s boundaries to serve on the Bond Citizens Oversight Committee.
District 5 needs a vocal representative on the board, “not a rubber stamp,” Shelton told Oklahoma Voice. The area contains Frederick A. Douglass High School and Star Spencer High School and their feeder schools, where a majority of students are Black, as well as the state’s No. 1-ranked high school, Classen High School of Advanced Studies at Northeast.
“There’s a constant conflict between the people that serve in this (District 5) seat right here and the school board chair — prior to me, and if things don’t change it will continue,” Shelton said. “So, this board member needs to be strong enough to be willing to stand out by themselves and understand that you’ve got to ask questions. 
“They’ve got to dig down a little deeper to make sure that our students and families are being treated fairly.”
Dismuke said she aims to be that type of school board member. She said District 5 “needs somebody who’s going to be a voice, who has the ability to fuss, fight and argue, if you will, and have critical discussions, come to some sort of agreement and then move forward.”

“I believe that those of us who live in the district would agree that we have unique needs and we need to be heard and we need to be seen, and it would be my honor to be able to do that,” Dismuke said.
Dismuke, an Oklahoma City native and OKCPS graduate, has lived in District 5 since 1997 and plans to move to Spencer in the near future. Her three children graduated from Northeast High School, and her niece, whom she’s caring for, is a student at Frederick A. Douglass.
She said she first considered running for a school board seat 25 years ago, and the desire never went away. Her top concern, she said, is how Oklahoma City will position itself for the future, when education and workforce needs could become drastically different from what they are today.
“I’d like to work at the systemic level and be at the table in terms of helping make decisions concerning the future of education,” she said.
The school district’s only contested race will take place in the majority-Hispanic area of south Oklahoma City. District 7 contains Capitol Hill High School and Southeast High School, as well as the middle and elementary schools that feed into them.
Roman, who did not return requests for comment, is a student in OU’s Gallogly College of Engineering, according to the university’s directory. Her social media accounts indicate she’s studying computer science.
Her opponent, Martinez, is an Oklahoma City native who graduated from OU with degrees in nonprofit administration and political science. After attending Capitol Hill Elementary, she finished her K-12 education in charter schools, first at Dove Science Academy and graduating high school from Harding Fine Arts Academy.

Martinez started her career by working in political campaigns before moving into policy- and election-focused nonprofits, including Voto Latino, Run For Something and Future Caucus. She is now the associate director of communications and events for the Partnership for Large Election Jurisdictions, an organization focused on best practices for elections.
Martinez said she’s a reflection of District 7’s demographics, where a majority of students are Latino and come from low-income households. Her first language was Spanish, and she grew up in a multi-immigration-status family.
She said she hopes she can bring her career experience and lifelong perspective to the board. The goal is to become a “sounding board” for families in the diverse, multilingual school district.
“With how things are going nationally and within the state, it’s really important to me that our students find safety in our district and safety in their city and especially in their schools,” Martinez said. “And so with everything happening, I just want to make sure that there’s also an advocate that’s on the board that’s able to not only understand the experience of these students, but (is) making sure that parents feel like they can come to public schools in OKC and if they need help, be able to ask for that help, or if they need resources, be able to access those resources.”

Laura Kelly says the loss in federal funding from health care changes in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will cost Kansas at least $150 million. (Photo by Grace Hills for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is expected to cost Kansas at least $150 million as provisions cutting health care programs go into effect, Gov. Laura Kelly said in an interview with Kansas Reflector.
She said state agencies are studying implications of the law, and while guidance from the federal government has been unclear or incomplete, it’s clear the state budget will feel a bite when tens of millions of federal dollars are lost.
“And that’s if we don’t choose to cover some of the folks who will be knocked off of programs or hospitals that need support,” Kelly said.
“The reality is we don’t have that kind of money. No state has the money to backfill these programs that were designed to be federally supported,” she added.
Kelly was referring to cuts included in the federal law to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Medicaid, and expiring premium subsidies for people who buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. The federal government funds about 60% of Medicaid, she said.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects the act’s cuts to Medicaid alone will increase the number of uninsured people in the country by 7.8 million by 2034.
The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates Medicaid changes in the act and expiration of ACA enhanced tax credits will increase Kansas’ uninsured population by about 63,000 people by 2034.
As changes to social programs are instituted over the next three years, Kelly is worried about Kansas hospitals.
More than half of rural hospitals in the state are at risk of closing, and a United Methodist Health Ministry Fund report said Kansas would experience a 15% reduction in total rural Medicaid hospital reimbursement under the law. In addition, 5,000 rural Kansans enrolled in Medicaid are expected to lose coverage.
Freeman Health System, which had considered opening a hospital in southeast Kansas, said in a news release in October that the “unpredictable impact” of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and other changes in rural health care were factors in its decision to cancel the project.
The upcoming shifts will “throw a number of our hospitals over the edge,” Kelly said.
Retirement homes also will see financial effects, she said. Many are dependent on Medicaid payments and federal changes will negatively affect them, Kelly said. According to LeadingAge, more than 50% of nursing home residents in Kansas receive Medicaid.
 
Ripple effects
It is difficult to assess the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s full impact because it is unknown how the changes will play out. For instance, Robert Stiles, CEO of the Community Care Network of Kansas, said those on Medicaid will have to reapply twice a year instead of once a year.
Overnight, the state will manage twice as many Medicaid verifications, he said. It’s one item in a long list that will at a minimum cause behind-the-scene challenges.
Kelly said the long-term effects also include higher levels of hunger and lack of insurance access. Hungry children don’t learn as well and their brain development is affected, she said.
The Navigator Program, which helps people work through the challenges of applying for Medicaid, the ACA and other social service programs, was cut 90%.
“I can remember sitting in public health committee as a senator, and we worked very hard to get that funding in there for navigators,” Kelly said, referring to the launch of ACA.
Kelly represented a Topeka district for 14 years in the Kansas Senate before she was elected governor.
“I do understand the Stephen Millers of the world — they think differently,” Kelly said. “But I don’t understand why Congress is sitting back and letting all of this happen. It’s their bailiwick. This is what they’re supposed to be doing, and why they are allowing all of this to happen while they sit on their hands, I don’t know. I just don’t know if they’ve thought about the ripple effects.”
Miller, the U.S. Homeland Security adviser, is credited with shaping the Trump administration’s immigration policies.
 
Medicaid and ACA changes
The governor’s office offered a three-page assessment of Medicaid and other social service effects of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, including:

A provision requires Kansas to lower payments it uses to enhance Medicaid payments for specific providers, which could result in revenue loss for those providers. State Directed Payments, or SDPs, are payments from Medicaid managed care plans that the state can direct to support specific providers. Kansas has been using these payments to increase dollars for academic medical centers, Children’s Mercy Hospital and inpatient/outpatient hospitals, according to the Kansas Health Institute. The federal bill directs SDPs to be lowered by 10% each year starting in 2028 until it is at 110% of Medicare. “With SDP rates in Kansas projected to exceed 200% of Medicare by 2028, hospitals are expected to see a decline in SDP-related revenue as phased reductions take effect. By 2038, these payments must be fully phased down which may require Kansas to find alternative funding sources or adjust Medicaid payment strategies,” KHI said.
Currently, Medicaid is required to pay for expenses incurred for 90 days before a person was found eligible for the program. The federal law drops it to 60 days, which means the patient or the medical institution will have to cover expenses before that time period.
Participants in the ACA marketplace won’t be automatically reenrolled each year, even if no information has changed.

Cindy Samuelson, spokeswoman for the Kansas Hospital Association, echoed Kelly’s concerns, pointing to a KHA study about commercial payers that found hospitals are losing money on patient services.
The study showed most Kansas hospitals are losing money on patient services. In fiscal year 2022, the median operating margin for Kansas hospitals was -12.7%, with most hospitals losing money on patient services. Kansas had the lowest median operating margin compared to Nebraska and Oklahoma, the study found.
Samuelson said the federal changes to state directed payments, which start in 2028, will mean hospitals get paid less for Medicaid services than they are now. As costs rise every year, that will be a significant cut.
“We’re going to keep working and advocating and trying to tell the story, but I think we have to be prepared,” she said. “We have to know that we’re going to have to look at long-term stability of the program and how we’re going to support people that have Medicaid.”
 
Economic effects
Kelly said it’s unclear how far the economic reverberations of these changes will spread, much like it was difficult to predict how trade policies and shutting down the U.S. Agency for International Development programs would affect Kansas farmers. 
A study by Manatt Health projected that Kansas hospitals will lose $1.6 billion over 10 years from lost Medicaid funding, which would affect the Kansas communities, especially if hospitals were to close.
“It’ll be really impactful,” Kelly said. “And I don’t know how subtle it will be, whether it will come sort of like the tariffs, or whether it’ll be a slow death to parts of our economy.
“When kids don’t get food at home — I mean, we already are trying to feed them at schools and it’s going to be even worse. What is that going to do, then, ultimately, to our workforce, when you have kids who are not eating, therefore not learning, therefore dropping out? The impact is huge.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Kelly-13-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-04 15:59:06.616715
,DC,2025-12-04 20:03:13+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Signalgate report says Hegseth created a risk to national security with cellphone messages,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/signalgate-report-says-hegseth-created-risk-national-security-cellphone-messages,,"WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth violated official policy when he used the publicly available Signal app to message about military plans from his personal cell phone, including imminent bombings in Yemen, according to a report released Thursday by the Pentagon’s own watchdog. The Defense Department Inspector General’s 84-page report concluded Hegseth sent information about the “strike times of manned U.S. aircraft over hostile territory over an unapproved, unsecure network approximately 2 to 4 hours before the execution of those strikes.” “Although the Secretary wrote in his July 25 statement to the DoD OIG that ‘there were no details that would endanger our troops or the mission,’ if this information had fallen into the hands of U.S. adversaries, Houthi forces might have been able to counter U.S. forces or reposition personnel and assets to avoid planned U.S. strikes,” the report states. “Even though these events did not ultimately occur, the Secretary’s actions created a risk to operational security that could have resulted in failed U.S. mission objectives and potential harm to U.S. pilots.”Members of Congress from both political parties requested the Defense Department Inspector General look into Hegseth’s use of Signal after a journalist at The Atlantic was inadvertently added to a group chat of national security officials planning the bombing in Yemen. Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg later published a series of stories detailing the messages. Acting Defense Department Inspector General Steven A. Stebbins released a memo in April announcing he had opened an investigation into the matter. GOP wants more Pentagon tech, Dems want Hegseth goneMembers of Congress' reaction to the report was mixed, with Republicans suggesting more technology is needed for the Pentagon, while Democrats called for Hegseth to resign. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., issued a statement saying the report shows Hegseth “acted within his authority to communicate the information in question to other cabinet level officials.” “It is also clear to me that our senior leaders need more tools available to them to communicate classified information in real time and a variety of environments,” Wicker added. “I think we have some work to do in providing those tools to our national security leaders.”Senate Armed Services Committee ranking member Jack Reed, D-R.I., said in a statement the report confirms “that Secretary Hegseth violated military regulations and continues to show reckless disregard for the safety of American servicemembers.”“For months, Secretary Hegseth has attempted to mislead Congress and the American people, claiming repeatedly that no classified information was involved,” Reed said. “The Inspector General has now definitively cast doubt on those false assurances.”Reed added that Hegseth should “explain himself to Congress, the public, and the servicemembers he leads. The men and women of our armed forces deserve leadership they can trust with their lives.”Hegseth refuses to give cell phone to investigatorsThe Inspector General report said Hegseth declined to sit for an interview with the Defense Department’s oversight agency, that he refused to hand over his personal cell phone to investigators and that he didn’t retain some of the messages in accordance with federal recordkeeping requirements. Officials working for Hegseth shared copies of the Signal chat with the inspector general, but those were incomplete since the app’s auto-delete feature was on at the time. Signal users can adjust that for different lengths of time or turn it off completely.Hegseth was in the Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF, in his home the morning and early afternoon of March 15 to monitor “the operation against the Houthis,” according to the report. Two aides who were with Hegseth at the time told investigators he used “secure, classified” systems to communicate with United States Central Command officials “during the planning and execution of the strikes against Houthi targets that day and reviewed information related to the strikes.” “In the SCIF, the Secretary had access to multiple means of secure communication that allowed him to provide the necessary operational details and updates to non-DoD government officials on the Signal group chat,” the report states. The group chat about the Yemen bombing that accidentally included a journalist wasn’t the only one Hegseth used to communicate about official Pentagon business from his personal phone. Eight officials within the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Office of the Chief Information Officer told investigators that Hegseth created “multiple Signal group chats in which the Secretary and others allegedly discussed official DoD business and nonpublic information.” “One of the officials we spoke with stated that the Secretary posted the same sensitive operational information concerning the Houthi attack plans on the ‘Defense Team Huddle’ group chat,” the report states, later adding Hegseth declined to provide any information about that chat. The Inspector General opted not to make any recommendations about the use of Signal in the report, since “records management issues arising from the use of Signal and other commercially available messaging applications are a DoD-wide issue.”A previous inspector general report also called on the department to “improve training for DoD senior officials on compliance with records retention laws and policies.”Alabama's Rogers says mission not compromisedHouse Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Ala., wrote in a statement that it is ""important to remember that this was a successful operation that took out a dangerous target with no harm to U.S. troops. It’s clear that the discussion on Signal didn’t compromise the mission.""""During the past few administrations, the use of Signal for communication between government officials has grown, so I appreciate the comprehensive work by the IG to develop recommendations on how to improve and secure communications,"" Rogers said. ""I encourage the Administration to follow these recommendations, and I look forward to discussions with the Pentagon on how to implement them.""House Armed Services Committee ranking member Adam Smith, D-Wash., called the report ""a damning review of an incompetent secretary of defense who is profoundly incapable of the job and clearly has no respect for or comprehension of what is required to safeguard our service members.""""It confirms staggering violations of policy - namely that unsecured platforms were used by the secretary to boast about sensitive operational details that could have jeopardized both the mission and, more importantly, the lives of American service members tasked with carrying out Operation Rough Rider,"" Smith said.'A fireable offense for anyone else in the Department of Defense'Senate Defense Appropriations subcommittee ranking member Chris Coons, D-Del., said in a statement the report ""concluded that Secretary Hegseth violated DOD procedure and put service members’ lives at risk with his reckless mishandling of sensitive information."" ""In March, I led a group of senators in pressing the Trump administration to investigate this blatant misconduct. Any service member who acted with such disregard for our national security would be dismissed, at the very least,"" Coons said. ""Our nation’s highest ranking defense official should not be held to a lower standard than the men and women he oversees. For the good of our nation, I once again call on Secretary Hegseth to resign.”House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence ranking member Jim Himes, D-Conn., said in a statement the report “confirms what I feared when this Signal thread became public: We are fortunate that the mission was not compromised and that servicemembers were not put at needless risk thanks to Secretary Hegseth’s reckless treatment of classified information.”“Pete Hegseth’s behavior and lack of judgment would be a fireable offense for anyone else in the Department of Defense,” Himes said. “What’s more, his refusal to sit for an interview with the Inspector General or submit his device for examination is yet another example of his failure to take responsibility for his actions.”",,,,2025-12-04 15:59:06.616715

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Mounting questions over Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s handling of classified information and his role in ordering a lethal strike on alleged Venezuelan drug-running boats in the Caribbean have prompted a renewed push this week for his removal — a demand led by U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., who says the latest revelations show Hegseth put U.S. pilots and service members at risk.
Warner, the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said findings released by the Pentagon’s inspector general Thursday show Hegseth shared classified targeting information about planned military actions in a Signal group chat that included at least one journalist. 
Combined with the administration’s shifting account of a Sept. 2 strike, Warner said the pattern points to what he called dangerous and chaotic judgment at the top of the Defense Department.
“His actions potentially put pilots in harm’s way,” Warner told The Mercury on Thursday, a day after publicly stating that Hegseth “endangered the lives” of air crews aboard the USS Harry S. Truman. “Don’t believe me, believe the inspector general,” Warner said.

The inspector general’s report concluded that Hegseth violated Defense Department policies by sharing operational information about U.S. strikes in Yemen using his personal phone and in a chat that included his family members and a civilian journalist. 
The investigators found Hegseth “failed to protect classified operational details” and created “unnecessary risk” to U.S. forces.
Warner said the latest findings matched concerns long expressed by families in Hampton Roads. 
“I heard from families in Norfolk who were, frankly, pissed off that their sons and daughters could have been put in harm’s way,” he said. He added that he plans to return to the region to hear directly from sailors.
 Caribbean strike under congressional investigation

The report arrived as Congress intensifies its probe into the Sept. 2 strike on two boats the administration said were suspected of ferrying drugs from Venezuela. 
The mission killed 12 people and has faced scrutiny over a second strike carried out against individuals already in the water — a scenario that could violate international law if they were no longer considered combatants.
U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told CBS News’ “Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan” on Sunday the follow-on strike could rise “to the level of a war crime if it’s true.”
Warner emphasized Thursday that Hegseth’s conflicting statements deepen the concern.
“At first he pumped his chest and said it was great that he watched this whole bombing incident take place on Sept. 2, where 12 people were on the boat,” Warner said. 
“He came out subsequently that while he offered an order to kill them all — we don’t know was that verbal, was it written — that changed and (he) said no second strike, then changed his position, and said there was a second strike, but it was ordered by Admiral Bradley, who I will be meeting with today to try to get to the bottom of it,” Warner said, referring to Admiral Frank Bradley, the commander of the United States Special Operations Command.
Warner added that the confusion has put U.S. personnel “in potential legal jeopardy” under international standards. 
Hegseth has publicly rejected reports that the Sept. 2 operation was mishandled, calling a Washington Post account of the second strike “fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory,” in a post on X.
“As we’ve said from the beginning, and in every statement, these highly effective strikes are specifically intended to be ‘lethal, kinetic strikes.’ The declared intent is to stop lethal drugs, destroy narco-boats, and kill the narco-terrorists who are poisoning the American people,” he wrote.
Hegseth has similarly downplayed the significance of his Signal messages, insisting in one exchange that “nobody was texting war plans and that’s all I have to say about that,” and later mocking descriptions of the chat by noting it included “no names” and “no targets” and calling them “some really shi— war plans.”
Warner said Thursday that the presidential administration’s evolving account on the Sept. 2 strikes has only made the situation worse.
“We have seen two or three different answers from the president,” he said. “It is again symptomatic of this administration’s national security, which is chaotic, at best, and downright making Americans less safe across the board.”
The senator added that the administration could have quelled most of the controversy by releasing the full, unedited strike video from the start. 
 IG findings on Signal chats intensify concerns

The inspector general’s report on Hegseth’s Signal use, Warner added, fits into what he views as a broader pattern of politicization and carelessness with sensitive information across the Defense Department.
“We were striking against the Houthis in Yemen, and Secretary Hegseth gave out all of this information on an unsecure line, using his private phone that included not only security officials, but family members,” he said. 
“This was clearly classified information, and while the Secretary of Defense has the ability to declassify information, he made no indication, at that time, or even afterwards, that he went through any kind of declassification process.”
He compared Hegseth’s handling of classified material to President Donald Trump’s argument that he could declassify documents “by thinking about it.” 
 Warner presses Republicans to join public oversight push

Asked Thursday what concrete steps Congress and the administration should take to prevent similar breaches, Warner pointed directly to oversight — and to Republican colleagues he says have expressed worries privately but not publicly.
“It would start with congressional oversight,” he told The Mercury. “I have begged my Republican friends, ‘Hey, we have got to push back on this.’ So far, they’ve been privately concerned, but not willing to go public.”
He said he is encouraged that the Senate Armed Services Committee at least plans to fully investigate the Caribbean strike. 
“We need to get to the bottom of all of this malfeasance, and the sooner the better,” he said. Until then, he added, “I can’t guarantee those families that their loved ones are as safe as they should be.”
Warner said the stakes are especially significant for Virginia, home to the world’s largest naval base and thousands of sailors whose deployments hinge on the decisions of senior Pentagon leadership.
“Our sailors deserve a clear explanation,” he said, particularly on whether the Sept. 2 mission targeted narco-traffickers or something less clear-cut. 
“Are they drug boats, are there narco traffickers on those boats? If there are, why don’t you interdict them and show the world rather than simply blowing them up — to make sure the sailors are not doing something that’s inappropriate?”

Looney, D-New Haven, a lawmaker for 45 years and the top Senate leader for a decade, filed papers Wednesday that make him a candidate for reelection at age 77.
It most likely will not be clear until the approach of the nominating conventions in spring whether the filing represents a definitive commitment to another term or an effort to postpone a free-for-all for an open race in a district dominated by Democrats.
Looney, one of the two longest-serving members of the General Assembly, has no worries about support from the city’s Democratic Town Committee.
“Marty Looney is and has always been the fiercest advocate for his district and the progressive policies he has championed. The New Haven DTC stands by him,” the committee’s chair, Vincent Mauro Jr., said in a text.  
Looney could not reached for comment, but he told the New Haven Independent’s Paul Bass last month that a filing was imminent: “At this point, I’m going to open my campaign committee next week, as I usually do.”
Looney was elected to the House of Representatives in 1980 and to the Senate in 1992. His 11th Senate District includes portions of New Haven and Hamden. He was elected as president pro tem in January 2015.
He underwent a successful kidney transplant in December 2016.
His predecessor as president pro tem, Donald E. Williams Jr. of Brooklyn, assumed the post in July 2004 after the resignation of Gov. John G. Rowland triggered constitutionally mandated successions: Lt. Gov. M. Jodi Rell as governor and Senate President Pro Tem Kevin B. Sullivan as lieutenant governor.
Williams surprised his caucus in February 2014 by announcing he would not seek reelection that fall.
Looney was majority leader during Williams’ tenure as president pro tem. Sen Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, has been majority leader for the entirety of Looney’s time as president pro tem.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, recently filed for reelection and confirmed he also will be seeking an unprecedented fourth term as speaker in January 2027.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_6839-2-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-04 14:57:58.086039

The office also includes the Billings Office of the Custer-Gallatin National Forest (Photo by Darrell Ehrlick of the Daily Montana)Conservation groups in Montana and across the West are raising concerns about Steve Pearce, a former New Mexico representative who is President Donald Trump’s newest nominee to lead the Bureau of Land Management. 
The nomination has reignited a fight over the management of public lands which was highlighted during negotiations over Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” due to proposed amendments to sell off federal land. The fight also spawned two new bipartisan caucuses in Congress, both co-chaired by Montanans, and predicated on public land access and management. 
In Montana the two Dakotas, the BLM manages more than 8.3 million acres of federal land. Nationwide, the BLM oversees 245 million acres of federal land, along with 700 million acres of subsurface rights for extraction and energy development, putting the position directly in the crosshairs of energy developers and outdoor industry groups. 
According to the Center for Western Priorities, Pearce amassed a “lengthy anti-public lands record,” sponsoring bills to shrink national monuments and increase extraction on national forest land. 
Many conservation groups are specifically honing in on Pearce’s long record of advocating to sell off federal lands, including sponsoring legislation in Congress to authorize land sales or exchanges with local governments. 
In a letter to then-House Speaker John Boehner in 2012, Pearce wrote that of the federal lands located in the West, “most of it we do not even need.”
He proposed using land sales to reduce the deficit, similar to rhetoric heard earlier when Interior Secretary Doug Burgum equated federal lands to the nation’s “balance sheet.”
“We cannot afford to hand the keys to 245 million acres of our public lands over to someone who has spent his career trying to auction them off to the highest bidder,” Aubrey Bertram, staff attorney and federal policy director at Wild Montana, said. “Steve Pearce’s record is crystal clear: he believes public lands should be privatized for billionaires’ benefit, not protected for the people’s.”
But Pearce’s nomination has been greeted with enthusiasm by mining and energy companies that operate on federal land, as well as by many Republican officials, including Montana Sen. Steve Daines.
“I knew Steve in the House days, and Steve is a great pick. And I particularly like the fact that it’s a Westerner,” Daines said in an interview. “I think it’s helpful when we have leaders in those important positions that come from the West, when they understand uniquely the challenges we face as it relates to federal land, state land, private land. And Steve Pearce has lived it and breathed it.”
Daines is a member of the newly formed Senate Stewardship Caucus, which is co-chaired by Montana Sen. Tim Sheehy. 
The two Montanans also bucked their party earlier this year by joining Senate Democrats in a resolution that would have prevented the use of public land sales to reduce the deficit. 
Representatives for Daines and Sheehy did not respond to questions about Pearce’s nomination. 
Sheehy has not publicly stated whether he will support Pearce. 
But Montana’s federal delegation has been supportive of increasing coal and energy extraction in the state. 
In eastern Montana, Congress recently voted to overturn a Biden-era restriction on resource extraction on federal land, reopening nearly 1.7 million acres to future coal leasing.  
All members of the state’s delegation supported the move calling it vital to the state’s economy and the nation’s energy security.
Pearce has roots in the oil and gas industry that stretch beyond his political work. 
In the 1980s, Pearce founded an oilfield services company in New Mexico, which he later sold when he won his first election. 
Starting in 2003, he represented New Mexico in Congress for seven terms.
He lost races for the U.S. Senate in 2008 and governor in 2018. 
While conservation and public land advocates have pushed back against Pearce’s nomination, industry groups have applauded Trump’s pick. 
The National Cattleman’s Beef Association said Pearce’s experience makes him “thoroughly qualified to lead the BLM and tackle the issues federal lands ranchers are facing.”
The Western Energy Alliance, comprising oil and gas companies across nine western states, also put out a statement of support for Pearce. 
“As a westerner coming from a state that’s nearly 20 percent BLM land, he understands the bureau’s mission. As a former congressman and chair of the Congressional Western Caucus, his record shows he’s been a champion of multiple-uses of public lands. Steve has been a longtime friend who understands the value of energy development among other uses,” the Alliance said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/BLM-office-I-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-04 14:57:58.086039

The Missouri Senate Education Committee convened a hearing Thursday morning to question Missouri Commissioner of Education Karla Eslinge about the department’s efforts to support underperforming schools after a release of annual performance data last month.
District accreditation hasn’t been impacted by annual performance scores since the department’s switch to the Missouri School Improvement Program 6 in 2022. Education officials are waiting until next year to change classification based on the scores, based on internal policies, though state law would allow them to make accreditation decisions this year.
“If we said we would like you to be able to change classification and not have to wait,” Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin asked Missouri Commissioner of Education Karla Eslinger during a public hearing Thursday. “Would you support that?”
Eslinger warned against “changing the rules midstream,” arguing that school administrators would be frustrated at a sudden change of plans. The department has begun working with struggling schools, she said, with state staff and groups of community leaders brainstorming solutions to chronic underperformance.
“I am not waiting for a classification or an annual performance report score, or whatever it is, to keep me from going and getting into schools that are struggling,” Eslinger said.
State Sen. Rick Brattin, a Republican from Harrisonville and chairman of the committee, said he was worried that performance scores painted a rosy picture of districts with low proficiency rates.
“This everyone-gets-a-trophy mentality and approach to education is detrimental,” he said. “If we’re not holding people who are failing accountable, then what are we doing here? Why are we investing billions and billions of dollars?”
The state has been transitioning from an older version of its accountability model to a new one, the Missouri School Improvement Program 6. The update has been described as “more rigorous,” with schools scoring significantly lower than they did under previous iterations.
This change is bringing more accountability, Eslinger said. Currently, 9% of school districts and charter schools are scoring below the full accreditation range.
“I don’t remember a time when there were that many school districts that would have been provisionally accredited, but that doesn’t mean that it’s not necessary,” Eslinger told the committee. “We do believe that we have to hold our schools accountable and make sure that our kids are performing at the level we want them to be.”
Missouri schools show improvement in annual performance reports

Accreditation decisions are scheduled for next year, but senators questioned if the change could happen as soon as January. If classifications were lowered, it would impact five school districts: Hayti R-II, Hickman Mills C-1 in Kansas City , Normandy Schools Collaborative, Osborn R-0 and Riverview Gardens in St. Louis.
St. Louis Public Schools, which drew the attention of some of the committee members, scored in the fully accredited range.
Despite the district’s scores on annual performance reviews, GOP lawmakers still believe it is falling short.
“My biggest concern is St Louis,” O’Laughlin said. “It’s totally a train wreck. I don’t think you could describe it any other way.”
Eslinger told the committee the state has “ongoing communication” with the district and is speaking with St. Louis leaders about the district’s struggles in a group called “transforming schools.”
The district has recently switched to a phonics-based reading assessment program recommended by the state. The assessment is the result of a bill championed by O’Laughlin and Eslinger, during her time as a state senator.
Eslinger, in her recommendations to the committee, said she would like to see a bill that would require districts to adopt the assessment. The current law leaves the assessment open-ended, with the option to use other tests based on the science of reading.
She also asked for a bill that would help centralize the department’s data collection.
Eslinger has touted coming changes to the way the department presents data, aiming for more clarity and accessibility on the department’s website.
The hearing ended without action from the committee. The State Board of Education is scheduled to meet Tuesday and will look at the annual performance reports.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_2463-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-04 14:57:58.086039

Dec. 3, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceThe Michigan Senate version of a bipartisan effort to increase the clearance rate of unsolved violent crimes was before a panel in the upper chamber on Wednesday, but the language of the bill has some senators on the fence.
Members of the Senate Civil Rights, Judiciary and Public Safety Committee took testimony only on Senate Bill 613, sponsored by state Sen. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit), the committee’s chairperson. The bill has a Michigan House counterpart in House Bill 5097, sponsored by state Rep. Sarah Lightner (R-Springport), who chairs the House Judiciary Committee.
The bills were introduced in October. The effort followed an op-ed that Chang and Lightner co-authored in The Detroit News, which outlined their goal to reduce violent crime clearance rates, or rather the rate by which law enforcement agencies make arrests and solve violent crimes compared to the total number of instances reported.
Chang on Wednesday called the bills commonsense measures with practical investments toward safer communities, helping law enforcement agencies get targeted resources to solve violent crimes.
“When violent crimes go unsolved, the result may be more violence, and we know that that deterrence, one of the main goals of our justice system, works best not necessarily because of longer, more severe sentences, but actually instead, when punishment is certain, swift and fair,” Chang said. “In other words, if we solve more crimes and increase the feeling that a crime will be solved and the person will be caught, we might deter more crime from happening in the first place.”
Chang added that increasing clearance rates has shown, over decades of evidence, to be one of the most cost-effective ways of reducing violent crime.
“If would-be shooters think that the police won’t catch them, they’re more likely to pull the trigger no matter how severe potential punishment is,” she said. “So the Michigan violent crime clearance improvement grant program would provide resources in the form of grants directly to local law enforcement agencies to help them strengthen investigative capacity.”
Law enforcement agencies could use the funds to hire or retain more detectives, acquire and upgrade evidence processing technology, hire additional crime analysts and support witnesses to improve cooperation. There are also accountability measures baked into the legislation, Chang said, to ensure the resources are being used to catch violent offenders.
Off the bat, state Sen. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor) had questions about language that would allow the Michigan Department of State Police to take 15% of funding they might receive off the top for administrative costs. Irwin said that seemed higher than normal for a program like the one Chang and Lightner were crafting in their respective chambers.
Irwin also posited that the state and local governments have been investing “billions and billions more over the recent decade in law enforcement,” but clearance rates haven’t been going up, they’ve been going down.
“Why would we suppose that even more investment into the same approach that we’ve been using, and failing with, is going to somehow produce the opposite result of producing for the last decade?” Irwin asked.

To the first question, Chang said the 15% administrative cost figure was baked into other grant programs she’s worked on, and that stakeholders she’s worked with on the bills didn’t propose reducing that number. She was still open to suggestions.
To Irwin’s point about past investments not having an effect on clearance rates, Chang said she sponsored the legislation because she also wants to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely, especially on crime prevention, and that the bill was different from past efforts in that it is targeted to hiring and expansion of technology – the things law enforcement needs to solve these types of crimes.
Testifying in favor of the bill was Helen Weston, an advocacy and research associate for criminal justice with the Niskanen Center, a nonpartisan think tank based in Washington, D.C.
Weston said police departments in rural and urban areas alike face numerous challenges, including the ability to invest in their ability to fight and deter these kinds of violent crimes.
“We must ensure that the resources available to the law were actually important, and the urgency of their work,” Weston said.

Irwin was still concerned about the money and investing in technology that has had mixed results or have been discredited as methods of investigation.
The bills have support from the Michigan Fraternal Order of Police, Our Street Institute, and Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard.
Opposing the bill was the Michigan Sheriffs Association.
The committee did not report the bill out to the Senate floor, signaling a chance for further testimony.
Committee reports post-prison reentry services, support bill for resentenced inmates
The committee on Wednesday also reported Senate Bill 592, sponsored by state Sen. Sylvia Santana (D-Detroit), which would provide specific reentry services and vital documents for inmates who are being discharged from Michigan prisons due to be being resentenced after serving time on mandatory life sentences without parole – sentences handed out when they were juvenile offenders. 
Recent Michigan Supreme Court precedent has whittled away mandatory life without parole sentences for juvenile offenders, and has ordered courts to reconsider some of those cases in light of the offenders’ age when the crimes were committed.
The high court has been steadily moving up the age by which a person’s youthful state of mind could be considered as a significant factor in an offender’s decision making, giving those cases a chance to be resentenced away from the mandatory life punishment without a chance of future release.
Part of the bill allows for reentry housing and access to vital documents, like birth certificates and other identification documents, which can be hard to acquire when an inmate is released, depending on their circumstances. Access to those documents also allows for a smoother transition into housing and potential work – which are vital to a returning citizen’s success after serving a prison sentence.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PC036352-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-04 14:57:58.086039

(File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Maryland House of Delegates Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County), the first woman and the first Black legislator to hold the post, is stepping down after more than six years in the job.
Multiple sources confirmed that she had decided to retire before the 2026 legislative session. The announcement came as Jones called a meeting Thursday with leaders of the House’s standing committees.
For the better part of the month, Jones, 71, has been quietly absent. She did not attend a fundraiser for the House Democratic Caucus last month and sharply curtailed her schedule during that same time as  behind-the-scenes jockeying to succeed her circulated Annapolis.
Neither Jones nor her staff responded to multiple requests for comment.
Her decision caps a difficult year for the speaker that included the sudden death of her son Brandon in February.
She surprised many when she filed for re-election in June.
Jones, a lawmaker with a nearly 30-year career, ascended to the rostrum as a compromise candidate following the death of her predecessor Speaker Michael E. Busch (D-Anne Arundel).
Jones served 17 years as speaker pro tem under Busch and also served during that time as chair of the House Appropriations capital budget subcommittee.
Despite the pair of powerful posts, Jones was known as a quiet leader — a quality she brought to her time as speaker. In that role, Jones was known for a decentralized approach to guiding the chamber, allowing her committee chairs wider authority.
In some ways, Jones’ career was marked by being in the right place at the right time.
Jones worked in Baltimore County overseeing the county’s office of fair practices. She was not politically active at the time, but found herself vying to succeed Del. Joan Neverdon Parker, who died in 1997. Jones was backed by her boss, County Executive Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Baltimore County) and his political machine.
She took Parker’s seat on the House Appropriations Committee and became friends with Del. Maggie McIntosh, who later went on to chair the committee. The late Appropriations Chair Del. Howard “Pete” Rawlings (D-Baltimore City) became something of a mentor to her during that time.
She continued her quiet climb up the leadership ladder when Busch became speaker.
Busch’s death at the end of the 2019 session touched off a scramble to replace him.
Jones initially entered the fray but quickly put her support behind Del. Dereck Davis (D-Prince George’s), then chair of the House Economic Matters Committee. Davis however could not secure enough Democrats within his caucus. 
The Democratic Caucus sought a compromise candidate and they found one in Jones, who was later elected unanimously by the full House in a special session that lasted less than 15 minutes.
Jones has championed a number of social justice issues including increased funding for historically underfunded Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the state. She also threw her support behind ensuring equity licenses in the state’s newly opened recreational cannabis and sports gaming industries.
And she successfully backed efforts to enshrine the right to an abortion in the Maryland Constitution — a legislative effort backed by Busch before her.
In her first year as Speaker, Jones led the chamber in session truncated by COVID-19. It was a pandemic that would mark a large portion of her time as presiding officer.
Her departure touches off a new scramble to fill the void at the rostrum
Early candidates include House Appropriations Chair Ben Barnes and House Health and Government Operations Chair Joseline Pena-Melnyk, both Democrats who represent the same district that spans Anne Arundel and Prince George’s Counties.
Also on the list are House Economic Matters Chair Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles) and Del. Jheanelle Wilkins. (D-Montgomery) vice chair of the House Ways and Means Committee and chair of the Legislative Black Caucus.
Del. Vanessa Atterbeary (D-Howard), who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee, had been considered a contender for the position, but announced earlier this year that she would not seek reelection to the House but instead would run for Howard County Executive. It is not clear if Jones’ sudden departure will change her plans.

While billionaire wealth surged dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic, it did not nearly triple in a single year. 
Data from March 2020 to early 2021 show that the combined wealth of the world’s more than 2,500 billionaires rose from approximately $8 trillion to over $13 trillion, an increase of roughly 68%. This was due in part to a strong stock market, returns of profits to shareholders and, in the case of billionaires like Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, a shift to online shopping during the pandemic.
Meanwhile, the pandemic disproportionately affected ordinary people, pushing over 150 million more people into poverty, causing massive job losses and reducing women’s earnings by $800 billion in 2020. 
Advocates and organizations like Oxfam have highlighted this disparity, calling for wealth taxes on pandemic-era gains to fund vaccinations, social protections and economic recovery, underscoring the extreme inequality exacerbated during the crisis.

But the government made minimal mention of Native American tribes in sparsely populated areas and in need of significant improvements to health care access.
Federally recognized tribes can’t directly apply for a share of the rural health fund — only states can. And states aren’t required to consider tribes’ needs. But state applications for the five-year payout show some states with significant Native American populations did so anyway.
Workforce development, technology upgrades, and traditional healing are a few of the initiatives specifically aimed at Native American communities that some states included in their applications, which were due to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services on Nov. 5. The fund was a late addition to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in response to worries about the harm the spending reductions in Republicans’ bill would have on rural hospitals’ finances.
Some states, including Idaho, Nevada, and Oregon, are also considering setting aside 3% to 10% of their federal payouts to distribute among tribes. Washington proposed setting aside $20 million per year.
Federally recognized tribes have direct relationships with the U.S. government, but state governments also allocate resources to tribes and can create policies that support tribal priorities. States and tribes share concerns about the effect that the massive GOP budget bill, which President Donald Trump signed into law in July, will have on the U.S. health system. The law is expected to reduce federal Medicaid spending by nearly $1 trillion and increase the number of uninsured by approximately 10 million people, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
Catherine Howden, a CMS spokesperson, said that states are required to develop their applications in collaboration with key stakeholders, including the state governments’ tribal affairs offices or tribal liaisons, as well as “Indian health care providers, as applicable.” But these entities do not include tribal governments or official tribal representatives.
Tribes can apply for Rural Health Transformation Fund subgrants through their states. But during a recent call with federal health officials, tribal leaders expressed frustration about being regarded as just another stakeholder in the issue rather than sovereign nations. Tribal sovereignty guides most government-to-government consultations over proposed federal actions that would have a substantial effect on tribes.
“Even in a scenario where tribal consultation is required, the quality and quantity of that tribal consultation on a state-by-state basis is all over the place,” said Liz Malerba, director of policy and legislative affairs for the United South and Eastern Tribes Sovereignty Protection Fund, which advocates for tribal nations from Texas to Maine. Malerba is a citizen of the Mohegan Tribe.
Federal policy works better when tribal nations are directly eligible for funding that supports essential services in their communities, Malerba said, adding that tribal leaders are concerned that the reach of the program into their communities will vary considerably.
There are 574 federally recognized tribes and more than 7 million Native American and Alaska Native people in the U.S. The population faces a lower life expectancy and among the poorest health outcomes when compared with other demographics. The Indian Health Service, the federal agency responsible for providing health care to Native Americans and Alaska Natives, has been historically underfunded by Congress.
KFF Health News analyzed how 12 states with significant Native American populations took tribes into account as they developed plans for the pot of federal money.
Idaho, Washington, Montana, and Arizona were among the states that held tribal consultations or listening sessions ahead of the Nov. 5 application deadline.
In states that did not initiate input from tribes, some Native American leaders made sure their voices were heard in other public hearings. Jerilyn Church, CEO of the Great Plains Tribal Leaders’ Health Board, said she attended an October public meeting in South Dakota because she felt it was important for state leaders to consider how they could use the program’s resources on reservations. There are nine federally recognized tribes in the state, and Native American people make up 9% of the population.
“I felt like we needed to help be that advocate,” said Church, a citizen of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe.
In the proposed initiatives included in its rural fund application, South Dakota identified tribal community needs such as improved telehealth and funding for doula programs. It also said the state will continue meeting with the Great Plains tribal health board throughout the five-year funding cycle.
In Oklahoma — where more than 14% of the population is Native American, a higher share than in most other states — tribal representatives were invited to weigh in with the rest of the public when the state was gathering information for its application, the details of which have not been publicly released.
“We’ve welcomed input from any Oklahoman,” said state health department spokesperson Erica Rankin-Riley.
North Dakota identified tribes in its state as partners in the Rural Health Transformation Program and included initiatives such as expanding physician residency slots with tribal-specific rotations and opportunities for farm-to-table food distributions. But lawmakers there declined to support a proposal that would have pledged 5% of its federal allotment to tribes. There are five federally recognized tribes in the state, and Native Americans make up nearly 5% of the population.
Some states did include proposals to fund high-priority initiatives for tribes.
Washington’s application for the rural fund included an initiative focused on improving health among Native American communities. Its goals include investing in workforce development for tribes, better care coordination between tribes and rural hospitals, and $2.4 million annually to support Washington State University’s rural health education programs, including its Indigenous health program.
Alaska’s proposal included integrating Indigenous traditional healing in Alaska Native village clinics. It would include offering traditional-healing house calls, hands-on training for healers, and traditional-medicine training for health care providers and staff, according to the application.
One of Oregon’s five initiatives would support the state’s nine federally recognized tribes in improving health outcomes. The state estimates the initiative would require $20 million per year, or 10% of the Rural Health Transformation Program award.
Whether or not states identified funding for tribes or included tribal priorities in their proposals, tribes will be eligible to apply to their states for subgrants of the Rural Health Transformation Program money. While larger tribes that have more resources, such as grant writers and staff to implement programs, could benefit, smaller tribes may struggle to produce competitive applications.
Church said that the Great Plains Tribal Leaders’ Health Board will know the fruits of its labor when states are notified of their rural health fund allotments by the end of the year.
“Hopefully the work that we did, the advocacy that we did, and the outreach,” Church said, “will result in resources getting to our tribes.”

Axios reported Thursday that the president’s first stop will be in northeastern Pennsylvania on Tuesday, a state he won with just over 50% of the vote in 2024. It appears to be his first visit to the commonwealth since attending an energy summit in Pittsburgh in July. 
People across the country are growing increasingly frustrated with the cost of living — and Trump’s approval rating has fallen to 38% in response, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll. The Democratic party notched several wins in last month’s elections, including the commonwealth’s judicial retention vote and flipped several municipal races. Democrats also picked up affordability-focused gubernatorial wins in New Jersey and Virginia.

The historically slim GOP majority in Congress has stymied some of Trump’s policies, and politicos predict that a Democratic sweep in 2026 would further threaten administrative priorities. Northeastern Pennsylvania’s 8th Congressional District, currently held by GOP U.S. Rep. Bob Bresnahan, is on Democrats’ shortlist for opportunities next year. 
A White House official didn’t confirm a time or place when asked by WVIA, an NPR member station. The news organization notes several NEPA Trump visits over the years, including two in 2024 in Wilkes-Barre Township and Scranton. 
Last month, The New York Times reported that the 79-year-old had fewer public events on his schedule than he did during his first term with less domestic travel. It noted most public appearances fell between noon and 5 p.m., and the president appeared drowsy at recent press conferences, as detailed in the story.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/trump_westmifflin1748923162.jpg,,,2025-12-04 14:57:58.086039

(Photo: Anna Liz Nichols)Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald, running in 2026 to become Michigan’s next attorney general, has the strongest leads against the Republican candidates compared to other Democrats in the primary, according to a new poll released Wednesday. 
The poll, conducted in late November by Public Policy Polling, shows McDonald with a seven-point lead over attorney Matt DePerno, who is currently facing felony charges in an alleged scheme to tamper with election equipment during the 2020 election, and a five-point lead over attorney Kevin Kijewski, who has represented one of the “false electors” who was charged with attempting to submit a slate of 2020 electoral votes for Donald Trump. 
McDonald’s Democratic primary opponents, Washtenaw County Prosecutor Eli Savit and former U.S. Attorney Mark Totten of the Western District of Michigan, each held smaller leads over each Republican candidate, all within the margin of error of the poll. 
Savit was tied with Kijewski in the poll, while Totten held a one-point lead. Against DePerno, Savit and Totten were both three points ahead. The poll also showed McDonald, who prosecuted the shooter in the 2021 Oxford High School shooting as well as his parents, with greater name recognition among Democratic voters. 
“This poll shows what we are seeing every day on the ground, that Michigan voters are hungry for a candidate who has been willing to take on tough fights, will fight to protect our freedoms, uphold the law and keep our communities safe,” McDonald said in a press release from her campaign.
The poll interviewed 631 likely Michigan voters by phone and text, and the margin of error for the poll was 3.9 percentage points.

But residents across the state have raised concerns about noise, pollution and other environmental impact, the potential for higher energy bills and noted the centers promise very few jobs by scale. A petition asking for more guarantees from local officials in Brandon over a data center being built there now has over 1,000 signatures.

xAI in Mississippi
Some DeSoto County residents living close to the makeshift power plant fueling xAI’s Memphis data centers have raised concerns about the plant’s near constant noise and environmental issues. 
xAI is owned by billionaire Elon Musk, whose company is building two data centers across state lines in Memphis. 
One longtime resident said the noise started at a low level in August but has gotten louder. He told Mississippi Today, “I can’t live here like this for another nine months. It’s going to drive me crazy.”

Amazon’s next move
In November, Amazon announced it will be building a new $3-billion data center in Warren County. 
The new center will create about 200 new jobs. It will not require any more state funds beyond an original 2024 agreement in which the state provided $44 million and loaned Amazon $215 million, along with tax breaks. 
Amazon is already constructing two data centers in Madison County, bringing its total investment to $29 billion in the state. 
Entergy promises upgrades without higher price tag
Speaking of energy, Entergy has said that its historic investment into upgrading the grid won’t result in higher rates. 
Entergy Mississippi CEO, Haley Fisackerly recently told the Clarion Ledger that Amazon and data centers will pay “a larger share of the cost of the business.”
Fisackerly recently told Mississippi Today that multiple companies are exploring bringing new data centers to the state. Data centers require huge amounts of electricity and water, and many of the deals involve energy companies.

Other news: ‘A charming Southern haberdashery,’ continuing debate over BP settlement spending

The New York Times named Oxford’s Hinton & Hinton one of the 50 best stores in America. The store was described as a “charming Southern haberdashery.”
The Mississippi Gulf Coast Restoration Fund’s handling of the $750 million settlement from BP’s 2010 oil spill has once again come under scrutiny. In a letter to the state Legislature, Bill Cork, executive director of the state’s economic development agency, wrote, “this year’s applicant pool does not reflect a coordinated regional strategy or the transformational impact envisioned when the Legislature created the GCRF.” The fund is no stranger to controversy. In 2022, the Sun Herald wrote that the Fund was “failing to meet any conventional measure of success for an economic development program.” 
Hope Credit Union opened the HOPE Economic Empowerment Center in Jackson. The center will offer financial products and services, training and education to expand economic mobility. In a release, Jackson Mayor John Horhn said the new center transformed a vacant city property into a place that will offer financial products and services for individuals, families, and small business owners, along with homebuyer education, entrepreneurial training, and a multipurpose space designed for community engagement. 
BWC Terminals, a large liquid-storage company, is opening a new facility in Pascagoula. According to the Mississippi Development Authority, the $316-million investment will create 25 jobs. The new site is part of an agreement with the nearby Chevron Pascagoula Refinery.

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)North Carolina’s programs to repair and rebuild multi-family and workforce housing in western counties will begin accepting applications in early 2026, Gov. Josh Stein said this week.
“Multi-family housing applications will be in the first part of the year,” Stein told reporters Wednesday. “And workforce [housing] will follow.”
The housing initiatives are part of a larger, federally-funded effort to rebuild housing after Hurricane Helene in fall 2024. State officials have been accepting applications for single-family housing since June; that program’s applications close Dec. 31.
That single-family program uses the largest chunk of $1.4 billion in federal grant money, just over $800 million. The multi-family program will spend around $191 million, according to the state’s federally-approved plan, and the workforce program will spend around $53 million.
The state’s decision to stagger the timing of the programs is due to “limited staff,” Stein said Wednesday, as state officials and contractors have pushed to get as many people enrolled in the single-family program as possible. State officials had initially estimated that the multi-family and workforce programs would open in late 2025.
As of Dec, 4, there are just under 5,000 active applications for single-family housing, according to state data.
Multi-family housing repairs and rebuilds will focus on rentals that are separated into two categories: small projects with four or fewer units, and large projects with five or more units. Those projects can include those that are mixed-use, and large project applicants can include both for-profit developers, nonprofits and local governments.
Small projects will receive anywhere from $250,000 to $1.5 million, according to the state plan. Large projects can receive up to $15 million.
If projects under the program have received or could receive low-income housing tax credits, state officials will consult with the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency. The state plan calls for priority to be given to projects developed in areas with “high costs … relative to area median gross income” and higher rates of poverty.
The N.C. Department of Commerce, which is overseeing the housing programs, expects multiple rounds of applications “over the next several years” for large multi-family projects, the plan says.
Workforce housing, meanwhile, will likely have just one application round.
The program aims “to incentivize (workers) to remain in western NC following Helene and to partially remedy inadequate housing production in past years across western NC,” according to the state plan.
Housing developed under the workforce program will be for ownership, available to households who make up to 80% of an area’s median income. Local governments, public and private companies and nonprofits are all eligible to apply to develop projects under the program.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3393-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-04 13:57:57.942437

Free.,Health subsidies would continue for 3 years under Dem bill to be voted on in US Senate,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/health-subsidies-would-continue-3-years-under-dem-bill-be-voted-us-senate,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer announced Thursday the chamber will vote next week to extend enhanced tax credits for three years for people who purchase their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act marketplace, though the plan seems unlikely to get the bipartisan support needed to advance. While it would typically be difficult for the minority leader to schedule a floor vote, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., agreed that Democrats could bring up a health care bill of their choosing in exchange for voting to end the government shutdown.Schumer told reporters in recent days to “stay tuned” for details about the legislation while maintaining all Senate Democrats were united around the proposal. The three-year plan he previewed during his floor speech appears identical to one House Democratic leaders have been pressing for in that chamber. “Any Republican who claims to care about premium increases on January 1 has only one realistic path, and that's to support our bill for a simple, clean, three-year extension,” Schumer said. “If Republicans block our bill, there's no going back. We won't get another chance to halt these premium spikes before they kick in at the start of the new year.” The vote will take place next Thursday, Schumer said. Clock ticking on solutionHealth care costs have surged to the forefront of the national conversation in recent months, with both Democrats and Republicans in Congress pledging to find solutions. Both agree much more time is needed to make larger, structural changes. The Senate committee in charge of health care policy held a hearing Wednesday where senators began to coalesce around extending the enhanced tax credits beyond the end-of-December sunset date. But a bipartisan bill has not yet been introduced in that chamber on that subject. Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Chairman Bill Cassidy, R-La., said just after the hearing wrapped up there will likely be a GOP bill, or even a bipartisan one, to counter Schumer’s bill. “Yeah, absolutely,” Cassidy said. “I'd like to have a plan that both sides can vote for. But there will be a Republican plan if I have anything to do with it.”Congress has an especially brief time frame to find a short-term resolution on the expiring tax credits, which would lead the cost of ACA marketplace plans to rise by hundreds or thousands of dollars. Open enrollment for ACA marketplace plans ends in most of the country on Dec. 15 and lawmakers are set to leave Capitol Hill on Dec. 19 for their winter holiday break. A poll released Thursday by the nonpartisan health organization KFF showed nearly 60% of ACA marketplace enrollees could not cover the costs of a $300 annual increase in their premiums, while an additional 20% said they couldn’t afford a $1,000 jump in prices per year. Gottheimer, Kiggans unveil House bipartisan billAt the same time Schumer was speaking on the Senate floor, a bipartisan group of House lawmakers, led by New Jersey Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer and Virginia Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans, introduced a bill they said could address some of the short-term issues facing ACA enrollees. “Although we may have different opinions over the long-term solutions for reforming marketplace health care or if there are even better and cheaper options for publicly available health insurance, we agree on the many aspects of the short-term solutions,” Kiggans said. The legislation — which needs to pass a floor vote, make it through the Senate and garner President Donald Trump’s signature — would extend the enhanced ACA marketplace tax credits with new income caps, “guardrails for waste, fraud and abuse” and an overhaul of the pharmacy benefit manager, or PBM, system, Kiggans said. The bipartisan group of representatives would then move on to the second part of their plan, not included in the bill, where they would try to make more structural changes to the entire country’s health care system. Those bills, Kiggans said, would address hospital billing transparency, implement Health Savings Accounts and advance the Give Kids a Chance Act “to accelerate pediatric cancer treatments and expand access to life-saving therapies for children battling rare diseases.”Gottheimer said the group wants House leaders to put their bill up for a vote before members leave town for the two-week, end-of-year break. “In the last month, families have seen their health insurance premiums surge as they've shopped for insurance during open enrollment because enhanced premium tax credits are set to expire, as we all know, at the end of the year,” Gottheimer said. “In fact, because of this, for millions of families on the ACA, their health premiums will rise an average of 26% next year. “In Jersey, where we live, it could be even rougher with a 175% increase. That's $20,000 for a family of four. And that's why we're all here together to try to solve this problem, do something about it, and avoid a massive new tax on hard-working families,” he said.Senators don’t see future in bipartisan House billSchumer and other Senate Democrats didn’t appear to take the bipartisan House plan seriously when pressed about it during an early afternoon press conference, asking reporters in the room whether Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., would actually put it on the floor for a vote. “As for whatever House proposals there are, we'll always look at something, but I don’t even see 15 Republicans supporting it right now,” Schumer said. “Sure an individual or two or three people can say this or that. It’s not going to solve the problem.”Schumer maintained Senate Democrats' three-year extension, which does not come with income caps or other changes to the tax credits proposed by centrist Republicans, is the best path forward.He appeared frustrated when reporters asked him why he didn’t include changes that could have swayed at least some GOP senators to vote for the bill. Schumer said it wasn’t worth it for Democrats to put together a bill that a few Republicans might support when he doesn’t expect Speaker Johnson to put the bill on the floor in that chamber given strong opposition to the enhanced tax credits by “half his caucus.”“Come on,” he said. “The fault is there, not with us.”",,,,2025-12-04 13:57:57.942437

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer cited false statistics about the percentage of crimes committed by Somali-Americans on Fox Business Wednesday, joining a wave of Republicans engaging in anti-Somali rhetoric lately. 
“It’s not that all Somalis are committing crimes, but 80% of the crimes being committed in the Twin Cities Minnesota are being committed by Somalis,” Emmer said. 
That is false. 
Crime statistics are complicated, as they are often based on crimes that are reported and — in the case of statistics on the race of the offender — those that are solved or result in an arrest. Law enforcement discrimination can also skew the data; a 2023 federal report following an investigation of the Minneapolis Police Department found that the agency discriminated against Black and Native American people. 
Law enforcement agencies do not release data on the nationality of perpetrators, only race and ethnicity when available. That means Somali-Americans are grouped with other Black and African-American people in crime statistics. 
All of those caveats considered, a state crime dashboard, filtered for crimes in the seven-county metro area, shows that 37% of people arrested since 2021 were Black. Somali-Americans comprise just a portion of the total Black population, which means Emmer’s claim is significantly off.
A Hennepin County Attorney’s Office dashboard shows that since 2018, 57% of Hennepin County cases involved a perpetrator who was Black or African-American. (The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office declined to press charges in around one-quarter of cases received by the office.)
Emmer made similar comments on Fox over the summer.
Wednesday’s remarks come after a couple of anti-Somali tirades by President Donald Trump, who at a cabinet meeting Tuesday said Somali people are “garbage.”
The Trump administration has launched an immigration enforcement campaign targeted at Somali people in the Twin Cities, sparking fear among the community and pushback from Somali leaders. 
Emmer’s public comments on Minnesota’s Somali community — the largest in the nation — have shifted drastically since he defended Somali immigrants in St. Cloud a decade ago.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The state of Utah’s chosen site for a massive new homeless campus is generously sprinkled with wetlands that environmentalists desperately want preserved, and as such is also a haven for mosquitoes. Despite ample warnings against it, the Utah State Prison was relocated to a similar site not far away. As predicted, prisoners and staff are besieged by mosquitoes and swarms of other biting insects that provide food for the 12 million migrating birds that feed near the Great Salt Lake.  Forcing the homeless into that same environment just exploits them even more.
As the climate warms and mosquito season lengthens, the homeless, like the prison population, will find life in a mosquito factory about as pleasant as a root canal that never ends. But that inevitably launches the “solution” of insecticide warfare, under the assumption that if enough toxic chemicals are sprayed, and evolutionary science and collateral damage conveniently ignored, the mosquitoes will surrender and the biting will stop.
Pesticides (insecticides and herbicides) are poisons to much of the biologic world, from pest insects to humans and everything in between.  Thousands of studies have connected pesticides to multiple poor human health outcomes. One of the most well established is neurotoxicity, hardly a surprise given their origin as nerve agent chemical weapons.  Many pesticides are directly toxic to neurons, especially those that produce the neurotransmitter, dopamine. Pesticides and air pollution are established risk factors for intellectual disabilities, neurodevelopmental disorders, autism, cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Disease. Given high rates of mental illnesses and disabilities, unhealthy behavior, poor nutrition, and lack of medical care in the chronically homeless, they would only be further victimized if subjected to a continuous barrage of insecticides for months at time, year after year. 
Pesticides also cause metabolic disorders like type II diabetes, reproductive and developmental toxicity, and respiratory disease. They can cause genetic damage, increasing the risk of  multiple cancers, including non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, leukemia, multiple myeloma, soft tissue and lung sarcoma, brain, pancreatic, prostate, stomach, liver, kidney, bladder, and gall bladder cancer, including the transgenerational increased risk of cancer in unexposed children of occupationally exposed parents. 
This homeless campus would also be close to where invasive phragmites are sprayed regularly with herbicides, usually glyphosate (i.e. Roundup), the most commonly used herbicide worldwide.  Glyphosate, like many other pesticides, is an endocrine disruptor, meaning it can trigger a wide variety of maladies (birth defects, hormone and reproductive disorders, multiple cancers, fatty liver disease, and impaired brain development, pregnancy complications, miscarriages and pre-term births) by antagonizing or augmenting human hormones even at extremely low doses. Like insecticides, glyphosate is highly toxic to the brain and associated with virtually all the same clinical outcomes as previously mentioned with insecticides. 
Even more alarming, in animal studies glyphosate was associated with multi-system toxicity and pathologies that were more extensive and more severe in up to three subsequent, unexposed generations.
Glyphosate is already toxic enough, but based on EPA’s analysis of new formulations of Roundup sold for residential use, Friends of the Earth found that four new ingredients intended to replace glyphosate, are, on average 45 times more toxic than glyphosate. 
But it gets worse. The most dangerous feature of pesticides is that nearly 70% of all pesticides introduced for commercial sale between 2015 to 2020 have PFAS, i.e. “forever chemicals” in their formulas either intentionally or unintentionally. PFAS are considered the most toxic industrial chemicals ever produced, even worse than the pesticides themselves.
Spraying insecticides has become an institutionalized ritual, rationalized as necessary to prevent human cases of West Nile Virus despite it being ineffective or even counterproductive.  Nearly 80% of infections are asymptomatic and never reported. Normally less than 1% of people infected will develop encephalitis or meningitis, and about .05% of cases will be fatal. But the risks are much higher for elderly males and the immunosuppressed which are overly represented in homeless populations. 
Insecticides inhibit a critical enzyme in white blood cells, impair the survival of those cells, damage the immune system and increase the risk of a debilitating or fatal outcome. Human disturbance of an area, including pesticide spraying, can not only increase the number of mosquitoes, it increases the number of disease-carrying insects. Repeated use of insecticides invariably induces resistance in mosquitoes, launching a chemical arms race invoking ever more spraying and more toxic chemicals. 
The mosquitoes will eventually win this battle and the homeless will lose. For people already living on the edge of survival, rounding them up and smothering them with mosquitoes and pesticides will truly make it hell on earth.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/090325_UND-Homeless-Site_06-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-04 13:57:57.942437

Ron DeSantis on Thursday proposed an artificial intelligence “bill of rights” to stymie unfettered AI growth, crack down on sexual AI chatbots, and restrict AI data centers in Florida.
Hinted at for months, these legislative proposals come in sharp contrast to pro-tech push marking President Donald Trump’s second term in office. Trump — allied with technology titans like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg — toyed with an executive order to thwart state-level AI regulations earlier this month.
But DeSantis insists he won’t allow Florida to fall victim to dangers he believes unrestricted AI development will yield.
“We cannot turn it all over to machines and think it’s going to work out great in the end,” he said in a press conference from The Villages, joined by an Orlando mom who lost her son to suicide after an AI chatbot encouraged him to “come home.”
“I really fear that if this is not addressed in an intelligent and proper way, it could set off an age of darkness and deceit,” DeSantis added.
He pointed to a slew of perceived problems with artificial intelligence, including unmonitored chatbots contributing to the “sexual grooming” of children.
Sewell Setzer, 14 years old, committed suicide last year after using a customizable Character.AI chatbot that he nicknamed “Daenerys Targaryen,” the “Game of Thrones” character. His mother, Megan Garcia, spoke during DeSantis’ press conference Thursday morning to denounce the company for allowing the chatbot to engage in “sexual role-play” with her son.
Garcia says the chatbot encouraged him to “come home” and that it “would be waiting” for Setzer after he committed suicide.
“If an adult engaged in this behavior, they would be in jail,” Garcia said.
Congressional ‘overreach?’
One of DeSantis’ biggest objection to AI appears to be its data centers. These are facilities designed to process the massive amount of energy required to operate AI language learning models.
High energy consumption overheats the machines, which require water to cool them down. A medium-sized data center could require up to 110 million gallons of water per year and a large-size center up to 1.8 billion gallons per year, the Environmental and Energy Study Institute reported.
Rural Louisiana will be the site of Meta’s new $10 billion data center, set to be the company’s largest of 20 centers worldwide.
Over the summer, the U.S. House passed a version of Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” that would have banned states from regulating AI for the next 10 years. Although the Senate promptly struck that line-item following sweeping, bipartisan backlash, the proposal re-emerged at the end of November.
The White House was considering an executive order to re-up that provision with a decade-long moratorium on state-level AI regulations. Although that plan appears to have been scrapped, DeSantis told onlookers Thursday that that would constitute significant congressional “overreach” and potentially be unconstitutional.
“Is it an overreach to do a 10-year moratorium as a matter of policy and strip the states [of regulation ability]? Yes,” he said. “This is basically putting every state in handcuffs and not letting them do anything.”
What will be in the AI Bill of Rights?
Without delving into explicit details nor divulging which lawmakers will sponsor his “AI Bill of Rights” — although he did mention he’d spoken with “a number of Senators,” “some House members,” and Senate President Ben Albritton — DeSantis outlined a host of proposals he’d like to see become law:

Fortifying anti-deep fake protections;
Banning local governments from contracting with Chinese-created AI tools;
Preventing AI companies from selling consumer data;
Allowing parents to access their child’s conversations with these chatbots;
Requiring attorneys to certify whether they used AI to write legal briefs;
Prohibiting utility companies from charging Floridians to subsidize data centers;
Allowing local governments to refuse AI data centers;
Preventing AI data centers being constructed in agricultural areas;
Requesting the Florida Department of Transportation to conduct a “noise review” near AI data centers.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ChatGPT-screen.png,,,2025-12-04 13:57:57.942437

ADFA is charged with promoting economic growth in the state by providing affordable financing options for business expansion, affordable housing, infrastructure, public health initiatives and higher education funding, according to a commerce department news release.
Arrington is replacing former ADFA President Mark Conine, who resigned in August to pursue an opportunity in the private sector. 
“Stepping into the role of president at ADFA, I’m focused on maintaining the strong foundation already in place,” Arrington said. “We’ll keep pushing forward to support projects that make a real difference across Arkansas.”
Since joining ADFA, Arrington has served in multiple leadership roles, including as vice president of homeownership and public finance. A graduate of the University of Arkansas, Arrington has served as ADFA’s interim president since August.
“Ro Arrington has been instrumental in ADFA’s success for more than a decade, and his appointment as president will lead to continued growth for the agency,” Secretary of Commerce Hugh McDonald said. “He is the right person for the job with the financial expertise and experience to lead ADFA. We are excited about Governor Sanders’ selection and look forward to working alongside Ro in his new leadership role.”

Free.,"Trump’s Education Department transfers illegal, US Senate Dems say",Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trumps-education-department-transfers-illegal-us-senate-dems-say,,"WASHINGTON — More than 30 members of the U.S. Senate Democratic caucus slammed the U.S. Education Department’s plans to shift several responsibilities to other Cabinet-level agencies in a letter to Secretary Linda McMahon. The senators blasted the move as “outrageous,” and “illegal,” saying it circumvented appropriations law — which is how Congress exercises its power of the purse — and would “jeopardize the funding and support that tens of millions of students, teachers, and families across the country rely on.”Sens. Patty Murray of Washington state, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer led the letter, dated Wednesday. Murray is the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Baldwin is the top Democrat on the Appropriations subcommittee overseeing Education Department funding and Sanders is the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.“This is the latest example of this administration’s complete lack of regard for our laws and its failure to provide the certainty, clarity, and stability that students and schools deserve when it comes to the federal government’s approach and commitment to properly implementing federal education laws and appropriations,” the senators wrote. Department dismantlingThe Education Department outlined six agreements signed with the departments of Labor, Interior, Health and Human Services and State. The move drew swift backlash from Democratic officials, labor unions and advocacy groups. The plan, announced Nov. 18, is part of a larger effort from President Donald Trump’s administration to dismantle the 46-year-old Education Department as the president seeks to send education “back to the states.” Much of the funding and oversight of schools already occurs at the state and local levels.McMahon has defended the move as an effort to cut “bureaucratic bloat.”But the senators’ letter said the plan will “create even more bureaucracy that states, school districts, and educational institutions across America will have to expend time and resources navigating at the expense of students and families.” The lawmakers urged McMahon to “immediately reverse course” and focus her time and attention on “actions that actually help states, school districts and educational institutions improve educational outcomes and support for students.” Appropriators objectThe senators also pointed out that Congress has not provided the Education Department with the authority to transfer the programs and their associated funding to other agencies. They noted that “appropriations law prohibits the transfer of funds to another federal agency unless expressly authorized in appropriations law, which it has not done in this case.” The senators also expressed concerns over the loss of expertise from the transfer of services, highlighting the Department of Labor’s greater role in managing the Education Department’s elementary and secondary education programs and higher education grant programs. “The Department also provides deep policy expertise to ensure programs support improved student outcomes, such as through expert guidance to colleges and universities to improve college access, retention, and completion through programs like TRIO, GEAR UP, the Postsecondary Student Success Grant Program, and others,” they wrote.The Federal TRIO Programs include federal outreach and student services programs to help students who come from disadvantaged backgrounds, while the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs, or GEAR UP, aim to prepare low-income students for college.“Now, DOL, who lacks the necessary expertise, is tasked with managing these programs and students will suffer as a result.” The lawmakers also criticized the lack of detail the administration has provided about the implementation of the transfers.“The other federal agencies that will suddenly have significant responsibilities in administering billions in education funding — have provided no information about their roles or their capacity to carry out these programs and activities,” they wrote. The department did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.",,,,2025-12-04 12:59:43.027400

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Since 2013, chronic wasting disease has been detected in more than 500 deer across 31 Iowa counties. 
The Iowa Department of Natural Resources has launched an updated response plan to the disease that includes collaboration with the hunting community, researchers and landowners. The plan was introduced ahead of the start to Iowa’s gun season for deer hunting, which begins Saturday. 
The plan, which is written for 2025 through 2030, said the state is shifting focus from eradicating the disease to instead “mitigating its spread and managing its impacts.” 
Chronic wasting disease is a fatal neurological disease impacting cervids – elk, moose, caribou and most importantly to Iowa, white-tailed deer. It is spread through certain prion proteins in saliva, nasal drippings, urine and other secretions. 
The stated goal in the response plan is to “document the spread of the disease while balancing deer herd health with quality hunting opportunities, for as long as possible, while preparing Iowans for our future with CWD.” 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Jace Elliott, DNR’s state deer biologist, said the response plan is intended to serve as a “blueprint” for how state agencies are responding to the disease. Elliott said Iowa is still in a “relatively early stage” of the disease, as there are still a handful of hotspots.  
“Our hope is the public sees it as a measured, moderate approach to managing an extremely difficult challenge,” Elliott said in a news release with DNR.
Monitoring CWD 
The disease starts in low numbers but grows exponentially, according to a news release from DNR. Elliott said chronic wasting disease can take a couple of years before it starts to physically impact an infected deer, and it can take decades to impact a deer population. 
As it has since the first Iowa detection, in Allamakee County, the department plans to continue sampling and testing harvested deer for the disease. The majority of surveillance in recent years has come from samples submitted by hunters. 
DNR plans to continue to issue county-specific quotas for the number of deer samples collected and tested for chronic wasting disease. Deer hunters who want to participate in the program can find more information online about submitting and collecting samples from a harvested deer.

While the disease has not been shown to infect humans, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that hunters test their deer meat for the disease before consuming. Samples, even after a county has reached its quota, can be sent to DNR for testing if a hunter wants the peace of mind before consuming his or her hunt. 
Iowans can also access a dashboard online with chronic wasting disease data by county. Tyler Harms, a biometrician with DNR, said this data can help hunters decide if they want to get their deer tested, and where they want to hunt. 
“Hunters care, they’re passionate, they want to do what they can to slow the spread of the disease,” Harms said in a news release with DNR. 
DNR staff like Harms and some Iowa State University professionals have trained interested hunters on managing, testing and sharing information about the disease within their counties. These trained hunters become chronic wasting disease ambassadors for the state and are part of the department’s initiative to prioritize education and outreach about the disease. 
Managing deer populations 
In addition to testing, the DNR plan includes harvest-based management to help control the spread of the disease. 
Deer hunting in the state helps to keep populations at a healthy level, which can also lower transmission of the disease. 
“We’re trying to mitigate increased transmission and high prevalence rates by keeping deer numbers at a balanced level—in other words, avoiding overabundance,” Elliott with DNR said. “We’re not doing aggressive, targeted deer removals; all of our harvest and surveillance is voluntary.”
Counties with overabundance might have additional, special hunting weekends or tags to help curb the population. Hunters can find a map of DNR’s deer management zones online, as well as further licensing information. 
“Hunting plays a huge role in slowing the spread of the disease,” Harms said in a news release. “We encourage hunters to continue hunting in Iowa and managing the herd for future generations.” 
Saturday, Dec. 6, marks the start of gun season, which DNR said is Iowa’s busiest deer season. Hunters are expected to harvest between 55,000 and 60,000 deer during the Dec. 6-10 and Dec. 13-21 gun seasons this year. 

Hunting information
Official hunting and licensing information can be found in the DNR’s annual hunting guide. 
DNR recommends hunters review their equipment and safety protocols, including the requirement to wear blaze orange while hunting, before heading out.

Already, hunters have harvested more than 29,000 deer in 2025. Youth and bow hunting seasons began in September and October. 
In the 2024-2025 season, hunters bagged 101,282 deer in Iowa, according to the state report. 
Elliott said early season reports show “strong” deer harvest in eastern Iowa and low deer numbers in central and western Iowa, in part due to other disease pressures. 
The department anticipated last year that epizootic hemorrhagic disease in deer would impact deer populations. Hunters can also report suspected cases of the hemorrhaging disease to DNR. Impacted deer are often found dead near bodies of water as the disease causes dehydration. 
Public outreach 
The chronic wasting disease response plan emphasizes that the department will enforce deer-related policies, like a ban on hunting over bait and interstate carcass transport. 
The plan also calls for continued public outreach about the disease. DNR has partnered with ISU to lead the ambassador courses, seminars, chronic wasting disease sampling workshops, hunters education workshops and more. 
The plan said outreach efforts focus on educating hunters, landowners and stewards about the disease so the department can be “actively involving” Iowans as the disease continues to spread to more counties. 
“By leveraging a weighted surveillance protocol, engaging in proactive stakeholder collaboration, and utilizing validated diagnostic testing, the DNR strives to efficiently monitor and document CWD’s progression,” the plan said.

The judges found both the ballot language and the summary statement that will be posted […],"Students hold up anti-abortion signs at the Midwest March for Life on May 1, 2024, at the Missouri State Capitol (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).A Missouri appeals court rewrote the language for a proposed abortion ban set to appear on the November 2026 ballot after the judges concluded Thursday the previous wording drafted by Republican Secretary of State Denny Hoskins was riddled with errors.
The judges found both the ballot language and the summary statement that will be posted at polling places “fail to sufficiently advise voters” that the proposed amendment would repeal and replace the reproductive rights amendment voters passed in November 2024 to legalize abortion. 
The new ballot language certified by the Missouri Court of Appeals reads: 
“Shall the Missouri Constitution be amended to:

Repeal the 2024 voter-approved Amendment providing reproductive healthcare rights, including abortion through fetal viability;
Allow abortions for rape and incest (under twelve-weeks’ gestation), emergencies, and fetal anomalies;
Allow legislation regulating abortion;
Ensure parental consent for minors’ abortions;
Prohibit gender transition procedures for minors?”

Western District Court of Appeals Presiding Judge W. Douglas Thomson and judges Thomas Chapman and Janet Sutton filed the opinion less than 24 hours after hearing arguments in their courtroom Wednesday afternoon.
Hoskins’ now-rejected ballot language, in-part, asked if voters wanted to: “Repeal Article I, section 36, approved in 2024; allow abortions for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape, and incest.’”
Attorneys for Dr. Anna Fitz-James, who filed the lawsuit, picked this statement apart, scrutinizing the assumption that voters would know what “Article 1, section 3 of the constitution is, the exclusion of the 12-week gestation limit for survivors, as well as the misuse of a semi-colon, which could be interpreted to mean citizens would be newly gaining these abortion rights.
The appeals court agreed with them on all three counts.
The judges also re-wrote Hoskins’ initial ballot language that asked if voters wanted to: “Guarantee women’s medical care for emergencies, ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages.”
The appeals court found that wording to be “misleading,” because while the proposed amendment would prevent the state from interfering with an individual’s ability to access such care, it “does not guarantee the care itself.”
Fitz-James also argued the proposed amendment violates a statute that prevents ballot measures from encompassing more than one subject. She argued that gender-affirming care is a different subject from reproductive health care.
The appeals judges agreed with the lower court’s assessment that the proposed amendment “passes constitutional muster” and does not violate the single subject rule. 
“Because gender transition surgeries or hormone therapies may affect the ability to reproduce, gender transition surgeries and hormone therapies may be connected with, or incident to, reproductive health care,” the judges wrote. 
Missouri challenges FDA approval of new generic mifepristone in push to limit abortion

Abortion rights groups have accused lawmakers of including the ban to win over more voters. Gender-affirming health care for minors is currently banned in Missouri, though a challenge to the law is before the state supreme court. 
But they disagreed with how Hoskins worded this part of the language, which initially asked if voters wanted to “prohibit sex-change procedures for children.” The judges said this wording incorrectly attempted to use the words “gender” and “sex” interchangeably. 
The court also re-wrote the ballot summary to reflect the new ballot language. 
A new law passed this year allows the secretary of state three attempts to write fair ballot language. Hoskins has so far used two, but the appeals court ruled Thursday that he wouldn’t be given his third try at the wording.
The latest decision is expected to be appealed to the Missouri Supreme Court. 
The proposed constitutional amendment was drafted and approved by Missouri’s Republican supermajority in May. A lawsuit over the initial ballot language, which failed to state the amendment would ban abortion, was filed in July by Fitz-James. Fitz-James, who submitted the language for the reproductive rights initiative petition, said the latest amendment was intentionally deceptive. 
While abortion up until the point of fetal viability is a constitutional right in Missouri because of  the abortion rights amendment voters approved, only several dozen abortions have occurred as legal battles over abortion regulations that remain in state statute play out in the courts.

(Courtesy of Environmental Protection Agency)Billing problems, dry taps and excessively leaky pipes paint a picture of a rural water utility that is “barely limping along” and may need state intervention, one of New Mexico’s three Public Regulation Commission members said at a recent meeting.
Commissioner Patrick O’Connell was responding to a complaint filed in January by Timberon resident and former Timberon Water and Sanitation District Board Member Mark Harding.
Timberon, a town of fewer than 1,000 people, lies in Otero County and is nestled between Alamogordo and Piñon at the southern edge of the Lincoln National Forest. 
Harding accused the Timberon utility of overbilling customers and inconsistently applying taxes to customer bills. In subsequent filings with the PRC, he alleged that utility staffers and elected board members incited community members to attack him on social media by making light of his complaint at recent board meetings and on social media. One resident on Facebook referred to his complaint against the utility as evidence that “Satan is at work” in the community.
Harding’s complaint also drew attention to bigger issues of water quality and reliability in the small town. 
Public notices show that the Timberon Water and Sanitation District recently violated multiple state water quality requirements. One such notice, posted in February, revealed violations for monthly reporting requirements and for failing monthly water disinfection requirements. Tests at the time found bacteria in the water — water district officials responded and said they were addressing the issue by putting chlorine in the water, per state guidelines.
More recent public notices reveal that in November officials put residents on a “precautionary water boil advisory.” Customers reported low pressure in their water, the notice said, which “may increase the likelihood of microbiological contamination within the distribution system.” It warned residents, in an all-caps message, “DO NOT DRINK THE WATER WITHOUT BOILING IT FIRST.”
During a late November PRC hearing about Hardin’s complaint, O’Connell said he thought commissioners needed to consider receivership, “because this utility is not functioning.”
“How many more Timberon issues do we need to see before we put the pieces together and say, ‘We need a bigger solution than a fine,’” he said. “If the community won’t create the solution themselves, which would be my preference, then we might need to take all of what’s going on down there as a sign to regulate more assertively.”
David Cruey, the Timberon Water and Sanitation District’s governing board chair, told Source NM that he was not aware of O’Connell’s comments until a reporter called him. He said TWSD officials are working with their delegation in the state Legislature to obtain the funding they need to update the system’s aging water infrastructure. Source NM contacted Rep. Harlan Vincent (R-Ruidoso Downs), but he did not respond to requests for comment. 
“A receivership wouldn’t help us. What we need is $45 million to $50 million to overhaul our water system,” he said. “A receivership is not going to bring money in, that’s for sure.”
According to Cruey, the water system in the area was installed in the 1970s and hasn’t been upgraded much since then. “It was subpar then and it’s certainly subpar now,” he said. 
Harding’s case and the longstanding issues of reliability and safety highlight the ongoing struggles of other small-town utilities across the state — earlier this year, the New Mexico Environment Department sued the Camino Real Regional Utility Authority in Sunland Park over longstanding problems with reliability and exceedingly high levels of harmful contaminants such as arsenic. In court, NMED officials asked a judge to place the utility in a receivership. And in a hearing before state lawmakers in November, a coalition of New Mexico locales said they need an extra $200 million to fully fund water infrastructure projects across the state.
In addition to its other issues, Timberon loses as much as 85% of the town’s water due to leaky pipes, O’Connell said at the November meeting. Harding shares his concern.
“We lose 3.5 million gallons a month to water loss,” Harding said. “My concern is that it’s not an infinite supply. Once you lose water, you lose it.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/lead-pipes-enviromental-justice.jpeg,,,2025-12-04 12:59:43.027400

Dec. 3, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceInquisitive residents packed into the Rod Bushey Performing Arts Center at Howell High School Wednesday night, as a panel of environmental, tech and infrastructure experts aimed to provide additional information on what it looks like when a data center is built within a community. 
Howell Township is one of a growing number of communities in Michigan raising questions on how they will be impacted if one of these facilities is built within their community as a project reportedly backed by Meta, the parent company for Facebook and Instagram, is planned on more than 1,000 acres of farmland.
Data centers are facilities made to house information technology equipment including servers, storage systems, networking equipment and other hardware used to store and distribute data. While these facilities provide the infrastructure for the internet and web-based services, they are also used in artificial intelligence development.
With the Legislature creating a sales and use tax exemption for data centers in 2024, more facilities are aiming to set up shop in Michigan. However, the speakers at Wednesday’s community information and action night warned that these projects can herald higher energy rates, alongside a number of environmental issues.
As data centers flock to Michigan communities, what protections exist for residents?

Ben Green, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan School of Information and the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy, explained that using programs like ChatGPT or video generation platforms requires a huge amount of energy, increasing energy demand and requiring upgrades to the grid, prompting energy companies to try and recover costs by raising rates. 
Oftentimes these companies are realizing they need to keep fossil fuel plants open in order to supply energy to these resource intensive facilities, Green said, which can scuttle climate goals like Michigan’s law requiring energy companies to meet a 100% clean energy standard by 2040.
Data centers often have gas generators on site to ensure they have enough energy, which creates air pollution, Green explained. Data centers can also create issues with light pollution and noise pollution, Green said. 
Water use is another major concern, Green said, explaining that water is often the most effective way to cool servers and chips, which generate heat when in use.
Transparency is also a major issue surrounding these facilities, Green said. 
“Data Center companies are incredibly eager to not share any information about how much electricity they use, how much water they use,” Green said. “Often they have various types of non-disclosure agreements or kind of bans on what even the public officials are allowed to say. So it can be very hard for journalists and citizens to actually learn, you know, just how much electricity are you using, how much water are you using?”

While data centers are often viewed as a major job creator, Green and Prescott Balch, a retired tech industry employee who wrote software supported by data centers, said the actual gains are significantly smaller compared to what companies promise.
“There’s a lot of construction work in these projects,” Balch said. “The construction work will employ over 1,000 people at its peak, and it will last for quite a while.” 
However, the data centers themselves employ as few people as possible by design, Balch said. Both Green and Balch noted that the facilities often only have around 20 to 25 full time employees after it is built. 
“It’s not, you know, what you might envision of a San Francisco office of coders and developers and program managers,” Green said. “It’s really just a bunch of a stack of computers on computers, on computers just processing data. So they really don’t need that many employees.”
In reality it’s the construction that brings economic development, not the data centers, Balch said. They do not turn communities into tech hubs, Balch said, calling them “the broom closet of technology.”
“We need them. You got to put the broom someplace,” Balch said. “They’re really important, and they’re really large. They can’t go in expensive real estate in downtown San Francisco. But they’re not sexy.”
Balch also warned that the AI boom driving investment into these facilities could go bust.
“The current data center market is $350 billion,” Balch said. “The currently proposed aggregate of all data center proposals is $2.5 trillion. There is no industry that grows that fast and lives to tell about it.”
Communities entertaining housing a data center need to ask themselves what will happen should the AI bubble burst, Balch said, with the answer varying depending on where they are in the development process. 
At the very end of that process, there is a risk of obsolescence, with Balch noting there are very few data centers that are more than 25 years old. 
“Technology will relentlessly innovate, and at some point a data center is too expensive to upgrade and it has to get converted to some other use,” Balch said. “We have no track record on hyper scale data centers, because they’re brand new.”

While the details will vary by state and by community, Balch also raised questions about providing these facilities with tax breaks, as they often fail to provide benefits in return. 
Andrea Pierce, the policy director for the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition, and Green also noted that the tax revenue that is lost in providing these breaks could instead be used for other priorities like schools, public services or roads.
Balch also noted that many of these companies are pursuing sites in small towns with cheap land and close access to water and power. This creates an additional risk for residents, who will be left to make up for lost tax revenue if a data center dries up. 
While they can drive economic development, the key is to develop a lot of them, Balch said. 
If a community has the expertise and expenses to negotiate a fair deal with the company, the resources needed to manage these oversized projects and a tax base that can absorb the cost if a facility becomes obsolete, then a data center could work there, Balch said, emphasizing that there are pros and cons to every project.

When asked how members of the community can protect themselves from the financial and environmental risks of a project, Balch encouraged them to tally up those downsides, decide which ones are important to them, and to formulate a strategy from there on how those issues can be addressed. 
Pierce recommended residents call their lawmakers and ask them to repeal the law creating tax breaks for data centers, and to take steps to hold their state and local officials accountable. 
Green emphasized that data center developers and tech companies push for these projects to move forward as quickly as possible with as little transparency as possible, advising community members to do everything in their power to slow the process down and learn more. 
“It’s imperative to figure out, like, who you know, is it the zoning board? Who is it in this community that actually has the sign off to approve or disapprove this project?” Green said. “What can you do, whether it’s a ballot initiative or something else, to put a moratorium in place, to just say we need to gather more information before a decision is made.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_7275-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-04 12:59:43.027400

An internal affairs investigation into the actions of police in a motor-vehicle pursuit that resulted in the death of a young officer was “preventable” if police had followed proper procedures, recent court documents show. A Salisbury man driving the vehicle being pursued faces a murder charge in her death.
The investigation found other officers involved in the July 2023 deadly incident committed several policy violations, from not having the proper authority to initiate the pursuit to not following procedures while the chase was underway.
The pursuit, according to police, ended on Woodstock Avenue in Rutland when Tate Rheaume  slammed nearly head-on into a cruiser, killing 19-year-old Rutland City Police Officer Jessica Ebbighausen.
Ebbighausen had been with the Rutland City Police Department for less than two months as a part-time officer and was scheduled to begin training the following month to get her full-time certification. 
“The death of Officer Ebbighausen WAS preventable,” Rutland City Police Commander Sam Delpha, who conducted the internal affairs investigation into the crash, wrote in his conclusion to his nine-page undated report.
“This incident and more specifically the pursuit should have never happened,” Delpha wrote. “The pursuit should have never started. The specific parts of the vehicle pursuit policy were put in place to prevent this exact sort of thing.”
The report was included as an exhibit to a filing last week in Rutland County Superior criminal court by Rheaume’s attorney, David Sleigh. 
Had the officers performed “their jobs correctly on this day,” Delpha added, the crash would not have occurred. 
“Even if the pursuit was legitimately started, supervisors had a duty and responsibility to stop the pursuit,” Delpha wrote. “There was plenty of time in between radio transmissions for supervisors to take control of this situation and make the appropriate decisions.”
Rheaume, who was also injured in the crash, was charged shortly after the incident with grossly negligent operation of a motor vehicle with a resulting death and attempting to elude police leading to a fatal crash.
He had been released on bail. However, several months later the prosecutor upgraded the charges against Rheaume to include aggravated murder – the most severe charge available in Vermont – which carries a mandatory minimum sentence of life in prison without parole if Rheaume is convicted. 
Rheaume, 22, was arraigned on the upgraded charges in April 2024 and has been held in custody without bail since. A trial is not expected to take until sometime next year.
This story will be updated.

Delaware State Park officials say the updated entry fees is designed to balance access, affordability, and long-term sustainability.
Jamie Kleman | Contributing Writer | Delaware Live | December 2025
Delaware’s state park entry fees will rise in 2026, marking the first change to the fee structure in ten years. The update applies to daily entrance fees, annual passes, and the lifetime pass offered to senior residents. New passes and permits will be available beginning December 9, 2025, in advance of the upcoming spring season.
For inland parks, Delaware registered vehicles will pay 5 dollars per day, while out-of-state vehicles will pay 10 dollars. At beach parks, daily entry will cost $ 10 for Delaware-registered vehicles and $ 20 for vehicles registered elsewhere. Annual passes that provide access to all 17 Delaware state parks will cost 50 dollars for Delaware registered vehicles and 100 dollars for out of state vehicles. Seniors and active duty military members can receive discounted annual passes. The lifetime pass for Delaware residents age 65 and older will increase to 150 dollars. Fees for surf fishing permits will remain the same in 2026. The new daily entrance fees will go into effect on March 1, 2026.
State officials say the increase reflects the growing cost of maintaining parks and supporting visitor services. User fees currently fund about 65 percent of park operating expenses, and attendance has increased steadily. In 2024, the statewide parks system recorded roughly 7.4 million visits, a rise of almost 2 million compared with ten years ago. Higher visitation means more wear and tear on facilities, trails, restrooms, and public access areas, along with greater demand for maintenance crews, lifeguards, and seasonal staff.
As part of the decision-making process, public information sessions were held in each county, and surveys were circulated to gather opinions from residents and park visitors. Officials say support was generally strong for updating the fees to help preserve services. Many survey respondents said they preferred a modest increase compared with the possibility of reduced hours or fewer programs.
For Delaware residents who visit year-round, an annual pass may offer the best value. Families who go to the beach several times each summer or enjoy multiple trips to inland parks like Killens Pond, Trap Pond, or Lums Pond will likely save money by purchasing a pass. Seniors and military members are encouraged to review eligibility for discounted prices before selecting a pass option.
Park officials say the updated fee structure is designed to balance access, affordability, and long-term sustainability. They believe the change will help protect natural resources, support education programs, and keep Delaware’s parks safe, clean, and enjoyable for generations of visitors.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Fee-Booth.png,,,2025-12-04 11:58:09.740923

State health officials say the epidemic is fueling chronic disease and infant mortality. Without major intervention, they warn, the health care system could be overwhelmed.  
To counter the crisis, multiple state agencies are rolling out coordinated programs to expand treatment access, improve nutrition education and promote physical activity. 
Growing crisis with deep health consequences
Mississippi ranks among the worst in national health outcomes, with about 1.2 million adults — roughly 40% of the population — classified as obese, according to federal data. Only West Virginia and Arkansas have higher rates, per Statista. 
Obesity significantly increases the risk of chronic diseases such as hypertension, heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, neurodegenerative conditions, diabetes and cancer, according to the University of Mississippi Medical Center.  
Dr. Daniel Edney, the state health officer and executive director of the Mississippi Department of Health, said obesity also drives some of the state’s most severe health challenges. 
“It’s the No. 1 cause of preterm birth, and preterm birth is a leading cause of infant mortality,” he said. “We have too many babies who die. We have too many children who die. We have way too many teenagers who are dying — and we can prevent all of this.” 
Edney said low-income and minority communities experience the highest rates, but the problem affects all Mississippians. Reports also show that more than 40% of children in the state are overweight or obese. 
“That is scary,” Edney said. “If they’re obese in the fifth grade, then they’re very likely to be morbidly obese when they’re 45 (years old).” 
That trajectory, he added, often reflects deeper economic and social barriers.
Barriers, stigma and the human cost of obesity 
Since July 2023, Mississippi Medicaid has covered anti-obesity medications, but only 2.4% of adults received treatment in 2024, according to the Mississippi Division of Medicaid’s drug utilization report.

Dr. Rasheedah Hall, owner of Hall Health in Hattiesburg, said patients without Medicaid often face monthly costs ranging from $300 to $1,500 if they pay out of pocket or if their insurance doesn’t cover treatment. 
“We need to make those medications more affordable to everyone,” Hall said. “They are a game changer.” 
Hall said increasing affordability and awareness of available treatments would help reduce obesity statewide. 
For Macayla Douglas, a lack of early access to resources shaped her struggles with obesity as a teenager. 
“As a 13- (or) 14-year-old and you’re super overweight, there’s people that call you names, you get weird looks,” Douglas said. “I was getting out of breath simply just like walking to class in a high school.” 
Douglas said her family often relied on cheap, less nutritious food due to cost and access barriers — a common issue across Mississippi. 
“I didn’t really feel like I had enough resources,” she said. “I didn’t come from a super privileged household.” 
 After years of trying to lose weight, she was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. With that diagnosis, she began medication, adopted a regular exercise routine and made lifestyle changes — ultimately losing 82 pounds.

“Whenever I was watching what I ate and sticking to consistent exercise, I was able to see a dramatic decrease in weight,” Douglas said. “It was making me feel super good, and it just led me to want to keep going.” 
Hall said stories like Douglas’ help shift public perception.  
“We’re moving forward and getting away from the stigma and the misunderstanding … if you just eat right and exercise, everybody would be at a healthy weight,” she said. “There are (sometimes) other factors at play.”
Policy, prevention and the path forward
Hall and Edney agree that reversing Mississippi’s obesity crisis will require long-term, statewide investment in education, prevention and equitable access to care. 
At the policy level, Gov. Tate Reeves reinstated the Presidential Fitness Test in October for the 2026–27 school year, and state leaders are proposing changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program intended to encourage healthier food choices.  
The Mississippi departments of Health and Education are also developing an interactive virtual platform that delivers daily health education to students through gaming. The goal: to make screen time active and build healthy habits from an early age. 
“That 15 minutes a day, kindergarten through 12th grade — that will change two generations,” Edney said. 
He emphasized that families also play a key role in encouraging physical activity, limiting screen time and monitoring key health indicators like blood pressure and blood sugar. 
“At the core of everything is the education of health promotion principles,” he said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/02091319/Obesity_Image_Workout.jpg,,,2025-12-04 11:58:09.740923

(Photo by Ryan Murphy/Getty Images)A federal immigration enforcement campaign began in earnest Wednesday in Louisiana, the latest area of focus for the Trump administration’s sweeps, detentions and deportations.  
Operation Catahoula Crunch began with agents fanning out from their New Orleans base into suburban areas to apprehend day laborers outside home improvement stores and workers at restaurants and construction sites. Official numbers on how many people were arrested were not immediately available, but the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement Wednesday morning its sweeps would be “targeting criminal illegal aliens roaming free thanks to sanctuary policies that force local authorities to ignore U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrest detainers.” 
Immigrant advocates have been on high alert and are tracking authorities as they carry out their operation. Members of Unión Migrante have posted frequently on social media to inform its followers of suspected sweep locations, sharing video of what they see. One post warned of federal agents reportedly attempting to board a school bus in Kenner as it dropped off students. They were refused access, according to the group’s observers.
Rachel Taber, an organizer with Unión Migrante, went to a home improvement store where a group of men in the parking lot had been taken into custody. She cast doubt on Homeland Security’s declared intent to round up criminals in New Orleans.
“They were roofers working hard today. They were people standing on the corner of Home Depot for an honest day’s pay, so that’s an absolute falsity,” Taber told WVUE-TV Fox 8, “like so many of the other things that they’re trying to sell us about what this Border Patrol operation is.”


State leaders have been openly supportive of the Trump administration’s immigration policy, and several local law enforcement agencies have entered into agreements with ICE to either house detainees in their jails or lend manpower to their sting operations. 
Besides Texas, Louisiana correctional facilities hold more ICE detainees than any other state. Federal, state and local prisons house between 7,000 and 8,000 immigrants based on estimates using immigration court data. 
Gov. Jeff Landry also declared an emergency earlier this year to renovate a high-security section of the state penitentiary in Angola to secure “the worst criminal illegal aliens arrested by ICE.” What’s been dubbed “Louisiana Lockup” has capacity for 416 beds.
Louisiana officials have also taken steps to shield federal agents as they conduct their mission. In a joint statement, the FBI and Louisiana State Police said they would collaborate “to deter assaults on federal officers and attempts to obstruct law enforcement actions.”
Attorney General Liz Murrill has said her office would seek consequences for anyone who prevents authorities from carrying out Operation Catahoula Crunch. 
“Individuals who interfere with ICE, Border Patrol, or assault law enforcement are committing a State crime and will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law,” Murrill said in a brief statement.
Murrill has also been critical of the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office over its refusal to hand over immigrant detainees to ICE. The agency’s chief task is operating the city jail, and it has been under a federal consent decree that places restrictions on when the sheriff’s office can yield custody to federal authorities. Murrill disputes this and is challenging specifics in the consent decree in federal court.
The attorney general faces a separate challenge from the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, which filed a lawsuit Wednesday. It argues a new state law that prohibits interfering with immigration enforcement is so broadly written that it stifles free speech and could place severe punishment on innocuous, legal activities.
The ACLU represents Immigration Services and Legal Advocacy, the lead plaintiff in the case. The group said it has stopped hosting “Know Your Rights” events to inform immigrants on how best to handle heightened enforcement over worries that it violated the new law, according to the lawsuit.
“Our law is constitutional and we look forward to defending it in court,” Murrill said Wednesday afternoon, adding that she had yet to receive the lawsuit.    
The Southern Poverty Law Center is also monitoring developments in Louisiana. One of its leaders, chief legal officer Derwyn Bunton, brings the perspective of having been the lead public defender in New Orleans for 13 years.  
He called into question claims that Homeland Security is pursuing the “worst of the worst,” as indicated in its announcement for Operation Catahoula Crunch. According to federal data Syracuse University has compiled, 71.5% of the nearly 60,000 people in ICE detention as of Sept. 21 had no criminal convictions. Many with convictions had committed only minor offenses, such as traffic infractions.
“The information that’s coming out is not matching the rhetoric of the administration …” Bunton said. Federal leaders have described “the sort of criminal element in the streets in our communities, painting this picture of all of us being held hostage in our streets by criminal elements who are not documented in our communities, and the data seems to be nothing further from the truth.”

The Ohio Senate passed the bill with a party line vote earlier this year and the Ohio House passed the bill last month.

“I believe it unwise to provide for 14- and 15-year-olds to work, on a school night, that late at night,” DeWine said in his veto message. “I see no compelling reason to deviate from current law.” 
Ohio law currently allows 14 and 15 year olds to work till 9 p.m. during the summer or during a school holiday, meaning they are not able to work past 7 p.m. on school nights.
“I believe the current law has served us well and has effectively balanced the importance of 14- and 15-year-old children learning to work, with the importance of them having time to study,” DeWine said in his veto message. 
Ohio is unable to change the law without the federal government making changes to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.
Ohio lawmakers also passed Senate Concurrent Resolution 3 which urges Congress to alter the Fair Labor Standards Act to let a teenager younger than 16 work between 7-9 p.m. during the school year if the teenager has their parent or guardian’s permission. 
“Learning to work is an essential part of growing up,” DeWine said in his veto message. “Businesses across Ohio each day give young people the opportunity to learn the so-called soft skills that will serve them well when they become adults.” 
Ohio Sen. Tim Schaffer, R-Lancaster, introduced both Senate Bill 50 and the Senate Concurrent Resolution, which says 14 and 15 year olds would need approval from a parent or guardian to work till 9 p.m.
Ohio businesses can pay 14 and 15 year olds the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, which is less than the state’s minimum wage of $10.70 per hour, according to the Ohio Department of Commerce.  
The Ohio Restaurant and Hospitality Alliance is in favor of the bill while the Children’s Defense Fund of Ohio opposes it.

Mai Xiong (D-Warren), second from right. Dec. 3, 2025 | Photo from Xiong's official Facebook pageLue Yang, a Lansing-area Hmong community leader who had been detained by ICE in July, has been released from federal custody after efforts from legislators on both sides of the aisle. 
“Everybody has given me, they gave me the strength,” Yang said in a video posted by U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte), who represents Yang’s home of St. John’s. 
Yang has been a resident in the United States since he came as an asylum seeker when he was a child. He was convicted on a burglary charge in 1997 and served a 10-month sentence — which despite being expunged from Michigan records in 2018, was the basis of his detention. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer also pardoned Yang in October, seeking to pause his deportation to Laos.
Another strong advocate for Yang’s release since he was taken into custody has been state Rep. Mai Xiong (D-Warren). Also a Hmong American who came to the U.S. as a refugee as a child, Xiong was present to welcome Yang back as he was reunited with his wife and six children. 

“This effort required setting aside partisanship, reaching across the aisle, and working together, at all levels of government. I commend the attorneys who are working overtime, within the confines of the law and policies that are ever changing, and the organizations that uplifted his story and informed the public and media,” Xiong wrote on social media. “While there are still many members of our community that have been detained by ICE recently, Lue’s release brings hope to so many immigrant families who are still awaiting their loved ones’ return home.”
“Lue is not and never has been an illegal immigrant, and he does not present a threat to our community, which motivated me to work tirelessly to see him released from custody,” Barrett, whose staff in Washington worked with federal agencies to facilitate his release, said in a statement. “I have consistently said that I believe we need to be firm, fair, and humane in how we enforce immigration law, and I’m proud that I could effectively advocate to get Lue released. I appreciate the willingness of the administration to listen to my concerns about Lue’s case and to reach this outcome.”
However, Rising Voices, a nonprofit organization focusing on increasing civic participation among Michigan’s Asian American residents, said that Yang’s legal battles were not over, as his immigration status still had to be definitively resolved in court. 
“But today’s homecoming is still a victory—not just for the Yang family, but for immigrant and refugee communities who are facing persecution and violence from our government at an unprecedented scale. The reunification of the Yang family is a beacon of hope and assurance that the power of organizing and unyielding demands for justice can indeed change the world,” the group said in a Facebook post. “No amount of racist rhetoric, xenophobic policy or violence can erase the truth of our existence: We are America, we are the future of this nation, and when we fight for our loved ones, we remain undaunted.”
State Sen. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit), who has also been an advocate for Yang’s release since his detention, also expressed her joy at the release on social media. 
“I am so relieved and happy that Lue Yang has been released by ICE and is reunited with his family! His wife Ann is a true inspiration,” she wrote in a Facebook post. “Our country is better because of immigrants and refugees — and people like Lue Yang deserve to continue contributing to our state rather than being deported. Today is a giant rare win for dignity for immigrants and refugees.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/593754486_122203721432284570_4335904162276942888_n-1024x657.jpg,,,2025-12-04 11:58:09.740923

Hosseini, during a board meeting Thursday in Gainesville, said UF will formally launch the search Friday.
Columbia University professor named University of Florida interim leader

Landry came from Columbia University to serve as interim president after former interim President Kent Fuchs’ contract expired. This is the second UF presidential search this year after the Florida Board of Governors rejected University of Michigan President Santa Ono despite his being approved by UF trustees.
In September, UF and Landry agreed to his interim agreement, which stipulated UF would owe Landry $2 million if he is not named permanent president.
Former UF President Ben Sasse resigned in 2024, citing his wife’s health. Later, a state audit found that Sasse’s spending during his short tenure was not reasonable.
Landry’s contract includes “key duties” of appointing a provost and interim deans.

After expressing interest in the permanent president position, University of West Florida interim President Manny Diaz Jr. was named the sole finalist for the job at that university.

UWF is not the only school to interpret “unranked list” as a single candidate. UF was another when it named Ono, and Florida International University was another after Jeanette Nuñez left her post as the state’s lieutenant governor to become interim leader there.

Roger Wicker",Associated Press,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/04/hegseth-signal-app-watchdog-roger-wicker/,"The report looking into Hegseth’s messages and participation in the chat follows a joint letter from Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi and U.S. Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Republican and Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, respectively, asking the Pentagon’s watchdog to investigate the Signal conversation.","WASHINGTON — The Pentagon’s watchdog found that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth put U.S. personnel and their mission at risk when he used the Signal messaging app to convey sensitive information about a military strike against Yemen’s Houthi militants, two people familiar with the findings said Wednesday.
Hegseth, however, has the ability to declassify material and the report did not find he did so improperly, according to one of the people familiar with the findings who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the information. That person also said the report concluded that Hegseth violated Pentagon policy by using his personal device for official business and it recommended better training for all Pentagon officials.
The report looking into Hegseth’s messages and participation in the chat follows a joint letter from Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi and U.S. Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Republican and Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, respectively, asking the Pentagon’s watchdog to investigate the Signal conversation.
Hegseth declined to sit for an interview with the Pentagon’s inspector general but provided a written statement, that person said. The defense secretary asserted that he was permitted to declassify information as he saw fit and only communicated details he thought would not endanger the mission.
The initial findings ramp up the pressure on the former Fox News Channel host after lawmakers had called for the independent inquiry into his use of the commercially available app. Lawmakers also just opened investigations into a news report that a follow-up strike on an alleged drug-smuggling boat in the Caribbean Sea in September killed survivors after Hegseth issued a verbal order to “kill everybody.”
Hegseth defended the strike as emerging in the “fog of war,” saying he didn’t see any survivors but also “didn’t stick around” for the rest of the mission and that the admiral in charge “made the right call” in ordering the second strike. He also did not admit fault following the Signal revelations, asserting that the information was unclassified.
“The Inspector General review is a TOTAL exoneration of Secretary Hegseth and proves what we knew all along — no classified information was shared,” Sean Parnell, the Pentagon’s chief spokesman said in a statement. “This matter is resolved, and the case is closed.”
Journalist added to a chat where sensitive plans were shared
In at least two separate Signal chats, Hegseth provided the exact timings of warplane launches and when bombs would drop — before the men and women carrying out those attacks on behalf of the United States were airborne.
Hegseth’s use of the app came to light when a journalist, Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic, was inadvertently added to a Signal text chain by then-national security adviser Mike Waltz. It included Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and others, brought together to discuss March 15 military operations against the Iran-backed Houthis.
Hegseth had created another Signal chat with 13 people that included his wife and brother where he shared similar details of the same strike, The Associated Press reported.
Signal is encrypted but is not authorized for carrying classified information and is not part of the Pentagon’s secure communications network.
Hegseth previously has said none of the information shared in the chats was classified. Multiple current and former military officials have told the AP there was no way details with that specificity, especially before a strike took place, would have been OK to share on an unsecured device.
The review was delivered to lawmakers, who were able to review the report in a classified facility at the Capitol. A partially redacted version of the report was expected to be released publicly later this week.
Hegseth said he viewed the investigation as a partisan exercise and did not trust the inspector general, according to one of the people familiar with the report’s findings. The review had to rely on screenshots of the Signal chat published by the Atlantic because Hegseth could not provide more than a small handful of his Signal messages, the person said.
When asked about the investigation in August, Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson told reporters that “we believe that this is a witch hunt and a total sham and being conducted in bad faith.”
Lawmakers called for inspector general to investigate
The revelations sparked intense scrutiny, with Democratic lawmakers and a small number of Republicans saying Hegseth posting the information to the Signal chats before the military jets had reached their targets potentially put those pilots’ lives at risk. They said lower-ranking members of the military would have been fired for such a lapse.
The inspector general opened its investigation into Hegseth at the request of the Armed Services Chairman Wicker and Reed.
“This chat was alleged to have included classified information pertaining to sensitive military actions in Yemen,” Wicker and Reed’s letter said. “If true, this reporting raises questions as to the use of unclassified networks to discuss sensitive and classified information, as well as the sharing of such information with those who do not have proper clearance and need to know.”
Some veterans and military families also raised concerns, citing the strict security protocols they must follow to protect sensitive information.
It all ties back to the campaign against Yemen’s Houthis
The Houthi rebels had started launching missile and drone attacks against commercial and military ships in late 2023 in what their leadership had described as an effort to end Israel’s offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Their campaign greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it annually.
The U.S.-led campaign against the Houthis in 2024 turned into the most intense running sea battle the Navy had faced since World War II.
A ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war had begun in January before falling apart in March. The U.S. then launched a broad assault against the Houthis that ended weeks later when Trump said they pledged to stop attacking ships. The latest Gaza ceasefire began in October.
Following the disclosure of Hegseth’s Signal chat that included the Atlantic’s editor, the magazine released the entire thread in late March. Hegseth had posted multiple details about an impending strike, using military language and laying out when a “strike window” starts, where a “target terrorist” was located, the time elements around the attack and when various weapons and aircraft would be used in the strike. He mentioned that the U.S. was “currently clean” on operational security.
Hegseth told Fox News Channel in April that what he shared over Signal was “informal, unclassified coordinations, for media coordinations and other things.”
During a congressional hearing in June, Hegseth was pressed multiple times by lawmakers over whether he shared classified information and if he should face accountability if he did.
Rep. Seth Moulton, a Massachusetts Democrat and Marine veteran, asked Hegseth whether he would hold himself accountable if the inspector general found that he placed classified information on Signal.
Hegseth would not directly say, only noting that he serves “at the pleasure of the president.”

The Student Compensation and Opportunity through Rights and Endorsements, or ‘‘SCORE” Act, would bar student-athletes from being recognized as employees and provide broad antitrust immunity to the NCAA and college sports conferences. 
The measure was on the House schedule for Wednesday, before the office of Majority Whip Tom Emmer announced Wednesday afternoon its consideration would be postponed. The notice did not provide a reason for the cancellation, as is typical. 
The bill’s lead sponsors are GOP Rep. Gus Bilirakis of Florida and Democratic Reps. Janelle Bynum of Oregon and Shomari Figures of Alabama.
The other original co-sponsors are all Republicans: House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Brett Guthrie of Kentucky, Education and Workforce Committee Chair Tim Walberg of Michigan, and Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Lisa McClain of Michigan, Scott Fitzgerald of Wisconsin and Russell Fry of South Carolina.
Bipartisan opposition
The bill has faced widespread Democratic opposition over concerns it would roll back student-athletes’ rights and give “unchecked authority” to the NCAA while failing to protect student-athletes. 
Though the bill has garnered broad GOP support, some in the party have pushed back against it. House GOP critics include Texas’ Chip Roy, who dubbed the bill a “Band-Aid on a gunshot wound” during a House Rules Committee hearing Monday. 
Roy, along with fellow House Freedom Caucus members, Byron Donalds of Florida and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, joined Democrats in voting against the rule governing floor debate alongside several other measures Tuesday. The rule was still adopted, 210-209. 
The bill advanced in July out of the House Energy and Commerce and Education and Workforce committees, which have jurisdiction over elements of the bill.
The college sports world has grappled with the fallout from the NCAA’s 2021 guidelines, which let student-athletes profit from their name, image and likeness, or NIL. A patchwork of NIL laws exists across states, with no federal NIL law in place. 
In June, a federal judge approved the terms of a nearly $2.8 billion antitrust settlement that paved the way for schools to directly pay athletes. 
Senate Dems’ competing bill
Meanwhile, the bill would face a tough path in the Senate, where Democrats have expressed opposition. 
Democratic Sens. Maria Cantwell of Washington state, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut introduced competing NIL-related legislation in September. 
Known as the Student Athlete Fairness and Enforcement Act, or “SAFE Act,” the bill “gives all athletes Name, Image and Likeness (NIL) rights, establishes uniform health and safety standards, protects scholarships and requires agents to register with a state and abide by clear contract requirements, including a 5 percent cap on fees,” according to Democrats on the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, where Cantwell serves as ranking member.

The Missouri Right to Education Initiative challenged the ballot language as “deceptive and prejudicial” in August, pointing to two bullet points it says draws conclusions that are not in the text of the amendment.
The proposed amendment seeks to add 23 words to the state’s constitution, making education a “fundamental right” and putting a duty on the state to provide “adequate, thorough, and uniform high quality free public schools.”

Hoskins’ summary says the amendment would “potentially eliminate existing state scholarship programs that provide direct aid to students with disabilities and low-income families” and “prevent the state from supporting educational choices other than free public schools.”
Cole County Circuit Court Judge Christopher Limbaugh ruled the descriptors are insufficient and unfair, saying that they go beyond the “legal and probable effects” of the amendment. The word “potentially,” Limbaugh wrote, reveals that the likelihood of scholarship programs being eliminated is less than probable.
“The elimination of certain scholarships would only occur as the result of future litigation,” Limbaugh wrote in his ruling. “This court can’t possibly predetermine the result of that future litigation.”
Limbaugh also took issue with the characterization that the amendment would prevent the state from supporting other educational options.
The ruling sends the summary back for Hoskins to rewrite by Dec. 8.
The Missouri Right to Education Initiative focuses on public education funding on its website, not commenting on education formats other than traditional public schools.
“Only public schools guarantee that all students are provided education, regardless of financial status or ability,” said Spencer Toder, the campaign’s treasurer, said in a press release Wednesday. “When passed, we will finally be able to hold the state accountable and ensure that every child in Missouri has access to a public school with the necessary resources for them to thrive.”
A separate campaign, filed in August by an attorney with the public education law firm EdCounsel, also challenged the Secretary of State’s summary of its proposed amendment. In that case, Hoskins’ ballot language was affirmed apart from a “drafting error” that was sent back for correction.
A spokesperson for the secretary of state’s office would not comment on “pending litigation.”

But he said the $1,000 accounts for babies that Congress approved this month were poorly designed and will benefit the wealthy. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)  Worries about the declining U.S. fertility rate are overblown, UNC family demographer Karen Guzzo told an audience gathered in Carrboro on Tuesday.  
The U.S. fertility rate reached a new low of 1.6 children per woman last year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. That’s below the 2.1 children per woman needed to maintain a stable population. 
But Guzzo, director of Carolina Population Center, says the fertility rate doesn’t tell the whole story. And the solutions offered by the “pronatalist” movement won’t solve the perceived problem, she said.
 Pronatalism is a largely conservative movement aimed at convincing American women to have more children, often through the use of government policy. 
Guzzo is a family demographer who has been interviewed on Fresh Air, the USA Today podcast The Excerpt, and Radio New Zealand.  She spoke in Tuesday’s installment of Carolina Science Cafe, a series where experts discuss topics in the news. 
The decline in the national birth rate is driven largely by the drop in birth rates for teenagers and women in their early 20s, years when a majority of pregnancies are unintended. 
“We spent hundreds of millions of dollars trying to tell people not to have kids when they’re young, when they are unmarried, when they don’t have a good job, when they’re not in a stable partnership,” Guzzo said. “So this is a good news story.”
Karen Guzzo, director of the Carolina Population Center at UNC. (Photo courtesy of UNC-Chapel Hill)
Birth rates aren’t high enough among older women to offset the dramatic drop among younger women. But surveys of women who have completed their childbearing years find that they had two children, she said.
Low birth rates have consequences for the labor market and the social safety net. 
The U.S. population is growing, but much of that growth is coming from immigration. Back in January, the Brookings Institution reported the U.S. population grew nearly 1% between 2023 and 2024, with immigrants responsible for most of the gains. 
In the last year, President Trump has embarked on an aggressive mass deportation agenda that has had federal agents sweeping through major cities such as Chicago and Los Angeles, and less populous locations, including Charlotte and the Triangle in North Carolina. 
To immediately address the consequences of low fertility rates, the country could welcome immigration to address labor shortages, Guzzo said. 
Worries about the solvency of the Social Security system because of declining birth rates could be addressed by increasing or eliminating the cap on Social Security taxes, she said. Wages above $176,100 aren’t taxed. The cap rises to adjust for inflation every year. 
Meantime, the Trump administration has advanced pronatalist policies, like “Trump Accounts” that will be available to some U.S. citizens born between Jan. 1, 2025 and Dec. 31, 2028,
The accounts will start with $1,000 contribution from the federal government. Families and companies will be able to contribute to them. However, the money can’t be withdrawn before children turn 18. After that, IRA rules will cover withdrawals. 
At the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, nearly everyone in the office that administers the Title X family planning program, which finances birth control for low-income women, has been laid off. The Heritage Foundation, a right-leaning policy institute, has proposed redirecting those funds toward treating infertility instead.
There’s also increasing interest in the MAHA movement in encouraging family planning that rejects hormonal birth control. Casey Means, Trump’s surgeon general nominee, is critical of hormonal birth control. 
Guzzo said these proposals aren’t likely to make much difference in the national birth rate. 
These policies are envisioned for straight, married couples, Guzzo said. Underlying many of them is a desired return to rigid gender roles, she said, and “this nostalgic, never quite real, version of the 1950s.”
Guzzo added that proposals like “Trump accounts” aren’t likely to spur couples in 2025 to have more children, either.
“This is essentially an IRA for newborns,” Guzzo said. “That’s fine. Who doesn’t like free money? But it’s not money that’s going to help with the new expenses that happen when you have a baby.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/mother-baby_brandon-bell_getty-images_0-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-04 11:00:58.895713

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The federal government research organization that has been devoted for half a century to renewable energy development has had the word “renewable” stripped from its name.
The Trump administration, which broadly opposes renewable energy projects, changed the name of the Colorado-based National Renewable Energy Laboratory to “National Laboratory of the Rockies.”
The U.S. Department of Energy announced the name change on Monday, effective immediately.
“The energy crisis we face today is unlike the crisis that gave rise to NREL,” Assistant Secretary of Energy Audrey Robertson said in a statement. “We are no longer picking and choosing energy sources. Our highest priority is to invest in the scientific capabilities that will restore American manufacturing, drive down costs, and help this country meet its soaring energy demand. The National Laboratory of the Rockies will play a vital role in those efforts.”
NREL has a prominent presence in Alaska. The agency in 2020 joined into a partnership with the Cold Climate Housing Research Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. The UAF facility is one of four NREL centers; two campuses are in Colorado and there is an office in Washington, D.C.
Jud Virden, the laboratory’s director, said the new name “embraces a broader applied energy mission entrusted to us by the Department of Energy to deliver a more affordable and secure energy future for all,” according to the statement.
However, the name change is a troubling sign to one Alaska organization involved in projects promoting renewable energy and energy affordability.
“Removing ‘Renewable’ and ‘Energy’ from NREL’s name raises concerns. Renewables are key to affordable, secure energy and deliver long-term economic benefits, especially for rural communities,” Bridget Shaughnessy Smith, communications director for the Alaska Public Interest Research Group, a non-profit consumer advocacy group, said by email.
“While it’s not yet clear if this name change signals a broad mission shift, any refocus cannot come at the expense of renewable energy or by prioritizing already well-funded fossil fuel industries. Remote microgrid communities in Alaska are working with NREL to innovate toward affordable, reliable energy, and this name change must not disrupt that critical work,” Shaughnessy Smith continued.
NREL’s history started in 1974, when the organization was established as the Solar Energy Research Institute. In 1991, President George H.W. Bush elevated it to national lab status and changed the name to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
The Cold Climate Housing Research Center was established in 1999 with a mission of improving housing and building conditions in Alaska’s extreme climate. The center has focused on renewable energy, along with energy efficiency, structural integrity for buildings on permafrost, indoor air quality and designs that are sustainable in the far north. The center headquarters is the world’s farthest-north building with a platinum rating, the highest possible, bestowed by the U.S. Green Building Council Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design.
The NREL-Cold Climate Housing Research Center partnership has participated in numerous recent energy and environmental innovations, including the development of non-plastic housing insulation made from a fungi-wood pulp blend.
The NREL name change adds to a list of government agencies and geographic sites changed by the Trump administration this year to align with the president’s agenda.
On the day he was inaugurated for his second term, President Trump issued an executive order directing that the Gulf of Mexico be renamed “Gulf of America” and that Denali, North America’s tallest peak, revert to its previous federal name, Mount McKinley.
The Denali name comes from the traditional name for the Alaska peak used by the Koyukon people, the region’s Indigenous residents. The name, which translates to “the high one,” has been the official state of Alaska name since the 1970s. The McKinley name, for former president and Ohioan William McKinley, has been widely panned in Alaska, and state lawmakers passed a resolution asking for the Denali name to be restored for federal government use.
In September, Trump issued an executive order directing that the U.S Department of Defense be renamed “Department of War.” That resurrected a department name that was dropped in 1947.

The survey, released Thursday, also finds political anxiety barely moved over the last six months, even as partisans remain deeply split in how they view public institutions and national politics.
“Mail voting in Virginia isn’t going anywhere, at least in the near term, which seems to be fine with most Virginians,” said Harry Wilson, interim director for the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research at Roanoke College. “They are also happy to have a photo ID requirement, though it isn’t clear how that squares with mail voting.”
Large majorities of Virginians support requiring a government-issued photo ID (82%), automatically registering eligible citizens (66%) and allowing any voter to cast a ballot by mail (65%). Views on “ballot harvesting,” which allows a person to collect and submit the completed ballots of others, remain mixed: A small majority (53%) opposes banning the practice, while 43% support a ban.
More respondents say absentee ballots increase turnout and make elections more accurate (55%) than say they lead to falsified or miscounted ballots (42%).
 Trump and Youngkin ratings

The poll shows Virginia residents continue to give low marks to President Donald Trump. His job disapproval rating rose to 63% — higher than in the October survey — and his favorability rating declined seven points, though it remains close to typical levels recorded in past Roanoke College polling.
Asked how best to describe Trump, the plurality selected “criminal” (30%), followed by “leader” (23%), “disruptor” (18%), “fascist” (16%) and “visionary” (11%). Those views split sharply along party lines.
“Democrats and Republicans continue to view things, almost everything, through a different lens,” Wilson said. “Their levels of political anxiety and descriptions of Trump remain relatively steady if vastly different.”
Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s numbers remain steady. Just weeks before he is set to leave office, his job approval stands at 54%, roughly in line with his average throughout his term. His favorability rating (50% favorable, 40% unfavorable) is also largely unchanged from August.
Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger enters office with the strongest showing of the three, recording a 56% favorable rating — her highest mark in the Roanoke poll — and 33% unfavorable.
 Partisan divides and the political climate

A majority of Virginians say they trust the federal government to do what is right only sometimes (56%) or never (25%). Yet 58% believe ordinary citizens can influence Washington. Most (59%) say their side has been losing more than winning on important issues.
Nearly half of respondents (49%) say they are dissatisfied with how the federal government is working, while 27% say they are angry — the highest combined level of discontent since 2017, though only slightly above the May measurement. 
A majority (53%) believes the country’s best years are behind it; 44% say the best years lie ahead. And 61% say the federal government makes their life worse, compared with 35% who say it makes their life better.
The poll’s political anxiety index stands at 81.26, down eight points since May — a small shift that masks wide partisan gaps.
Democratic anxiety rose dramatically from May 2024 (-10.39) to November 2024 (101.77) and now sits at 155.42, nearly identical to where it stood in May 2025 (153.36). 
Republican anxiety followed the opposite arc last year, falling from 166.59 in May 2024 to 13.52 in November 2024, and has remained steady this year (-30.10 in May and -34.13 in November).
The index continues to track closely with which party controls the White House and Congress.
 Trust in polling and the media

A small majority of Virginians (54%) say they trust the polling industry a great deal (10%) or some (44%). But skepticism remains, as 30% trust pollsters “not very much,” and 14% don’t trust them at all. A majority (56%) believes pollsters slant their results to fit their own views, while 40% believe pollsters try to measure opinions accurately.
A plurality of respondents has limited (40%) or no (23%) trust that the media report the news fully, accurately and fairly — nearly identical to results in November 2024. 
Wilson pushed back on assumptions about partisan or ideological slant.
“Lastly, while some (or even many) of you may not believe it, all reputable pollsters attempt to measure opinion accurately and don’t slant the results to fit our views,” he said. 
Three-fourths of Virginians (74%) say the country is on the wrong track — the most negative view in two years — while half (50%) say the commonwealth is moving in the right direction, roughly unchanged since August.
The Roanoke College Poll was conducted by IPOR between Nov. 9 and Nov. 14, 2025. The 819 interviews included random telephone calls and texts to 450 Virginians and 369 responses drawn from a proprietary online panel. 
The survey’s weighted margin of error is 5.25%.

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A Kansas accountant stole $400,000 from his family, transferred it to a fake ranch, then used the funds to pay for construction of his new home.
Quintin Flanagin was a certified public accountant in northwestern Kansas, and his family members were clients at his firm. In January 2022, Flanagin added Middle Finger Ranch to one of his personal banking accounts, according to federal court documents.
That January, he began an 8-month scheme, funneling money through checks and wire transfers into the Middle Finger Ranch, swindling more than $400,000. He wrote six checks, many of which contained false memo lines attributing the stolen money to farm operations, the court documents said.
When Flanagin’s family discovered discrepancies in their accounts, he created fabricated flow charts and blamed others for the fraudulent checks, said federal prosecutor Ryan Kriegshauser in a news release from the Kansas district’s U.S. Attorney’s Office.
“The name of Mr. Flanagin’s fictitious ranch speaks for itself,” Kriegshauser said. “After stabbing his family in the back, Flanagin lied to their faces.”
A grand jury indicted the 45-year-old Colby resident in June 2024 after investigations by the Kansas Bureau of Investigation and the FBI. He pleaded guilty earlier this year to one count each of wire fraud, bank fraud, false statements and money laundering. He was sentenced Wednesday to four years in federal prison.
“In his hubris, Flanagin thought he could outsmart federal investigators and forensic accountants,” Kriegshauser said. “He was wrong.”
Stephen Cyrus, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Kansas City Field Office, said Flanagin’s sentencing reflects the severity of the case and how seriously the FBI takes financial fraud.
“Mr. Flanagin was entrusted with a fiduciary duty to protect the financial interests of the victims in this case,” Cyrus said. “Instead of acting with integrity and in the interest of his clients, the defendant used his position to personally benefit from the scheme.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/P7251374-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-04 09:56:38.171520
,Mississippi Today,2025-12-04 14:30:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,A new bold plan aims to help more Jackson third graders read on grade level,Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/04/jps-third-grade-reading-plan/,A new Jackson Public Schools initiative aims to help more third graders improve their reading skills.,"Michael Cormack felt like he’d been punched in the stomach. 
In May, Jackson Public Schools’ deputy superintendent was at his desk in the district’s central office, with the most recent third grade reading test results spread in front of him. As he thumbed through the papers, which showed that just over half of the students tested passed the state assessment on the first try, the knot in his stomach grew. 
He realized he had to do something — immediately. Within weeks, Project 75 was born. 
Project 75 is a reading initiative with an ambitious goal: to boost the percentage of third graders in JPS who pass the state assessment on the first attempt from 55% to 75%. Cormack presented his plan for Project 75 to the school board in August, but the initiative kicked off in earnest in mid-November. 
It’s a bold leap, but based on the data about students’ ultimate success rate, Cormack believes it’s possible. 
In 2013, state lawmakers passed the Literacy-Based Promotion Act aimed at increasing reading proficiency. The legislation put a historic amount of money and resources toward the goal and established a third grade reading “gate.” To get promoted to fourth grade, students have three tries to pass, or score 3 out of 5 or higher, on the reading portion of the state English Language Arts assessment.
Students have increasing success with each attempt. This past year, about 70% of JPS third graders ultimately scored high enough to move to the next grade, 15 points lower than the statewide average. 
“What that indicates to me is that there is some latent knowledge that scholars activate, and there’s a level of seriousness and intensity once we get the initial scores back,” Cormack said. “But what we want to do is to tap into those energies early to ensure that out the gate, the performance is strong.”
Largely thanks to the literacy act, the percentage of Mississippi’s fourth graders scoring advanced or proficient on the National Assessment of Education Progress has steadily grown, going from last in the country to ninth. But a closer look at the data reveals districts that still struggle, including Jackson. 
Cormack, whose background includes K-12 teaching and leading the Barksdale Reading Institute, reviewed hundreds of files for every student who failed the state reading test last year. The documents arrived by milk crate this spring, after being reviewed by school-level administrators.

What he found was, in many cases, students were not getting the targeted support they needed. 
At the start of each school year, JPS teachers assess students to identify their strengths and weaknesses. That test helps teachers determine students’ specific instructional needs to improve their weakest academic areas. 
However, in practice, that tailored instruction wasn’t always happening. 
“We know exactly where our students need help,” Cormack said. “So why can’t we do it?”
Project 75 aims to close those gaps by giving students targeted, tiered, thorough support. The plan involves seven strategies that center around data, district-wide coordination, professional development, monitoring and focused student learning.
Some action items include scheduling standing meetings with school leaders and staff to review data and adjust teaching, tracking student progress, offering more professional development for teachers on the science of reading and assigning struggling students to the district’s most successful teachers. 
Project 75 also includes an afterschool component for second graders and third graders who need extra help.
LaRoy Merrick, principal of Walton Elementary School, said some parts of the plan were already being implemented ahead of the fall start date. Early in the year, for example, school leaders identified their students who struggle the most with reading, grouped them together and ensured they received one-on-one help from a reading interventionist in a small setting.
Merrick also realized that his special education teachers — whose students are in the school’s bottom 25% of readers — needed to learn how to teach reading, so he sent them for training.
In preparing for the Project 75 kickoff, Galloway Elementary staff reviewed absenteeism rates, discovering that some of their least proficient readers were also regularly missing school, Principal Natasha Simmons said. 
Simmons said she’s impressed upon her staff the importance of the goal in front of them. 
“They’re going to have to do an obsessive amount of reading to pass that test,” Simmons said. “So we’re attacking this in a number of ways.”
The stakes are high. Research shows that reading is fundamental to academic success throughout schooling, which correlates with career success, financial security and better health outcomes. 
“It can create a snowball effect,” Cormack said of reading. “When scholars are retained, we also know they enter a higher risk category for not successfully graduating high school. That’s not a reality that we want to live with, so we know the urgency of getting this right.”
The initial impact of Project 75 won’t be revealed for months, until the third graders take the state reading test in May. But if the district falls short, Cormack is sure of one thing. 
They’ll keep trying.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/07060702/school-bus-1-scaled.jpg,,,2025-12-04 09:56:38.171520
,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-12-04 14:21:47+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,AG’s suit against Meta hits the SJC,Jennifer Smith,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/courts/ags-suit-against-meta-hits-the-sjc/,"The case, scheduled for oral argument Friday morning, puts Massachusetts at the center of a debate over Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects internet companies from lawsuits over user-generated content.","TWO YEARS AGO, Attorney General Andrea Campbell took Meta – Mark Zuckerberg’s monolith that owns Facebook and Instagram – to court over claims that its platform designs and features exploit children and keep them hooked on addictive content. On Friday, the Supreme Judicial Court will be the first state high court in the nation to consider whether those platform designs are shielded by a law protecting publishers from being sued over the content of their websites.
The case, scheduled for oral argument Friday morning, puts Massachusetts at the center of a debate over Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The court will consider whether the 1996 federal law that protects internet companies from lawsuits over user-generated content extends to claims about platform design.
Campbell filed the lawsuit in Suffolk Superior Court in October 2023, joining a bipartisan coalition of 42 attorneys general who sued Meta in an array of federal and state courts. The Massachusetts complaint alleges that Meta violated state consumer protection law and created a public nuisance by deliberately designing Instagram with features like infinite scroll, autoplay, push notifications, and “like” buttons to addict young users, then falsely represented the platform’s safety to the public. The company has also been reckless with age verification, the AG argues, and allowed children under 13 years old to access its content. 
Suffolk Superior Court Judge Peter Krupp denied Meta’s motion to dismiss the case in October 2024, writing, Meta’s statements about its safety “are belied by its internal data showing that Instagram addicts and harms children. Meta had repeatedly deprioritized youth well-being to increase revenue.” 
The case is before the high court because Meta wants to challenge Krupp’s ruling that it was not entitled to immunity – a procedural move that bumped the case up to the SJC even though the lower court has not decided its merits.  The state’s complaint relies heavily on Meta’s own internal research, which allegedly showed the company understood Instagram’s features were harming teenagers but concealed this knowledge to maximize profits. According to Campbell’s lawsuit, Meta secretly utilizes design features that “deliberately exploit and capitalize off young users’ unique vulnerabilities” and overcome their ability to self-regulate time on the platform.  The complaint alleges that young Massachusetts users are induced into using Instagram for multiple hours a day, often instead of homework or sleep, in an addictive manner they cannot self-regulate.  Research cited in the lawsuit shows that for adolescents, mental health steeply declines after one hour of daily social media use. As hundreds of thousands of Massachusetts teenagers actively use Instagram, the lawsuit alleges the website’s practices have burdened Massachusetts school systems and added to health care expenditures.   
“This addiction, according to Meta’s own data, has caused widespread mental and physical harm to children,” the AG’s office wrote. “The Commonwealth has been left to grapple with the extent of that harm.”  Meta argues that Section 230 bars the entire case. The law states that “no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.” Courts have broadly interpreted this to protect websites from lawsuits over content posted by users.  In its filings, Meta argues that its products are fundamentally based on third-party content.  For that reason, the company says, its platform features and design cannot, on their own, be held responsible for any problematic behavior related to use of the platforms.   
Simply put, it wrote, “if there were no videos to play, there would be no ‘autoplay.’ Nor does the Complaint allege how users would be addicted to Instagram if there was no content on the service. Regardless of Meta’s publishing choices, if Instagram had no content, and instead displayed a blank screen upon loading, no one would use it, nor could possibly claim that they were addicted to the service.” 
Meta’s argument extends beyond user content. The company contends that Section 230 also protects its editorial choices about how to organize and present that content, including through design features like notifications, infinite scroll, and autoplay. Meta further argues the First Amendment bars claims targeting its content moderation policies and algorithms.  Judge Krupp rejected these arguments. The issue at hand included false statements that Meta made about their safety, he said, which would not be the type of content protected by Section 230. The design and moderation choices are also fair game, Krupp said, because the state “is principally seeking to hold Meta liable for its own business conduct,” not content posted by third parties.  “The Commonwealth alleges that Instagram’s features in and of themselves, regardless of their associated content, cause its young users to become addicted to the platform,” Krupp wrote.  Meta appealed to the SJC, challenging the denial of its Section 230 defense.  
“The evidence will demonstrate our commitment to supporting young people,” a Meta spokesperson wrote after the ruling. The company recently announced new “Teen Accounts” on Instagram, a protected experience that automatically limits who can contact teens and the content they see.  Justices on Friday will consider two questions, the first of which is whether the high court should be considering the appeal at all. A legal doctrine allows parties to appeal if they are denied immunity they think they are entitled to by law, so the question that the SJC will consider for the first time is whether Section 230 creates an immunity from suit and therefore whether Meta can appeal the lower court’s denial to bring the question before the SJC. 
But the philosophical meat of the suit is whether Meta is actually immune from the consumer protection and public nuisance lawsuits because of Section 230.   The case has attracted significant attention from free speech advocates. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) and TechFreedom both filed amicus briefs urging the court to reverse Krupp’s ruling and affirm Meta’s immunity from lawsuits over the design of its platforms.  
Campbell’s argument is part of a long history of panic over unfettered speech, argued FIRE in its brief. People can make choices about how they want to consume their entertainment and information, they note, and young people are no more at risk of being overwhelmed by the style of social media than literary figures of old were by books. 
“The Commonwealth is concerned that the speech is too powerful,” it wrote. “They think minors are like Don Quixote, transfixed by stories and ideas. This problem, however—if it’s a problem—is not for the Commonwealth to fix. Under the First Amendment, the strong effects of speech are an inherent part of speech—not a ground for regulation.”  
Law professors Jane Bambauer and Eugene Volokh argued in an amicus brief that social media platforms create expressive products and their features “stem from constitutionally protected decisions about where, when, and how speech is communicated.”
Campbell’s office argues that Meta’s attempt to distinguish between content moderation and design features creates a false distinction. The state contends that, just as Meta may curate posts through content moderation policies, it may approve of and encourage speech through design features that are separate from the third-party content itself. 
Campbell argues that “by designing and using addictive design features on Instagram to exploit children’s psychological vulnerabilities,” Meta falsely represented that its features were not addictive and in fact prioritized youth health and safety.  The Massachusetts case is one of several challenging Section 230’s reach.  
In October 2024, US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, overseeing multidistrict litigation in California involving more than 30 states, rejected Meta’s motion to dismiss similar claims. However, no state supreme court has yet ruled on whether Section 230 shields social media companies from lawsuits targeting platform design.  Massachusetts is part of a bipartisan effort led by Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser and Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti. Thirty-three states joined the federal lawsuit, while nine states, including Massachusetts, filed in their own state courts. 
In an amicus brief filed in the Massachusetts case, the coalition of attorneys general wrote that Meta’s attempts to ask higher courts to wade in on the immunity question “and expand the scope of Section 230 have the potential to sow confusion among the courts.” They noted that Meta has universally lost, in part or in full, in its motions to dismiss based on the publishers’ immunity.  As Campbell put it in announcing the lawsuit in October 2023, “based on its own internal research, Meta knew of the significant harm these practices caused to teenage users and chose to hide its knowledge and mislead the public to make a profit.”  The SJC’s ruling could determine whether that alleged knowledge and those choices are subject to state consumer protection laws, or whether Section 230 places them beyond the reach of state enforcement.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pemberton.johnadamscourthousejpg-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C641&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-04 09:56:38.171520

On Friday, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court will hear arguments in a pivotal one, centered on whether the Commonwealth can continue to pursue its case against Meta, the tech giant that owns Facebook and Instagram.  
Attorney General Andrea Campbell has accused Meta of designing their platforms to be addictive for minors, while falsely representing to the public that they prioritized youth health and safety. Meta is hoping to escape the lawsuit not by defending itself on the merits, but by arguing that a federal law known as Section 230 means that the company should be pre-emptively immune from legal challenges over how it designs its platforms. 
How to hold social media companies accountable for their effects on our children, health, and safety continues to be hotly debated, while the companies themselves argue they bear no responsibility whatsoever for what happens on their platforms.  
Over the last few years, state attorneys general and private litigators across the country have been prosecuting a set of these cases against Meta. One of the lawsuits recently revealed a trove of internal documents that depict Meta’s corporate culture as one of callous disregard for the health and safety of our children. 
Section 230 says that courts cannot treat tech companies as the “publisher” of user-generated content. Ever since the law was passed in the 1990s, tech companies have tried to convince courts that Section 230 immunizes them from liability for any activity that can be characterized as “publishing”—which, the companies argue, encompasses almost everything they do.  
The companies have met with varying degrees of success. But with the advent of sophisticated, highly designed platforms like Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok, courts have increasingly rejected Big Tech’s characterization of Section 230 as a broad immunity shield. 
And for good reason. As we explained in an amicus brief we filed in the Supreme Judicial Court with various non-profits and legal scholars, Congress didn’t intend Section 230 to be a catch-all, get-out-of-jail free card for Big Tech. It was meant to serve the limited but important purpose of preventing companies that host user-generated content online from facing unlimited liability for harm caused by that content—particularly when that liability is tied to a company’s choice to moderate the content on their platforms.  
If companies had to ensure that their platforms were completely free from any content that could carry legal liability, they would be forced to either abandon content moderation, extensively monitor and censor user speech, or stop hosting user-generated content altogether, creating what we refer to as “the moderator’s dilemma.” All of these choices are bad for the online speech environment, which is why Section 230 prohibits forcing companies into the dilemma.  
Holding Meta—and other tech companies—accountable for designing their platforms to be addictive for kids does not force Meta into the moderator’s dilemma. Our brief explains how the platform features at the heart of the Commonwealth’s case—things like infinite scroll, autoplay, the timing and batching of push notifications, and other tactics borrowed from the gambling industry—have nothing to do with content moderation; they are designed to elicit a behavior on the part of the user that furthers the company’s own business goals.  
You don’t have to take our word for it. We examined companies’ patents, describing in their own words these goals—such as extended use or increased return visits—that are independent of the user-generated content displayed. We also detailed how Meta could choose alternative designs that mitigate the harm to kids without touching any user-generated content. 
In short, applying Section 230 in this case would not protect online speech at all. The only effect would be to further incentivize Meta to disregard user safety as it designs its products to maximize profits.  
Section 230 serves an important purpose. But that purpose is not served by applying it in this case. Not giving Meta Section 230 protections won’t break the internet. It won’t even mean that Meta is automatically liable. All it would mean is that the victims of real harm that might have been facilitated by an online company’s own design choices would have their day in court, something they deserve to have.

From CalMatters economy reporter Levi Sumagaysay:
California, whose unemployment rate has been at 5% and above for the past couple of years, is likely to see a weak job market through at least early next year, according to the winter UCLA Anderson forecast published this week. 
Authors of the longtime economic forecast cited continued uncertainty around tariffs, deportations and federal funding as factors.
Based on year-over-year data through August, the economists said weak or declining jobs growth affected construction, nondurable goods manufacturing, retail, and leisure and hospitality. Business services jobs, which include professionals in the tech industry, lawyers, accountants and architects, fell in the following major regions: Silicon Valley, San Joaquin Valley, Sacramento and the Delta, San Diego and the Inland Empire. 
The sectors that showed job growth in the past year — state and local government, education, health care and social services, and farms — could shrink in 2026 because of budget constraints, federal funding cuts or deportations, the economists said. 
Possible bright spots include aerospace and artificial intelligence. But “for the California economy to grow faster than the U.S. economy, as it is accustomed to doing, durable goods manufacturing, including aerospace and technology-laden sectors, will have to rebound strongly,” the economists wrote. They added that the state and nation have seen a decline in manufacturing jobs, and “the timing of a turnaround in this sector remains uncertain.”
Based on what happened after mass deportations from 2008 to 2014, the forecast’s authors said they expect continued deportations to have a negative effect on the California economy both in terms of decreased local consumption and a drop in other employment. That’s because jobs of immigrants lacking permanent legal status and those of U.S.-born workers can be complementary. 
“For example, home building could be delayed because of a reduction in skilled roofers,” the economists wrote.

Reporting unlawful federal conduct to CA

Californians who witness potentially unlawful conduct by federal agents can report what they saw to the state via a new online portal unveiled Wednesday.
As President Donald Trump’s administration continues its crackdown on immigrants — at times deploying plain-clothes, masked federal immigration enforcement agents — California Attorney General Rob Bonta is urging residents to report “excessive force, unnecessary detentions and unconstitutional searches.”

Bonta, at a press conference: “Over the last 10 months we’ve seen troubling reports coming from communities across California, including unmarked, military-style vehicles and individuals detained in ways that resemble abductions and kidnappings more than lawful arrests. Californians are scared and they’re right to question whether federal agents are respecting the law.” 

Bonta added that while reporting an incident helps the state “monitor and address” potential misconduct, it will not prompt any particular or immediate response from state authorities. 
More on CA and Trump: On Tuesday Bonta said that California, along with 21 other states, secured a preliminary injunction to block the Trump administration from refusing Medicaid reimbursements to Planned Parenthood. 
In the ruling, the federal judge sided with the states’ arguments that Trump’s policy change was an unconstitutional “retroactive condition that … could not have anticipated when (states) joined Medicaid,” and that the costs to states to comply with the policy “constitute an irreparable harm.” The ruling provided the Trump administration seven days to file and appeal.



CA fights for permanent housing funding

California, Santa Clara County and the city of San Francisco are suing the Trump administration over policy changes it issued last month, which shifts federal homelessness funds in a way that decreases money for permanent housing, writes CalMatters’ Marisa Kendall.
The lawsuits argue that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development illegally bypassed Congress’ authority when it enacted new rules prohibiting jurisdictions that are applying for a piece of a $4-billion federal homelessness fund from spending more than 30% of their grant on permanent housing.
Most experts agree that permanent housing is one of the most effective ways to solve homelessness. Last year, California communities won more than $683 million in federal homelessness funds, 90% of which went toward permanent housing projects. Those projects currently house tens of thousands of people, who may become homeless again due to the rule change, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office. 
HUD Secretary Scott Turner in a statement last month said the changes are aimed at “stopping the Biden-era slush fund that fueled the homelessness crisis … and incentivized never-ending government dependency.” 
This is the 47th lawsuit California filed against the second Trump administration.

CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: California’s poorly performing public school system lacks accountability because its governing structure includes overlapping bits of authority that undermine cohesiveness. 
The idea that California can be powered solely by solar, wind and hydro is unrealistic, and in order to really meet its climate goals the state needs nuclear power, writes Leonard Rodberg, professor emeritus of Urban Studies at Queens College, City University of New York.

Amnesty International, a humanitarian group spanning 150 countries, alleged in 48-pages that the federal Krome North Services Processing Center and — to a far greater degree — the state-run Everglades site the DeSantis administration calls “Alligator Alcatraz” have engaged in practices that could violate international law.
They’ll send their report to Congress and the United Nations later this week, demanding an independent investigation into the centers, the organization said.
The Florida governor’s office and the Department of Homeland Security deny wrongdoing and the existence of any non-compliant standards at the facilities. They insisted the report was a “fabrication” or a “hoax” that could rile up anti-ICE sentiment.
“We were all shocked and horrified by what we saw,” Amy Fischer, Amnesty’s executive director for Refugee and Migrant Rights, told the Phoenix. She toured Krome with five colleagues in September and interviewed four detainees, all of whom had previously been held at the Everglades site.  
None of them has a final removal order, the report says. 
Their accounts paint a disturbing picture of extended solitary confinement at Krome, a 2-by-2-foot punishment “box” — compared to a lion’s cage at a circus — complete with shackles in the Everglades, and poor medical conditions at both South Florida centers.
One detainee claimed there was a death at the Everglades site, although it “went unreported” because “there’s no way to know what actually happened to the person because we’re not registered in ICE’s system.”
Amnesty only toured Krome. ICE denied its request to tour the Glades County Detention Center, which also houses immigration detainees, and the Florida Division of Emergency Management never responded to its tour request, the report says.
They didn’t respond to the Phoenix’s request for comment, either.
The Phoenix was unable to independently verify the four men’s stories. Amnesty’s report kept them anonymous, aside from their nationalities and immigration status.

‘Alligator Alcatraz’
Florida under Gov. Ron DeSantis firmly cemented its status as the leading anti-undocumented immigration state in July after President Donald Trump flew to the heart of the Everglades to celebrate the opening of the nation’s first state-run migrant detention center: Alligator Alcatraz.
The sprawling, former training airport, now rife with industrial tents, can hold up to 3,000 detainees at a time in caged areas. And it hasn’t been without its controversies.
Lawsuits from Democrats, environmentalists, and activist groups have decried a lack of transparency surrounding humanitarian conditions, who is being detained, and environmental consequences.
Past reports have claimed the facility is flood-prone with poor food and features a “box” used for punishment. 
Amnesty International claims that’s all true.
“People ended up in the ‘box,’ just for asking the guards for anything,” a Venezuelan man identified as an asylum seeker told Amnesty. “I saw a guy who was put in it for an entire day.”
“One time, two people in my cell were calling out to the guards telling them that I needed my medication,” a Chilean migrant said. He recounted how he was arrested by ICE while driving to the doctor for a case of pneumonia before being jailed in Walton County for three days. 
He was bused to the center around 9 p.m. on a Friday, shackled until 4 a.m. without “any food or water,” he added.
“Ten guards rushed into the cell and threw them to the ground. They were taken to the ‘box’ and punished just for trying to help me,” he continued. “Any time that anyone demanded that our rights be respected, they were punished.”
Fischer told the Phoenix that the “box” resembled a lion’s cage at a circus, standing at just two-feet tall by two-feet wide. She said shackles are attached to its floor, and that it was kept in the “hot Florida sun.”
“People have to stay there for hours shackled and denied food and water as a form of punishment,” she said. “Amnesty’s analysis, based upon the use of the box, we have found that it meets the definition of torture under international law.”
“It’s a copy of Guantánamo,” a Cuban man identified as an asylum seeker told Amnesty. He was detained there for 11 days. “The conditions are inhuman.”
Thirty-two people are locked in a 1,000 square foot “cage” inside of a tent holding eight cages, the report says. There are three toilets per cage with cameras affixed above them, although another Cuban migrant said the toilets were frequently clogged “and s*** overflowed from them.”
They claimed staff would keep the bright “stadium lights” on 24/7.
The report alleges other malfeasance, including “racism,” lengthy delays in medical attention, and migrants getting just minutes to speak with their attorneys on a collect-call phone. 
‘Fabrications’ and a ‘hoax’
The Florida governor’s office and the Department of Homeland Security vehemently pushed back on Amnesty’s allegations in statements to the Phoenix. They contended it contains fabrications that could stir up violent animosity toward immigration officials.
“​​Another day and another hoax about Alligator Alcatraz,” wrote DHS Assistant Director Tricia McLaughlin. “Nearly every single day, my office responds to media questions on FALSE allegations about Alligator Alcatraz. The media is clearly desperate for these allegations of inhumane conditions at this facility to be true.
“Feces are not overflowing in the toilets. Just like no one has died,” she continued. “These types of smears are directly contributing to our officers facing a 1,153% increase in assaults against them. 
“Here are the facts: Alligator Alcatraz does meet federal detention standards. All detainee facilities are clean. Any allegations of inhumane conditions are FALSE. When will the media stop peddling hoaxes about illegal alien detention centers and start focusing on American victims of illegal alien crime?”
A Los Angeles Times investigation suggests that figure overstates the seriousness of the problem. However, a sniper targeted a Dallas ICE facility in September, opening fire on agents and migrants alike. Two detainees were killed. On July 4, a group of suspects launched a coordinated attack on the Prairieland ICE detention facility in Alvarado, Texas, using fireworks to lure officers into an ambush.
DeSantis’ press secretary, Molly Best, echoed McLaughlin in her statement to the Phoenix.
“This ‘report’ is nothing more than a politically motivated attack,” she said. “None of these fabrications are true. In fact, running these allegations without any evidence whatsoever could jeopardize the safety and security of our staff and those being housed at Alligator Alcatraz.”

‘Amounts to torture’
The Everglades site wasn’t the only center Amnesty believes to have violated international standards.
At Krome in western Miami, the report details an ICE-led tour throughout parts of the federal detention center. 
One section they entered was the solitary confinement ward. ICE officials told Amnesty that the minimum duration for solitary confinement is 24 hours and that the maximum is 30 days, though that can be extended, the report says.
One man held in solitary confinement put a sign through the metal flap in the door reading, “Help Me. I’m on Hunger Strike.” He had a broken hand, and ICE told the researchers he was being held there because of his hunger strike. 
“The man showed Amnesty his bruised and mangled hand and said he had been waiting 37 days to receive medical attention,” the report says. 
“As the man was describing his injuries, an ICE official repeatedly and violently slammed the metal flap against the injured man’s hands and forced Amnesty International out of the solitary confinement area, stating, ‘This is a detained population. They can be dangerous. Allow security to do their jobs, also he’s not on a hunger strike. He ate yesterday and today.’”
Because the United Nations considers solitary confinement in excess of 15 days to amount to “torture,” Amnesty found that the detention conditions at Krome “do not comply with international human rights law and standards.” 
“Individuals are held in unsanitary and overcrowded conditions, face prolonged or arbitrary solitary confinement, lack adequate access to legal counsel and medical care, and experience treatment that collectively amounts to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment,” the report says.
“The use of prolonged solitary confinement at Krome and the use of the ‘box’ at “Alligator Alcatraz” amount to torture or other ill-treatment.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2224536667.jpg,,,2025-12-04 09:00:22.400093

Gavin Newsom is a longtime ally of the tech industry. Asked about its leaders’ rightward shift, he downplayed the moves while still offering some criticism.","In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom is a longtime ally of the tech industry. Asked about its leaders’ rightward shift, he downplayed the moves while still offering some criticism.


Despite watching one after another of his state’s tech titans head to the White House to seek President Donald Trump’s favor, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday he doesn’t begrudge the industry’s rightward swing — mostly.
“It’s very situational with a lot of these guys,” he said when asked about tech businessmen going to “the other side.” “They are and they aren’t … I don’t see it as as big a shift as perhaps others do.”
His comments at a New York Times finance summit underscored the governor’s balancing act with the tech industry, even as his relationship with its major businesses has been strained by Trump this year. Though he has excoriated law firms and universities for “selling out” to Trump administration demands this year — even threatening to pull state funding from California universities that sign certain agreements with the president — Newsom has walked a finer line when it comes to tech. 
“I think it’s a little bit more, I don’t want to say the word transactional, but it’s fiduciary,” he said of tech leaders’ decisions to curry favor with Trump . 
Newsom, who was San Francisco mayor in the 2000s, has long been close with tech leaders. As governor, he counts on the industry’s outsized gains to keep a massive state budget balanced. As a possible 2028 presidential contender, he could find Silicon Valley’s deep-pocketed donors helpful. 
The relationship has made Newsom a reliable politician in the industry’s corner as lawmakers in his own party increasingly push for regulations on social media and its effects on children, data centers’ use of environmental resources and artificial intelligence’s proliferation into workplaces, adolescent relationships and daily life. 
While Newsom has signed some of those bills, particularly ones in which advocates negotiated with tech companies, he’s also vetoed several out of concern that overregulating a nascent industry would drive it out of state. And he’s vehemently opposing a proposed wealth tax that would undoubtedly touch tech executives. 
Tech titans cozy up to Trump
That’s been the case this year despite Silicon Valley’s increasing coziness with Trump, whom Newsom has criticized for threatening industries with tariffs to extract concessions and demanding loyalty from private business executives. The relationship has affected California in a number of ways, from Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s aggressive pursuit of federal firings and cost-cuttings earlier this year to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff’s suggestion that Trump send the National Guard to San Francisco, precipitating a nervous few days in October as the president moved to start immigration raids there. Benioff later walked back his statements and Trump said he relented after talking with him and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.
Peter Leroe-Muñoz, a senior vice president at the industry group Bay Area Council, praised Newsom for nevertheless understanding “the value of the innovation our member companies produce.”
“While the governor may not always agree with innovation companies and how they choose to operate or conduct themselves, at the end of the day the governor recognizes that we all have a stake in the success of California and so not cutting off ties or undermining those industry players is in the long term success of the Golden State,” Leroe-Muñoz said last month. 
“There needs to be levels of ethics that are demanded of these leaders.” Gov. Gavin Newsom, referring to tech leaders who make deals with Trump
Still, Newsom offered some criticism of the industry’s relationship with Trump on Wednesday, calling it “self-dealing” that the president’s AI and crypto czar David Sacks, along with many other investors and chipmakers, have reportedly been in line to profit from Trump’s AI directives. 
“There needs to be levels of ethics that are demanded of these leaders,” he said. “That entire ecosystem has benefited from it. California has benefited from it. But I do not think it’s healthy for capitalism.”
And he called Apple CEO Tim Cook’s ability to strike a deal with Trump to get tariff exemptions for critical parts of the iPhone supply chain “by definition, crony capitalism.”
“How about the farmers and ranchers in California, how about all the small businesses that can’t pick up the phone and get an exemption on their tariffs?” Newsom said. “It breaks my heart.”
But he acknowledged Cook was serving his shareholders: “Do I begrudge that? Yes. Do I begrudge him? Not as much.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/080725-Newsom-Tech-AI-GETTY-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-04 09:00:22.400093

Spencer Cox holds a press conference to present his budget proposal at the Salt Lake County Library in Kearns on Wednesday, Dec. 3, 2025. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Thanks to tax cuts from the “one, big, beautiful” law, Utah won’t collect about half a billion dollars of income tax revenue in coming years — about $300 million in 2026 and $200 million in 2027. 
That’s according to Gov. Spencer Cox’s proposed budget unveiled Wednesday, which gives lawmakers a suggested roadmap to consider ahead of their 2026 legislative session, scheduled to begin Jan. 20. Utah’s Republican-controlled Legislature typically doesn’t put finishing touches on the budget until the final days of the 45-day session, which will conclude in early March. 
Cox’s $30.7 billion budget proposal is notably less than the $30.8 billion budget the 2025 Utah Legislature adopted for the current fiscal year — which Cox said during his budget announcement at a Salt Lake County library in Kearns reflects a “flat year, for sure.” 
Though he said Utah has benefited from a growing economy, federal changes to tax policy within Congress’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act means Utah won’t collect about $500 million in corporate and individual income tax revenue during the 2026-2027 fiscal year that it otherwise would have without those tax cuts.

“We are complying with those changes, and we immediately adopt those changes in our state without changes coming from the Legislature,” Cox said, adding “we’re pleased to announce” a roughly $300 million “tax decrease” for Utah taxpayers in 2026. 
“That’s less revenue coming into the state, which means that we are holding things flat,” Cox said. 
The Trump administration’s tax cuts come at a time when Utah state leaders had already spent years chipping away at the state’s income taxes. Over the past five years, the Utah Legislature and Cox have approved a series of tax cuts that have resulted in a cumulative loss of $1.4 billion in revenue every year. 
Most of those cuts have come from knocking the state’s income tax rate down several pegs. The most recent reduction approved earlier this year brought the rate down to 4.5%. 
Under the Utah Constitution, the vast majority of Utah’s income tax revenue must be used to fund public education. As the Legislature has approved repeated income tax rate cuts, education advocates and others have expressed concerns about foregoing funding that could otherwise be used to bolster the state’s schools or other programs eligible for the funds. Utah’s per-pupil spending rank is consistently among the lowest in the nation.

But Republican legislative leaders have defended the cuts as necessary to keep Utah “competitive” with other states that have lower tax burdens. They’ve also argued in favor of allowing Utahns and businesses to keep more money in their pockets to help foster economic growth while balancing responsible government spending. 
Because of the federal tax cuts, Cox said he’s not recommending legislators pursue yet another income tax rate reduction during the 2026 session — though he did propose setting aside $2.5 million to expand the state’s child tax credit to families with children up to 3 years old. 
The governor’s budget office estimates that expanded child tax credit would provide an additional average benefit of about $220 to an estimated 11,100 families. 
That’s the only tax cut Cox is proposing this year. It remains to be seen what legislators will do and whether they’ll listen to his recommendations — or keep up with their pattern of incrementally slashing the state’s income tax rate. 
5 years after failure, Utah lawmakers haven’t taken another stab at tax reform. When will they?

When asked if he would support another state income tax cut in addition to the federal tax cuts if the Legislature approves one, Cox told reporters, “We haven’t had any direct conversations about anything above and beyond that.”
“Again, it’s a tight year,” he said, though he noted that he’s supported the tax cuts approved over the last five years. 
More broadly, though, the governor reiterated a point he’s made repeatedly in the past — encouraging lawmakers to consider holistic tax reform before continuing to chip away at the state’s income tax rate. 
“I’ve said before, if we want to get rid of the income tax, I would support that,” he said. “But it’s impossible for us to get rid of the income tax and still function as a state government. So what are we going to replace that with?”
However, in his budget proposal, Cox does call on the Legislature to pursue property tax reform — or policies to “right-size the property tax burden distribution between residential and commercial properties.” 
A legislative audit last year found Utah homeowners are carrying a disproportionate share of the state’s property tax burden because assessors find it more difficult to correctly determine the value of commercial property, resulting in a “tax shift” from one sector to another.
Even though the “flat” revenue year meant Cox’s administration had to say no to plenty of requests, the governor’s budget proposal outlines a list of priorities he wants lawmakers to consider. 
Here are some highlights from the governor’s budget proposal:
Education
For public education, Cox is recommending $654.2 million next fiscal year. That includes, according to his budget proposal:

$191.4 million for a 4.2% increase to the weighted pupil unit, which is the per-pupil rate used to calculate how much money each school should receive. 
$80 million for paraeducator grant programs, including $60 million for “targeted behavioral interventions in K-3 classrooms” and $20 million for reading support in elementary schools that have not met the statewide proficiency benchmark of 70% of third graders reading at grade level. 
$53.4 million safe learning, including $50 million for public schools to make “necessary safety upgrades” and $3.4 million for higher education institutions to “enhance campus safety.” 
$5 million to expand Promise Partnership Utah, an organization meant to build connections to support student success. 
$500,000 for a literacy campaign. Along with private donors, Cox said the campaign will put out ads and billboards meant to “remind people how important it is to read.” 

Utah first lady Abby Cox also spoke at the governor’s budget proposal announcement, saying they decided to hold Wednesday’s news conference at a library to showcase the importance of reading and literacy and how social media has created a “big hole” that needs to be filled with books.

After Wednesday’s budget announcement, the first lady read a book to a room full of children at the library. 
“It’s not unconnected to social media. The issues that we’re having with literacy is a direct result of us not reading and children not having access to books and not being read to,” Abby Cox said. 
As part of the governor’s continued push against social media and its damaging impacts to children, Cox’s budget proposal also calls for “taking action to hold social media companies accountable for the costs associated with” harmful effects of social media, including impacts to mental health of Utahns. 
Cox said he’s “hopeful” the Legislature will pass a “bell-to-bell” ban on cellphones in classrooms after stopping short of an all-day ban earlier this year. 
Homelessness 
Cox recommended the state use $25 million in one-time money and $20 million in ongoing money to help fund a new 1,300-bed homeless campus, while focusing that funding specifically on “homelessness and criminal justice high utilizers.”
The controversial project has been envisioned to help Utah be a “pilot” state to fulfill President Donald Trump’s executive order titled “Ending Crime and Disorder on America’s Streets.” 
Though the campus plans are still being formulated, the state’s top homeless leaders and Cox have expressed support for increasing capacity for people who are civilly committed — or court ordered into mental health treatment. 
Utah Gov. Cox proposes millions for homeless campus while also hoping for federal funds

They have also envisioned an “accountability center” or a “secure residential placement facility” for substance abuse treatment as an alternative to jail, where people who are “sanctioned” to go there would not be able to leave voluntarily. 
That project — not expected to be built until some time in 2027 — is also projected to cost much more than what the governor included in his budget, to the tune of at least $75 million to build and north of $34 million a year to operate. 
When asked about that funding gap, Cox said other partners, including local governments, “are going to have to play a role in that.” He’s also hoping by partnering with the Trump administration, Utah could get an infusion of federal funds to help with the campus. 
“Because of the government shut down, we haven’t made as much progress as we had hoped, but (those conversations) are ongoing,” Cox said, adding that state leaders have been reaching out to federal officials “because we believe that with the changes that are being made to some of those funding streams around homelessness, that this is the perfect project for the federal government to get involved, that it can be a model for the nation.” 
Trump’s executive order encourages cities and states to enforce stricter anti-camping laws, expands power to involuntarily treat and civilly commit people experiencing homelessness, and directs federal officials to end support for “Housing First” strategies, an approach to homelessness that prioritizes providing housing while offering — but not requiring — treatment. 
“We want to make Utah the worst place to camp on the street, and the best place to get help and support,” Cox said in a prepared statement. “This budget recognizes that homelessness is complex, and solving it requires long-term commitment, community partnership, and a willingness to act boldly on behalf of those who need help the most.”

Acknowledging the campus will entail a “long-term effort,” Cox said he also included $5 million in his budget proposal for The Other Side Village, a master-planned tiny home community in Salt Lake City meant for people transitioning out of chronic homelessness.
“We know that these investments will pay great dividends for our state,” Cox said. “We want to make sure people are not camping on our streets, are not making life dangerous for people who want to take their kids out … and we want to get services to those who are struggling with addiction and mental health.” 
Water
The governor has also recommended $53.8 million in “continued investments” for water infrastructure and conservation. That includes: 

$6.2 million for dam safety upgrades.
$5 million for the Great Salt Lake long-term water program, which will “cover water leases while building on $50 million in federal funding, $200 million in pledged private investment and the Great Salt Lake 2034 Charter.” 
$5 million to extend the Colorado River Demand Management Pilot Program to “keep Utah in the driver’s seat, and to minimize disruptions to agricultural production” as changes to water use in the Colorado River Basin loom due to drought, litigation and policy changes. 
$2.5 million for Utah’s Agriculture Voluntary Incentive Program, which helps farmers and ranchers to adopt sustainable practices like upgrading irrigation systems or improving nutrient management.

Other priorities
The governor has also recommended: 

$290.3 million for state employee compensation, a 2.6% cost of living adjustment for state employees, additional pay increases based on performance, and increased funding for health and dental insurance. 
$7.6 million for reduced-price school lunch, which reflects a three-year commitment to cover the National School Lunch Program’s reduced-price category. 
$5 million for the Utah National Guard, including $3.4 million for recruitment and retention bonuses and $1.6 million for tuition assistance. 
$3 million for domestic violence and sexual assault victim services, including $2.1 million for the Utah Office of Victims of Crime, and $886,000 for the Department of Health and Human Services to continue access to services including crisis intervention, shelter, therapy and case management. 
$1.8 million to fill funding gaps for Meals on Wheels, a program that provides more than 159,000 meals to seniors.

On Monday, UA officials told members of Alice and Nineteen Fifty-Six that their publications would be suspended to remain compliant with a memo released over the summer by Attorney General Pam Bondi. The memo made non-binding recommendations on compliance with anti-diversity, equity and inclusion policies supported by the Trump administration.
Alex House, an associate director of communications at UA, said in a statement Tuesday the suspension of both magazines was to “ensure all members of our community feel welcome to participate in programs that receive university funding from the Office of Student Media.”
Other student organizations have spoken out against the university’s decision to shut down the publications.
“Nineteen Fifty-Six is not just a magazine but it is a beacon of light and one of the absolute greatest parts about our university,” the UA Afro-American Gospel Choir said in a statement posted to Instagram Wednesday. “There are no words that truly encapsulate how we truly feel. But we are incredibly saddened by this news. Their work has been imperative in telling our stories and the work they’ve done in front and behind the scenes does not go unnoticed.”
While both magazines were focused on specific demographics, there were no restrictions on who could contribute and work for the publications. Bondi’s memo did not provide specific guidance on student-run media serving particular communities.
The news of the suspension has gained national attention including an article in The New York Times.
A petition to reinstate the magazines was started on MoveOn saying the suspension of both publications “is a testing ground for the government and the current administration to see how far they can push.” As of Wednesday afternoon, it had over 2,100 signatures.
The University of Alabama has been removing spaces for marginalized groups on the campus for the past year and a half following passage of SB 129 in March 2024. The bill bans publicly-funded diversity, equity and inclusion programs as well as “divisive concepts.”
In August 2024, the university shut down the Safe Zone, a space for LGBTQ+ students, and a dedicated space for the Black Student Union, citing SB 129. In a filing in a federal lawsuit brought against the university by UA students and professors over the moves, attorneys for the school argued that reopening the spaces would constitute “unlawful discrimination,” citing the memo from Bondi. 
Attorneys for students and educators challenging SB 129 rejected the assertion, saying the memo was non-binding and said the spaces were open to all students regardless of race, gender or sexual orientation.
House said in a statement Tuesday that staff at the university “hope to work with students to develop a new publication that features a variety of voices and perspectives to debut in the next academic year.”
Emwanta said a new magazine isn’t what students want.
“A lot of people have cultivated audiences and communities and creative teams around both magazines and scrapping them to make something new and different is just not something that people are really, honestly looking for,” she said.

,California,2025-12-04 13:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s education leadership mishmash makes it hard to know who’s accountable,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/12/california-education-leadership-mishmash/,Experts say there are too many confusing layers in state and local education governance. The governor should hire the state's schools chief.,"California’s public school system, which purports to educate nearly 6 million students ranging from 4-year-olds in transitional kindergarten to near-adults preparing to graduate from high school, is in a world of hurt.
Its students perform poorly in national tests of academic achievement, some local school districts flirt with insolvency as unions press for raises to offset spikes in living costs, politicians wrangle over money while issuing a steady stream of mandates and demands and — on top of everything — nobody knows who is accountable for outcomes.
The lack of accountability stems from the construction — in layer after layer — of overlapping bits of authority that undermine cohesive governance. 
The governor, the state school board he or she appoints, an elected state schools superintendent, the Legislature, locally elected school boards and their superintendents, elected county school superintendents, elected county boards of education and the courts all have input.
When things are going well, such as an upward spike in test scores, there’s a rush to claim credit. But when problems arise, everyone involved points to someone or something else.
Finally, a prestigious collection of education experts is blowing the whistle. Policy Analysis for California Education, a consortium of education faculty at five major California universities, this week issued a detailed report on the lack of effective governance in education, how it evolved and how it might be improved.
“California’s education governance system is a complex network of agencies and entities designed to serve the most diverse and expansive TK–12 population in the United States,” the PACE report declares. “This system incorporates state, regional, and local levels of authority, each tasked with specific responsibilities and oversight. At its core, the structure seeks to balance statewide education goals with local control and accountability. However, its complexity often results in overlapping responsibilities, fragmented authority, and challenges in ensuring streamlined decision-making.
“The need to strengthen California’s education governance has never been more urgent,” PACE concludes. “Schools are grappling with deepening inequities, persistent opportunity gaps, and the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on student learning and well-being. At the same time, the federal government’s retreat from its traditional role in civil rights enforcement, accountability, research and evaluation, and oversight places even greater responsibility on states to lead. California must take bold and strategic steps now to ensure that its governance systems are not only coherent and efficient but also equity centered, transparent, and responsive to student needs.”
While the report advocates a wide rearrangement of responsibilities among the system’s many players, its most fundamental reform would place the governor at the top of the revised organizational chart while converting the elected state superintendent of public instruction into an ombudsman and independent critic, rather than the operational head of the state Department of Education.

The department would be managed by an appointee of the state Board of Education, whose members are named by the governor.
Reimagining the superintendent of public instruction as an independent evaluator and advocate for students “presents promising opportunities to strengthen systemwide accountability,” PACE says, “but it also introduces important trade-offs.” PACE questions if the office could still be influential if it lacks implementation authority.
The need to streamline authority and accountability in California’s school system is self-evident. A state that prides itself on being in the forefront of social progress still tolerates an education governance system created in the 19th century, one that has been augmented piecemeal with little thought about consequences and that prevents California’s voters and parents from really knowing who to hold accountable for obvious shortcomings.
That lack of clarity protects failure from exposure and inhibits successful programs from being duplicated. 
The PACE report’s proposed changes might not work. Giving the governor more authority might backfire. But we won’t know if we don’t try it.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/052125_Paradise-School-Mental-Health_MG_CM_17.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-04 09:00:22.400093

(Photo courtesy Clark County)This story is the second in a series on the connections between housing instability and child welfare. This project was supported by the USC Annenberg Center for Health Journalism’s National Fellowship and Fund for Reporting on Child Well-Being.
It was a little after 4 a.m. on a May morning when Victoria left the homeless encampment she was staying at near Russell Road on the border of Henderson in order to catch a bus to Help of Southern Nevada. 
Victoria, who is using her first name for privacy, had just entered her third trimester while living on the streets and was desperate to find a safe place, somewhere inside. 
She knows better than anyone the consequences that could come from being unsheltered with a baby and how it could lead to having a child removed by the child welfare system. Eight years earlier, while experiencing homelessness and addiction, she got pregnant with her first child. Unable to remain sober and housed, she eventually lost parental rights before her son turned 2.
“I already lost one kid to the system,” Victoria said. “This was my second chance to get right and not lose another child to the system.”
After an hourlong bus ride, she arrived at the Help of Southern Nevada office on Flamingo Road.
The nonprofit, which offers a variety of housing and homeless resources, hosts a weekly drop-in event every Thursday for people needing on-the-spot assistance. Outreach workers from the nonprofit had previously encouraged Victoria to come in for help. Now she was ready.
Though she wanted to find housing, she was worried no place would take her along with the father of her unborn child. 
“There’s not very many programs out there that are willing to take non-married people like me and him,” she said. 
To her surprise, case workers had just the solution: a Clark County-operated non-congregate shelter specifically designed for families.
Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Clark County used federal relief dollars to convert six older motels and hotels into noncongregate shelters. Four facilities serve adults without children; two serve adults with children. 
Dubbed “La Quinta” after the motel chain that previously operated at the location, the main noncongregate facility for unhoused people with children has become a lifeline for families living on the streets or on the verge of homelessness, especially those families dealing child welfare cases. 
The program was in such demand, the county opened an additional facility for families this year, which has remained full. 
“I feel like the need is always going to be there, because we’re offering something that’s safe, stable and can keep a family together,” said Brenda Barnes, social services manager with Clark County.
Housing instability can be deeply interconnected with Nevada child welfare

In the early days of its transformation from motel to family shelter, officials noticed the facility also presented opportunities to reunify families who were dealing with the child welfare system. For some families who have their children removed, housing can be the last barrier to reunification. 
Opening the facility, “gave us a place where, if housing was the only factor to reunify and get kiddos back with their parents safely, we were able to kind of make that plug,” Barnes said. 
It has since been used as an option to steer people away from child welfare altogether. 
The family shelters run by the county have served 1,823 families – roughly 4,000 children –  since opening in 2021. 
Data provided to Nevada Current showed 1,050 of those families have previous referrals with the child welfare system, of which 258 referrals stemmed specially from homelessness or inadequate housing. 
County officials estimate the family shelters have diverted 1,838 children – roughly 875 families – from entering the child welfare system and prevented them from being removed from caregivers and parents. 
It costs roughly $1.4 million a month to run the two family specific shelters. 
During an interim legislative committee hearing in 2024, state lawmakers were told the first three years of operations resulted in the county saving $32 million in child welfare costs.  
At the hearing, Barnes told lawmakers the “return on investment” was believed to be greater than the estimates. 
At the time the county had diverted close to 1,600 children from the system at the time. By doing so, the county estimated it saved Child Haven, a campus where children removed from their families stay, roughly $10 million in operational costs.
At the 2024 legislative hearing, Barnes reiterated all estimates were “based on not a full comprehension but an overview of what it costs to run a child haven as a facility and what it costs to have children in foster care.”
The bigger accomplishment is keeping families whole instead of removing children. 
“You can’t put a price on the reduced amount of trauma by opening these doors,” Barnes said. 
Filling a void
The 2024 Southern Nevada Point-in-Time count, a yearly snapshot of the number of people experiencing homelessness on any given night, found 7,906 people were unhoused in January of that year. Roughly 20% of the entire homeless population – around 1,500 – were families with children.  
The number is likely an undercount yet still higher than previous years. 
The 2022 homeless count found 516 families with children.
“It stood out in opening these facilities that we were offering a service that wasn’t available in the community,” Barnes said.
The first family shelter the county opened was a converted Rodeway Inn in December 2021 with 150 rooms. In less than a year the facility was “bursting at the seams,” Barnes said, adding that the county had to transition to a new location the following year. The Rodeway was repurposed to serve adults without children.
The former La Quinta, which has 251 rooms, has served 1,553 families since it opened in 2022. The additional location that opened this year, which has 150 rooms, has served 270 families.
“I feel like if we were to open another facility, would we fill it? Probably. Absolutely,” Barnes said. “It doesn’t mean that those families are currently unsheltered. It just means that we’re providing a resource that meets their unique needs a little bit better than their opportunities before.”
Coming to La Quinta
Victoria, 41, first began experiencing homelessness in 2013 after both her mother and grandmother died in the same year. 
She had struggled with mental health issues and addiction since she was 16, but being unhoused after the death of her family exacerbated her substance abuse and “I just lost myself.” 
“People really don’t get it. It’s really a sickness. It’s really a disease,” Victoria said. “It’s not as easy as people think. People say, ‘Oh, you can quit if you want to.’ The person has to be willing to quit at that time. You can’t force a person into recovery.”
When she found out she was pregnant with her first son – years before La Quinta opened – she also struggled with finding housing and addiction services.  
“They say there’s so much help for us pregnant women but there’s really not,” she said. 
Victoria gave birth while struggling with homelessness. While her newborn son inspired her to maintain sobriety for a time, she eventually fell back into addiction and wound up homeless once again. 
Her son was removed from her care when he was 18 months old. Life began to spiral after she lost her parental rights. 
“After I lost my son and everything, I just went on a rollercoaster,” she said. “I didn’t care anymore.”
Victoria spent the next few years moving from encampment to encampment. She tried drug treatment programs, but nothing would stick.
Then, earlier this year, another unhoused woman Victoria knew from a nearby encampment became pregnant. Not long after, Victoria began mirroring the same symptoms. “I thought it was just sympathy symptoms,” she said. 
Victoria was in fact pregnant for a second time. Traumatized by losing her first child to the child welfare system, she said she began trying to stop using drugs. She had been sober a little under a month by the time she arrived at La Quinta.
“I lost my first son because of my own actions and my own decisions in life,” she said. “Choosing to do my drugs and not putting my son first, that’s my biggest regret.”
Not all people who stay at La Quinta have been experiencing homelessness chronically like Victoria.  
Shay, a mother of three using her first name to maintain privacy, also sought housing resources. Shay was evicted from her apartment in July and didn’t know where she and her children would stay.. 
She worked a part-time security job with an inconsistent work schedule. At the beginning of the year, she fell behind bills and couldn’t pay her $1,100 rent. 
She sought housing assistance from other nonprofits around town and thought she would qualify for rental assistance. It never materialized. 
Then the eviction notice came. Two days after her eviction hearing this summer, she and her three kids, 9, 8 and 4, were locked out of her house. 
“I was feeling like I should just quit, like it was pointless,” she said.

Barnes said similar stories of evictions have played out among people staying at La Quinta
The legacy of the pandemic, unsteady employment, increased rental costs and other factors can create a “domino effect” leading to eviction notices, Barnes said. 
The county does not consistently track the number of people entering La Quinta who have been evicted. But the county was able to provide a snapshot from July that showed 27 of the 77 families referred to La Quinta that month had recently been evicted. 
“Our observations are consistent with national trends showing that rising housing costs and the end of temporary eviction protections have contributed to increased housing instability,” said Jennifer Cooper, a spokeswoman for Clark County.
A family member told Shay about Help of Southern Nevada. Though she met with a case worker and did a housing assessment, Shay wasn’t sure it would lead to anything. 
“By the time I even got to the bus stop, they had called me and told me that they found housing for me,” she said.
She and her three kids could stay at La Quinta. 
‘Sometimes it takes a few tries’
While Shay was able to stay at La Quinta for several weeks before transitioning to another housing program, Victoria and her partner – who she refers to as her husband – were eventually asked to leave La Quinta. Though it stung, Victoria admitted it was their fault for violating the property rules.
All residents have to sign an occupancy agreement that outlines mandatory case management, welfare and room checks. Alcohol and controlled substances aren’t allowed on the property.
“We have to keep those to ensure we maintain a safe environment,” Barnes said.
Victoria’s husband brought in a marijuana vape pen, though she maintains it was empty.
Barnes said even if people violate rules, they are usually given warnings before being asked to leave. Even then, there is a chance to come back to La Quinta. 
“We’re not a one-stop shop or a one-chance you’re out place,” she said.  “There’s always an opportunity that if you couldn’t follow the rules that we could re-evaluate. People come into this system of care multiple times, and that’s okay. Sometimes it takes a few tries.”
After leaving La Quinta, Victoria contacted her previous case worker with HELP of Southern Nevada, who was able to get her into another housing program. Victoria signed the lease to her unit, and then an hour later went into labor. 
The average length of stay at Clark County’s family shelters is 117 days, according to data provided to the Current. County officials noted one family stayed for more than a year and a half. 
While housed in the facilities, families meet with case managers, which can make referrals for other housing programs in the community or the Housing Choice Voucher program, commonly known as Section 8.
Housing vouchers are hard to get and qualifying for them can be a multi-month process. At the end of it, there is no guarantee people will find a place to live. 
Housing vouchers also have stringent requirements on income limits and the type of places people can live. 
And the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban and Development requires environmental reviews and housing inspections “just to make sure families aren’t put into places that really end up in slum lord situations,” Barnes said. “They want to make sure they are appropriate and safe units.” 
Another ongoing challenge is finding landlords willing to accept those vouchers, Barnes said. Nevada, like most states, doesn’t have any laws prohibiting landlords from turning away potential tenants who will be paying rent with public assistance. 
The time to move someone from the family shelter to permanent housing could “have been cut shorter if we had landlords willing to rent to voucher holders,” Barnes said. 
“We can exit families into permanent housing if it was affordable for them to live in,” she said. “And families want to. Families don’t want to stay in La Quinta forever.” 
Though the county has been able to find a solution to stabilize some unhoused families, the road to permanently housing them isn’t easy. 
Barnes said it will continue to be a challenge “until we can (contain) the cost of living and have a decent wage for families to live off of and have affordable places for them to rent that aren’t in the worst parts of the cities.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Courtyard.jpg,,,2025-12-04 09:00:22.400093

Dec. 3, 2025. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. Doctors and parents urged legislators on the Michigan Senate Health Policy Committee Wednesday to pass a bill, put forward by state Sen. Kevin Hertel (D-St. Clair Shores), that would require insurance companies in Michigan to cover treatments for two pediatric autoimmune neurological disorders. 
The disorders, known as PANS (Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome) and PANDAS (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Streptococcal Infections), were described by Bruce Goodman, an advocate with the Michigan PANS and PANDAS Alliance, as “a form of sudden onset brain inflammation that occurs in children.” 
“It occurs when an infection or environmental trigger causes the child’s immune system to mistakenly attack healthy brain tissue,” Goodman explained. “The results can be dramatic and terrifying, severe OCD [obsessive compulsive disorder], ticks, eating refusals, emotional regression, debilitating anxiety and cognitive decline that appear almost out of nowhere.”
Goodman explained that this very situation had happened to his granddaughter, Una. “She went to bed as a regular, happy 5-year-old. She woke up in the morning with severe OCD,” he said. 
Central in the testimony was a treatment known as intravenous immunoglobulin, or IVIG. In Una’s case, after she was treated with IVIG, she recovered. 
Eight parents of children diagnosed with PANS/PANDAS testified about how intravenous immunoglobulin treatments drastically improved their children’s symptoms or brought them into remission — but all of those families also faced either delays or denials of the treatment from their insurance companies. 
IVIG treatment is used only in the most severe cases, if antibiotics or other treatments fail, but insurers regularly delay or deny treatments — sometimes in the middle of a course of therapy. 
“No family should have to watch their child fall apart because the insurance company says no, even when all the doctors say yes,” said Michelle Stackpoole, whose son developed PANS — with symptoms including tics, OCD, anxiety, self injury and severe behavioral regression — after contracting COVID-19 in 2021.

Gary Driscoll’s 15-year-old daughter developed PANS/PANDAS after a strep infection, with her symptoms getting so bad that she lost the ability to walk. Because insurance denied intravenous immunoglobulin treatment, the family paid $22 thousand out of pocket — and her symptoms resolved within days. 
“Families should not have to choose between financial ruin and watching their child lose their childhood,” Driscoll said. 
Sixteen other states have passed laws similar to Hertel’s bill, Goodman said, noting that in both Arkansas and Colorado, a child with PANS/PANDAS committed suicide, spurring passage of the law. 
“In Michigan, we are way behind the times,” said Dr. Susan Youngs, who said that she has treated over 300 children with PANS/PANDAS in her time as a doctor. 
Sen. Kevin Hertel (D-St. Clair Shores) listens to testimony from parents on his bill, SB 447. Dec. 3, 2025. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance.
For the first eight years of her career, she said, she almost universally got insurance approvals for patients with PANDAS/PANS. But in recent years this has changed dramatically, and in the last five years, cases are almost universally denied or delayed. 
“Let’s be clear, there’s not a difference in opinion between doctors on this issue,” Youngs said. “Skilled, knowledgeable doctors who actually treat PANS patients all agree that IVIG is life changing for this disease.”
The committee only took testimony at Wednesday’s hearing, and did not vote on Hertel’s legislation, which seeks to amend the Michigan Insurance Code, mandating coverage by private insurers.

AI does not reward size. It rewards small teams who can move quickly, learn fast and adapt.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Bernie Gracy:  AI can be Vermont’s advantage.","This commentary is by Bernie Gracy. He is a technology executive who splits his time between Hollis, New Hampshire  and Averill, Vermont,  where he also serves as president of the Averill Lakes Association.



Last month I attended my second “Rumble in the Kingdom” pitch competition — the annual gathering where entrepreneurs, students, technologists, community leaders and outdoor-industry innovators come together in the Northeast Kingdom to compete for seed funding. In a packed house, cheered on by friends and neighbors, these founders made the most of their five-minute pitches.
What struck me over the past couple of years was the shape of the business ideas. The entrants weren’t Silicon Valley clones chasing scale for scale’s sake. They were grounded in solving real problems in the real economy — housing, food systems, health care access, nonprofit infrastructure, outdoor recreation and creative services.
These were practical and community-oriented ventures — the exact kinds of companies that stand to benefit the most from AI if it is deployed thoughtfully.
A startup building high-performance prefab homes can use AI to model energy efficiency and reduce material waste.
A food cooperative can forecast demand, cut spoilage and better connect with local producers. A drone and photography studio can automate editing, mapping and client proposals.
An outdoor recreation business can predict visitor traffic and optimize inventory before the busy season.
Even a nonprofit platform can match local needs to donors more quickly and with far less administrative burden.
None of this replaces the human relationships that define these companies. It simply gives small teams the capabilities once reserved for organizations ten times their size.
And that’s the point — AI may be the first major economic shift where Vermont’s scale is an advantage, not a limitation. AI does not reward size. It rewards small teams who can move quickly, learn fast and adapt. 
Contrary to the daily headlines about AI-driven layoffs, this is not about replacing Vermont workers. It’s about giving small, mission-driven businesses the analytical, operational and marketing capabilities that used to belong only to large companies — without changing who they are. 
For many of these startups, AI can collapse a century of structural disadvantage as it rewards teams and team members that are agile and entrepreneurial, able to wear multiple hats, and collaborative and grounded in trust and community values.
Large companies must unwind layers of complexity to adopt AI — Vermont companies do not have that burden. Moreover, Vermont has a unique opportunity to show the country what “human-scaled AI” looks like — a future where technology strengthens communities instead of hollowing them out; where innovation supports stewardship; and where rural economies lead instead of lag.
Rumble on!

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)State officials say a federal agency review found 21 noncitizens have cast ballots in Indiana elections, along with 165 noncitizens who registered to vote in the state.
Those figures were included in an announcement Wednesday from the offices of Attorney General Todd Rokita and Secretary of State Diego Morales about the settlement of a lawsuit in which they sought to force the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to verify the citizenship of more than 585,000 registered Hoosier voters. 
It was not clear how many of those voter registrations had been reviewed by the federal agency and when the illegal voting was alleged to have occurred.
In 2024, Indiana had 4.8 million registered voters and just under 3 million, or 62%, voted in that year’s general election. The Hoosier state has one of the lowest voter turnouts in the country.

Rokita and Morales, both Republicans, filed the lawsuit in April, seeking to force federal review of the voter list after the agency did not do so during then-President Joe Biden’s administration when first requested in October 2024 — just weeks before that year’s presidential election.
Rokita said in a statement that the settlement “delivers the federal access we’re entitled to under law, allowing the Secretary of State to swiftly remove ineligible voters from the rolls and fortify our system against future risks.”
“From day one, many individuals dismissed our work as a ‘witch hunt’ — but the facts speak for themselves: non-citizen voting is real here in our state, and even one illegal ballot undermines the trust we are told to have in our election processes and even the Republic itself,” Rokita said.
Rokita’s office did not answer questions from the Indiana Capital Chronicle about how it had confirmed the instances of noncitizens registering to vote and casting ballots — and whether any legal action against those people was being sought.
The announcement said the ballots had been wrongly cast in “recent elections” but did not provide additional information.
Morales spokeswoman Lindsey Eaton said the review “includes voters in 2024 and past elections. It’s based on statewide voter history.”
It is illegal under both Indiana and federal law for noncitizens to vote in elections.
Actions criticized as voter intimidation
Voting-rights advocates previously denounced as attempted voter intimidation the request from Rokita and Morales for review of the nearly 600,000 registrations by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services — which is housed within the homeland security agency.
The Chicago Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights, which is representing several Indiana groups in legal challenges to state election law changes, criticized the actions by Rokita and Morales.
“Hoosiers who have become U.S. citizens are needlessly harmed by these efforts. This preliminary information from USCIS has not been verified,” the organization said.
Eaton said the secretary of state’s office “believes information received from USCIS is accurate and we will provide more information concerning referrals to law enforcement in the near future.”

That requested review covered about one in eight people on Indiana’s voter rolls, involving those who registered without providing a state-issued form of identification.
Indiana was among four Republican states agreeing in the lawsuit settlement filed Friday to help the Trump administration gain access to state driver’s license data through a nationwide law enforcement computer network seeking out alleged noncitizen voters.
Under the agreement with Florida, Indiana, Iowa and Ohio, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is required to continue its development of a program capable of scanning millions of state voter records for instances of noncitizen registered voters.
Morales announced in September that his office had identified a noncitizen living in Vigo County who alleged had registered to vote in 2018 and cast ballots in six elections.
That case was referred to county and federal prosecutors, but it was unclear whether any legal action has been taken as those offices did not immediately reply Wednesday to messages seeking an update.

It is whether the care needed to survive one is available in the communities where the state requires it to continue (krisanapong detraphiphat/Getty Images).Across much of rural Missouri, pregnancy begins with distance. In many counties, the nearest hospital that still delivers babies can be close to an hour away.
According to the 2024 March of Dimes report, 51% of Missouri counties are now classified as maternity care deserts, offering no obstetric clinicians or birthing hospitals. A 2025 analysis by the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform found that less than half (41%) of U.S. rural hospitals still offer labor and delivery services.
Hospitals are closing these units because insurance companies and Medicaid do not reimburse enough to cover the cost of births, causing already struggling rural facilities to lose money. When these units close, families lose local prenatal care, clinicians who know them and the infrastructure that stabilizes emergencies. High-risk pregnancies become harder to monitor. More births occur in emergency departments or outside hospitals. Preterm birth rates rise.
In counties where chronic illness, limited transportation and poverty are already widespread, the loss of maternity care makes healthy pregnancies even harder to achieve. 
Over the last decade, Missouri has experienced a steady decline in maternity units and hospital services, especially in rural areas. 
More than 40% of births in Missouri are covered by Medicaid, and many patients rely on clinics and community health centers when hospitals close. Medicaid reimburses for contraception and pregnancy care, but not for abortion. That leaves legal rights disconnected from the services people need to use them.
Labor and delivery services are often among the first cuts when a hospital is trying to stay open. In parts of southeast Missouri, patients must travel across county lines or out of state for obstetric care.
These access barriers compound Missouri’s pregnancy-related mortality rate of 32 deaths per 100,000 live births and show how geography and limited access worsen clinical risk. Black women in Missouri face a pregnancy-related death risk about 2.5 times that of white women. Women living in micropolitan counties had the highest pregnancy-related mortality ratio, nearly 40 deaths per 100,000 live births. 
Mental-health conditions, including substance use disorders, are among the leading causes of pregnancy-related deaths in Missouri. Most pregnancy-related deaths occur after birth, often months into the postpartum year. 
The state’s Pregnancy-Associated Mortality Review Board determined that every mental-health–related death was preventable. Overall, more than 80% of pregnancy-related deaths in Missouri were considered preventable.
The same counties that lack maternity units also lack psychiatrists, psychologists, and addiction treatment programs.
Missouri earned a D grade from the March of Dimes for preterm birth. About 11% of babies in the state are born preterm. The latest data shows that 6 infants die per 1,000 live births. Missouri continues to rank among the worst performing states for infant mortality. These outcomes reflect a system where maternity care has deteriorated faster than the policies meant to support it.
During this period of shrinking access, Missouri also moved through years of reproductive policy instability. After the United States Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion in 2022, Missouri’s trigger law took effect and banned most abortions. The only exception was a narrowly defined medical emergency provision that functions as an affirmative defense. Physicians can be investigated or prosecuted first and must justify the decision later.
In 2024, Missouri voters approved a constitutional amendment recognizing a right to reproductive freedom, but legal protections did not change the underlying conditions that have driven maternity unit closures. They did not rebuild maternity units, reopen labor wards, or restore prenatal and postpartum care where it was lost. 
The legal landscape changed repeatedly, and clinical practice and patient access changed as a result. Hospitals and clinics revised policies in response to litigation, and patients were sometimes delayed, transferred or told to wait until symptoms worsened.
Many Missourians now face delays in getting their first prenatal appointment, and that visit may require an hour-long drive each way. If severe pain or bleeding begins, the nearest emergency department may not have an obstetrician on site. Patients may be stabilized and transferred or directed to seek care elsewhere.
If a pregnancy becomes dangerous, clinicians must navigate both medical risk and a changing legal environment that governs emergency care in Missouri.
The distance between pregnancy and care in Missouri is no longer just a matter of miles. It widens if you are Black, low income, rely on Medicaid or lack transportation. It widens if you live in a maternity care desert, face untreated mental health conditions or addiction or are a teenager or single parent without support. 
The question in Missouri is no longer whether people have control over a pregnancy. It is whether the care needed to survive one is available in the communities where the state requires it to continue.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/gettyimages-2211388790-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-04 07:56:16.177540

But the dispute is likely not over. The gun rights advocacy group suing to overturn the ban says it will appeal. And whether restrictions like Washington’s are constitutional may eventually be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Washington’s law doesn’t prohibit owning assault weapons, just their manufacture, importation, distribution or sale. The term “assault weapon” is defined in the law, including with a list of specific firearm models, such as AR-15s.
The Silent Majority Foundation, along with gun sellers in Moses Lake and Ephrata and individuals, sued over the ban in 2023 in Thurston County Superior Court. They say it violates the state constitution that protects the right to bear arms.  
The state attorney general’s office countered that policymakers can still regulate uniquely deadly weapons disproportionately used in mass shootings. These guns aren’t suited for self-defense, the state argued. The Silent Majority Foundation disagreed, arguing that the firearms in question are widely owned and so should have constitutional protection. 
Lawyers for the state said assault weapons aren’t covered by the state constitution, which states “the right of the individual citizen to bear arms in defense of himself, or the state, shall not be impaired.” 
Thurston County Superior Court Judge Christine Schaller sided with the state last month.
“This is another strong affirmation that our state’s gun violence prevention laws are both constitutional and effective,” Alliance for Gun Responsibility CEO Renée Hopkins said in a statement. “Assault weapons have no place in our communities, and Washington has been clear about that.”
The Silent Majority Foundation says this won’t be the final say on Washington’s law. 
“The words of the Washington Constitution, which provide that the right to bear arms shall not be impaired, must mean something,” Rob Waites, operations director for the Pasco-based organization, said in an email.
Federal judges in western and eastern Washington have also denied preliminary challenges to the state law. But those cases have been paused in anticipation of an appeals court ruling on California’s assault weapons ban that could have precedence for Washington. 
Meanwhile, an East Coast appeals court with a conservative majority is considering the future of New Jersey’s ban. Over the summer, another appeals court upheld Connecticut’s assault weapons prohibition. 
Conservative U.S. Supreme Court justices have expressed interest in taking up a case on assault weapons bans, but the high court declined to hear such a case this year. The Bellevue-based Second Amendment Foundation recently urged the court to take up its challenge to a local assault weapons ban in Cook County, Illinois. 
Washington is one of 10 states that ban semiautomatic firearms classified as assault weapons. For years during his time as attorney general, Gov. Bob Ferguson pushed for the law in the wake of a shooting at a Mukilteo house party that killed three teens and injured another.
The federal government banned the manufacture of assault weapons in 1994, but allowed the prohibition to expire after 10 years. 
The Silent Majority Foundation also took on the state’s ban on the sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines. So far, the group has failed to overturn that law, with the state Supreme Court upholding it this year. The organization has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review its case. 
The foundation was formerly led by Pete Serrano, an unsuccessful Republican candidate for state attorney general last year. In August, President Donald Trump named Serrano interim U.S. attorney for Washington’s Eastern District. The Senate has yet to confirm Serrano to the permanent post amid opposition from Washington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray. 
Waites noted Serrano isn’t affiliated with the foundation while he’s serving as U.S. attorney.
The state is sure to face more legal challenges on its gun laws, as its new permit-to-purchase system takes effect in 2027. Lawmakers passed the controversial policy this year.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ar15s-1024x890.jpg,,,2025-12-04 07:56:16.177540

(Stock photo by Joe Sohm/Getty Images)An unusual coalition that includes business groups, environmental activists, and New Jersey’s ratepayer advocate is urging lawmakers to reject a legislative proposal that would see residents pay for the construction of a new nuclear power plant years before it begins sending energy to the grid.
The bill, introduced last month during the final weeks of the Legislature’s current session, would add a mandatory charge on every ratepayer’s electricity bill to cover 5% of the projected construction costs of a to-be-constructed nuclear plant generating at least 1,100 megawatts of electricity.
The measure’s opponents warn that the bill, sponsored by Sens. Bob Smith (D-Middlesex) and John Burzichelli (D-Gloucester), would shift risk from the plant’s developers to residents who could ill-afford further rate increases after a steep hike this summer that will be followed by another price spike next June.
“There are going to be people after this bill who aren’t going to be able to afford their electric bill,” Brian Lipman, director of the state’s rate counsel division, which advocates for utility customers before the state’s energy regulators, told the Senate’s energy committee Monday.
The advanced nuclear development charge would add between $22 and $55 to residential ratepayers’ monthly bills, Lipman said, and consumers would likely pay that charge for at least a decade before a nuclear plant actually comes online. Lipman called that framework unprecedented.
The plan would lead some to pay as much as $6,600 over the next decade for a plant that will not have produced any electricity.
As written under the current version of the bill, ratepayers would pay those subsidies in perpetuity.
“I don’t think any of us intend that this credit is something that’s going to be paid by our grandchildren for, say, the 80-year expected life of the facility,” said Abe Silverman, an energy research scholar at Johns Hopkins University.
The committee advanced the bill in a 4-1 vote. Sen. Parker Space (R-Sussex) voted no.
Though New Jersey’s ratepayers fund utilities’ infrastructure investments through their utility bills, utilities are only permitted to recoup the cost of their investments after projects go into service.
Industrial and commercial customers who use large amounts of power and almost exclusively procure their electricity from off-grid third-party suppliers would face far steeper costs, said Steven Goldenberg, counsel for the New Jersey Large Energy Users Coalition.
“When Brian says that the average residential ratepayer will see the rates increase $55 a month, that is huge,” Goldenberg said. “But when it gets translated to my people, we’re talking five figures every month.”

Board of Public Utilities President Christine Guhl-Sadovy, the only person to speak in favor of the bill during Monday’s committee hearing, argued that private firms need subsidies to secure U.S. Department of Energy loans that could cover as much as 80% of a nuclear project’s costs.
Energy markets could not support private investment in new nuclear plants despite recent and looming price rises, she said, at least not without ratepayer support.
“Even conservative estimates for load growth make a strong case for building new nuclear generation. We have a responsibility at the BPU to ensure reliable and affordable utility service. If the state does not invest in new generation, electricity will continue on the path of being unaffordable,” she said.
Opponents said the risk to ratepayers is too great.
Provisions in the bill would allow developers to seek and obtain, as-of-right, ratepayer dollars to help pay for cost overruns not exceeding 20% of a project’s forecasted costs, and developers are permitted to seek ratepayer funds for larger increases with approval from the Board of Public Utilities.
The state would be hard-pressed to deny requests for larger cost overruns, especially those that come years into a project’s development, Silverman said. Those requests would put regulators in a difficult position: Pay more, or kill a project for which ratepayers have already supported with hundreds of millions — or even billions — of dollars.
Nuclear plant cost overruns aren’t unheard of, and they can be significant. Two nuclear units completed in Georgia in 2023 saw their cost balloon from a projected $14 billion to a realized $31 billion. Some estimates peg the cost as high as $37 billion. The units went online more than six years behind schedule.
The Georgia plants’ construction was the first the country saw in decades. Guhl-Sadovy argued the lessons learned there would prevent similar overruns in New Jersey.
“A lot of mistakes, I think, were made and recognized, and changes have been made,” she said. “We would not anticipate those kinds of cost overruns.”
The bill would not require developers of a project completed on time to fully return the ratepayers’ investment. Though the bill mandates developers return at least some revenue to ratepayers, it would allow the Board of Public Utilities to negotiate how much.










There are going to be people after this bill who aren’t going to be able to afford their electric bill.


– Brian Lipman, director of the state’s rate counsel division


Some detractors warned against imposing additional costs on ratepayers before the state studies what types of energy generation best fit its needs.
Others warned New Jersey wouldn’t see the full benefits of cost reduction from subsidized new generation because that power would be sold on PJM Interconnection’s 13-state grid, spreading its benefit to states outside of New Jersey.
There’s no guarantee that subsidized nuclear plants could even participate in PJM. The U.S. Supreme Court found a 2011 New Jersey program that sought to underwrite the construction of new gas plants by guaranteeing they earn a set amount in energy markets unconstitutionally infringed on federal regulatory authority.
“This bill does almost the same thing,” Lipman said in written testimony provided to the committee.
Others cautioned the bill should not move before Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill takes office.
Energy policy was a major focus of her campaign, and adding $55 in fixed monthly costs could doom her pledge to freeze energy rates once she’s inaugurated on Jan. 20.
“I don’t think that we should be working, moving forward on comprehensive reform or any kind of major investment in new generation in front of Mikie Sherrill taking her seat,” said Dena Mottola Jaborska, associated director of New Jersey Citizen Action. “She did make this a signature issue in her campaign, and I do feel like six weeks is not enough time.”
It’s not clear whether the bill will reach Gov. Phil Murphy’s desk before he leaves office, or if he would sign it if it does.
The bill had no Assembly companion as of Wednesday, and the Senate version did not appear on the agenda for the Senate Budget Committee’s Monday meeting.
Sen. Bob Smith (D-Middlesex), the bill’s prime sponsor, appeared to suggest the measure could see changes.
“Is this a controversial bill? Yes. Do we have any solutions for the future of New Jersey? Not really. Has the discussion started? Yes, it has,” he said.

The Missouri School Modernization Task Force’s performance incentive working group completed its final meeting Wednesday before it presents recommendations to the larger group in January. The three other working groups have at least one more meeting each before their recommendations are finalized and become public.
Providing financial incentives for school districts to improve student achievement is a new concept, with few states using outcome-based funding models. But under an executive order from Gov. Mike Kehoe, Missouri may be poised to try the concept.
A memo from the nonprofit Aligned, an education-policy group focused on workforce development, noted that the idea of incentives had “potential” but could be a source of inequity. The brief, written by Aligned’s Kansas Director of Policy and Research Eric Syverson, looked at a program in Arizona that gave additional funding to high-performing schools. 
“Most dollars flowed to already advantaged schools,” he wrote, noting that Arizona lawmakers shut down the program in 2024.
Creating equitable incentives was a key focus of the working group’s meeting Wednesday, as members questioned whether their plan served all students across the state.
The framework the group is pursuing gives extra funding to districts when students reach achievement levels or hit growth targets in the areas of early literacy, middle school math and language arts and college and career readiness. A committee would be formed to articulate precise targets.
The program would be funded through a separate line item in the state budget, with a target funding level of $50 million, according to draft recommendations.
One part of the plan split the panel, though, as members debated whether or not the performance of certain student groups should have higher awards for schools. Kari Monsees, the state education department’s semi-retired finance chief, proposed a larger bonus when English-language learners, low-income students and those in special education reach performance targets. His recommendations were based on the group’s prior meetings, not necessarily the opinions of the state education department.
Chris Vas, a senior director with the Herzog Foundation, questioned why some students’ performance would trigger higher funding than others.
“We are basically telling students that certain students, we care more if they grow than others,” he said. “And that’s where (schools) will put their focus.”
The state gives additional funding for schools to educate students in these groups, Vas said, saying that any additional resources needed should come through the formula that funds schools rather than an incentive program.
Monsees said he worried that removing the boost would hurt districts with a greater population of low-income students and English-language learners.
“It is possible that the weightings (in the formula) are never going to be enough to meet the needs and close those gaps in every case, so having the extra incentive still could provide additional value,” he said.
Michael Podgursky, an economics professor at the University of Missouri–Columbia, said the program could be a source of inequity without the extra funding for dedicated student groups. Eliminating this piece would cause “a disproportionate share of the bonus funding will go to wealthier school districts,” he said.
The group based its model off of Tennessee’s outcome-based incentives, which doubles financial incentives when economically disadvantaged students hit performance targets.
Tennessee is in its third year with its current funding model, including the performance incentives. Monsees spoke to Tennessee’s education finance officer, who said the state has seen growth in achievement but also had numerous factors leading to this improvement.
“Not a lot of states have done this type of incentive type work, so we’d be among a small number that would be heading down this path,” Monsees said. “There is going to be a lot to be learned, both by our own state and by continuing to study others.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/090925_monsees1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-12-04 06:57:30.690286

The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The bill would also allow those already sentenced to life as a juvenile the opportunity to appeal and adjust their sentences after serving 15 years for crimes that didn’t involve murder and at 20 years for those who were convicted of homicide.
Two U.S. Supreme Court rulings (Miller v. Alabama, 2012, and Montgomery versus Louisiana, 2016) have held that life without parole for a juvenile comes under the category of cruel and unusual punishment. The Court has found that youth shouldn’t be held to the same level of accountability as adults because they are not psychologically or emotionally as mature and their brains are not fully developed.
According to an April 2024 report by the Campaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youth, “Unusual & Unequal: The unfinished business of ending life without parole for children in the United States,” 28 states have banned juvenile sentences of life without parole (JLWOP):
“The scientific understanding that young people have limited decision-making abilities and impulse control informed widespread, rapid rejection of JLWOP in state legislatures, the Supreme Court, state courts, and the court of public opinion. Declaring that youth is ‘a mitigating factor’ that must be considered by sentencing judges in Miller v. Alabama (2012), the U.S. Supreme Court held that life without parole is disproportionate for the vast majority of youth.”
Nikki Olson, founder and executive director of Wisconsin Alliance for Youth Justice, is one of the advocates pursuing the legislation in Wisconsin.
“Their liberty was taken away before they even had full rights because they were kids,” she said of juveniles sentenced to life. “We are talking about people who weren’t even 18, who couldn’t legally smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol or couldn’t even drive without their parents’ permission. They couldn’t sign contracts or be on a jury or vote in society. We understand that kids are fundamentally different. The science says kids are fundamentally different. The Supreme Court says they are fundamentally different. We would like Wisconsin law to reflect that as well.”
Two past Republican sponsors of the proposed Wisconsin legislation are Rep. Todd Novak and Sen. Jesse James.

“Ending juvenile life without parole in Wisconsin is not just about reforming our justice system; it’s about restoring hope, potential and the promise of a future for our youth,” Novak has said. “This would also ensure that Wisconsin remains in compliance with the United States Supreme Court precedent.”
Sen. James has also gone on the record endorsing the bill. “The science is clear: brains are still developing. They cannot fully comprehend the extent of their actions,” James said. “For example, how is a 15-year-old supposed to understand life without parole when that sentence is literally quadruple the entire time they’ve been alive. People can grow; people can change, especially when their brains are still forming. Juveniles deserve a second chance.”
According to Sen. James’ office, the bill will be reintroduced as soon as the Department of Corrections (DOC) provides data on how many people currently incarcerated in Wisconsin  would be eligible to apply for a sentence adjustment if the bill is passed. The advocacy group Kids Forward puts the number somewhere north of 100.
Sen. James was asked whether his Republican colleagues known for supporting tough-on-crime legislation would also back the bill.
Sen. Jesse James (Screenshot via WisEye)
“As legislators, we introduce legislation with the hope that it’ll pass,” he said. “It is a part of our job to advocate for our bills and highlight the potential benefits and positive impact of the legislation with supportive research. Last session was my first time authoring this bill, and I’m still learning new information about this issue myself. We unfortunately didn’t get the opportunity to have a public hearing on this bill in the Senate last year, so myself and other advocates have not had the chance to testify in support and provide that background and context to members of the Senate.”
Convicted as a juvenile, serving life as an adult

Zachary Reid, 33, incarcerated at the New Lisbon Correctional Institution, has been in prison for 17 years. He is serving a life sentence, but he can apply for extended supervision after serving 40 years. If there isn’t a change in the law or Gov. Tony Evers doesn’t offer him a commutation or pardon, Reid is looking at another 23 years of incarceration.
If the bill does become law, Reid said he would apply at his 20-year mark, and he would be granted a hearing for a sentence adjustment.
The current language of the bill says the hearing should consider “relevant information” including “expert testimony and other information about the youthful offender’s participation in any available educational, vocational, community service, or other programs, the youthful offender’s work reports and psychological evaluations, evidence of the youthful offender’s remorse and the youthful offender’s major violation of institutional rules, if any.”
In 2008, when Reid was 16, he was charged with killing his father. Then, in 2009, a Winnebago County trial jury convicted him of first degree  intentional homicide, and he was given a life sentence which he began to serve in Waupun Correctional Institution when he turned 17.
Reid continues to contend that the death of his father was not intentional but an accident and that  Reid was defending himself from his alcoholic, abusive father, who was wielding a knife and making threatening gestures. Reid claims he choked his father with the intention that his father would pass out, not die.
But Reid also admits he did some things after his father’s death that he shouldn’t have, such as placing the body in the trunk of his father’s car instead of reporting the death immediately to the police.
 At 16, Reid said, he was a very immature young person, often in trouble, using drugs, not attending school, and stealing, making many poor decisions.
“At that age, you think you’re an adult; you think you know everything,” he said. “Those things adults tell you to do, some certain things, and you think you know better. And I was guilty of all the same types of thoughts like that, of just thinking that I really knew what was best for my life.”
When Reid was arrested in October of his junior year of high school, he had not attended very many days of class, a trend of skipping school he had started as a sophomore.
“And I just thought I didn’t have to prove anything to anybody, like, I know this stuff,” he said. “Why do I have to prove to a teacher that I know? Just an ignorant way of thinking and really low maturity level compared to how I am now. I look back, and I just kind of shake my head a lot of the time. There’s just a lot of the stuff that I did, and on top of it, I was doing drugs and drinking. At the time, I was already binge drinking. I started drinking really bad when I was 15, and it really picked up even more when I was 16, because my grandmother passed, and I used it as basically a reason to implode. And so the combination of being immature and the drugs and drinking, I was making a lot of really poor decisions.”
At Waupun, Reid could have been a prison statistic with an attitude and gotten into drugs and gangs and trouble, but instead he decided to take a different path by learning to weld and machining and later to crochet and donate items to charities. He was transferred to New Lisbon, where he continued to work as a welder and machinist, and then five years ago, he began training dogs that assist the blind.

“We do basically high-level obedience training, preparing the dogs to be able to go to harness school, where they learn the actual skills of working with a blind person or visually impaired person, to basically give them back their life, to be able to get them out of their house and be able not to be stuck there,” he said.
In prison, Reid said, he’s applied himself to learn new skills and gain an education.
“I have valuable skills that Wisconsin needs right now, you know, like welding and fabricating is a really in-demand training, even the machining,” he said. “Like I can run a mill, a lathe, you know, that type of stuff. I’ve gotten two vocational certificates since I’ve been here. I got an electromechanical service technician certificate. It’s also part of a pre-apprenticeship program through the Department of Workforce Development. I’m actually a certified professional dog trainer, like I got that through Chippewa Valley Technical College. I just finished my associate’s degree earlier this year, so I have an Associate of Science through Milwaukee Area Technical College.”
Reid also intends to pursue a bachelor’s degree from Marquette University in peace studies.
“I contribute to society right now in the environment I’m in, so I have no doubt that I can contribute in a meaningful way out there,” said Reid.
Since he has been in prison, Reid claims he has only received two conduct reports or complaints, one in 2010, his first year in prison, and another in 2016 for a tattoo.
Not many 33-year-old men have to wake up every day and live with the consequences of an action they took as a 16-year-old.
“Most of the time I try to just, kind of like, live in the right now,” he said. “I know it’s kind of like, you hear that phrase a lot, like live in the now type of stuff. I try to do that to the best of my ability as a coping mechanism, because, dwelling, obviously, on what happened and everything like that, like it was my dad, you know, so to me, I think it’s even a little bit more burdensome than for most of these people in that, I mean, my intent wasn’t to kill him. I was trying to just get him to stop attacking me in the situation we were in, and he passed away. So it’s like it’s not only just the guilt of taking a life, but it’s like I was so drug-addled or whatever it was, but it’s like I failed in that moment, like that was my failure.”
In-prison testimonies
At a future hearing to have his sentence adjusted, Reid would likely hear from others who would offer endorsements.
Patricia Muraczewski provided the dog training for the residents in New Lisbon and worked with Reid for two years. She was impressed by his work ethic and character and believes Reid should be considered for an early release.
“He was a member of the Paw Forward team of inmates who train dogs for the visually impaired,” she said.  “Mr. Reid was extremely diligent in class attendance and was very serious in acquiring and understanding the methods needed to train each dog that he was partnered with.  He had a very relaxed demeanor and got along with all of the other teams.  Even though there were frustrations at times with new instructors and conflicting material, he never expressed any anger.”
She added, “Over the course of my time in New Lisbon, never was Mr. Reid disrespectful and he never broke any rules or overstepped his position.” 
“Of all of the inmates I had worked with during that time, in my opinion, he was the inmate most likely to be successful when released and least likely to reoffend,” she said, adding,“During the four years this program has been in existence at New Lisbon none of the men that have been released have reoffended.” 
Brandon Horak knew Reid as a fellow resident at Waupun and later at New Lisbon. Horak had been sentenced to 10 years of incarceration for felony murder in the commission of an armed robbery after he set up a drug dealer for a robbery that resulted in the murder of the dealer.
“I wasn’t in a good state of mind,” he said when he first entered Waupun and met Reid.  “I had just been sentenced to 10 years in prison, so I met him in Waupun and he ended up encouraging me to get a job, so we worked in the laundry room together for a year and a half or two years. He encouraged me to get into school, and I didn’t want to do any of this stuff, so he was a really big influence on my life.”

Both Reid and Horak left Waupun and then later met up again in New Lisbon, where Reid had begun training dogs, and Horak said he noticed that Reid had lost a defensive, protective shield that many residents carry in amaximum security prisons like Waupun.
“I asked him why he didn’t care if someone stole something from him, which is obviously a big no-no in prison, and he said the dog program had changed his life and he had something to live for,” said Horak.
Even though Horak wasn’t officially in the dog program, Reid taught Horak what he had learned, and after he left prison, Horak set up his own dog training business based on Reid’s mentoring, a business called EDU Training.
“We train dogs in people’s homes, and to be honest, it was all thanks to Zach,” he said.
Out of prison, Horak often reaches back to Reid and his cellmate for advice on working with client pets.
“I’ve never been back to jail,” Horak said “I have a full-time job. I own a business. I do all this stuff, and I honestly do not believe I would have been able to do it without his (Reid’s) help. I just talked to him last week and he always tells me, ‘You better be doing good out there.’”
In prison, Horak said, he saw many people released and then come right back. Because of that, he doesn’t automatically believe everyone deserves leniency. Still, he says, Reid isn’t one of those who should be in prison and he believes he could do more good on the outside.
Engaged to be married 
Reid and his fiancée Samantha, got to know each other as pen pals in 2013, and that developed into a relationship in 2018. In 2019, they became engaged. In 2024, she moved from Florida to Wisconsin to be closer to Reid.
“The only reason we’re not married right now is that we’re hoping to get him out one day,” said Samantha, “so we can have just a normal marriage out here, versus having a marriage done or a wedding ceremony done inside the prison.”
Samantha said she has been communicating with Reid since they were both in their early 20s, and she’s seen him mature over the years.
“But just even in the last maybe five years, it’s just blown up like he has just matured and wants to do so much good,” she said. “ … He loves that he can actually make a difference, and he’s done other charity programs that even the prison doesn’t offer. He crochets hearts for suicide prevention.”
She said it recently occurred to her how much Reid is trying to do good for others and also maintain a relationship with her from prison.
“That is work, too, to just step up and almost religiously call somebody regularly, and never let me down, and to take care of me with all this distance,” she said.
If the legislation is passed, Samantha says that Reid would be the “poster child for this bill.”
“It’s like he went out of his way to get welding experience,” she said. “He went out of his way to do charity work. He went out of his way to do all these wonderful things over the years. And I mean, just since I’ve known him, he’s grown and matured. He’s checking off every box he can possibly check off, and could prove that over the course of 17 years, like he is not that person [that he was at 16], and look at all these good things he is doing and all the things he could contribute to society, and right now we’re just warehousing him. We’re wasting all these taxpayer dollars housing somebody that is very clearly not a threat.”

Credit: Courtesy of CBS SolarThousands of Michigan families were preparing to save on their energy bills this year through local Solar for All projects, including affordable housing complexes in Oakland County to rural communities in the Upper Peninsula. Those plans are now on hold after federal officials announced they would cancel the program, even though the funds were already distributed and projects were underway.
The Michigan Attorney General is right to challenge this reversal. At stake isn’t just funding, it’s fairness. The sudden halt means uncertainty for families expecting lower bills and for small businesses counting on steady work. Michigan had received $156 million to bring affordable, reliable energy to 18,000 households across the state and drive investment in the state’s clean energy workforce—all now in limbo.
With so many clean energy tax credits repealed under Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” it’s vital to protect programs like Solar for All, which ensure the benefits of the clean energy transition reach people of all income levels.
 While solar adopters have grown more diverse, they still tend to be more affluent because rooftop solar is largely limited to individuals who own their own homes. Solar for All was created in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act so that low-income, rural, and disadvantaged communities could access clean, affordable, and reliable solar energy. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In Michigan, the Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) has already awarded $13.9 million in grants to fund pilot programs for projects like installing solar on homes serving low-income and formerly homeless seniors in Oakland County and building rooftop solar for households with residents who rely on electric medical devices in the Upper Peninsula. All of the projects were designed to deliver at least a 20% reduction in household electricity costs for the participants while supporting local job growth by connecting solar installers and maintenance workers to new opportunities. EGLE Director Philip Roos estimated that the program would have created 700 high-quality jobs across the state.
None of this, unfortunately, is all that surprising. Sudden funding reversals have become a recurring pattern under the second Trump administration, often followed by court challenges and reinstatements. In fact, Solar for All contracts were frozen briefly before a federal judge ordered a reinstatement in April. The same happened with the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, which was eventually restored after a judge rejected the Department of Transportation’s efforts to cancel the program. In its press release unfreezing NEVI grants, the DOT acknowledged that it couldn’t withhold funding that was already approved by Congress. “We will respect Congress’ will,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement.
Solar for All seems to be following the same trajectory. It, too, was a congressionally approved program with federal funding already appropriated. But unlike previous attempts that stopped funds from going out, the Trump administration is trying to rescind money it has already disbursed. Even if Nessel’s office can get Solar for All funds reinstated, damage from the chaos, uncertainty, and paused work will have already been done.
As electricity bills continue to rise, no one disputes that we need more energy generation to keep up with demand and maintain affordability. But the way we achieve that goal matters. Halting programs that make energy cleaner and more affordable for working families is the wrong approach. Likewise, pulling the rug out from under workers and small businesses that rely on these programs will only lead to volatility in our local economies and undermine job security. We need policies that bring reliable, affordable energy to Michiganders without leaving anyone behind. And that means supporting programs like Solar for All.
Michigan has a rich history of innovation. That includes everything from manufacturing to mobility to energy. But innovation requires consistency. When programs like Solar for All are disrupted midstream, the real costs fall on families, workers, and small businesses. We need stable policies that keep energy affordable, create local jobs, and ensure that every Michigan community can share in the benefits of a cleaner, more reliable future.

(Getty Images)Indiana school officials are warning that the state’s new property tax overhaul is pushing districts into an unprecedented financial squeeze — which dozens of Hoosier superintendents say is already forcing staff cuts, delaying maintenance and increasing the likelihood for other reductions. 
Their concerns are at the heart of a new statewide survey released Thursday by the Indiana Coalition for Public Education, first published by the Indiana Capital Chronicle. 
The report highlights how Senate Enrolled Act 1 is reshaping local school budgets just months after its passage.
The survey — completed by 148 of the state’s 290 traditional public school corporations — found that 95.3% of Indiana districts expect SEA 1 to negatively affect their funding in 2025, and 99.3% expect impacts in future years.
Concerns cut across geography and school size. Large suburban districts worried about their ability to accommodate growth without operational dollars, while small rural districts said they face “existential threats” in the form of potential staff layoffs, school consolidations and the reduction of essential services if operational funding continues to shrink.
Urban districts additionally said long-standing structural disadvantages make them especially vulnerable to revenue compression, noting that dense populations, aging buildings and higher concentrations of high-needs students leave them with fewer ways to absorb shrinking tax collections.
Story continues below.
ICPE_2025-School-Funding-Report
 
For many superintendents, the financial strain isn’t a future concern, but a problem already unfolding inside their buildings. 
Survey responses were kept anonymous in ICPE’s published report.
One superintendent described being unable to cover even the most basic operating costs, saying their district’s finances had reached the point where “I cannot pay my utility bill,” and warned that rising gas, electricity and insurance costs are outpacing any funds available to cover them.
Another district leader said the combined effect of inflation and the property tax cap changes mean their operations fund is shrinking each year while costs climb. 
“The negative impacts of SEA 1 cannot be overstated,” the superintendent wrote, adding that “uncontrollable cost increases in utilities, transportation and insurance cannot be addressed adequately” under the new levy limits.
Indiana schools depend on local property taxes to fund essential services like custodial work, transportation, facility maintenance and bus purchases — areas where costs have risen sharply in the last decade.
SEA 1 decreases the taxable assessed value available to school corporations through expanded deductions that phase in through 2031. Although the law was intended to provide tax relief to property owners, superintendents emphasized in the survey that it has weakened the financial foundation for operating public schools.
Several respondents pointed to a mismatch between what’s expected of schools and the dollars they receive. 
One rural superintendent reported that their district had “a history of doing more with less,” but that the law’s projected reductions in the operations fund would soon make it “very difficult to simply run school.”
A suburban superintendent separately noted that long-range financial planning has become nearly impossible because “constantly changing regulations” leave districts unsure how much revenue they will receive from one year to the next.
Cuts ripple across classrooms, buildings and school services
The survey found that 65.3% of Indiana districts that responded have already reduced or will reduce support staff, and 55.8% have already reduced or will reduce teaching staff.
Combined with the districts that are considering reductions, more than 90% reported that cuts to staffing or facilities are on the table.
In write-in responses, superintendents said they’re postponing or canceling bus purchases, scaling back technology upgrades, holding off on building repairs, and in some cases, preparing for building closures. 
A suburban superintendent described a list of cost-saving measures large enough to reshape daily school operations — including the possibility of a four-day week, scaling back HVAC use to the minimum tolerable levels, and even “closing playgrounds if funds do not support adequate repairs after inspections.”
A different rural leader said their district would soon need to choose between raising tens of millions through a referendum or cutting what is, for many rural districts, a critical service.
“We have no choice but to either pass an operating referendum or eliminate transportation,” the superintendent wrote.
Others emphasized in the survey that cuts now reach well beyond the classroom. 
One superintendent said increased legislative mandates have made it impossible to balance budgets responsibly, emphasizing that “it’s impossible to ‘do more with less’ when everything else continues to increase in cost.”
Another superintendent detailed how their district’s operations fund will be less than $450,000 by 2028 — falling below the $600,000-per-year utility bill.
Superintendents express frustration
In addition to widespread reports of fiscal stress, other remarks captured anger and exhaustion among school leaders who said the state has placed them in an “impossible” position. 
Multiple superintendents stressed that Indiana has simultaneously increased schools’ responsibilities and expanded alternative education models that draw funds away from traditional districts while restricting the revenue streams that public schools rely on to meet those obligations.
One rural superintendent called the situation “a manufactured crisis.”
Another expressed disbelief that state lawmakers embraced referendums as the state’s new funding pressure valve while working to defeat those same measures locally.










The negative impacts of SEA 1 cannot be overstated.


– survey response from an unnamed Indiana school superintendent


“I’m shocked that the politicians made us a referendum state and now one of them actively tried to defeat all referendums,” the superintendent wrote. “You can’t make that make sense.”
A different superintendent wrote that policy shifts have pushed them to consider leaving the state altogether: “I’m seriously considering working as a superintendent in another state. The continuing changes in legislation keep moving the goal line.”
Many survey respondents said they feel the burden now falls on local voters to keep basic school functions afloat. 
Leaders in 90% of urban districts and 84.8% of suburban districts said they’re considering or pursuing operating referendums. 
“No district should need to run a referendum to adequately pay for expected services in the community,” one suburban superintendent wrote. “Any school below the ‘average’ per pupil funding continues to fall further and further behind.”
What schools need — and expect
When asked what funding increase would be needed to provide the services their communities expect, respondents offered percentages ranging from 2% to 20%, with an average of 7.6% — far above the increases approved by lawmakers in the most recent state budget. 
The 2025 state budget increased K-12 tuition support by roughly 2% each year of the biennium.
Several superintendents said the increases championed by lawmakers don’t reflect the true cost of new mandates.
“When you give a 2% increase but force us to pay for curricular material out of (the) Education Fund, that is NOT new money,” one superintendent wrote. “That is a 0% increase.”
Some school leaders said the only workable solution would be a reversal of the property tax changes themselves. An urban superintendent wrote that their district might survive if lawmakers acted quickly.
“If SEA 1 was completely repealed,” the local official wrote, “we could make it work.”
Others were less hopeful, pointing to projections that show continued enrollment declines, rising costs and a shrinking property tax base that will leave districts competing for scarce dollars.
“It continues to cost more to run a corporation,” said one rural superintendent, “but we continually lose funding streams to make it happen.”

Following the death of Rep. John Eklund, Wyoming politicians move quickly to fill the vacancy before the 2026 budget session.
The post Three candidates selected to fill Eklund’s legislative seat appeared first on WyoFile .","CHEYENNE—Following the death of Rep. John Eklund, R-Cheyenne, on Nov. 14, Wyoming politicians had to act quickly to fill the vacancy before the 2026 budget session kicks off in February.
Because Eklund was a Republican whose district, House District 10, was wholly located within Laramie County, the Laramie County Republican Party was tasked with nominating three candidates to succeed Eklund.
Monday evening, party officials selected Sharon Fain, Justin Fornstrom and Ron Rabou.
The three were selected by a ballot of Laramie County GOP precinct committee members following a brief introduction and Q&A portion, where candidates were given 30 seconds to answer questions predetermined by the party.

Now, it is up to Laramie County commissioners to decide which of the three will be the new representative for HD 10. Commission Chairman Gunnar Malm announced Tuesday evening that the selection meeting will begin at 3:30 p.m. Saturday in the Commissioners’ Board Room, located on the third floor of the Laramie County Governmental Complex, 310 W. 19th St. Commissioners will interview each of the three finalists, then deliberate and pick one of them to fill the open seat.
When the commissioners, along with Platte County commissioners, were involved with this process in August to replace Sen. Darin Smith following his resignation, one of their primary concerns was selecting someone with a thorough understanding of property taxes.
While Commissioner Troy Thompson said this is certainly important for a candidate to understand, his top priority is identifying someone who will be there for the commission and pick up when he or any of their constituents call.
“I think that’s more important than anything else,” he said.
“We have three really good candidates that came out of the party meeting last night, and all three would be exceptional.”
Sharon Fain
Fain decided to pursue the vacant seat largely because she felt she could best serve eastern Laramie County through her experience in business and economic development.
In her letter to the Laramie County GOP requesting consideration, Fain wrote that she believes in “defending private property rights, advancing responsible and limited taxation, and ensuring that Wyoming’s agricultural producers and legacy energy industries can thrive without unnecessary interference.”
Fain has experience in energy and public policy, as well as a commitment to agriculture.
“The residents deserve responsible and experienced leadership in the state House,” she told the Wyoming Tribune Eagle Tuesday. “With Rep. John Eklund’s passing, these are big boots to fill.”
Early in her career as a television news producer in Oklahoma, Fain was asked to relocate to Baghdad, Iraq. Instead of moving to the other side of the globe, she and her husband, Greater Cheyenne Chamber of Commerce President/CEO Dale Steenbergen, decided to relocate to Laramie County, where they’ve lived for the last 20 years. The couple maintains a sixth-generation purebred Gelbvieh cow-calf operation.
“The opportunities here are limitless, but we all need to work together to ensure that we have a financially stable future for Wyoming,” she said.
Now, she serves as the external affairs and marketing vice president for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Wyoming, and serves on the board of the Wyoming Congressional Award Council following a career of more than 16 years in energy communications, crisis communication, business development and strategic communications in Wyoming.
When asked Tuesday about what her priorities would be if selected to serve in the Legislature, Fain told the Tribune Eagle there’s a need to evaluate property taxes and have continued conversations about economic drivers for the state to diversify the economy to eliminate or lessen the impacts of the traditional boom-and-bust cycle.
When Sen. Taft Love, R-Cheyenne, was selected by county commissioners to fill the seat made vacant by Smith’s resignation, the most common point of discussion was property taxes.
Fain said that to address the decrease in funding due to property tax cuts, there needs to be a healthy discussion at the state level about the impacts these decisions have on communities’ ability to provide safe and reliable services.
“The health and safety of our communities are critical, and we need to ensure that we are addressing all of these issues before making such decisions that impact the day-to-day lives and safety of our communities,” she said.
Justin Fornstrom
Fornstrom is a lifelong resident of Laramie County and the current mayor of Pine Bluffs, where he graduated high school before earning a degree from the University of Wyoming in 1995.
He primarily considers himself a farmer and owns an agricultural operation with his brother, Mark. The pair also owns other commercial businesses in the area.
When asked why he put his name in to fill the vacant seat, Fornstrom said he’s motivated by a sense of loyalty to his state and to his area.
“John Eklund was a great man and a great public servant, great legislator,” he said. “I just wanted somebody [to succeed him] who would be an advocate like he was for agriculture and Laramie County and for the whole state.”
If Fornstrom is selected, he said he will resign from his post as mayor of Pine Bluffs, and the current council members will select someone to temporarily fill the vacancy until the next election cycle in 2026.
Fornstrom said that, if appointed, he is well aware he would be joining the House around two months before the 2026 budget session kicks off. Since it’s a budget session, he said developing and passing a responsible budget would be his top priority.
He said his other priorities include being a strong advocate for Wyoming’s agriculture sector and natural resources, as well as supporting Wyoming’s legacy energy sector. Fornstrom also noted he wants to pursue avenues to diversify Wyoming’s economy.
“I strive to be a good leader, and I enjoy listening to people and debating the issues. I hope that interest and skill set would serve me well in moving forward here,” he said.
When asked about property taxes, Fornstrom said his more than 16 years serving on a county fire board and his more recent experience as mayor gave him a thorough understanding of the issue.
“I am concerned that, currently, we are taking the approach that we were just reducing property taxes without any real, well-developed plans for how we backfill that money,” he said. “Government can probably afford to tighten their belts a little bit, but these are pretty drastic cuts, and more proposals for cuts are on the way, whether it be by the ballot or by the Legislature.”
Ron Rabou
Rabou is a fifth-generation Wyomingite and operates an organic farm near Albin. He said one reason he decided to pursue the vacant state seat was that Eklund was a friend of his, and he saw this as an opportunity to continue his legacy, while also giving back to the community that supported him as he and his wife operated a business and raised a family in the area.
“It’s an opportunity to serve the community that has blessed us for so many years, and in a place where we’ve raised three boys, and a chance to continue to lift up the community out here and continue to serve what’s treated us so well over all these years.”
In addition to being a local businessman and more recently pursuing energy technology opportunities in the form of carbon capture, utilization and sequestration, Rabou serves on many volunteer boards in the community.
He has previously been elected to the Laramie County Community College Board of Trustees, where he served as chairman, and served on boards for Wyoming Agriculture in the Classroom, Cheyenne Arts Council, the Purple and Gold Legacy Foundation, the American Society of Agriculture, the University of Wyoming Dean’s Advisory Board and currently serves as UW’s national representative for the Council for Agricultural Research, Extension and Teaching.
“I think that experience helps,” he said. “I think that certainly listening is one of the most important skills all of us can have, and certainly will be a major player in how I would legislate and lead in this position.”
Rabou said he will let this philosophy of listening drive his policy decisions, noting that it is a little premature for him to note what his top priorities would be as a state politician when asked Tuesday.
“I want to listen to what’s important to the people out here, and my mission will be to carry their best interest forward,” he said.
When asked for his position on property taxes, Rabou noted he is for limited government, but acknowledged there is still much to learn, absorb and understand, again leaning on his philosophy of listening to and representing constituents.
“Whatever issues are facing the Legislature, I certainly know [property tax] is a big one. I think that it’s important to really get both sides and as much perspective as possible before one actually dials in on what an actual solution would be, or what side of the fence you would be on,” he said.

Lifts will be turning at Jackson Thursday and Targhee Friday. A warm and dry November has delayed the season's start. 
The post December snow helps Wyoming ski areas begin to open appeared first on WyoFile .","Ski lifts will begin to run Thursday in northwestern Wyoming — marking the official opening day of a season delayed by a mild and dry November. 
Wyoming’s largest resort, Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, will launch its 60th season with three lifts running. Neighboring Grand Targhee resort will follow with its opening day on Friday. 
Elsewhere across the state, managers are hoping for assistance from Mother Nature. December has ushered in snowfall and colder temperatures across Wyoming, but for resorts that don’t have snowmaking infrastructure, like Antelope Butte in the Bighorn Mountains, there’s still a little ways to go. 
Storms brought about 4-6 inches of snow this week, Antelope Butte Guest Services Manager Tim Brown said Wednesday, but “there’s still grass poking up through the snow.”
November was drier and balmier than normal in Wyoming. Temperatures were as much as 10-15 degrees Fahrenheit warmer for much of the month, according to the National Weather Service Office in Riverton.

Some people likely enjoyed the mild sunny days, but the weather stymied snowmaking and other preparations for skiing. Jackson Hole Mountain Resort originally planned to open last Friday. White Pine near Pinedale moved its original Dec. 5 target to Dec. 12. Snow King in Jackson will open its scenic gondola on Friday but hasn’t announced when skiing will begin. 
For skiers antsy to get on the slopes, here are opening updates and projections for Wyoming’s resorts. 
Antelope Butte
This small ski area, located off of U.S. Highway 14 between Shell and Sheridan, has a target opening day of Dec. 19. Temperatures at the 8,400-foot-base-elevation mountain started dropping starting in late November, and this week’s weather bodes well. “It’s been coming down pretty regularly for the last 24 to 48 hours,” Brown said Wednesday. 
Jackson Hole Mountain Resort 
Three lifts — Teewinot, Apres Vous and lower Sweetwater — will be open to skiers Thursday at the state’s most high-profile resort. Crews have been making snow, and natural storms have helped fill in the base, with 2 new inches reported Wednesday morning. The mountain reports some 34 inches of natural snowfall mid-mountain so far, but cautioned skiers that “early-season conditions still exist, and all guests are advised to stay out of closed areas and look for hazards.” 
The resort hopes to announce additional terrain or lift openings the second week of December. 
Area skiers are heartened by weather forecasts, which call for a 100% chance of snow in the Jackson region this weekend. 
“What is certain is snowfall, what isn’t certain is how much,” The Bridger-Teton Avalanche Center said in a Tuesday posting. “The forecast area could receive over 2 inches of snow water equivalent and over 30 inches of snow by Monday morning.”
Grand Targhee 
The northwestern Wyoming resort, which sits near the Idaho border, will open Friday with two lifts. “The last few days have provided us the necessary conditions to make some snow off the Shoshone lift,” the resort announced Tuesday, thanking its snowmakers and groomers for their efforts. The mountain also cautioned skiers about thin spots until the base gets filled in. 

Hogadon Basin Ski Area posted this on Facebook Nov. 25. “Round 1 of snowmaking for the 2025-2026 season has started!” the post read. (Screengrab)

Hogadon Basin Ski Area 
The slopes of Hogadon Basin Ski Area were still brown in mid-November, but Casper’s weather plunged toward winter in the last week. Casper experienced a record-breaking low on Saturday of -15 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the National Weather Service, and also received a few inches of snow this week. 
The mountain plans to open its beginner area on Dec. 13, Ski Area Superintendent Ryan Butler said Wednesday. Snowmaking crews had exhausted the water supply by Wednesday, he said. Once it recharges they will resume. 
Meadowlark Ski Lodge
Meadowlark Ski Lodge, which sits in the southern Bighorn Mountains, doesn’t typically announce its opening date weeks in advance, co-owner Holly Jones said Wednesday. Opening day is too dependent on the whims of Mother Nature. 
Instead, Jones said, management waits until the mountain is ready, then updates Facebook. “We post it online, and then everybody shows up to ski,” she said. 
The two-lift mountain, which sits off of U.S. Highway 16 between Ten Sleep and Buffalo, has some base coverage, and snowmakers are making more under the lifts, she said. Though reluctant to pinpoint a date, Jones said the aim is to be welcoming skiers by Dec. 15. 
Pine Creek 
This small family-operated resort near Cokeville isn’t quite ready to open, operations director Alicia Etcheverry told WyoFile in an email Wednesday. But it typically gets lifts turning by mid-December. 
“It all depends on snow levels and right now we are waiting on a couple more good storms,” she wrote. “We have around a foot of snow and the cold temps are helping preserve it.”
The resort will update its website when it has an opening set.

Snow King Mountain
Snow King Mountain Resort in the town of Jackson will open its scenic gondola and its “Cowboy Coaster” Friday, but isn’t quite ready for snowsports on its 500 acres. “Skiing and boarding soon to follow!” reads its website. 
Snowy Range
Snowy Range in southeastern Wyoming plans to open Dec. 12. This week’s storm brought a blanket of fresh snow on Wednesday and temperatures in the teens. The National Weather Service is forecasting more snow this weekend. 
White Pine 
White Pine, a two-lift resort outside of Pinedale, also moved its opening date back from an original target of Dec. 5 to Dec. 12. In addition, the mountain announced it will offer a new Thursday-through-Sunday schedule this season. Snow looks likely Friday night.

Our disagreements, regardless of how trivial or necessary, are becoming ever more bitter, writes columnist David Romtvedt.
The post The home I would come home to appeared first on WyoFile .","According to the United Nations’ 2025 World Urbanization Prospects report, Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital, has displaced Tokyo as the most populated city in the world. With 42 million residents, Jakarta’s population is about the same as that of Canada’s. The report also notes that 45% of the world’s 8.2 billion human inhabitants live in cities.

Opinion

I’ve just returned from the Basque Country, where people always surrounded me. I mostly walked everywhere — 3-5 miles a day on packed streets where, when it rained, we engaged in a kind of umbrella war jockeying for space on the wet sidewalks. My trip home took 27 hours — two bus rides, three airplanes, three airports, and finally a car trip from the airport in Wyoming. 
I was worn out and happy to be home, to be welcomed back to silence and space. The Basque Autonomous Region — Euskadi, where I usually spend a month or so each year, has an area of 2,800 square miles and a population of 2.2 million. Johnson County, Wyoming, where I live for the rest of the year, has an area of 4,175 square miles with a population of 8,500, about half of whom live in Buffalo, the county seat.
While I was out of the country, a neighbor contacted my wife to say that she loves the columns I write, even though she mostly disagrees with what I say. This is a generous comment reflecting the degree to which we are acquainted with one another in small towns. But it’s also a statement that’s becoming increasingly rare, as our disagreements have become ever more bitter. Our social discourse has been degraded by social distance — digital interaction rather than face-to-face — and by living among strangers, both of which seem to encourage vulgarity, aggressive hostility, personal animosity, self-interest, and perhaps most alarming, an inability to imagine the lives of others, to feel what others feel.
One marker for this lack of feeling is seen in the Trump administration’s murder of suspected drug traffickers in international waters — no arrests, no charges, no due process, no trials. Our government announced that certain people were drug traffickers and ordered them murdered.
While I don’t know if they were responding specifically to this, seven members of Congress, all with military and intelligence backgrounds, released a video in which one of them, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly said, “Our laws are clear. You can refuse illegal orders.” Kelly, a former Navy fighter pilot and astronaut, was referring to the U.S. Military Code of Justice and the U.S. Manual for Courts-Martial, which state that the military requirement to obey orders “does not apply to a patently illegal order, such as one that directs the commission of a crime.”
The response to Kelly’s statement from retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, who served as U.S. commander of Basic Training, was that the order to refuse illegal orders, first stated for recruits in George Washington’s Continental Army, is given to all recruits to this day and is an expectation placed on all military personnel. But that was not President Donald Trump’s response. The president wrote on his Truth Social platform that Kelly and the others had engaged in “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH.” The president also reposted another Truth Social user who wrote, “HANG THEM.”
Secretary of War (Defense) Pete Hegseth initiated a Pentagon investigation into Kelly, citing the Military Code of Justice. Kelly, seemingly with some degree of humor, said, “He’s going to prosecute me under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for reciting the Uniform Code of Military Justice … It’s almost like you can’t make this shit up.” Kelly’s fellow Arizona senator, Ruben Gallegos, said Kelly “was doing his duty and just reminding people about their rights as service members.” Gallegos added, “And Secretary Hegseth … fuck you guys.”
These two little linguistic intrusions — “you can’t make this shit up,” and “fuck you” are revealing tics. How is it that we’ve come to accept this language in public discourse and in print? How is it that we’ve abandoned what we formerly saw as respect for those with whom we disagree and now see as weakness? Or am I wrong and the inclusion of this formerly unacceptable language simply reveals how strongly our lines are drawn, how pressured we are, how much we feel we can only make our point if we present it in the most extreme way possible?
And what about my neighbor saying she loves reading my columns even though she disagrees with what I say? I see her there at her kitchen table reading calmly and patiently. In response to her generosity, I can only say thank you. This is the home I would come home to.

Jeffrey Rawlings had prepared a “cute speech” for Tuesday’s “Be a Light Gala,” the annual fundraiser for the N.C. Coalition to End Homelessness.
But Rawlings, a senior analyst for homeless services for the City of Durham and a coalition board member, said the times called for something different, so he scrapped the “cute speech” in favor of a more direct message.
“We are under attack. The people that we serve are under attack,” said Rawlings, referring to Trump administration policies that he and other advocates for people experiencing homelessness believe are harmful.
Rawlings, who has twice experienced homelessness, said the Trump administration is attempting to “criminalize what we do and to make us do it a different way.”
“I will say this with absolute honesty: Housing First is not perfect, but it’s the best thing out there,” Rawlings said. “There’s not anything better.”
Rawlings was referring to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) dramatic shift away from the Housing First model, which prioritizes immediate access to permanent housing without preconditions such as sobriety or enrollment in drug treatment. 
The Trump administration is making deep cuts to funding for long-term housing and redirecting it to transitional housing with mandatory work requirements and treatment for addiction. 
HUD announced last month that it would change its focus, shifting two thirds of the $3.9 billion Continuum of Care (CoC) grants program to transitional housing and other short-term interventions for people experiencing homelessness. The program is the largest federal grant program specifically for assisting people experiencing homelessness. Much of that money has been used for years for permanent housing or subsidized rents for formerly homeless people. 

Advocacy groups claim the policy change will push more than 170,000 people into homelessness, some 3,000 of them in North Carolina. On Monday, they sued the Trump administration over the move, asking a federal judge to block it. 
The lawsuit was filed by the National Alliance to End Homelessness in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island. It names the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and HUD Secretary Scott Turner as defendants.

Latonya Agard, executive director of the NC Coalition to End Homelessness, shared news about the legal efforts to “stop the madness” with those attending the coalition’s “Be a Light Gala,” which was held virtually this year on Giving Tuesday.
“The NCCEH and so many of our partners are part of the fight to resist that,” Agard said.
The coalition receives state and federal dollars but can only use private donations for advocacy work, Agard told those attending the fundraiser.  
She cited the coalition’s success this year in helping to stop bills supported by Republicans in the General Assembly that advocates for people experiencing homelessness contend would have been “disastrous.” The coalition and its partners testified against the bills in legislative committees in both chambers.
One of them, House Bill 437, would have made homeless shelters operators responsible if drugs were sold or delivered outside of their facilities. It passed the state House, but stalled in the state Senate.
Rep. Heather Rhyne (R-Lincoln) said at the time that such a law is needed because the state’s homeless population is under regular threat from dealers seeking to sell them controlled substances.
“By making homeless shelters drug-free zones, we reduce the opportunity for these criminal elements to further victimize the homeless while holding operators of these facilities accountable,” said Rhyne, a bill cosponsor. 
But Agard said it could have forced shelters to close. 
“They [service providers] would have been fined, they faced potential felony charges because they couldn’t control what people were doing outside of their premises,” Agard said.
Another example, Agard said, was a controversial bill to ban public camping that would have criminalized people experiencing homelessness “for simply not having a home.” House Bill 781 would have prohibited unauthorized camping on public property. It also stalled in the Senate.
A bill co-sponsor, Rep. Brian Biggs (R-Randolph), said leaders of local municipalities came to him looking for guidance in handling homelessness. Biggs insisted the bill doesn’t criminalize homelessness as some critics contend.
“It addresses the use of public property for camping and sleeping without prohibiting homelessness,” Biggs said in April. “It does create clear guidance. We need guidance.”
H781 also passed the House but stalled in the Senate – in part, Agard said, due to the coalition’s testimony about it.
“Those were two huge wins, and this organization was part of the effort to bring people together, to craft a narrative that was compelling, and to use evidence, to use facts to show that these things are wrong,” Agard said.
“We can’t do that kind of work without funding that is not tied to federal policies or state policies, or any of those restrictions,” Agard said. “We need funds that will allow us to continue to do the hard work of standing in solidarity with people experiencing homelessness, speaking truth to power and ensuring that we are a voice for equity.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Image-1.png,,,2025-12-04 06:57:30.690286

(Photo by Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)Environmentalist groups and some Cameron Parish residents are disgruntled after Louisiana officials recently gave the go-ahead for construction of a liquified natural gas export facility after a state judge suspended the project.    
Judge Penelope Richard of the 38th Judicial District Court, which includes Cameron Parish, suspended Commonwealth LNG’s permit last month in response to a lawsuit from the Sierra Club. She ruled the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy hadn’t considered the effects of climate change, the high density of gas export facilities already in the area and the disproportionate impact of pollution on nearby communities when it approved the permit. 
The state agency then issued updated reasons Nov. 18 for approving Commonwealth’s permit, allowing the project to move forward. Officials again determined the proposed benefits of the project “outweigh the costs” of its environmental impact on Southwest Louisiana’s coast and communities. 
“Economic benefit outweighing all of these things is frustrating to me,” said John Allaire, a Cameron Parish resident who lives within 30 miles of three existing LNG export facilities and six more planned or under construction. “The economic benefits of their facility outweigh flooding me out, outweigh the commercial fishing industry, outweigh the eastern black rail, outweigh protecting our cheniers … I don’t agree with that. How much is enough?” 
The Department of Conservation and Energy’s new permit approval was based on an “independent analysis” of documents from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Those agencies considered the effects of climate change, environmental justice concerns and the cumulative impacts of multiple LNG facilities within a small area. All reached the same conclusion that the project’s benefits overshadow its costs. 
Environmental groups staunchly disagree with the decision to reissue the permit.
The Sierra Club said in a statement through its managing attorney, Eric Huber, that the permit was approved “without any notice to the plaintiffs or the public,” who he said learned about it through the news reports. Turtle Island Restoration Network and Louisiana Bucket Brigade, also plaintiffs in the lawsuit, declined to comment.  


Let us know what you think...


 

Sierra Club attorneys are reviewing the latest permit approval to decide whether they will take further legal action. By reissuing the permit, the state Department of Conservation and Energy “continues to neglect its responsibility to protect the public health and welfare of all Louisianans,” their statement said.
In its new reasons for approving the permit, Conservation and Energy officials determined it was in the “best interest of the state” not to delay in reassessing the permit as reason for their speedy decision. This is, in part, related to the Trump administration’s “energy dominance” agenda, which calls for further expansion of industries like liquified natural gas. 
The agency also justified its use of these external documents rather than doing its own research by citing the federal government’s decision to abandon its environmental justice analysis tools, following an executive order from President Donald Trump the day after he took office in January. 
Benefits cited in the state’s permit approval include job creation. Commonwealth estimates it will employ an average of 800 construction workers per month, with a peak of 2,000, over the three-year period. Half of all these construction employees are expected to come from Cameron and Calcasieu parishes, according to the document. 
The permit approval explanation did list downsides to the project, including the destruction of around 90 acres of coastal wetlands in Cameron Parish. State officials accounted for this, saying “these wetland impacts would be mitigated and would not have a significant cumulative impact on environmental justice communities.”
Community advocates like James Hiatt, director of nonprofit For a Better Bayou, question whether the state is acting in the best interests of its residents.  
“The job is not to expedite permits and do whatever corporations want. Their job is to protect national resources, the public good, the public interest,” Hiatt said, citing ongoing issues in Cameron Parish with rapidly eroding coastal land and disproportionately high pollution levels in communities closest to the LNG export sites.
The Commonwealth LNG facility will be built 750 feet away from Allaire’s property line, he said, adding that he feels Cameron Parish won’t see enough of the economic benefit from these facilities to make up for all of the drawbacks. 
 “They keep saying, ‘Well, it’ll be mitigated by economic benefit to the community,’” he said. “But come on down here and see where the economic benefit to the community is. It’s not here.”

Corrales said Fronapfel approached protesters during a November demonstration at the airport, saying he “supported what we were doing and would protect our ability to do so.”

Key Lime Air’s headquarters are at the Centennial Airport through a sublease with jetCenters of Colorado. The airline’s operation of ICE flights was first reported by Colorado Newsline in October. Two of its planes frequently fly routes between known ICE hubs, including in Texas, Louisiana and Florida, according to a Newsline analysis of publicly available flight tracking data.
The company flew 83 ICE flights in September and 192 in October, according to Human Rights First’s most recent ICE Flight Monitor Report. It is part of a growing network of companies, such as Avelo and GlobalX, that provide domestic immigration enforcement flights as the Trump administration ramps up mass deportation efforts.
Organizers acknowledge that airport leadership have little power to stop Key Lime Air’s immigration-related activity.
“The Centennial Airport is not going to be able to kick Key Lime Air out. They’re not going to be able to end the abuses that ICE is causing. But each blow that we strike to these entities puts a delay to what ICE is capable of doing,” Corrales said. “Anything that we can do to slow that process down until we can find longer term solutions is the goal.”
Human Rights First documented 109 total immigration enforcement flights — across all the airlines ICE uses — out of Denver between January and October. In April, the U.S. Coast Guard operated at least three immigration enforcement flights from Centennial Airport.
Cliff Honeycutt, Key Lime Air’s CEO, previously wrote in a text message that he can’t discuss private charter operations.
Organizers plan to attend and submit public comment at an upcoming Arapahoe County Public Airport Authority Board of Commissioner’s meeting.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)In the wake of business tax cuts and dried-up federal stimulus funds, Tennessee Comptroller Jason Mumpower is predicting a tough budget for fiscal year 2026-27.
Mumpower, who chairs the funding board that sets the budget growth rate each year based on economic forecasts, told the Lookout he believes it will be “the tightest budget year the Lee administration has experienced” in nearly eight years.
“There’s so many demands for money and resources,” said Mumpower, a former Republican lawmaker. “Prioritization is going to be the word of the year.”
Yet Republican lawmakers are pushing for an increase in funding for the state’s new private-school voucher program, which cost $144 million this year. 
Gov. Bill Lee also wants to add to the 20,000 students receiving $7,300 to attend private schools. The state has declined to say how many of recipients were enrolled in private school already, though 66% were expected to come from private schools.
With a difficult budget year looming, Finance and Administration Commissioner Jim Bryson urged department heads to trim their budget plans by 1% as they made presentations to the governor’s staff in November. Lee, though, told reporters he didn’t know anything about Bryson’s request.
Prioritization is going to be the word of the year,” says Tennessee Comptroller Jason Mumpower of the state budget.
Nearly every department requested funding increases.
The Department of Safety and Homeland Security is seeking an $84 million increase in its budget for next year, including more than $43 million to hire Tennessee Highway Patrol officers. The Department of Correction is seeking an $85 million increase, which includes $13 million more to pay CoreCivic, a private company that runs four state prisons.
Two years after dialing back the economy’s growth rate to reflect negative growth, the funding board recently set the figure for fiscal 2026-27 to fall between 2.25% and 2.35%, which would bring the state $450 million more in revenue.
Mumpower described the state’s economy as “very resilient” but noted the federal stimulus funds are gone and projected growth is below the 3% inflation rate. 
“Obviously, our purchasing power is impaired by that inflation rate,” he said.
Rep. John Ray Clemmons of Nashville said Democrats have been warning of a coming financial crisis for years and accused Republicans of running the state “off the fiscal cliff.”
“Reckless spending programs, endless corporate handouts and rampant fiscal mismanagement, combined with irresponsible revenue cuts that made our state even more reliant on fluctuating sales tax revenues, have resulted in an impending budget crisis,” Clemmons said.
Republican lawmakers approved two straight years of business tax reductions and a three-year tax rebate in 2024 that initially cost the state $1.5 billion initially, $7.4 billion over the next few years. 
Changes came after the Department of Revenue said the state could run into “significant legal risk” because of challenges to the property measure in the state’s franchise tax. State officials never identified any litigation, and some lawmakers said the move was simply good policy.
Tennessee has a AAA bond rating with Moody’s Analytics, a financial company in New York, Yet a Moody’s analyst described Tennessee’s economy as “treading water”, mainly because of tariff increases and federal job cuts. Sixteen states have economies that are expanding, according to the report, while 22 are in a recession or facing “high risk” for a recession.
Tennessee Correction Department requests $13M pay increase for embattled private-prison operator

House finance committee Chairman Gary Hicks said he met with Moody’s Analytics in October and its representatives never mentioned that the state was “treading water.”
Hicks said revenues are starting to “normalize” after two years of federal stimulus injections during the pandemic era.
“Which means we’re going to have to be more efficient in how we run government,” Hicks said. “I’m not real worried about that just yet. The economy’s always changing and it always will.”
Moody’s asked about the state’s business tax reductions, but Hicks said the state showed how it went about the business tax cuts “deliberately.” He said the state put itself in a good position by using “recurring” dollars, revenue projected to come in every year, for “non-recurring” expenditures, items that won’t have to be funded each year.

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)The University of Arkansas in Fayetteville has identified more than 100 scholarships to be modified to comply with laws related to race and diversity, and at least one donor has ended his financial support as a result. 
A 2023 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that it’s unconstitutional to use race as a selection criterion in university admissions prompted the University of Arkansas Board of Trustees to approve a resolution in January to review and modify scholarship endowment funds to comply with applicable law. 
The resolution directed campuses to use “permissible modifications that honor as closely as possible donor intent,” such as having significant financial need, being a first-generation college student, hailing from a geographic area that is less well-represented or having a record of overcoming challenges. 
“The goal of the changes is to ensure that donor intent can be carried out to the greatest extent possible and that University of Arkansas students with demonstrated need can continue to benefit from these generous gifts for years to come,” UA System President Jay Silveria said in a letter to trustees.  
As of late November, the majority of donors had been notified, but the process remains ongoing, said John Thomas, director of media relations and core communications.  
“Most donors contacted recognize the University’s obligation to make revisions given changes in the legal environment, including the Supreme Court’s Students for Fair Admissions decision,” Thomas wrote in an email. “If donors wish to discuss refined modifications, we are open to discussing that with them, but the bottom line is that scholarships must be compliant with legal requirements.”  
Higher ed institutions have been grappling with how to comply with an increasing number of federal and state directives and rules aimed at dismantling initiatives related to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in recent years. The institutions’ resulting actions have sometimes led to a loss of programs.
The University of Alabama, for example, suspended publication of two magazines Monday, claiming they were out of compliance with federal DEI guidance. In late October, the Equal Protection Project requested a federal civil rights investigation into the University of Central Arkansas over 10 scholarships that the group argued “discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin and/or sex in violation of Title VI and Title IX.” The EPP began in 2023 as an arm of the Legal Insurrection Foundation, a conservative-leaning advocacy group.
Bill to prohibit discrimination passes split Arkansas House panel after much public opposition

The complaint, filed with the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, “helps illustrate the risks that the University of Arkansas has been proactively seeking to prevent through the revision process,” Thomas said.
Documents the Advocate obtained through a public records request show that in July 2025, the University of Arkansas’ review also considered two new laws passed by the Arkansas General Assembly during this year’s legislative session. Act 116 of 2025 prohibits preferential treatment based on “race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in matters of state employment, public education, or state procurement.” Meanwhile, Act 340 of 2025 prohibits requiring adherence to a philosophical viewpoint or requiring the submission of diversity-related statements.  
With regard to sex-based scholarships, Thomas said some “distinct considerations” apply based on Title IX regulations, but generally any prohibitions would apply equally to both men and women. 
“The issue here is that if there is a sex restricted scholarship in support of an academic unit, there is an exception under the Title IX regulations through which the scholarship can be awarded, but only if it is grouped with a larger set of scholarships, with the recipients chosen without regard to sex,” Thomas said. “The sex-restricted scholarship can then be matched to a qualified recipient.”
This only applies to a small number of existing, older scholarships, he said.
Revoked support
According to emails the Advocate obtained through a public records request, four scholarships were identified for modification within the University of Arkansas’ Fay Jones School of Architecture and Design, including the Andrew A. Kinslow and Russell W. Kirkpatrick Diversity Award for Design Excellence. 
Kinslow, an architecture school alum and the scholarship’s benefactor, said he first learned university officials were considering changing his scholarship through an informal conversation about a year ago. He received a formal email about potential modifications on Oct. 10.
Ten Commandments displays prompt scholarship cancellations, teach-in at University of Arkansas

That same week, Kinslow learned Ten Commandments posters were being installed on the university’s Fayetteville campus to comply with another new state law, and decided to end his financial support by cutting the U of A out of his will and discontinuing his two scholarships. 
The Andrew A. Kinslow Interior Design Scholarship awarded $1,000 to a 3rd or 4th year student from Arkansas interested in commercial design. Applicant criteria is not included on that same scholarship website for Kinslow’s $1,500 diversity scholarship. However, according to a document on the architecture school’s website, the scholarship was awarded to 2nd through 5th year students with a 3.0 grade point average who demonstrate financial need and consideration was “given to students who demonstrate commitment to diversity and inclusion.”
Kinslow said he started the diversity scholarship a few years ago “to do more to help the students.” The Arkansas native, who now lives in Oklahoma, said he was surprised by notification that the scholarship needed to be changed because it refers to diversity generally instead of something specific, like a racial quota. 
“It was open in that it was to encourage diversity of all kinds and that includes people from small towns, it includes people from inner cities, it includes people from not necessarily race-based, but just more that whole thing of exposure to all sorts of people,” Kinslow said. 
“…I couldn’t understand why anybody would be against that, and that was when we had talked about pulling it because if it can’t be what we want it to be, why are we doing it?”
When he owned his own architecture firm, Kinslow said his 75 employees had a wide range of ethnic and religious backgrounds, which was good for the company. 
“It was a very diverse group, and we felt like that was one of our strengths in being able to pair people with clients that would relate more to that architect or designer,” he said. 
The firm never had racial quotas, according to Kinslow, who said they simply hired the most qualified person and sometimes that was a person from an underrepresented group.

“I think what we were trying to do was to make sure that we were interviewing everyone who applied and then picking the best person from that group,” he said. “And it just happened at different times that that was who that was.”
As a “strong believer” in the separation of church and state, Kinslow said the installation of the Ten Commandments at the university was “the final straw” that solidified his decision to cease his financial contributions, which he was already considering because of the issues with his diversity scholarship. 
In a Monday email to the architecture school, Kinslow said he had not received formal notification from anyone at the university acknowledging his termination of the scholarships or the gift in his will. Kinslow said he still had not received a response as of Wednesday. 
Once funding for a scholarship has been provided, a gift is considered complete and is not refundable, Thomas said. 
“Completed gifts are not returned by the University of Arkansas Foundation, but are used to continue to benefit students, as closely as possible in line with the donor’s intent,” he said.
Kinslow provided money for his scholarships on an annual basis and said he would not do so moving forward, even if the Ten Commandments law is repealed “because it never should have happened.”  
The U of A alum said he is still considering other organizations where he can direct the financial support he is rescinding from the university.

(Photo by Leann Ray/West Virginia Watch)Groups providing critical services to West Virginia foster care children, including driving them to see their biological parents, are calling on Gov. Patrick Morrisey and the Human Services secretary to immediately halt a new transportation documentation policy, saying it’s excessive, redundant and “forcing some providers to discontinue services.”
The mileage log policy change followed Morrisey’s executive order to weed out wasteful spending in state government. It resulted in state Department of Human Services officials finding numerous “unusual discrepancies” with Socially Necessary Services providers’ mileage.
There are nearly 6,000 children in the state’s overwhelmed foster care system. Multiple Socially Necessary Services providers support these children by transporting them to visits with their biological parents, siblings and grandparents. Often, providers’ goal is to support family reunification. Providers also provide safety services where children are present in the home and a safety concern has been identified.
DoHS notified the state’s service providers on Oct. 30 that they were now required to provide a mileage log for every mile utilized across the state beginning Nov. 1. Providers said the requirement is “labor-intensive administrative work without compensation” that will result in billing delays. 
“Your Socially Necessary Services provider community urgently requests the West Virginia Department of Human Services to immediately pause a well-intentioned, but inefficient transpiration policy,” several providers wrote in a letter to Morrisey and DoHS Secretary Alex Mayer on Nov. 13. 
“With a workforce already strained to the breaking point, we urge the state to remember that our first duty, providers and leadership alike, is to protect the children of West Virginia,” they said.
The mileage log requirement followed Morrisey’s executive order — issued on his first full day in office — that called for efficiency in state government. The order called on agencies to identify wasteful spending. 
Morrisey’s office did not respond to a request for comment. 
Angelica Hightower, spokesperson for DoHS, said the department “takes the stewardship of valued taxpayer dollars extremely seriously” and has been reviewing service provider payments, including Socially Necessary Services.
“Through this review, DoHS identified that transportation costs accounted for approximately 35% of all [Socially Necessary Services] spending, and numerous mileage invoices reflected unusual discrepancies,” Hightower said.
“To better understand the spending in this area, DoHS implemented a verification process reflecting what our own staff follow when traveling in their official capacity,” she continued. “This change results in [Socially Necessary Services] providers now submitting mileage logs that include start and end locations and total miles traveled, which are reviewed before payments are issued.”
Socially Necessary Services providers said the new requirement created the fourth time that they have to document information related to their work, and services have already been previously authorized by the state. The state contracts with a vendor, Acentra, to provide prior authorization for SNS services.
In their letter to Morrisey and Mayer, Socially Necessary Services providers stressed that good providers were committed to stopping fraud.
“We have a vested interest in ensuring limited dollars are spent appropriately,” they wrote. “The new policy doesn’t accomplish that goal and makes delivering critical services to children untenable. It is unclear how redundant documentation prevents fraud … This new policy doesn’t focus on providers exceeding authorizations, it merely requests the information be provided again.” 
The letter noted that the DoHS has had issues with Acentra working with the state’s online PATH portal — an information technology system for both users and providers with child welfare programs in the state. The state has spent more than $300 million creating PATH, and it still doesn’t work properly.  
“ … The consequence of those issues should not be more bureaucratic hurdles for providers,” they wrote. 
Socially Necessary Services providers proposed that DoHS use Acentra for its intended purpose of gatekeeping mileage. If a provider’s mileage exceeds the up to 3,000 mile limit for a three-month period, the SNS community suggested that the department determine if more mileage needs to be approved or suspend services to review potential problems. 
“We find ourselves in the dark, left to manage the consequences of poor decision making,” providers wrote.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A key U.S. senator raised questions Wednesday about whether former car dealership magnate Lee Beaman is fit to serve on the Tennessee Valley Authority Board of Directors.
Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, ranking member of the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, told the panel that Beaman’s qualification is that of a “Trump loyalist and 2020 election denier,” in reference to his support of President Donald Trump and claims that the presidential election of 2020 was stolen, a matter that has been debunked.
Whitehouse said Beaman signed a letter asking state lawmakers to appoint phony electors to overturn the election and noted he received a “Freedom Award” from Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity, which supports the fossil-fuel industry. 
“When the ask comes to raise customers’ rates by backing away from clean energy, it’s a safe bet whose back he’ll have,” Whitehouse said.
In addition, Beaman is a landlord for several Republican members of Congress at a Capitol Hill rowhome, including U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, Whitehouse said, along with U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee. Critics have questioned whether the arrangements meet disclosure and ethics requirements.
The nonpartisan Office of Congressional Ethics found wrongdoing in an Ogles campaign finance report, with Beaman serving as treasurer at the time, and planned to subpoena the congressman to testify. But that has been stalled since Johnson took over the speakership, Whitehouse said.
At public hearing, Knoxville residents push back on privatization of Tennessee Valley Authority

U.S. Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty of Tennessee introduced Beaman at the committee hearing, with Blackburn touting his “decades of experience in business leadership, community service and organizational governance,” as well as leadership in the beverage industry for 35 years in Tennessee and Georgia, according to a knoxnews article. Work in those TVA service areas gives Beaman “first-hand familiarity with the communities, the people, the economic conditions and the operations needs of this region,” Blackburn said.
The full Senate will take a final vote on the nominations of Beaman and four other men to fill TVA posts that became vacant after Trump fired Biden appointees, leaving the board unable to reach a quorum for decisions.
Asked Wednesday about his views on the importance of nuclear energy to TVA’s future, Beaman said, “I think nuclear power generation is the future of power in the United States and probably around the world,” according to the Knoxnews report.
Similarly to the other four nominees, Beaman told the committee he opposes privatizing the federally-owned utility, saying, “TVA is more uniquely, appropriately operated as a government entity.”
U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, a Memphis Democrat, called for the committee to reject Beaman’s nomination, saying he has no experience in the energy and utilities industries, in addition to lacking “sound judgment” and independence. Instead, most of his career has been in automotive sales, beverage distribution, real estate holdings and political fundraising, Cohen said.
“Nothing in Mr. Beaman’s record reflects the expertise necessary to provide informed oversight of such a complex public utility,” Cohen said in a statement.
The congressman also said Beaman acknowledged he was encouraged to pursue the TVA seat because of the “ongoing race for energy to feed AI-driven demand for data centers.” Cohen said Beaman holds equity stakes in businesses depending on AI integration, including energy-intensive computing, raising questions about a potential conflict of interest.
Beaman is a member of the Belmont University Board of Trustees, returning to the post after a leave of absence related to a divorce and accusations of sordid behavior by his ex-wife. 
He did not return a call requesting comment on the Senate hearing.

Current federal policies barely chip away at the buildup, with only 0.08% of public lands treated with prescribed fire. A rate far below the accumulation of vulnerable fuels on public lands in the mountain states.
The U.S. Forest Service manages 193 million acres, and 80 million acres need to be restored. Accounting for all management practices, like selective logging and prescribed fire, it will take 40 years to restore the forests needing remediated today. This does not account for the millions of acres that will become vulnerable in the future. It is little wonder that catastrophic wildfires continue to burst from this ever-growing logjam.
Balance of Idaho’s state wildfire suppression fund drops to $15 million after 2025 season

The bipartisan Fix Our Forests Act (HR 471 and S.1462), moving quickly through Congress, has the potential of ending this logjam. The strategy of the act authorizes more forest management tools and accelerates projects, lowering the frequency of deadly forest fires in the western United States.
In January, House Committee on Natural Resources Chairman Bruce Westerman (AR) testified on the act saying: “FOFA codifies emergency authorities used by both Democrat and Republican administrations to increase the pace and scale of management. Without these tools, completing a single forest management project takes three to five years. With them, land managers can act immediately.”
The Fix Our Forests Act creates these changes through four titles, attempting to solve this crisis with a solution whose breadth matches the problem. Below are some of the act’s policies that could remediate this government-created tinderbox:

Designates Fireshed Management Areas, which consist of the top 20% of firesheds for wildfire risk exposure based on threat to communities, municipal watersheds, and vegetation type.
Establishes the Wildfire Intelligence Center to assess and predict fire and provide data related to each fireshed and increase public interface to improve community wildfire resilience.
Expands collaborative tools to reduce wildfire risk and improve forest health by extending stewardship contracts from 10 to 20 years, increasing project scale from 3,000 to 10,000 acres, and utilizing grazing.
Reforms and streamlines the litigation process.
Prioritizes prescribed fire as a management tool and expedites the environmental review process under the National Environmental Policy Act.
Adopts vegetation management and reforestation efforts that improve wildfire resiliency.

2024 saw more acres burned than the five- and 10-year averages, with large fires (100+ acres in timber and 300+ acres in grass) accounting for less than 2% of fires nationally. However, 37 of these large fires were over 40,000 acres. Averaging over 136,000 acres per fire, these 37 large fires accounted for more than 50% of the almost 9 million acres burned in 2024. The complexity and threat of large fires will never be treated by the small efforts of 3,000 acres. Increasing the project scale of expedited projects to 10,000 acres may be enough to control the deluge.
The federal government’s slothfulness in managing fuels on federal land extends beyond potential wildfire threats. In post-fire landscapes, fire remediation on federal lands is minimal and hindered by litigation. Oregon’s 2020 Labor Day wildfires burned more than 1 million acres, consuming about 280,000 acres of federally managed lands. Less than 3% of this federal land received treatment to remove snags to improve safety from falling trees and prevent future reburns, which sterilize the land.
The Fix Our Forests Act’s efforts to increase the size and scope of projects are only possible because the legislation reins in the litigious abuse of special interest groups. Without changing existing environmental protections, the act will provide much-needed flexibility, expediting projects through the review processes. No longer will special interest groups be able to assert unilateral control over the process when fire-threatened communities are begging for prevention tools.
Our forests have outgrown small management projects and the weaponization of litigation to stop needed projects. Millions of acres of overgrown forests need a policy of this magnitude. Expanding the size and length of stewardship contracts and increasing the ease with which projects can be approved are needed steps in collaborating with private industry to increase the resiliency of American forests.

Ed Schafer and former director of the Department of Human Services, is being remembered as a North Dakota political ""trailblazer."" (Photo courtesy of Dana Chorpenning)Carol Olson, believed to be the first woman to serve as a North Dakota governor’s chief of staff and lead the state Department of Human Services, died Sunday in Colorado, one day after celebrating her 77th birthday.
Olson was active in North Dakota Republican politics for decades, leading successful campaigns for governors and other statewide officials.
“She was a trailblazer, no doubt about it,” said Republican U.S. Sen. John Hoeven, who hired Olson to run his campaign for governor in 2000. “Everybody always knew she was a person you could count on. She was tough, but had a huge heart.”
Former Gov. Ed Schafer said Olson was active in state politics when he met her at the state Republican convention in 1988. He said Olson, the former campaign manager for Republican U.S. Sen. Mark Andrews, was the only name that kept coming up when he asked his confidants who should run his gubernatorial campaign in 1992.
Though Republicans dominate North Dakota politics today, that wasn’t always the case. The Democratic-NPL Party held the governor’s office from 1961-81 and again from 1985-92. 
Olson also ran Schafer’s successful reelection campaign in 1996. 
“We pretty much upended everything the Democrats had done for years and years and years, and changed the directional trajectory of the state to where it is now,” Schafer said. 
Schafer appointed Olson to be his chief of staff during his first term. During his second term, he appointed Olson to run the Department of Human Services, a position she held from 1997 to 2012. Schafer said he believes she was the first woman to hold both positions in North Dakota.
Olson loved being the workhorse behind the political scene, said Kirsten Ziuchkovski, Olson’s youngest daughter.
“She never really liked being in the spotlight, but always putting somebody in the spotlight,” Ziuchkovski said. 
Olson knew how to run a grassroots campaign, said Dana Chorpenning, Olson’s oldest daughter.
“She really understood what it meant to reach every single person in North Dakota and to put out a message that everyone could get behind,” Chorpenning said. 
Although she was known as a good campaign manager, Olson also loved her work with the Department of Human Services, Hoeven said.
“Not only the people there, but the work, helping people. She really liked that,” Hoeven said.
Olson retired in 2012 and moved to Colorado Springs to be closer to her two daughters and six grandchildren.
A celebration of Olson’s life will be held in Bismarck next summer, with a location and time to be announced. Olson requested her ashes be spread over Lake Sakakawea, a place where the family spent countless days and nights with a shared love of the North Dakota outdoors.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
“It is a unique bill that has a lot of emotion and nuances to it,” said Rep. Chuck Wichgers (R-Muskego), describing a bill to give local law enforcement the power to disable or destroy drones. Speaking to the Assembly Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety on Wednesday, Wichgers said that the bill would give “the bare minimum protection” for both the public and police as global drone technology continues to rapidly evolve.
Although current state law prohibits the use of weaponized drones, the devices are not actually defined in statute. Wichgers’ bill would define a weaponized drone as one which “is equipped with a taster, firearm, flamethrower, chemical, or explosive device.” 
Wichgers cautioned that “we can easily complicate this bill,” especially given the growth of drone technology around the world. Over the last two decades, drones have gone from being scarcely heard of outside military settings to becoming household objects. The U.S. military’s infamous Reaper and Predator drones, some of which are the size of small planes, have long been used in combat for reconnaissance and lethal strikes. Today, however, the same small and cheap quad-copter drones used by photographers, landscapers and children are being outfitted with explosives for kamikaze-style attacks on armored vehicles on Russian and Ukrainian battlefields, where an estimated 70-80% of casualties are caused by drones.
“It’s beyond fascinating,” Wichgers  said of “this is a big and global issue.” Wichgers told committee members that “we need to start getting language in statute,” since only certain federal agencies currently have the authority to down weaponized drones. “This bill allows Wisconsin law enforcement to mitigate a threat posed by a weaponized drone by detecting, tracking and identifying the drone and then intercepting, disabling, or in a worst case scenario, destroying the drone.” 
In order to protect public safety,  Wichgers said  that “these powers should be extended to local law enforcement.” He added that the federal government provides grants to help mitigate drone threats, as well as $500 million set aside for fiscal year 2026-27, as part of the Trump administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” “The difficulty is that law enforcement should not have to waiver if there is an immediate threat for a drone that is weaponized or carrying a load that is harmful to the public,” said Wichgers. “Our airspace needs to be safe, just like we’re safe on our roads.” 
A quickly moving goalpost 
The bill was requested by the Police Chief Association of Waukesha County, Wichgers said. “State law must be enacted that is responsive to current and future needs as best as we can determine them in order to prevent harm and protect our communities,” he added. 
Committee members chimed in with a variety of questions. Rep. Shae Sortwell (R-Two Rivers) joked about farmers using weaponized drones to eliminate sandhill cranes consuming crops. Wichgers brought up  his own examples, including nervous neighbors calling the police to check out roofers who might be using drones for survey work, or a drone being used at a concert to drop fentanyl on people who then overdose in the crowd. “Right now the police would say, ‘Sorry, the Wisconsin Legislature is dragging their feet on passing a law that gives me permission to disarm that drone that’s a threat, we’ll have to wait till next session,” said Wichgers. 
Dan Thompson, chief of the Waukesha Police Department, told the committee,  that “drones carry contraband, surveillance equipment or worse, weaponized payloads” and that the technology can “present a unique danger that demands an immediate intervention.” 
The chief’s comments prompted Rep. David Steffen (R-Howard) to seek clarification that under the proposed bill a drone does not, in fact, need to be weaponized, and that law enforcement only need to “reasonably suspect” that it could pose a public safety threat in order to shoot it down. Sortwell said that the bill’s language seemed broad. 
Sortwell questioned whether as the bill is written, shooting down a drone could be justified at any time. Legislative counsel said, “I don’t know that I can really answer that.” Sortwell shot back, “The fact that you can’t say ‘no’ is troubling.”

Set to air on Mississippi Public Broadcasting at 7:30 p.m., the documentary, “Eyes on Mississippi,” shares its title with Minor’s long-running newspaper column. The nearly one-hour film offers an in-depth look at Mississippi civil rights history through the lens of Minor’s reporting.  
Directed and produced by Ellen Ann Fentress, a journalist and former colleague of Minor, the documentary draws on 24 different historical archives and over 40 hours of footage from interviews of Minor by Fentress. The documentary was first released in 2015 and has since been partially re-edited with new archival material from MPB. 
A portrait of Minor and his dispatches from the front lines of the Civil Rights Movement, the film offers viewers a trenchant look at how journalism and race relations intersect.
“I think this is very auspicious timing for this story to come out,” Fentress said at a documentary screening in Jackson on Tuesday. “We need this story and the relevance of honest journalism and truth-telling. Telling truth to power could not be important than it is right now.”  
Minor covered Mississippi politics for over 70 years, from 1947 until his death in 2017. He earned professional accolades and awards for his gutsy reporting of civil rights violence and the political and social forces that drove it. 
Minor offers an inside view of landmark stories such as the murder of civil rights workers in Neshoba County and the trial of Willie McGee, both of which captured national attention for their window into the racist violence and unequal justice system that infected the Jim Crow South.
The documentary features interviews with figures such as civil-rights leader Myrlie Evers and former Gov. William Winter, the latter calling Minor “our own interpreter of who we are as a state.”
Minor came to Mississippi as the one-man bureau reporter for the New Orleans Times-Picayune. In the years that followed, he documented and explained Mississippi’s society for countless others, including fellow journalists across the nation.
A native of Hammond, Louisiana, Minor was a Tulane University journalism graduate and a World War II Navy combat veteran.
When Fentress decided to make the film, she said that while the film’s title, Eyes on Mississippi, was the name of Minor’s column, it also was his strategy – that “the fastest route to change was to get the unvarnished facts of the struggle out. The more eyes on Mississippi, the more the pressure for transformation.”

In recent weeks, sheriff’s departments in Hancock, Lincoln, Madison, Marion, Van Buren and Unicoi counties have signed onto so-called 287(g) agreements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, according to a federal database.
These largely rural counties join a growing list of Tennessee police, sheriffs and constable districts entering into such agreements. Two state agencies – the Department of Correction and Department of Safety and Homeland Security, which operates the Highway Patrol – have also partnered with ICE to crack down on immigration violations in Tennessee, where immigrants without legal status are estimated to represent 2.2% of the population.
Tennessee is among the states seeing the most rapid proliferation of the immigration agreements since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term.
Tennessee partnerships with ICE multiply as feds offer $14B in incentives nationwide

Local law enforcement entities may enter into one of three separate tiers of cooperative agreements with the federal government.
They include a “jail enforcement” model that gives local officials the authority to investigate the immigration status of individuals who are already incarcerated. Tennessee law already requires local jails to cooperate with ICE to verify the immigration status of individuals coming into custody.
The “warrant service officer” agreement allows jailers to make arrests on behalf of ICE of individuals already in custody.  
A “task force” model gives local and state law enforcement officers the authority to make immigration arrests as part of their day-to-day policing.  It is the most expansive delegation of immigration enforcement powers of the three models.
Thus far 19 Tennessee counties and the Tennessee Highway Patrol have entered into task force agreements.  
Gov. Bill Lee and the Tennessee General Assembly have offered incentives for partnerships through  $5 million in grants to participating agencies.
The federal government has also offered what it characterized as ‘unprecedented reimbursement opportunities’ to participating agencies.
The reimbursements include salary, benefits and overtime reimbursements for each trained officer, laptops, cell phones, up to $100,000 toward the purchase of agency vehicles and bonuses ranging from $500 to $1000 per officer for the “successful location of illegal aliens provided by ICE and overall assistance to further ICE’s mission to Defend the Homeland.”

National Guard/Facebook)Last week two West Virginian National Guard members were tragically shot in an apparently targeted attack during their deployment in Washington, D.C. One of them, a 20 year old named Sarah Beckstrom, died from her injuries. 
The alleged shooter came here from Afghanistan in 2021 after the American withdrawal from the country.  
Now the shooting of the two West Virginians is being used as a catalyst for the latest phase of the presidential administration’s xenophobia and inhumane immigration enforcement. Our state continues to be caught up in the president’s influence and serves as a microcosm for what has happened to the country this year. 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey, and other West Virginia elected officials, keep trying to hammer home that the members of the guard who remain in D.C. are there because they volunteered to be.
The fact of the matter is that they’re there because the governor authorized the deployment months ago and still wants our people to be there, despite a recent federal court ruling that the deployment is illegal. A Kentucky or Florida National Guard member can’t just go and volunteer to be deputized to “combat crime” in a place without their governor’s consent. 
One of the worst parts of this tragedy is that there was never a true need for our guardsmen to be there in the first place. There was not a true crisis in Washington, D.C. that necessitated them. If the conditions in D.C. are really that bad, we should be treating it as an epidemic all over the country. 
Imagine if the president, Congress and governors wanted to throw resources that would actually address poverty, homelessness, hunger and crime. 
But no one wants to do that. Instead, Morrisey sent West Virginians as a political stunt to appease the president and bolster his future political prospects, all while setting the stage for possibly worse deployments and occupations in “democratic” states and cities in the future. 
He even fought for the deployment of the West Virginia National Guard to Washington, D.C. when West Virginia groups sued. 
The National Guard members in D.C. were hardly combatting crime. They’ve picked up trash, scooters, and on Thanksgiving they distributed food. According to CNN who interviewed guardsmen in D.C. and their relatives back in September, “one father of a Guardsman joked that this is like a vacation for his son.”
To be clear, none of those things are bad in and of themselves, but they’re bad uses of West Virginia National Guard resources. Things like that could be done in West Virginia. People are hungry here. We have illegal dumping in our forests and around our rivers. Our cities have litter. 
The Charleston-Gazette Mail reported that the National Guard no longer has a role in southern or northern West Virginia even though there are still things to do regarding recovery from this year’s flooding. 
This terrible situation encapsulates a year in which President Donald Trump has captured institutions left and right. At nearly every step of the way, Morrisey, our Legislature and our attorney general have stood behind him. As grants that would improve West Virginia have been cut, as federal employees in the state have been fired, as programs for coal miners and black lung disease have been attacked, and as environmental protections have been rolled back, West Virginia politicians have not pushed back. 
Instead, we get calls for thoughts and prayers. 
Everyone deserves to be kept in our thoughts. But right now what we need isn’t your prayers, Governor. We need your political courage to stand up for West Virginians and not cater to the every-changing whims of the president. Put West Virginians first, not your higher political ambitions.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)For the first time, state housing officials will take an active role in gathering data for the annual census of Rhode Island’s unhoused population likely in late January.
The Executive Office of Housing will be the lead coordinator of volunteers who fan out across the state to conduct the yearly Point in Time Count, a responsibility handled by the Rhode Island Coalition to End Homelessness for the past 16 years.
The state’s role in the federally-mandated count previously has been indirect — mostly looking over the coalition’s published numbers upon their release and allowing employees to go out and help with the census.
As the housing office continues to consolidate housing governance across Rhode Island, spokesperson Emily Marshall said the state can now support the count in a more direct way.
“Because the count is primarily conducted by these outreach teams, this new leadership role allows the state to strengthen and coordinate the effort in a more impactful and unified way,” Marshall said in an emailed statement.
The state’s new role doesn’t mean the coalition is ceding its authority in overseeing the yearly snapshot of how many unhoused people are in Rhode Island on a given winter’s night. 
Indeed, the organization will remain in charge of the state’s portion of the Homeless Management Information System through the end of 2028 under an agreement approved by the state’s Continuum of Care board on Nov. 6. The role requires the coalition to clean, validate, analyze, and submit the estimate of Rhode Island’s unhoused population to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). 
But the coalition is still without many key players in that data management. Susan Gutner, the chairperson of the organization’s board of directors, told Rhode Island Current that the coalition is in the midst of searching for a new data analyst and data liaison.
That’s on top of the ongoing search for a new executive director after Kim Simmons left in early September after a little more than two years on the job.
​​Gunter, who is serving as interim executive director, declined to say why Simmons left.
“I can tell you that we are actively engaged in the search for an executive director and it is going really well,” she said in a recent interview.
Gunter referred any comment on the upcoming Point in Time Count to the Executive Office of Housing, but noted that the coalition has “always worked in partnership” with the state.
“There’s absolutely no change there,” she said.
The coalition has been in charge of Rhode Island’s Homeless Management Information System since 2009.
No firm date yet
The Point in Time count documents the number of individuals experiencing homelessness on a given night during the coldest time of the year — a time when people are more likely to use shelters. The counts, which are done across the country, are used by HUD to determine federal funding for states and organizations to manage their response.
HUD is responsible for setting the date a state holds the count, often in late January. But when Rhode Island’s volunteers will go out next year has yet to be made public.
Laura Jaworski, executive director of the Warwick-based nonprofit community development corporation House of Hope, said partner organizations like hers typically get a sense of when the date will be in late summer or early fall.
“Because of the shutdown, who knows if we’re still going to stick by that January date,” she said.
A HUD spokesperson did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Rhode Island’s 2026 Point in Time date. Marshall told Rhode Island Current the state expects the date to be some time in the last two weeks of January.
This year’s census was held on Tuesday, Jan. 21 — a day when the temperature hovered around 18 degrees in Providence. There were at least 2,373 unhoused individuals across the state that night, representing a 2.8% decrease from the record high of 2,442 in 2024.
R.I. homelessness is down, but more people are out in the cold? New data says it’s true.

While the overall number of homeless individuals was down, volunteers found more were people outside that night than in a shelter. To remedy that issue Gov. Dan McKee’s administration in late October committed over $1.7 million in grants to municipalities and nonprofit service providers to expand Rhode Island’s network of warming centers and emergency shelters.
The state has had some issue with how the coalition has counted in the past. Rhode Island Housing Secretary Deobrah Goddard in a recent interview said volunteers used the coalition’s call center that was used for shelter referrals to see who may have been outside after the initial count was done, a practice that was allowed during the pandemic but no more.
“That’s not consistent with HUD guidelines,” Goddard said.
As of Oct. 1, the state no longer uses that hotline for shelter referrals.Instead, those seeking shelter must now go through the state’s new regional access points, walk-in centers across Rhode Island set up to connect people with housing and other services.
While the coalition deferred comments about the Point in Time Count, Jaworski was quick to defend the organization’s methodology, which she said is vetted and approved annually by the Continuum of Care board before it’s submitted to HUD.
“They’re following the guidance and letter of the law of what can and cannot be used,” she said. “I would find it hard to believe they were including numbers we cannot use.”
Having faulty numbers, she said, could impact how much grant money the federal government allocates to the state toward its response in addressing homelessness. Though even that now is in question as the Trump administration has imposed new restrictions on the funding — changes that face two separate lawsuits in Rhode Island’s federal courthouse.
Any issues with the methodology would mainly reflect on the organizations that go out to shelters and encampments that night.
“And there’s no lying or miscounting that we’ve been a part of,” she said.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)In an unhinged video this summer, Danielle Jurinsky, a former Aurora City Council member, blamed the Democratic Party for the firebomb attack on peaceful demonstrators in Boulder who called for the release of hostages in Gaza. Through tears, she angrily singled out Jewish leaders in the state, such as Gov. Jared Polis and Attorney General Phil Weiser, and said that as Democrats they were not really Jewish but part of a “demonic cult.”
The shocking performance was just one example of Jurinsky’s cuckoo style of public service, which strictly adhered to the MAGA themes of leadership: outrage, grievance and, above all, attention.
She achieved more attention for herself last year than even she could have imagined when she became the primary spreader of the lie that Venezuelan gangs had “taken over” whole parts of Aurora, Colorado. This falsehood brought undeserved disrepute to the city, but it also prompted a visit by a virulently anti-immigrant presidential candidate. Donald Trump soon led a campaign rally in Aurora, where he repeated lies about immigrants in the city and gave Jurinsky a turn at the mic.
She was clearly thrilled to be in the MAGA limelight. But it’s reasonable to say her constituents were less enthusiastic.

Last month, Aurora voters sent this Trump acolyte packing. Moreover, progressive city council candidates swept the races and flipped a longtime conservative majority. Conservative Steve Sundberg, known for making racist ads for his sports bar, was also booted from office.
Dave Perry, longtime editor of the Aurora Sentinel, in a column after the election captured how toxic city hall had become while Jurinsky and Sundberg were in the majority.
“In more than 30 years of covering Aurora politics, and almost 40 years as a journalist, I’ve seen some stuff. But I’ve never seen anything as dangerously weird as what Jurinsky and Sundberg inflicted on the state’s third-largest city,” Perry wrote. He added this hopeful note: “The Aurora City Council has a chance now to evolve and ensure that no matter how difficult city politics become, it’s never permitted to devolve into an organization that becomes a bigger threat to the community than the challenges they’re elected to solve.”
That process began this week. On Monday, the new Council members were sworn in, and the body immediately began to “undo harm caused by the previous council,” as one of the members put it. This included reversing restrictions on the ability of members of the public to address the Council.
Recovery from Trumpist madness in Aurora exemplifies a pivot that appears to have nationwide force. On Tuesday, a self-described “MAGA warrior” won a special congressional election in Tennessee, but the Democrat lost by just 9 percentage points in a district that historically favored Republicans by more than 20 points and Trump won last year by 22 points.
Democratic candidates throughout the country triumphed so consistently on Election Day last month that even Trump acknowledged it was a drubbing for the GOP.
The spread between Trump’s average approval and disapproval ratings in recent weeks has never been so wide — 39% approve of the president’s job performance, and 59% disapprove. These figures coincide with increasing consumer prices, inhumane and lawless immigration enforcement, fallout from the recent federal government shutdown, allegations that top military officials have committed war crimes, impending health care cost spikes, signs that Trump is physically unfit to carry out presidential duties, brazen acts of corruption, and other national developments that create a sense of dystopia.
Aurora offers some hope.
During her speech at the Trump rally last year, Jurinsky made a brash declaration. 
“Make no mistake of it, folks,” she said. “They can threaten me, they can try to silence me, they can lie about me, they can do whatever they want. I’m not going anywhere.”
But residents of Aurora showed that they could make a destructive figure like Jurinsky go away. They are a model for the country.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury) With the clock ticking, Attorney General–elect Jay Jones filed a motion this week asking the Virginia Court of Appeals to extend the commonwealth’s deadline to appeal a recent ruling that struck down the state’s background-check law for private firearm sales. 
The request — if granted — could buy more time for Virginia to mount a legal defense and potentially restore the law.
Under state law, the commonwealth had until Dec. 1 to file a notice of appeal after the Wilson v. Hanley decision. Because outgoing Attorney General Jason Miyares did not pursue the appeal, the right to challenge the ruling would have expired — potentially leaving the background-check requirement for private sales dead.

Jones’s motion asks that the deadline be extended to Jan. 30, 2026.
“Virginians demanded an attorney general who will stand up for their safety, and that’s exactly what I’m doing,” Jones said in a statement. “Background checks save lives and are essential to keeping guns out of dangerous hands. This motion protects Virginia’s ability to appeal this ruling, defend our laws, and keep our communities safe from gun violence.”
In October, a Lynchburg-area circuit court struck down the universal background-check law, holding that it ran afoul of both state and federal statutes — particularly as they apply to 18- to 20-year-old adults. 
The law, enacted by Democrats in 2020 as part of a sweeping gun-safety package and effective on July 1 that year, had applied to nearly all firearm transfers. 
Under federal law, licensed dealers cannot sell handguns to buyers under 21; yet state law allows those same 18- to 20-year-olds to legally possess handguns. By requiring all private transfers to go through licensed dealers and the federal background-check system (NICS), the law effectively denied those adults any legal way to acquire a handgun, advocates say.
In his decision, Judge F. Patrick Yeatts declined to address the constitutionality of background checks generally. 
Instead, he found the statute’s structure so flawed that the entire law had to be struck down. He noted that the commonwealth could attempt to craft a revised law that treats all age groups equally — an approach used in other states such as Nevada, which mandates minimum ages carefully calibrated to avoid similar legal traps.
Supporters of the 2020 law — part of a broader post-2019 gun-control push — had argued that universal background checks were a commonsense way to close the “private sale loophole.” With the law now enjoined statewide, attention has turned to whether the legislature will attempt to rewrite it.
 Pushback from gun-rights advocates

But not everyone welcomes Jones’s intervention. 
Virginia Citizens Defense League President Philip Van Cleave dismissed the court filing as improper. 
“Hopefully the request will be turned down since Jones has no authority until mid-January after he has been sworn in. The current attorney general is the one who counts,” Van Cleave said in an email.

He added, “Interesting that Jones, who was fantasizing about murdering someone and wishing death on that person’s children, is now suddenly concerned with saving lives” — a reference to a revelation publicized ahead of the Nov. 4 election that Jones, in 2022, sent violent text messages to a Republican lawmaker in which he mused about the death of then-House Speaker Todd Gilbert and his children. 
Van Cleave also questioned the premise behind universal background checks. 
“I’ve seen no statistics to indicate that universal background checks have saved any lives. The vast majority of criminals don’t submit to background checks,” he said. 
Meanwhile, Rooz Dadabhoy, president of Rally Virginia — a group describing itself as “the home of the modern Republican woman” — reacted sharply on X, formerly Twitter. Dadabhoy accused Jones of mounting “an assault on the Second Amendment BEFORE he even takes office.” 
Referring to the same text message scandal, she wrote: “Jay Jones himself shouldn’t even be able to own a gun because he clearly has deranged, violent fantasies.” 
She added that the move comes amid an effort by Democrats to hold firearm retailers liable for crimes committed with guns they sell — even if those sales comply with state law. “Virginia Democrats are absolutely coming for your right to ‘keep and bear arms,’” she declared.
 Virginia at a crossroads — as are other states

The legal battle unfolding in Virginia reflects a broader trend. 
As courts scrutinize fine print and statutory conflicts, universal background-check laws in several states may be vulnerable — especially where federal age restrictions collide with state-level firearm rights. 
Experts say the ruling and Jones’s appeal — if successful — could serve as a blueprint for other states seeking to restore or defend similar statutes in the post-New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen era. That 2022 U.S. Supreme Court decision struck down New York’s restrictive concealed-carry permitting system and held that modern gun laws must be consistent with the nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.
For now, Virginia’s background-check law remains in limbo. 
If the Court of Appeals grants the extension, the state will have until Jan. 30 to decide whether to press its case — and critics and advocates alike are bracing for the next round in what could be a defining legislative battle over gun policy and constitutional rights.

Inflation is making it more expensive to grow Christmas trees, with costs for things like labor and fertilizer rising. But Ryan Clouse, president of the Virginia Christmas Tree Growers Association, said a larger supply than usual will likely hedge against steep price hikes.
“The input costs have gone up, but I think a lot of what the big growers are doing is just trying to make sure they can market their trees,” he said.
Fewer Christmas trees were harvested and planted during the 2008 recession, which led to a shortage for the better part of a decade. Growers planted more to close the gap, but it takes seven to ten years for those trees to be ready to sell. Now, growers have trees they need to move.
Competition can keep costs low, or it can raise prices, Clouse said.
If an area has many tree lots, growers may keep prices lower to sell more trees. In another scenario, if a grower charges $50, but another grower down the street is charging $100, the first grower may decide they can charge a bit more and still stay competitive, Clouse said.
“There’s a lot of factors that go into the pricing, but I’d say this year is probably going to be a little higher than the past years,” he said.
In Hampton roads, consumers may be able to keep costs down by buying a locally grown Christmas tree.
“We haven’t gone up in two years,” said Heath Boomer of Boomer Family Christmas Tree Farm in Virginia Beach. “We’re doing $15 a foot, and nothing lower than five feet.”
George and Lisette Piccillo of Back Bay Christmas Trees in Virginia Beach said they’re also charging $15 a foot. Michael Bedell, a newer grower across the border on Knotts Island, N.C., said he’ll charge the same.
Boomer said he’s able to keep prices low by saving on labor costs.
“It’s me, it’s my wife, it’s my two girls,” he said. “We’re the ones that work it out here.”
 Coastal Christmas trees 

Growing Christmas trees in Hampton Roads is not a common venture. Only two species can thrive in the region’s sandy, hot and salty climate: Virginia pine and white pine.
Both trees have longer needles compared to mountain-grown species to deal better with heat, said George Piccillo.
And both trees have their perks, Boomer said.
White pines have a blueish tint and are fluffy, which is perfect for hiding lights, Boomer said. But they can’t hold heavy ornaments as well as Virginia pine’s stronger branches.
Virginia pines are yellow-green in hue and grow more quickly than white pines, which can make them more difficult to maintain.
Boomer said he has to prune Virginia pines twice a year, otherwise they’ll get “a little squirrely.”

And in what Boomer calls a funny coincidence, all of the region’s Christmas tree growers are connected to local schools. Boomer teaches history at Ocean Lakes High School. The Piccillos are retired schoolteachers and spent their entire careers in the area. Bedell started growing Christmas trees when he was a social studies teacher and is now assistant principal at Kellam High School.
The academic calendar complements the Christmas tree maintenance calendar, Bedell said.
“It’s nice, if you are in education, because you have your summers off,” he said, adding that pruning happens in June and July, and it takes at least an entire week from sunup to sundown.
All three of the local farms have trees ranging in size, from baby seedlings to taller mature ones. Christmas trees have to be at least 5 feet before they’re cut and sold, Boomer said.
It takes white pines and Virginia pines five to seven years to reach 6 feet. In that time, the trees may endure winds, heavy rains, drought, heat, pests and disease.
Overall, this year’s growing season along the coast was a good one, Boomer said, noting summer wasn’t too hot and the trees got plenty of water.
Not all growers in the state can say the same. Those along the Shenandoah Valley dealt with water issues in 2025 — either too much or too little, said Clouse, who owns Clouse’s Pine Hill Farm in Winchester County.
“We experienced record rain in May, June, middle of July, and then the spigot shut off,” he said.
Drought is especially hard on seedlings, Clouse said, and flooding can suffocate the roots.
Fraser firs are a popular type of tree often called the “Cadillac” of Christmas trees. Excess water makes these mountain-grown trees susceptible to root rot, he said. It’s caused by a pathogen called Phytophthora, which is contagious and can spread to other fir trees.
“You can transfer that on your pruner,” he said. “You can transfer it on your wheels, on your tractors, so there’s just any number of ways that you can acquire that.”
Once the pathogen is present, it can only be managed, Clouse said.
Virginia’s coastal Christmas tree growers have a different set of issues to deal with, Boomer said.
“One thing we deal with, being so close to the ocean, is a thing called salt spray,” Boomer said. “That’s the scariest thing is those northern winds, and the salt comes off the water, and it can burn the northeast side of trees.”
The redheaded pine sawfly eats Virginia pine needles as a caterpillar and can cause substantial damage. Poor drainage from the region’s sandy soil can drown trees.
Another challenge is demand, Boomer said.
“Christmas is moving up,” he said. “Everybody wants a tree sooner and sooner.”
But once a tree is cut, its time is limited, Boomer said.
His tips for making a Christmas tree stay green long into January?
Wait until after Thanksgiving, cut it fresh and put it in water immediately, he said.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)President Donald Trump’s signature law of his second term provides vastly more benefits to the rich Ohioans than to any other group, and it also takes more away from Ohio’s most vulnerable families than most people might realize, a new analysis says.
This summer, congressional Republicans passed — and Trump signed — the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, and it was controversial.
It extended tax cuts he signed in 2017. The extension provides $1 trillion to the richest 1 % of Americans over the next 10 years. At the same time, it cut nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid funding and nearly $200 billion in food assistance over the same period.
But an analysis by Policy Matters Ohio said that if you examine the details, the legislation is even worse for poor and middle-class Ohioans. 
Referring to Trump’s signature law as H.R. 1, it noted that many of the least popular cuts are delayed until after the 2026 midterm elections, and others are obscured in other ways.
“This smoke-and-mirrors approach to promoting H.R. 1 was partly possible because many of the budget’s largest cuts are just plain hard to understand — and there are a lot of cuts coming from a lot of different directions,” it said.
For example “… Congressional leaders chose to dramatically reduce revenues states rely on to finance their share of Medicaid, to fund Medicaid expansion, to weather budget short-falls and to expand services,” the Policy Matters report said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“States will now be responsible for a higher burden of health care costs due to H.R. 1’s restrictions on these revenue streams.”
One way the Trump law will do that is by phasing down “state directed payments.” 
Those are payments states can instruct Medicaid managed-care providers to make to cover certain expenses. 
H.R. 1 also prohibits states from increasing provider taxes or creating new ones. 
Those two measures will take away between $6.5 billion and $13 billion over the next decade to fund the state’s Medicaid expansion, the report said. 
The expansion provides health coverage to 770,000 Ohioans and has cut the state’s uninsured rate in half.
In June, Gov. Mike DeWine signed a budget containing a provision that would end Ohio’s Medicaid expansion if the federal government funds less than 90% of the cost. 
That’s a real possibility in light of the cuts buried in the law Trump signed this summer.
“In short, Congressional leaders chose to dramatically reduce revenues states rely on to finance their share of Medicaid, to fund Medicaid expansion, to weather budget short-falls and to expand services,” the Policy Matters report said. 
“States will now be responsible for a higher burden of health care costs due to H.R. 1’s restrictions on these revenue streams.”
Huge numbers of Ohioans also could lose federal food benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance, or SNAP, program.
The state got an idea of the effects of such a loss last month, when Trump decided to delay food benefits during the partial government shutdown. 
Many Ohio food pantries reported record demand during the resulting crisis.
The bill he signed this summer will take away an estimated $416 million a year in food assistance to needy Ohioans. 
Given that the average recipient gets just $6.17 per day from the program, the loss will be felt by many.
Ninety two percent of adult SNAP recipients under 65 are either working, in school, ill and unable to work, or unable to because of caregiving responsibilities. 
Most others can only receive three months of benefits in a three year span unless they can show that they’re either working or receiving 80 hours of job training each month. 
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act removed exceptions for the homeless, people between 55 and 64, people living in areas with high unemployment, parents whose youngest child is 14, veterans and former foster youth.
“The Urban Institute estimates that 717,000 Ohio families will lose some or all of their SNAP benefits under the administration’s megabill,” the Policy Matters report said.
In addition, states will now face gigantic charges if their error rates in processing SNAP benefits aren’t reduced to what some experts see as unrealistic levels.
Ohio lawmakers will be faced with the prospect of finding money elsewhere if many thousands are to avoid going sick or hungry, or both, the report said. 
It added that the General Assembly has a poor track record in such matters.
“In Ohio, state legislators have created an increasingly inequitable tax system over the last two decades, costing the state $12.8 billion in lost annual revenues per year (largely through cuts to income taxes) as of 2024,” it said. 
“This lost revenue amounts to almost half of the tax revenue collected by Ohio for its General Revenue Fund in fiscal year 2024.”

(Getty Images)Lawmakers in both Concord and Washington, D.C., spent much of 2025 debating cuts and changes to Medicaid, the nation’s public health care program for low-income people and those with disabilities. Now, state lawmakers are preparing to debate how to implement the changes in 2026.
When they passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act over the objections of their Democratic counterparts, congressional Republicans instituted a series of changes to Medicaid. Most notably, they created a work requirement and mandated Medicaid enrollees work 80 hours per month to receive coverage. Because Medicaid is a program run jointly by the federal and state governments, the bill requires each state to formulate a system to implement these work requirements.
New Hampshire Republicans have already begun this process in a series of House committee meetings.
Lawmakers will have to determine how the state verifies whether Medicaid enrollees are working enough to meet the requirement. Rep. Jim Kofalt, a Wilton Republican, has proposed the state ban self-attestation and require documentary evidence as an amendment to 2025’s Senate Bill 134. If that change is adopted, enrollees would be required to document their work schedule rather than simply tell the government they’re working.
Kofalt also proposed an amendment that would require enrollees to work for three consecutive months in order to gain Medicaid eligibility. However, he and his colleagues backed away from the three-month look-back after discussions with Medicaid Director Henry Lipman.
State Republicans have also filed legislation to direct the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services — which is responsible for operating the state’s Medicaid program — to follow the federal government’s new work requirements rather than apply for a federal waiver to create state guidelines.
“Currently we have Medicaid requirements in state statute that have not been implemented,” Kofalt said during a November legislative work session. “They are different from the federal requirements. What we really want to do is go with the federal requirements for a number of reasons. That’s going to be better, faster, financially viable.”
Republicans argue Medicaid should be reserved for those who either cannot work or those who are working. The requirements include exemptions for people with disabilities and medical issues that prevent them from working, though critics question whether states will be able to handle the bureaucracy necessary to determine who is eligible for those exemptions.
In implementing the work requirements, Republicans will be attempting to avoid past mistakes. In 2018, New Hampshire created a 100-hour-per-month Medicaid work requirement. However, a month after the rule went into effect, then-Gov. Chris Sununu paused the requirements because only 8,000 of the 25,000 people subject to the requirement had completed the necessary paperwork to document their hours. The remaining roughly 17,000 Medicaid recipients were set to lose coverage, even after the state had spent more than $130,000 on outreach efforts to teach enrollees about the new requirements.
Democrats have long pointed to what happened in 2018 as evidence that work requirements, because of the large bureaucracy required to manage them, will revoke coverage from people who actually do work. They point to a number of studies, including research compiled by the Brookings Institution, that suggest work requirements don’t increase employment, as many Republicans claim.
A group of Democrats led by Nashua Rep. Laura Telerski, the House Democratic deputy leader, is filing a bill that would direct Health and Human Services to “identify the impact of Medicaid changes on New Hampshire residents’ access to health care.” The bill is still being drafted by legislative staff.
In addition to work requirements, New Hampshire Republicans enacted several changes to Medicaid on the state level. In a plan spearheaded by Gov. Kelly Ayotte and amended by House and Senate Republicans, some Medicaid enrollees will have to pay a fee of up to $270 per month in order to keep their coverage. This was done as a cost-saving measure.
The final enacted version of this plan will require enrollees making 100% of the poverty line or more to pay between $60 to $100 per month, depending on the size of their families; enrollees making at least 255% of the poverty line will be required to pay $190 to $270 monthly. For reference, that means a family of three earning $59,962.50 is set to pay $233 a month under this new law, based on 2025’s poverty level guidelines. A family of three earning $26,650 will pay $90 a month under the law.
Democrats have lambasted the premiums as cruel and likened them to an “income tax on the poor.” Ayotte has defended the premiums by pointing out that New Hampshire’s eligibility requirements are broad compared to other states.
Indeed, New Hampshire has the fourth (tied with Connecticut) most expansive Medicaid income eligibility requirements for children among U.S. states and Washington, D.C., as of January, the most recent data available, according to KFF.
Ayotte also proposed increasing the portion of prescription costs, or copays, that enrollees are responsible for. Starting in January, Medicaid recipients are set to pay $2 or $3 for their prescriptions instead of the previous copay of $1.
Democrats are now trying to reverse these changes. Senate Bill 484, sponsored by Sen. Cindy Rosenwald, a Nashua Democrat, would repeal the 2025 provisions that enacted the premiums and copays. A proposed bill in the House, sponsored by Telerski, that is also still in the drafting phase seeks to similarly stop the two Medicaid changes from going into effect.
“Far too many Granite Staters are skipping care because of the cost,” Portsmouth Sen. Rebecca Perkins Kwoka, the Senate minority leader and a co-sponsor of the bill, said at a press conference in late September before the bill language was released. “Our plan caps out-of-pocket costs and repeals Gov. Ayotte’s Medicaid income tax that taxes working families hundreds of dollars a month.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/medicaidumbrella-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-04 05:56:49.196770

(Getty image)Just because a good idea came from the other political tribe doesn’t mean it’s a bad idea. 
For example: The 2001 No Child Left Behind law did states a huge favor by providing the resources to build massive information systems that school districts just couldn’t afford. The data helped educators pinpoint successes, failures and inequalities. Sadly, the bill demanded that schools meet statistically impossible benchmarks or face specific harsh consequences for the failure to do so. 
In that same bill, though, were mandates and money for “Reading First,” designed to clear away debunked Whole Language and Balanced Literacy to make way for science-of-reading techniques. Sadly, educators rejected Reading First, mostly because it was associated with Republicans. If only the education industry embraced retooling reading instruction 25 years ago, America’s dismal reading proficiency would be in a far better place, especially among urban kids. 
Let’s not make a similar mistake again.
Buried inside the deeply troublesome federal law called the “Big Beautiful Bill Act” is an opportunity called the Educational Choice for Children Act. Its virtues are hard to see because it’s wrapped in language offering students vouchers to private school. For Rhode Island’s powerful anti-school-choice advocates, that’s a hard “no.” Families who vote with their feet reduce the districts’ market share of students’ per pupil expenditure and the number of unionized jobs.
But private-school vouchers are not mandated. Not even expansions of choice are mandated. 
In fact, the Republican budget reconciliation package specifies that the money can pay for certain big-ticket items. Like tutoring, technology, after-school programs, transportation, dual enrollment in higher education and services for students with disabilities, among others.
That’s a lot. Researchers studying the effects of the federal pandemic money found that tutoring is hands-down the best technique for improving academic outcomes, especially among struggling performers. 
Similarly, Rhode Island can’t begin to meet the demand for after-school programs. Parents and kids would be ever so grateful for more. Dual enrollment? Supports to special needs kids? What’s not to like?
Rejecting the money throws the baby out with the voucher bathwater, just as we did with Reading First. 
We badly need to start putting kids’ needs first, before protecting adults.
Here’s how the law works: States must agree to participate, or not. Already three states have said yes (Nebraska, Tennessee and North Carolina) and three no (Wisconsin, Oregon and New Mexico), splitting along predictable partisan lines.
Participating states offer local nonprofits the opportunity to become “Scholarship-Granting Organizations.” Think: organizations like Family Services, Children’s Friend or Progresso Latino. They would start accepting donations in 2026 for services to be delivered in 2027.
Individual taxpayers can donate up to $1,700 per year, and take a 100% federal tax write-off, which is an unprecedented, dollar-for-dollar tax break. The donation cap came down from $5,000 and earlier, $10,000. Corporations cannot donate at all. The money flows through nonprofits directly to students or programs like tutoring, with any necessary collaboration, but not interference of the government nor its school systems. 
Governors must decide to join or not. Governors seem always to be in campaign mode and often make decisions contrary to the public good to get themselves elected. Will Gov. Dan McKee sign on and be clear how the money would help student-oriented programs thrive? Or will he turn down the opportunity to demonstrate partisan solidarity with those who dislike school choice? 
Unless you have money to leave the public system, charters are the only form of choice in Rhode Island. Even before the pandemic, families nationally and locally were leaving district schools for community-created personalized learning environments like learning pods, micro-schools, home-schooling. The Act would like to accelerate those choices but again, we don’t have to. 
Internationally more than 80% of the worlds’ school systems have funding mechanisms that blur any division between public and private. Those countries just want the kids to be well educated. Our leaders need to get real about demonstrating the same objective.
Actually, I’m no fan of private school vouchers because public tax money becomes invisible inside private compounds free of public accountability.
So the challenge is to look past the voucher/choice noise and sign up for the free money that will help the ocean of students who need tutoring, after-school engagement, special needs help and so on. 
Right now, this opportunity is up to the governor. Let’s not keep making the same tribal prejudice mistakes. Clearly, we’d have to keep our eye on this program so we get genuinely good public services.
But for once, state leaders, focus on the public good. Take the money and run.

Medicare, the public health insurance for older Americans, is piloting a new prior authorization program powered by artificial intelligence that some physicians fear will result in more denials and delays in medical care for patients. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) A Medicare pilot program will allow private companies to use artificial intelligence to review older Americans’ requests for certain medical care — and will reward the companies when they deny it.
In January, the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will launch the Wasteful and Inappropriate Services Reduction (WISeR) Model to test AI-powered prior authorizations on certain health services for Medicare patients in six states: Arizona, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas and Washington. The program is scheduled to last through 2031.
The program effectively inserts one of private insurance’s most unpopular features — prior authorization — into traditional Medicare, the federal health insurance program for people 65 and older and those with certain disabilities. Prior authorization is the process by which patients and doctors must ask health insurers to approve medical procedures or drugs before proceeding.
Adults over 65 generally have two options for health insurance: traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage. Both types of Medicare are funded with public dollars, but Medicare Advantage plans are contracted through private insurance companies. Medicare Advantage plans tend to cost less out of pocket, but patients enrolled in them often must seek prior authorization for care.
AI-powered prior authorization in Medicaid Advantage and private insurance has attracted intense criticism, legislative action by state and federal lawmakers, federal investigations and class-action lawsuits. It’s been linked to bad health outcomes. Dozens of states have passed legislation in recent years to regulate the practice.
In June, the Trump administration even extracted a pledge from major health insurers to streamline and reduce prior authorization.
“Americans shouldn’t have to negotiate with their insurer to get the care they need,” U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a June statement announcing the pledge. “Pitting patients and their doctors against massive companies was not good for anyone.”
Four days after the pledge was announced, the administration rolled out the new WISeR program, scheduled to take effect in January. It will require prior authorizations only for certain services and prescriptions that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has identified as “particularly vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse, or inappropriate use.” Those services include, among other things, knee arthroscopy for knee osteoarthritis, skin and tissue substitutes, certain nerve stimulation services and incontinence control devices.
The companies get paid based on how much money they save Medicare by denying approvals for “unnecessary or non-covered services,” CMS said in a statement unveiling the program.
The new program has alarmed many physicians and advocates in the affected states.
AI vs. AI: Patients deploy bots to battle health insurers that deny care

“In concept, it makes a lot of sense; you don’t want to pay for care that patients don’t need,” said Jeb Shepard, policy director for the Washington State Medical Association.
“But in practice, [prior authorization] has been hugely problematic because it essentially acts as a barrier. There are a lot of denials and lengthy appeals processes that pull physicians away from providing care to patients. They have to fight with insurance carriers to get their patients the care they believe is appropriate.”
CMS responded to Stateline’s questions by providing additional information about the program, but offered few details on what the agency would do to prevent delays or denials of care. It has said that final decisions on coverage denials will be made by “licensed clinicians, not machines.” In a bid to hold the companies accountable, CMS also incentivizes them for making determinations in a reasonable amount of time, and for making the right determinations according to Medicare rules, without needing appeals.
In the statement announcing the program, Abe Sutton, director of the CMS Innovation Center, said the “low-value services” targeted by WISeR “offer patients minimal benefit and, in some cases, can result in physical harm and psychological stress. They also increase patient costs while inflating health care spending.”
A vulnerable group
Dr. Bindu Nayak is an endocrinologist in Wenatchee, Washington, a city near the center of the state that bills itself as the “Apple Capital of the World.” She mainly treats patients with diabetes and estimates 30-40% of her patients have Medicare.
“Medicare recipients are a vulnerable group,” Nayak told Stateline. “The WISeR program puts more barriers up for them accessing care. And they may have to now deal with prior authorization when they never had to deal with it before.”
Nayak and other physicians worry the same problems with prior authorizations that they’ve seen with their Medicare Advantage patients will plague traditional Medicare patients. Nayak has employees on staff whose only role is to handle prior authorizations.
More than a quarter of physicians nationwide say prior authorization issues led to a serious problem for a patient in their care, including hospitalization or permanent damage, according to the most recent report from the American Medical Association.
And some patients are unfairly denied treatment. Private insurers have denied care for people with Medicare Advantage plans even though their prior authorization requests met Medicare’s requirements, according to an investigation from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services published in 2022. Investigators found 13% of prior authorization denials were for requests that should have been granted.
But supporters of the new model say something must be done to reduce costs. Medicare is the largest single purchaser of health care in the nation, with spending expected to double in the next decade, according to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an independent federal agency. Medicare spent as much as $5.8 billion in 2022 on services with little or no benefit to patients.
Congress pushes back
In November, congressional representatives from Ohio, Washington and other states introduced a bill to repeal the WISeR model. It’s currently in committee.
States try to rein in health insurers’ claim denials, with mixed results

“The [Trump] administration has publicly admitted prior authorization is harmful, yet it is moving forward with this misguided effort that would make seniors navigate more red tape to get the care they’re entitled to,” U.S. Rep. Suzan DelBene, a Washington Democrat and a co-sponsor of the bill, said in a November statement.
Physician and hospital groups in many of the affected states have backed the bill, which would halt the program at least temporarily. Shepard, whose medical association supports the bill, said that would give CMS time to get more stakeholder input and give physicians more time to prepare for extra administrative requirements.
“Conventional wisdom would dictate a program of this magnitude that has elicited so much concern from so many corners would at least be delayed while we work through some things,” Shepard said, “but there’s no indication that they’re going to back off this.”
Adding more prior authorization requirements for a new subset of Medicare patients will tack on extra administrative burdens for physicians, especially those in orthopedics, urology and neurology, fields that have a higher share of services that fall under the new rules.
That increased administrative burden “will probably lead to a lot longer wait times for patients,” Nayak said. “It will be important for patients to realize that they may see more barriers in the form of denials, but they should continue to advocate for themselves.”
Dr. Jayesh Shah, president of the Texas Medical Association and a San Antonio-based wound care physician, said WISeR is a well-intentioned program, but that prior authorization hurts patients and physicians.
“Prior authorization delays care and sometimes also denies care to patients who need it, and it increases the hassle factor for all physicians,” he told Stateline.
Shah added that, on the flip side, he’s heard from a few physicians who welcome prior authorization. They’d rather get preapproval for a procedure than perform it and later have Medicare deny reimbursement if the procedure didn’t meet requirements, he said.
Prior authorization has been a bipartisan concern in Congress and statehouses around the country.
Last year, 10 states — Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Vermont, Virginia and Wyoming — passed laws regulating prior authorization, according to the American Medical Association. Legislatures in at least 18 states have addressed prior authorization so far this year, an analysis from health policy publication Health Affairs Forefront found. Bipartisan groups of lawmakers in more than a dozen states have passed laws regulating the use of AI in health care.
But the new effort in the U.S. House to repeal the WISeR program is sponsored by Democrats. Supporters worry it’s unlikely to gain much traction in the Republican-controlled Congress.

– Dr. Jayesh Shah, president of the Texas Medical Association


Shepard said his organization has talked with state and congressional representatives, met with the regional CMS office twice, and sent a letter to CMS Director Dr. Mehmet Oz.
“We’ve looked at all the levers and we’ve pulled most of them,” Shepard said. “We’re running out of levers to pull.”
Venture capital jumps in
CMS announced in November it has selected six private tech companies to pilot the AI programs.
Some of them are backed by venture capital funds that count larger insurance companies among their key investors.
For example, Oklahoma’s pilot will be run by Humata Health Inc., which is backed by investors that include Blue Venture Fund, the venture capital arm of Blue Cross Blue Shield companies, and Optum Ventures, a venture capital firm connected to UnitedHealth Group, the parent company of UnitedHealthcare. Innovaccer Inc., chosen to run Ohio’s program, counts health care giant Kaiser Permanente as an investor.
Nayak said she knows little about Virtix Health, the Arizona-based private company contracted by the feds to run Washington state’s pilot program.
“Virtix Health would have a financial incentive to deny claims,” Nayak said. “It begs the question, would there be any safeguards to prevent profit-driven denials of care?”
That financial incentive is a concern in Texas too.
“If, financially, the vendor is going to benefit by the denial, it could be a problem for our patients,” Shah said. He said that Oz, in a webinar presentation on the new program, assured physicians that their satisfaction and turnaround times would be metrics that Medicare would factor into the tech companies’ payments.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-04 10:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Harding High’s progress marks turning point for Bridgeport schools,Reginald David,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/04/bridgeport-harding-high-school-turnaround-status/,Harding High is no longer on the state's list of lowest-performing schools. Staff and students say the changes are palpable.,"Warren Harding High School’s transformation was on full display at this year’s pep rally as students streamed through the halls just before the event. The atmosphere was calmer than in years past, and Principal Vernon Thompson said that shift reflects the deeper work that helped the school move off the state’s turnaround list, meaning the school has met specific improvement goals and is no longer considered one of the state’s lowest-performing.
For the first time in years, Harding is now a focus school. This means the school has made progress, but still receives targeted state support to help students with higher needs continue improving, placing it a step above turnaround status and on a clearer path toward sustained achievement.
Thompson said the school’s progress began with changing how staff responded to student behavior. Instead of relying on removal or punishment, the school built a system that treats behavior as something connected to students’ needs and well-being. Harding expanded partnerships with mental health providers like Effective School Solutions and LifeBridge, which gave students access to clinical support during the school day.

Thompson said this approach helped students stay in school and helped staff address the root causes of disengagement. “When you look at behavior as clinical instead of punitive, you can actually heal,” he said. “That is when you start to see change.”
The shift in climate allowed teachers to spend more time focusing on instruction. Thompson said teachers had long been pulled in two directions, trying to teach while managing chronic disruptions. As hallway culture improved, teachers were able to reconnect with professional development, coaching and more consistent classroom expectations.
The school has tracked improvements in chronic absenteeism, graduation rates, ninth grade on-track data, and failure rates, which Thompson said are among the indicators the district reviews when monitoring progress.
Harding’s improvement is part of a broader shift across Bridgeport schools. Barnum, Roosevelt, and Madison schools all exited state lists of underperforming schools this year after sustained academic gains. Bassick High School has also shown growth in its graduation rates. District leaders say these changes signal that progress is possible when schools have consistent leadership, community partnerships, and targeted support.
The district as a whole has been receiving state intervention for nearly a year. Last January, the Board of Education voted to allow the state to intervene in the Bridgeport Public Schools by providing a “technical assistance team,” required training for district board members and having the state approve the district’s permanent hire for superintendent.

At Harding, teachers say the changes are real. English teacher Amanda Palmer said this is the first time in years she has seen sustained stability among the staff. She said teachers feel anchored by clearer expectations and stronger support for students who are struggling. “Students are responding to structure that is built on consistency and care,” she said. “You can feel that people want to be here, and that makes a huge difference.”

Palmer said she has stayed at Harding because she believes the work is moving in the right direction and because she feels the staff is finally pulling in the same direction.

The academic culture has also shifted, according to English teacher Leah Rosen. She said more students are taking advanced courses and advocating for themselves. “Students have a stronger sense of what they can do,” she said. “They walk into class expecting to learn, not expecting conflict. That is a real change from a few years ago.”

Rosen said she sees students pushing themselves more and taking pride in gaining skills they once felt were out of reach.

Students say they have felt the changes directly. Some describe the building environment as stricter and more structured. Fewer students roam hallways and teachers enforce rules more consistently. For many students, this shift has raised expectations for themselves.
Rebecca Bristol, a senior, said she regularly used to show up “mad late,” sometimes 30 minutes into the school day. This year she says she takes her time in school more seriously. “I know I have to get there. I cannot be slipping up. I am here to get my education.”
Other students acknowledge that the increased structure can feel overwhelming at times, but they also describe a stronger network of support. Senior David Basnueva said he struggled with stress during his junior and senior years and leaned on a school social worker who helped him manage the pressure. A teacher connected him with a summer college preparation program that he said changed how he viewed his own potential. “If you go out of your way to talk to people here, you build a network,” he said. “Harding actually gave me opportunities I do not think I would have had otherwise.”
Students say the school’s culture has shifted in ways that feel more communal and less chaotic. Junior Jazlee Montalvo said Harding has become a place where students feel comfortable with one another and are encouraged to explore interests beyond academics. She pointed to a health teacher who also coached the volleyball team to a national competition.
She also raised a persistent concern for students: transportation. With many students relying on public buses, late arrivals remain a challenge. “More reliable transportation would make it easier to get here and make school more enjoyable,” she said.
Teachers say the improvements they see inside the building still depend heavily on whether students can get there on time and ready to learn. The school has expanded early college opportunities and career programming, but students cannot benefit if they walk through the door already overwhelmed, Assistant Principal Matthew Corcoran said.
“We have the pieces in place,” he said. “What students need is stability outside the building too. When that happens, everything inside becomes more effective.”

Corcoran said the consistency in leadership has also mattered. “Having a principal who stays, who sets expectations and sticks to them, has been important for building trust,” he said.
Thompson said student feedback is central to maintaining the school’s momentum. Students have asked for more school events, more spaces to celebrate academic success and more extracurricular opportunities.
The school has responded by building out activities, finding funding for student experiences and doing what Thompson calls small things that make students feel valued, including providing pre-game meals prepared by a local chef for athletes before state competitions. “We may not have all the dollars, but we find a way to make students feel as special as they are,” he said.
Teachers say those gestures matter. Rosen said students notice when the school recognizes their accomplishments. The culture shift feels sustainable because it is rooted in relationships rather than shortcuts, Palmer said. 
The question now is whether the district and state will maintain long-term support. “We can keep building, but it will take continued investment,” Corcoran said.
Thompson said the school still faces significant challenges, especially around trauma that students carry from outside the building. Many ninth graders enter high school already behind in credits or facing family or community stress. “Trauma is not going anywhere,” he said. “The question is how we respond to it and how we make education accessible even when students are facing serious challenges.”
And even with its progress, Harding still has work ahead. The school continues to support a large population of students with higher needs, and leaders say long-term improvement will depend on consistent resources, strong attendance and stability in students’ lives outside the building. At the same time, the school is expanding academic opportunities.
Thompson said the long-term goal is to build a school community that students will trust beyond their own graduation. “When my students become parents, I want this to be a place they are comfortable sending their children,” he said.
Students who will graduate this year say they already see that vision taking shape. Bristol said a teacher helped her discover an interest in accounting and pushed her to pursue programs like the Young Entrepreneurship Program, offered by Bridgeport Caribe Youth Leaders, which is aimed at Bridgeport high schoolers interested in entrepreneurship. “I want to do accounting because of my teacher,” she said. “I learned so much, and she helped me with everything.”
As the school prepared to gather for its pep rally, students said the celebration felt like more than a school spirit event. For some, it represented pride in a building that has changed around them and pride in the progress they have helped create. Thompson said the transformation is ongoing, but the shift in culture is already clear. “Out of our love, we build structure,” he said. “So our students can build success.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1125_SR_HardingTurnaround_386-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-04 05:56:49.196770

Free.,"Most ACA marketplace users can’t afford potential increases, poll shows",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/most-aca-marketplace-users-cant-afford-potential-increases-poll-shows,,"WASHINGTON — Americans who purchase their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace are bracing for a steep rise in costs next year that many say they will not be able to afford, according to a poll released Thursday by the nonpartisan health organization KFF.Nearly 60% of enrollees surveyed could not cover the costs of a $300 annual increase in their premiums, while an additional 20% said they couldn’t afford a $1,000 jump in prices per year. About 90% of those polled said it would be somewhat or very difficult to afford health insurance within their budget if they could no longer purchase a plan through the ACA marketplace.

The spike in prices is predominantly due to the end-of-year expiration date for enhanced tax credits for ACA marketplace plans. Republicans in Congress have so far declined to extend the subsidies, while Democrats shut down the government in an unsuccessful attempt to continue the credits.While increases would vary considerably based on location, income and plan type, a Sept. 30 KFF analysis projected individuals’ annual premiums would rise between around $350 and more than $1,800.Open enrollment for ACA marketplace plans began in many states on Nov. 1 and will run through Dec. 15 for most Americans, giving little time for Congress to broker a deal before the ability to purchase a plan for next year closes.No progress on negotiationsThe Senate is expected to vote next week on a Democratic bill to extend the subsidies, though that legislation appears unlikely to get the 60 votes needed to advance in the Republican-controlled chamber. The Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee held a hearing this week to explore short- and long-term options to bring down health care costs, but senators on that panel didn't reach a clear consensus. KFF President and CEO Drew Altman said in a statement the “poll shows the range of problems Marketplace enrollees will face if the enhanced tax credits are not extended in some form, and those problems will be the poster child of the struggles Americans are having with health care costs in the midterms if Republicans and Democrats cannot resolve their differences.”The KFF poll showed only 9% of marketplace enrollees have a lot of confidence that Republicans in Congress will address rising health insurance costs, with 24% saying they had some confidence, 25% saying they didn’t have much confidence and 42% responding they had no confidence in GOP lawmakers on that particular issue.Blame falls to TrumpACA marketplace enrollees would predominantly fault President Donald Trump if their overall health care costs, including premiums, co-pays and deductibles, were to increase by $1,000 next year, though Republicans and Democrats in Congress would share nearly as much blame, the survey found.Thirty-seven percent would place the responsibility with Trump, while 33% would cite GOP lawmakers and 29% would fault Democrats with the rising costs.Those numbers fluctuate significantly depending on a person’s political affiliation, with 65% of Republicans saying they would blame Democrats, while 20% would credit Republicans in Congress and 14% would fault Trump.Forty-four percent of people who identified as independents said they would blame Trump, while 32% said they would cite Republicans in Congress and 23% said they would fault Democrats.Among Democrats, 49% would blame Trump, 46% would credit congressional Republicans, with the remainder would fault members of their own party.KFF conducted the survey of 1,350 people between Nov. 7-15. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points for the full sample, with a plus or minus 6 percentage points margin of error for political party affiliation questions.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-12-04 06:57:30.690286

Getty Images.Now-defunct Eastern Gateway Community College in Steubenville, Ohio, allegedly mishandled more than $17 million in federal student aid before closing in 2024, according to State Auditor Keith Faber. 
Faber recently released an audit of Eastern Gateway Community College’s finances from July 1, 2022, through June 30, 2023.
Forty-four issues were in the report including unauthorized expenses, financial reporting errors, issues with financial aid, and accounting problems, among others.
The audit said many of these issues led to the college’s financial issues and ultimate closure. 
Eastern Gateway closed in the fall of 2024 after financial and legal troubles.

“This goes beyond sloppiness and honest mistakes,” Faber said in a statement. “The public should be outraged.”
The auditors are questioning all of Eastern Gateway’s Title IV Pell disbursements during fiscal year 2022-23, which total $17.28 million.  
“An institution’s record-keeping practices are paramount to ensuring a proper administration of Title IV programs,” according to the audit. 
“The college failed to provide adequate source documentation … hindering a thorough review of the college’s distance education programs, including evidence that students commenced attendance.”
The college’s former chief financial officer and controller did not make a monthly reconciliation of all accounts which “led to inaccurate reporting in the annual financial statements,” according to the audit. 
“The college was unable to identify, assemble, analyze, classify, and record its transactions correctly or to document compliance with finance related legal and contractual requirements,” according to the audit. 
The audit revealed a lack of policies that led to unauthorized expenses and financial reporting errors. 
There was no list of who had access to the college’s credit cards. The college had an Amazon account used to make purchases, but there was no policy for the account. There was no travel rental car policy, “which was a significant part of the college’s travel expenses,” according to the audit. 
The college opened a PayPal account in June 2023, but there was no policy for use of the account. 
“There is no evidence that the former chief financial officer and former controller approved or otherwise knew about college’s PayPal account,” the audit said. 
Some of the other issues in the audit include: 

The former chief financial officer did not get a certificate of estimated resources or certify the total funds from all sources available for expenditures to the county auditor. 
The college’s former board of trustees did not adopt a formal appropriation measure, meaning the expenses the college’s former chief finance officer and former controller made violated state law. 
Documents to show compliance with federal programs, including TRIO and adult education grants, were “incomplete and inconsistent and based on unreliable data systems,” according to the audit. 
The college did not form a records commission and public records were not properly handled, violating the state’s open records law.
The former board of trustees authorized a $13.6 million bond issue to pay for a Youngstown parking garage even though demolition costs would exceed the property’s value. 

Ohio’s Special Investigation Unit is continuing to investigate the college. 
The U.S. Secret Service, the Ohio State Highway Patrol’s Computer Crimes Unit, the Ohio Narcotics Intelligence Center, the Columbus Division of Police, the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office, and Ohio’s Special Investigation Unit all executed a search warrant in January 2024 related to the investigation.
Eastern Gateway Community College had campuses in Steubenville and Youngstown, and it mainly served students in Trumbull, Mahoning, Columbiana, and Jefferson counties.  
The college was placed on probation by the Higher Learning Commission in November 2021.

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)A national progressive political action committee endorsed U.S. Senate candidate Graham Platner on Wednesday, the latest signal that the political novice’s campaign to replace Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins does not appear to be hindered by his controversial past remarks. 
The endorsement from the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a political action committee associated with progressive movements, comes weeks after Maine and the rest of the country gained a more complete picture of the veteran and oyster farmer’s time before deciding to run for national office. 
In Reddit posts, Platner previously made sexist, racist, homophobic and other offensive statements. He also had a tattoo that resembled a Nazi symbol, a connection he denied knowing until recently, that he’s since covered. 
Some other political figures that the Progressive Change Campaign Committee has previously endorsed include Democratic U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Maxwell Alejandro Frost of Florida, and Jasmine Crockett of Texas.
Endorsements for the Senate race are now stacking up. 
Gov. Janet Mills, who officially entered the primary race days before the controversies were first reported, launched her campaign with the financial backing of national Democrats, specifically a joint fundraising committee between her team and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee called “Maine Senate Victory 2026.”
EMILY’s List, the nation’s largest resource for women in politics, has endorsed Mills, the two-term governor and former attorney general. Prominent political figures have as well, including Democratic governors Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Andy Beshear of Kentucky and Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico. Former candidates for U.S. Senate Daira Smith-Rodriguez and Dan Kleban also suspended their campaigns to endorse her.

In addition to Platner’s new endorsement Wednesday, he has the support of organized labor — United Auto Workers, Maine State Nurses Association, and International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers — as well as a coalition of Democratic youth-focused groups. Independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont has also endorsed him.
The Progressive Change Campaign Committee also on Wednesday released results from a poll conducted on the group’s behalf that has Platner leading Mills in the Democratic primary by 20 points.
The poll, conducted by progressive firm Z to A research on behalf of the partisan group, captured 845 likely Democratic primary voters who submitted responses between Nov. 14 through 18, with a margin of error of ±3% for all midterm voters and ±3.4% for Democratic primary voters. 
Respondents were recruited into an online survey instrument through texts from a voter file sample of likely midterm voters — a method that runs the risk of missing older voters. 
Mills declined to comment on the poll and endorsement. 
This poll follows an October survey from the University of New Hampshire conducted as Platner’s controversies were first being reported, which also had Platner leading Mills.
“It’s amazing to see what it feels like on the ground being reflected directly in a poll like this,” Platner said during a press call. “This I think just lays clear what our theory is, which is that we are not going to defeat Susan Collins running the same exact kind of playbook that we’ve run in the past, which is an established politician, supported by the power structures, supported by Washington, D.C.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_5028-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-04 04:56:13.233313

One triple citizen disagreed, warning that this would be a mistake.
The United States of America is often called a melting pot of culture and ideas. Dr. Brian Edmiston said it’s for good reason.
“You’ve got people who have experience from other countries who can compare,” Edmiston said.
Born in Northern Ireland, he automatically gained dual citizenship with the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.
But he emigrated to the United States in the 1980s and became a U.S. citizen two decades ago.
Now, the triple citizen is a professor at The Ohio State University.
“I wanted to be fully participant in the work of living in this country,” Edmiston said. “I have family who live in Britain, I have family in Ireland, and I go back and forth between both countries.”
We asked if he considers himself an American.
“Yes, definitely,” he responded. “I consider myself an American because I pledged allegiance to the U.S. Constitution and was very pleased to do that.”
But if Edmiston is so pleased to be a citizen of the U.S., Ohio College Republican leader Gabe Guidarini said he and other dual citizens should prove their allegiance.
“If you’re an American, you’re an American citizen — you’re only an American citizen,” Guidarini asserted.
He is supporting Moreno’s new legislation. The Colombia-born lawmaker introduced a bill that would outlaw dual citizenship.
“If you’re going to come to this country and use our resources and seek the American dream, then that has to be a full-term commitment to the American dream,” Guidarini said. “Otherwise, how can we trust you?”
The college student said dual citizens should denounce their other citizenships, just like Moreno did when he became a U.S. citizen at 18.
“Existing law allows certain United States citizens to maintain foreign citizenship, which may create conflicts of interest and divided loyalties,” the legislation states.
“It is in the national interest of the United States to ensure that United States citizenship is held exclusively.”
The senator was unavailable for an interview, but provided a statement:
“It was an honor to pledge an Oath of Allegiance to the United States of America and ONLY to the United States of America!” Moreno said. “Being an American citizen is an honor and a privilege — and if you want to be an American, it’s all or nothing. It’s time to end dual citizenship for good.”
Guidarini claimed that dual citizens “exploit” the system by spending money in their other country.
We asked how it’s possible to police people’s money — referencing how the U.S. would need to track citizens’ spending habits, as well as how American businesses have factories that are out of the country.
“It’s not about policing people’s money, it’s about making sure that America is the sole commitment,” he responded.
He said that if it’s just transactional, like a business from China investing in the U.S., that is different than a dual citizen taking money earned from their job and sending it to relatives out of the country.
We asked if he had seen dual citizens exploiting the system, to which he responded that college students with visas — a temporary pass to stay in the U.S. and not full citizenship — will get a local job and not participate in the American economy.
“I think that there should be a bare minimum commitment here to where, if you’re coming to America, if you’re using our services, if you’re using our taxpayer dollars… your financial advancement should also be for the collective benefit of America,” Guidarini said. “You should not be able to simply use America’s resources and take it to your country where you came from.”
These are non-arguments, Edmiston said.
“I see no conflict between being a citizen of three different jurisdictions,” Edmiston said.
We asked how he would feel if there was a choice that he had to make, choosing between his three different citizenships.
“I don’t know… It’s upsetting,” he responded. “Loyalty is not something that is unitary, and it’s not exclusionary.”
This is a way to make all immigration, but specifically legal immigration, more difficult, he added.
“I legally emigrated here and went through the process and was proud to do that,” the professor said. “This is putting people into categories, saying, ‘These are the real Americans.'”
And for Edmiston, his three passports tell a story — one that exemplifies the American dream.
“You should be encouraging people to stay, not pushing them out, not giving them a false choice,” he said.
The United States won’t be better off, he said, if the melting pot runs dry.

Two years ago, the Biden administration announced $7 billion in funding for a nationwide network of hydrogen hubs meant to kickstart production of the alternative fuel.

(Millennium Reign Energy)This story was originally published by Canary Media.

Two years ago, the Biden administration announced $7 billion in funding for a nationwide network of hydrogen hubs meant to kickstart production of the alternative fuel.


Now, the Trump administration has cast doubt over the future of the program — including the Appalachian Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub, or ARCH2, which features projects in Ohio.


Despite the turbulence, industry leaders said they see a bright future for hydrogen in Ohio.


“We’re building businesses in this state regardless of that federal funding,” said Bill Whittenberger, executive director of the Ohio Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Coalition, at the group’s 2025 symposium, held Oct. 27 and 28 at the Honda Heritage Center in Marysville, Ohio. In his view, federal funding ​“makes things go a little faster, [but] there’s a strong business case for all the things we’re doing here.”


Many see hydrogen as necessary for decarbonizing hard-to-electrify operations, such as steel and glassmaking, as well as some transportation sectors.


Today, however, few industries use the fuel at a meaningful scale — and very little low-carbon hydrogen is available.


The Biden administration’s hub initiative meant to change that by bringing down the cost of low-carbon hydrogen, which can be produced with renewable energy, nuclear power, or natural gas with carbon capture and storage.


The initiative sparked detailed planning for dozens of projects throughout the hub regions. In Ohio, proposals took on different shapes: One developer wanted to use solar power to make hydrogen for buses in Stark County, while another planned to derive the fuel from a chemical plant’s waste stream. Still others looked to expand storage and refueling operations in central and northeastern Ohio.


The Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act also created a lucrative federal tax credit for clean-hydrogen projects, an incentive that successful lobbying preserved through the end of 2027 in Republicans’ massive budget bill signed into law in July. But even with this federal support in place, the nascent industry has been on shaky ground. Some high-profile green-hydrogen projects were already floundering before this year.


The Trump administration’s October cancellation of federal dollars for two of the hubs that focused on hydrogen from renewable energy raised urgent questions about the viability of many hydrogen ventures nationwide.


The fate of the other five hubs remains uncertain. Last month, their names appeared on a leaked Energy Department list alongside a note to ​“terminate,” but the DOE has not confirmed their status.


Still, conference attendees emphasized, some hydrogen projects are moving forward in Ohio.


There’s the plan from American Electric Power’s Ohio utility to power data centers with fuel cells, for example. It’s part of a broader AEP partnership with Bloom Energy to acquire up to 1 gigawatt of fuel cells to help the giant computing facilities get online faster.


“Speed to power trumps all other things,” said Amy Koscielak, a senior business development leader for AEP.


At the outset, though, the systems planned in central Ohio for Amazon Data Services and Cologix Johnstown will run on natural gas. Eventually, AEP has said, they could switch to run on hydrogen.

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE

Earlier this year, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio green-lit plans for AEP’s Ohio utility to provide the systems’ output exclusively to those customers, although appeals are pending.


Hydrogen also features in vehicle offerings from American Honda Motor Co. Although its hybrid cars that can use either hydrogen or battery electric power are built in Marysville, most of them go to California.


In general, battery-powered electric vehicles are probably the best option for ​“small mobility,” said Gary Robinson, vice president of sustainability and business development for the company. Indeed, hydrogen cars remain niche at best. But ​“trucks, buses, industrial equipment — all of those things, in our opinion, are perfect candidates for hydrogen,” Robinson said. The company is exploring shipping and aviation as other potential markets for fuel cells.


Ohio also has a few projects looking to harness electrolysis — a process that uses electricity to separate water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. If the electricity that feeds into electrolysis is clean, the resulting hydrogen is clean too.


Dayton-based Millennium Reign Energy supplied electrolyzer equipment to provide initial fill-ups for the fuel-cell hybrids that Honda has made in Marysville since last year, and it has provided fueling equipment to other locations in the United States and abroad. The company plans to add two fueling stations for its Emerald H2 network in the Dayton area by April, CEO Chris McWhinney told Canary Media.


Plug Power also relies on electrolyzers to produce its hydrogen. The 28-year-old company’s first big order back in 2007 was for fuel cells to power pallet trucks at a Walmart distribution center in Washington Court House, Ohio, said Mike Ahearn, vice president for North American service. He did not talk about projects the company would do as part of ARCH2, if it moves ahead, but he did describe work outside of Ohio.


Plug Power remains on track to start construction next year on a wind-powered hydrogen plant capable of producing around 45 tons per day in Graham, Texas. ​“We are on a good trajectory,” Ahearn said, adding that the company’s goal is to turn a profit next year — something it hasn’t done yet over its almost three decades in operation.


Independence Hydrogen, another ARCH2 project-development partner, concentrates on local hydrogen production and distribution. While federal funding remains uncertain, the company still hopes it can move ahead with the Ohio project that would be part of the hub.


The company’s method of making the alternative fuel doesn’t fit neatly on the ​“hydrogen rainbow” that indicates whether production relies on renewable energy or fossil fuels.


Rather, the source would be an industrial waste stream from the INEOS KOH plant in Ashtabula, Ohio. The plant makes potassium hydroxide and other chemicals, and releases a waste stream that is almost all hydrogen. Independence Hydrogen would basically ​“clean up” the gas by removing water and other impurities and then compress it for transport.


But ​“I need an offtaker,” said William Lehner, chief strategy officer for the company. ​“We would love to provide that project.”


Indeed, most companies at last week’s symposium would love more customers, but it’s unclear how quickly interest in the alternative fuel will ramp up if federal funding for ARCH2 and other hydrogen hubs remains in limbo and if tax incentives aren’t extended further.


The DOE’s ​“hydrogen shot,” launched in 2021, aimed to scale up the production of clean hydrogen and cut its cost to $1 per kilogram — an 80% reduction — by 2031. While developers would still cover at least half the project costs at the hubs, federal grants would have reduced total expenses and let them charge customers less for their hydrogen. The hope was that the lower prices would stoke demand.


The Trump administration’s actions to dismantle decarbonization policy also raise questions about clean hydrogen’s future. Without sticks that punish greenhouse gas emissions or carrots that make zero- and low-carbon fuels cheaper, a lot of projects face a difficult road ahead.

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)What do we owe one another?
This strikes me as one of the most important questions facing Kansans and Americans today. When our family, friends and neighbors pursue a harmful course, do we offer them unthinking affirmation or do we push back and challenge them for the harm they inflict? Do we insist on responsibility over rationalization?
This comes to mind because of two recent regional stories that have riveted readers from coast to coast. One was the arrest of Coldwater Mayor Joe Ceballos on voter fraud charges. The other was the failing grade given to University of Oklahoma student Samantha Fulnecky for a lousy essay. Her case has nonetheless ignited a firestorm of conservative grievance, including an unhelpful Twitter post from Kansas gubernatorial candidate Jeff Colyer.
In each case, those following the news face a disquieting choice — sympathize or scrutinize.
If you choose to scrutinize, does that make you somehow complicit in our fractured public debate? If you choose to pat participants on the head and say you feel their pain, do you let them off the hook? To put it brutally simply: Do we tell others the truth or dispense comforting lies?
I’m a professional opinion editor and columnist. You probably know where I stand. I believe that public officials, public policies and the public as a whole should be challenged when warranted. That doesn’t mean I’m judging anyone’s soul, or saying anyone is a good or bad person. It means that people make bad choices and I write about them. Perhaps, if enough people take my words to heart, they will make better ones.
You can watch this dynamic play out in the case of Fulnecky, an OU pre-med student. She wrote a reaction essay to a scholarly article about “gender typicality, peer relations, and mental health.” Her instructor gave the junior 0 points out of a possible 25, saying the piece “does not answer the questions for this assignment, contradicts itself, heavily uses personal ideology over empirical evidence in a scientific class, and is at times offensive.”
In pre-social media days, you would usually have to take both parties’ word in such conflicts. In our modern era, however, the campus chapter of Turning Point USA posted Fulnecky’s assignment directly to Twitter.
“Women naturally want to do womanly things because God has created us with those womanly desires in our hearts,” she wrote. “The same goes for men.”
That’s subpar. Rather than demonstrating genuine engagement with the article, the student filibusters about her religious beliefs. And rather than take her instructor’s reaction to heart and acknowledge her shortcomings, Fulnecky sought martyrdom by running to a campus conservative organization.
I’m an old-fashioned kind of person. I thought universities were meant to challenge students, not coddle them.
Or as conservative writer Richard Hanania snarked: “You have to pass students who only cite religious faith for their opinions now or they’re victims of discrimination.”
As for the mess in Coldwater, I’ve had my say. I’ve heard from folks in the area and understand how personally those words landed. My column wasn’t intended to harm anyone. However, I wanted to provoke a twinge of discomfort — perhaps in the way that Fulnecky’s teacher wanted her to contemplate complex issues. I’m not sure how anyone learns otherwise.
In my four-plus years of doing this job, I have tried to walk the line between empathizing with individuals and spotlighting harmful actions and beliefs. I have tried to focus on the fact that every one of us can choose to do better. We can choose to change and lift one another up rather than push one another down. 
That requires confronting tough truths and committing to introspection.
I will never — in the stories mentioned above or any others to come — offer comforting platitudes. Neither should you. The fact is, our fellow Kansans don’t always want to do the right thing. Sometimes they ignore pressing needs. Sometimes they just behave terribly.
It doesn’t do any of us any good to pretend otherwise.

Over the weekend, an article by a financial advisor named Michael Green made headlines in a number of prominent media sources. 
In this article, Green argues that the federal poverty line for a family four shouldn’t be $32,000 as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services designates it, but should instead be $140,000.
Green comes to this conclusion by collecting average costs for a range of goods and adding them up. 
This is similar to the approach taken by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Amy Glasmeier in her Living Wage Calculator. 
Her number for Ohio comes out to $38.47 per hour, which equals about $80,000. So considerably more than the federal poverty line, but considerably less than what Green comes up with.
There are reasons to be skeptical about this approach to measuring poverty. 
A central question here as a former philosophy undergraduate and a current poverty analyst is “what is poverty?” 
Whether we’re thinking about poverty as a measure of absolute deprivation connected to some sort of sense of biological needs or if we’re seeing it as a measure of relative deprivation connected to social needs, using average expenditure on a wide range of goods as the sole determinant of the threshold is a problematic way to define poverty.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The most widely-accepted measure of poverty by poverty researchers is the Supplemental Poverty Measure. 
This is a poverty measure that uses spending as a baseline for its measurement, but instead of using average spending as the baseline, it measures how many households are below a certain percentage of average spending. 
Its threshold for a family of four in 2024 was about $39,000. So still considerably higher than the $32,000 of the official poverty threshold, but far below the MIT and Green calculations.
In the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international organization for development of economic policy, poverty is defined at 50% of median household income. 
This is a handy measure when measuring across countries due to simplicity, and also captures the essence of practical poverty policy across countries: how many people fall far from the norm when it comes to household resources. 
Using this measurement, a poverty threshold for Ohio would be about $36,000, half of the median household income at $72,000.
How do we make sense of these different measures? Is the poverty threshold $32,000, $39,000, $80,000, or $140,000? 
As a policy analyst, my answer to this question is this: which of these actually fit with our understanding of how poverty works in the United States? 
If you surveyed people at $75,000, would they, on average, consider themselves to be living in poverty? 
If not, then an $80,000 poverty threshold is defining that family into a financial position they don’t consider themselves to be in. Moreover, $140,000 stretches the definition of poverty to absurdity.
Another test: what is the point of the poverty measure? 
According to the Census Bureau, there are 1.2 million Ohio residents living under the official poverty threshold and 1.1 million Ohio residents under the supplemental poverty threshold. 
If the goal of poverty policy is to help the people who need it most, shouldn’t this population of one million plus warrant more attention than the over 9 million who make under $140,000?
Poverty measure is an inexact science. 
But widening the scope of poverty to include four out of five U.S. families is a great way to miss out on the plight of those struggling the most in the state. 
Measurements like relative poverty measures or the Supplemental Poverty Measure give policymakers a much clearer picture of poverty than summing average costs of goods across society.

(Courtesy of American Association of University Professors)The University of Nebraska Board of Regents should immediately cancel the Dec. 5 vote on Chancellor Rodney D. Bennett’s proposed $27.5 million budget cuts to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL).
Approving this questionable plan is not fiscal prudence. It is institutional self-harm with long-term consequences for Nebraska’s educational system, economy and communities.
Chancellor Bennett frames these cuts as “necessary for survival,” but this hides the central issue: The crisis
facing UNL is not financial. It is a crisis of confidence and shared governance. The UNL Faculty Senate underscored this with a 60-14 no-confidence vote in the chancellor’s leadership.
Warning from governance: Stop the cuts
The Academic Planning Committee (APC) — UNL’s official body responsible for reviewing budget reductions to protect academic integrity — formally recommended not implementing these eliminations.
The APC found the proposal is rushed, relying on incomplete, inconsistent data, and concluded bluntly: “We do not have a spending problem on this campus; we have an investment problem.”
Despite this recommendation to pause the process and explore revenue-generating alternatives, the administration is forcing a vote on a plan judged academically destructive by its own governance body.
Over the past six years, UNL has absorbed more than $75 million in cuts, yet the deficit persists. This chronic contraction is compounding the issue. Institutions do not cut their way to growth. They invest their way to stability.
Threats to UNL’s mission and Nebraska’s future
Since 1869, UNL has provided high-quality, affordable public education. The proposed cuts undermine this mission by raising student costs and eliminating foundational programs, thereby shrinking the state’s workforce pipeline.
The economic consequences are clear: the University of Nebraska generates $10 in economic activity for every $1 of state investment. Weakening UNL undermines one of Nebraska’s most
powerful economic engines.
Direct harm to agriculture and workforce
The proposal would significantly damage agricultural research and Nebraska Extension by consolidating essential departments:

Entomology
Plant Pathology
Agricultural Economics
Agricultural Leadership, Education and Communication

These units are crucial to rural communities and producers who rely on UNL experts for guidance on crop disease, yield, and economic issues.
The plan also dismantles programs vital to Nebraska’s workforce, including:

Educational Administration
Statistics
Textile and Merchandising
Earth and Atmospheric Sciences

Eliminating these programs drains the state’s talent pipeline and harms long-term competitiveness.
Loss of talent and research ambitions
The proposal eliminates 51 faculty positions outright and offers buyouts to 69 senior faculty, totaling 120 UNL educators—representing over 1,200 combined years of teaching, research and service — gone permanently.
The consequences are unavoidable:

Larger class sizes and reduced course availability.
Longer times to earning degrees and less advising and mentorship.
Reduced research capacity.

Students—already facing a 12% tuition increase over three years—would pay more for a diminished degree. This also undercuts UNL’s goal of rejoining the Association of American Universities (AAU), signaling a retreat from top-tier research.
A better path is possible: Delay the vote
There is no emergency requiring the dismantling of decades of progress in a single morning. This decision requires due diligence. The NU Board of Regents has a fiduciary and moral responsibility to protect Nebraska’s flagship university.
Approving permanent cuts of this magnitude—without transparent data, authentic campus engagement, and against the recommendations of the APC and Faculty Senate risks a
serious failure of responsible governance.
There are alternatives that should be pursued:

Identify administrative efficiencies instead of academic eliminations.
Pause non-essential capital projects.
Invest in modern, evidence-based enrollment and retention initiatives.
Collaborate with faculty experts to develop sustainable revenue strategies.

The APC explicitly recommended a delay to allow for a more thoughtful, sustainable, and strategic planning process.
Nebraska’s future depends on a strong, vibrant flagship campus.
The proposed cuts would weaken UNL’s academic core, diminish statewide economic growth, undercut agricultural innovation, and harm student success for years to come.
We hope that the board listens to the public and its own people and cancels the Dec. 5 vote. It can replace that move with a transparent, inclusive, data-driven planning process that protects UNL and the state’s people it serves.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderWhen the Georgia Supreme Court handed Pete Skandalakis a steaming pile of horse manure, he did what any reasonable person would do in such a situation: He disposed of it as quickly and efficiently as possible, recommending that all remaining state criminal charges against President Trump be dropped.
He was right to do so.
The job had landed in Skandalakis’s lap after Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who had initially filed those cases, was disqualified from handling them. The duty of deciding how to proceed thus devolved to Skandalakis as head of the Prosecuting Attorneys Council of Georgia. His decision means that all criminal cases filed against Trump for his conduct after the 2020 election, state or federal, have now become moot. No jury will ever hear the evidence and pass judgment on what occurred, leaving the final verdict to history.
According to some, however, the decision by Skandalakis means that Trump has been vindicated of the charges against him, and that is emphatically false.
In a letter explaining his decision, Skandalakis does conclude that the evidence against some of Trump’s 18 co-defendants in the case was too weak to justify prosecution. In his judgment, for example, there was no evidence that the “false electors” indicted by Willis had acted with criminal intent, a conclusion that seems correct. Skandalakis suggests instead that those electors had been honestly misled by Trump attorneys and advisors, and that if any criminality is involved, they are to blame.
However, in discussing his decision not to pursue charges against Trump, he makes no suggestion of innocence or weak evidence. Instead, his argument is grounded in sheer practicality.
“Never before, and hopefully never again, will our country face circumstances such as these,” Skandalakis writes. “The case is now nearly five years removed from President Trump’s phone call with the secretary of state, and two years have passed since the grand jury returned charges against President Trump and the 18 other defendants. There is no realistic prospect that a sitting president will be compelled to appear in Georgia to stand trial on the allegations in this indictment.”
“And even if, by some extraordinary circumstance, President Donald J. Trump were to appear in Georgia on Jan. 21, 2029 — the day after his term concludes — an immediate jury trial would be impossible.”
In fact, given the inevitable appeals and delays, “bringing this case before a jury in 2029, 2030, or even 2031 would be nothing short of a remarkable feat.”
Skandalakis also makes clear his belief that a conspiracy to overturn the election may very well have been underway, but it was a conspiracy hatched and carried out in Washington, D.C., not in Georgia, and thus any prosecution of those responsible is a federal, not a state, responsibility.
“Contesting an election is not unlawful,” he writes. “Both Congress and state legislatures have long recognized this principle and have enacted detailed procedures to permit such challenges. However, the strategy conceived in Washington, D.C. to contest the 2020 presidential election quickly shifted from a legitimate legal effort into a campaign that ultimately culminated in an attack on the Capitol, undertaken to prevent the vice president from carrying out his ministerial duty of counting the electoral votes.”
That campaign, he writes, bore evil fruit:
“But for this plan to use the fraudulent elector certificates to disrupt the congressional certification on Jan. 6, 2021, law-abiding citizens in Georgia, misled by campaign attorneys, some of whom were themselves misled, would not have served as Republican electors or cast electoral votes for the Republican candidate…
“But for the plan to stop the electoral count, President Trump’s phone call to the secretary of state would have been merely the conversation of a losing candidate struggling to accept defeat…
“And but for the plan driven by select individuals meeting in Washington, D.C., we would not have Fulton County grand juries selectively determining who should be charged with providing false statements to legislative committees convening on state Capitol grounds. Nor would we have had individuals encouraged by the false cries of voter fraud to harass and threaten an innocent poll worker,” a clear reference to Ruby Freeman.
As I said, that is not a vindication.
Some of our fellow Americans are trying to rewrite history, trying to convince us that we did not see what we all saw happen, that those who perpetrated a conspiracy against our democracy are in fact the victims of a conspiracy. Fifty years from now, I’m afraid, Americans will still be debating the events surrounding Jan. 6, much like some today still debate the JFK assassination or even the moon landing.

He also gutted the Office of Civil Rights, which helps enforce disability law.","In summary
Trump has cut funding to Medicaid, which pays for many services for students with disabilities. He also gutted the Office of Civil Rights, which helps enforce disability law.


Sleep is a rare commodity at Lindsay Crain’s house. Most nights, she and her husband are up dozens of times, tending to their daughter’s seizures. The 16-year-old flails her arms, thrashes and kicks — sometimes for hours.
But these days, that’s not the only thing keeping Crain awake. The Culver City mother worries about how President Donald Trump’s myriad budget cuts could strip their daughter of services she needs to go to school, live at home and enjoy a degree of independence that would have been impossible a generation ago.
“Every family I know is terrified right now,” Crain said. “We still have to live our everyday lives, which are challenging enough, but now it feels like our kids’ futures are at stake.”
Trump’s budget includes nearly $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, which funds a wide swath of services to disabled children, including speech, occupational and physical therapy, wheelchairs, in-home aides and medical care. All children with physical, developmental or cognitive disabilities – in California, nearly 1 million – receive at least some services through Medicaid.
Meanwhile, at the U.S. Department of Education, Trump has gutted the Office of Civil Rights, which is among the agencies that enforce the 50-year-old law granting students with disabilities the right to attend school and receive an education appropriate to their needs. Before that law was enacted, students with disabilities often didn’t attend school at all.
“We have a delicate web of services that, combined, support a whole child, a whole family,” said Kristin Wright, executive director of inclusive practices and systems at the Sacramento County Office of Education and the former California state director of special education. “So when the basic foundational structure is upended, like Medicaid, for example, it’s not just one cut from a knife. It’s multiple.”
Republicans have also suggested moving the office of special education out of the Department of Education altogether and moving it to the Department of Health and Human Services. Disability rights advocates say that would bring a medical – rather than a social – lens to special education, which they described as a major reversal of progress.
Trump has chipped away at other rights protecting people with disabilities, as well. In September, the U.S. Department of Transportation said it would not enforce a rule that requires airlines to reimburse passengers for damaged or lost wheelchairs. Trump has also repeatedly used the word “retarded,” widely considered a slur, alarming advocates who say it shows a lack of respect and understanding of the historical discrimination against people with disabilities. It’s all left some wondering if the administration plans more cuts to hard-fought rights protecting people with disabilities.
Fewer therapists, less equipment
The Medicaid cuts may have the most immediate effect. People with developmental disabilities typically receive therapy, home visits from aides, equipment and other services through regional centers, a network of 21 mostly government-funded nonprofits in California that coordinate services for people with disabilities. The goal of regional centers is to help people with disabilities live as independently as possible.
More than a third of regional centers’ funding comes from Medicaid, which is facing deep cuts under Trump’s budget. The money runs out at the end of January, and it’s unclear what services will be cut.
Schools also rely on Medicaid to pay for therapists, equipment, vision and hearing tests and other services that benefit all students, not just those with disabilities. In light of state budget uncertainty, it’s not likely the state could backfill the loss of Medicaid funding, and schools would have to pare down their services. 
Uncertain futures
For Lelah Coppedge, whose teenage son has cerebral palsy, the worst part is the uncertainty. She knows cuts are coming, but she doesn’t know when or what they’ll include.

“I go down this rabbit hole of worst-case scenarios,” said Coppedge, who lives in the Canoga Park neighborhood in Los Angeles. “Before this happened, I felt there was a clear path for my son. Now that path is going away, and it’s terrifying.”
Coppedge’s son, Jack, is a 16-year-old high school student who excels at algebra and physics. He loves video games and has a wide circle of friends at school. He uses a wheelchair and struggles with speech, communicating mostly through eye movements. He’ll look at his mom’s right hand to indicate “yes,” her left hand for “no.”
Coppedge and her husband rely on a nurse who comes four days a week to help Jack get dressed, get ready for bed and do other basic activities. Medicaid pays for the nurse, as well as other services like physical therapy. Even though Coppedge and her husband both work and have high-quality private health insurance, they could not afford Jack’s care without help from the government.
They also rely on the local regional center, which they assumed would help Jack after he graduates from high school, so he can remain at home, continue to hone his skills and generally live as independently as possible. If that funding vanishes, Coppedage worries Jack will someday end up in a facility where people don’t know him, don’t know how to communicate with him and don’t care about him.
“It feels like we’re going backward,” Coppedge said. “Half the time, I put my head in the sand because I’m just trying to manage the day-to-day. The rest of the time I worry that (the federal government) is looking at people like Jack as medical problems, not as unique people who want to have full, happy lives. It feels like that’s getting lost.”
The current uncertainty is stressful, but it’s even harder for families who are immigrants, Wright said. Those families are less likely to stand up for services they’re entitled to and are facing the extra fear of deportation. English learners, as well as low-income children, are disproportionately represented among students in special education, according to state data.
“That’s the other piece to all this — how it’s affecting immigrant families,” Wright said. “It’s a whole other level of anxiety and fear.”
Decades of progress on the line
Karma Quick-Panwala, an advocate at the nonprofit Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund, said she worries about the rollback of decades’ worth of progress that was hard-won by the disability rights community. 
The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the 1975 law that created special education, actually predates the federal Department of Education. In fact, Congress created the department in part to oversee special education. Removing special ed would be a devastating blow to the disability community — not just because services might be curtailed, but philosophically, as well, Quick-Panwala said. 
In the Department of Education, special education is under the purview of education experts who promote optimal ways to educate students with disabilities, so they can learn, graduate from high school and ideally go on to productive lives. In the Department of Health and Human Services, special education would no longer be overseen by educators but by those in the medical field, where they’re more likely to “look at disability as something to be cured or segregated and set aside,” Quick-Panwala said.
“The disability rights community has worked so hard and gave so much to make sure people with disabilities had a right to a meaningful education, so they could have gainful employment opportunities and participate in the world,” Quick-Panwala said. “The idea is that they wouldn’t just be present at school, but they would actually learn and thrive.”
For the time being, Wright, Quick-Panwala and other advocates are reminding families that federal funding might be shrinking, but the laws remain unchanged. Students are still entitled under federal law to the services outlined in their individual education plans, regardless of whether there’s money to pay for it. The funding will have to come from somewhere, at least for now, even if that means cutting it from another program. And California is unlikely to roll back its own special education protections, regardless of what happens in Washington, D.C.
An imperfect but successful routine
Those reassurances are scant comfort to Crain, whose daughter Lena will rely on government support her entire life. Born seven weeks prematurely, Lena has cerebral palsy, epilepsy, a cognitive impairment and is on the deaf-blind spectrum. But she has a 100-watt smile and a relentless spirit, Crain said. Even after the whole family has been up all night, Lena insists on going to school and getting the most out of every day.

Funny and assertive, she has a few close friends and, like many teenagers, plenty of opinions about her parents. She loves her English teacher and spends most of her day in regular classrooms with help from an aide. Her favorite book is about Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani activist who won a Nobel Peace Prize for fighting for girls’ right to an education.
Between school and home visits from aides and after-school therapists, Crain feels the family has pieced together an imperfect but mostly successful routine for Lena.
“Our entire lives are about teaching her self-advocacy, so she can have the most independent life possible,” Crain said. “Just because you need support doesn’t mean you can’t have a say in your life. There’s been so much work around the culture and the laws and the education system to make sure disabled people can make their own choices in life. We’re absolutely terrified of losing that.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/120125-Lena-Deacy-ZS-11.jpg?fit=1024%2C670&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-04 09:00:22.400093

California needs nuclear options",Leonard Rodberg,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/12/california-energy-needs-nuclear-options/,"If California ditches fossil fuels for greener energy, we can still expect weekly rolling blackouts. But nuclear power is unaffected by weather.","Guest Commentary written by

Leonard Rodberg
Leonard Rodberg is professor emeritus of Urban Studies at Queens College, City University of New York. 


Sure, California can swear off fossil fuels and shut down its nuclear plants, powering itself entirely with wind, water, and sun. 
All it takes is getting used to weekly rolling blackouts.
Some energy predictions are tricky; this one isn’t. We can estimate how much electricity each solar panel and wind turbine will produce, and when they’ll produce it. Then we can plug those numbers into a computer, along with green advocates’ optimistic projections of future electricity demand, to see how supply and demand match up on an hourly and seasonal basis.
Even with vastly expanded battery storage capacity to smooth things out, the match is poor. 
California will sometimes generate renewable energy in abundance, but grid operators will still face tough choices — such as disconnecting generators when there’s too much sun and little demand or firing up fossil-fuel based gas turbines when there’s no sun or wind at all. 
During much of the year, especially in late summer and throughout December and January, solar and wind power will meet demand for some hours but not have enough excess to charge the batteries. 
California might generate as much energy from wind and sun as it uses overall, but not when it’s needed. To keep the power flowing, the state will actually need up to 80 gigawatts of gas-fired backup capacity — far more than it has today — or risk repeated shortfalls.
Eighty gigawatts is enormous. California’s current peak demand is just over 52 gigawatts, but by 2050 — with millions of electric vehicles, heat pumps, and energy-hungry data centers — electric demand will be far higher. 
Keeping all that backup generation on standby won’t come cheap. The cost of maintaining this fossil fuel capacity must be added to the already high cost of intermittent renewables like solar and wind.
A system powered solely by solar, wind, and hydro isn’t an engineering strategy; it’s a belief system. Zealotry and energy reliability don’t mix.
Some zealots who advocate for an all-renewable energy future have offered unrealistic scenarios for powering California while eliminating carbon emissions. Our recent studies show their plan for California would leave it short of power at least 50 days a year.
The state’s official energy plan isn’t much better. A new grid simulator — the Hourly Electric Grid Analysis, or HELGA — compares expected demand with renewable output on an hour-by-hour basis. It shows California’s plan would cost nearly a trillion dollars yet still require the grid to burn almost as much natural gas as it does today.
Like every other state, California will need large, zero-carbon generators that operate independently of the weather to meet its climate goals. 
Realistically, that means nuclear power. 
A fleet of advanced reactors running around the clock can provide reliable, carbon-free electricity. New designs — such as Bill Gates’s Natrium reactor with molten salt thermal storage — are engineered to ramp output up and down in response to grid demand. Others will operate continuously, supplying the grid or charging storage systems as needed.
California can reach its climate goals, but not through blind adherence to ideology. Clean, reliable power is possible, but only if the state faces reality about what it takes to get there.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/080924-Diablo-Canyon-GETTY-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-04 09:00:22.400093

(Via FWC)When I was growing up here in Florida, everyone revered science. We looked to high-IQ scientists to tell us how to fly to the moon, how to transplant a heart, how to fire up a laser, how the universe began with a Big Bang.
But science is clearly out of favor now, especially in Florida. If you don’t believe me, look at the argument the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission put forward last week to convince a judge to approve a different kind of Big Bang: the first bear hunt in 10 years, starting Saturday.
An animal advocacy group called Bear Warriors United sued to stop the hunt, arguing that allowing people to blow away 172 bears over 22 days would fly in the face of science. The FWC’s attorney argued that there’s no law requiring the agency to follow this “science” stuff.
“There is nothing that mandates or controls how a commissioner votes,” the FWC attorney argued in a court filing, “nor requires that a commissioner base his or her vote specifically on a body of sound science.”
So beat it, you brainiacs! We don’t need no stinkin’ science! We can do what we want!

Clay Henderson, who helped create the wildlife commission 25 years ago, told me he was “just flummoxed by the FWC response. Their argument is the governor appointed them and the Senate confirmed them and that is all that matters. They are not bound by science.”
This certainly helps explain why the wildlife commissioners pushed for this hunt despite clear evidence that Florida’s bear population is in decline (more on that in a minute).
If they were following the science, they would hold off the hunt until they could get better information. Instead, they followed what I think of as the Veruca Salt Principle, which is “I don’t wanna wait! I want it NOW!”
When Bear Warriors United first sued, the organization’s founder, Katrina Shadix, told me she hoped the legal challenge would “shine a bright light to expose the FWC’s culture of corruption, as well as demonstrate the desperate and immediate need for massive agency reform.”
The suit has so far failed to stop the hunt, but it sure achieved that goal of switching on the spotlight to show us what the wildlife commissioners are all about.
Repeating mistakes
I was there in person for the last bear hunt back in 2015. The parallels to today are downright eerie.
The wildlife commission staff couldn’t say for sure how many bears there were, just like today. The hunt was massively unpopular with the general public, just like today. The commissioners who insisted on the need for a hunt sneered at the ignorant public trying to oppose them, just as the commissioners are doing now.
Only one commissioner voted against holding that 2015 hunt: avid outdoorsman Ronald “Alligator Ron” Bergeron, a rodeo champ, airboat pilot, and python hunter from Davie. Not exactly a shrinking violet, nor someone who tends to mince words.
“I’m a hunter myself and my family has been here for 170 years, all the way back to the 1840s,” he said 10 years ago. “But I believe that we need to evaluate, take our time a little bit here.”
Waiting would have been the smart thing to do. The hunt turned into a colossal disaster.
Wildlife commissioners had given the hunters a week to kill about 300 bears. They nearly hit the limit after just two days, forcing the executive director to shut it down early. Meanwhile, among the dead were 36 lactating mother bears, which may have left behind orphaned cubs.
I contacted Bergeron this week to ask him about the sitting commissioners claiming they’re not bound by science. He told me that when he sat on the wildlife commission, he believed that science was essential to doing the job, which was — in case you forgot the name of the agency — conserving Florida‘s wildlife.
“I think the state’s iconic wildlife — the panther, the eagle, the manatee, the bear — deserve an even higher level of protection than other wildlife,” he told me.
Bergeron said he could support having a bear hunt if the science showed a need for one. If there were too many bears for the amount of food they usually eat, for instance, that would be ample justification for thinning them out.
But there’s no science showing that.
Instead, he pointed out, the estimated number of bears in Florida now — 4,050 — is fewer than the estimated number we had before the hunt 10 years ago — 4,300.
“The population isn’t growing,” Bergeron said. “It’s stable.”
That means this isn’t a hunt to control the bear population, he said, but a hunt intended to provide some hunters with a trophy.
From what I heard this week, it’s even worse than that.
Juking the stats
During the August commission meeting at which they approved the hunt, Commission Chairman Rodney Barreto bragged about the process behind their vote.
Rodney Barreto via screen grab
“We make decisions based on science,” said Barreto, a wealthy developer. But that was another untruth.
This is the same Barreto who during a legislative committee meeting denied any effort on his part to develop in a sensitive wetland, even though an official record indicated he had filed an application to do exactly that.
For its lawsuit, Bear Warriors United brought in a former FWC bear biologist to testify about what was wrong with the agency’s science claims.
After the case was over, I talked to Darcy Doran-Myers, who worked for the agency for four years, about what she said in court. What she told me was disturbing.
It reminded me of a scene from “The Wire,” in which one of the characters uses the phrase “juking the stats.” It means rearranging the official numbers, twisting them this way and that, so they look better than they really are.
The FWC has divided the state into seven “bear management units.” The hunt is scheduled to occur in four of them.
One of the units in which the FWC plans to allow hunting is called “Osceola.” It’s about as far north as you can go in Florida without winding up in Georgia. The region got its name because it encompasses the Osceola National Forest. It’s known as one of Florida’s most forested and least-developed bear management units.
A scientific abundance survey, presented to one of the FWC’s advisory groups a month after the commissioners’ vote to hold the hunt, reported that Osceola’s bear population has seen a steep decline. It now contains just 165 adult bears, down from 496 in 2014.
The state’s bear management rules — at least the ones they’re using this year — say that no hunting can occur in regions with fewer than 200 bears. Obviously, that would eliminate hunting in the Osceola region.
Darcy Doran-Myers via Research Gate
So, they juked the stats. The official estimate for the Osceola region wound up including bears from Georgia too, Doran-Myers said. That boosted the number of bears in the unit to more than 300.
Then the FWC adjusted the total number of bears that could be killed. Originally the commissioners had approved killing 187, but now it’s a slightly smaller number: 172.
Bear (sorry!) in mind that the Florida hunters can’t stray across the state line to kill their prey in Georgia unless they’re licensed in both states. If they aren’t, they can only shoot bears in Florida. But counting bears from a different state gives a different impression about how many targets there are.
“It’s totally illogical from any way I can look at it,” she told me.
Juking the stats also means that by allowing bears to be killed in the Osceola region, the FWC may imperil the future of that segment of the bear population.
That’s not “conservation” by any definition of the word.
There’s no good reason to push this hunt ahead right now. Before the 2015 hunt, there were a number of bear maulings tied to human failure to properly dispose of garbage, so the argument for rushing the hunt then was to take care of that problem (even though we know now that a hunt has no effect on those incidents).
Those sorts of maulings have been stopped by better trash management. We did have one person killed this year by a bear — but that’s the first time that’s happened in Florida history.
Blood money
Bear Warriors United is appealing the judge’s ruling allowing the hunt, Shadix told me.
Meanwhile, her organization and its allies have fought back as best they can. They encouraged people who have no interest in killing bears to try to obtain hunting permits from FWC.
By one count, people who won’t hunt bears won 52 of the permits issued. That’s about 30% of all the permits, which should give you a good idea of how strongly some people want to protect the bears.
However, that may not help as much as it seems.
Katrina Shadix via screengrab
People who do manage to kill a bear have to turn in their official bear “tag” along with proof of their kill within 24 hours. Shadix pointed me to some social media posts by people in favor of killing bears. One, a woman from the town of Vernon (so odd and violent a place that it was the subject of an Errol Morris documentary), wrote, “I’m not using my tag until Bear No. 3.”
Some bear advocates are also offering to pay hunters with permits $2,000 not to kill a bear.  Shadix said she’s seen social media comments from hunters about how they think that’s a cheap effort. They can make $10,000 off selling bear body parts such as gallbladders to people who use them for folk medicine.
So, to sum up, the state wildlife commissioners — all of whom were appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis and most of whom are in the development business — ignored actual science and public opinion to hang a target on the state’s shrinking bear population and make a few people a lot of money.
Even worse, they’re allowing the use of bows and arrows, crossbows, and bait to lure wary bears close enough to shoot. If there’s a hunt in 2027, they plan to allow the use of dogs to harry the bears, too.
DeSantis could put a stop to this if he wanted. As I mentioned, he appointed all seven commissioners. He could call Barreto and say, “Don’t do this.”
I asked his official spokespeople if he was going to step in and save the bears. As usual, I didn’t hear back from them even to acknowledge my question. Shadix said her organization and others have appealed to him for help. They, too, got radio silence.
But that’s understandable. DeSantis’ pro-development choices for the wildlife commission have done little to conserve wildlife, and he’s done nothing to rein them in.
During his years in office, we’ve seen a major manatee die-off and now there are signs that the population of the Florida panther is in decline. That’s our official state animal, barely saved from extinction once, now apparently headed for the exit door again.
When it suits him, DeSantis likes to pretend to be as green as a glass of beer on St. Patrick’s Day, but he’s not. His actions — or lack thereof — speak far louder than his words. That’s just science.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Florida-black-bear-via-FWC-1.jpeg,,,2025-12-04 00:58:24.974407

My elementary school participated in mainstreaming, a practice in which students with special needs are integrated into general education settings. So, in my kindergarten class there were a few neurodivergent students. 
I could tell that they were different, but I also understood that this was perfectly okay. We played and learned together, which reinforced the importance of inclusion and acceptance.



I arrived at high school with a passion for work in special education and was accepted into a program known as “PE Partners”, a physical education class made up of neurotypical and neurodivergent students. 
My experiences in this program were incredibly positive and meaningful, except for the day a young neurodivergent student became incredibly agitated and began to get physically violent. The boy was autistic, which hindered his ability to regulate his emotions and physical outburst. During this specific outburst, the boy had to be physically restrained by an aide. She held him down on the ground, arms restricted, as he screamed and cried and begged. 
The scene was traumatic to say the least. 

Emme Turner

Considering how distraught I was, I can only imagine how difficult that moment must have been to process for a student with an intellectual disability. The worst part is, at the time, there was really no other option to deescalate the situation. If he had not been restrained, he could have been a serious harm to himself or others. There needs to be more options for responding to such crises.
Students in special education are particularly vulnerable to experiencing mental health crises. They have higher levels of emotional, behavioral, developmental, and trauma-related needs. For instance, one report notes that students eligible for “emotional disturbance” in Connecticut face very high rates of suspension and removal, suggesting gaps in behavioral-health supports. Furthermore, there has been a sharp rise in restraint and seclusion incidents in Hamden and Clinton schools. Officials link this increase to post-pandemic trauma, behavioral escalations, and disruptions in special education programs. 
As schools struggle to manage increased emotional and behavioral challenges with limited resources and support systems, a mental health crisis among children in special education grows. 
I advocate for a mandate which requires dedicated, embedded mental-health professionals in every special education classroom or setting statewide. This can include school psychologists, counselors, and licensed social workers. It would be funded by the state and tracked by student to clinician ratios. 
Existing Connecticut policy requires districts to adopt behavioral intervention plans and includes behavior assessments under recent legislation in special education. Additionally, the state’s “School Health and Sanitation” guidelines emphasize that districts should provide early and ongoing mental health screening, crisis intervention, staff development, parent-school linkages and community-based linkages. 
I believe that we can take this focus on mental health in special education a step further. My suggested legislation would require each education classroom, or wing, to have at least one full-time licensed mental-health clinician dedicated to students with IEPs or other special-ed designations. While professional guidance currently recommends about one full-time school psychologist for every 500 students and one counselor for every 250, the reality is that many schools face ratios of 1:1,000 or worse. Thus, students with special needs are often left without consistent mental-health staffing. 
When schools have dedicated mental health professionals embedded in special education settings, they can intervene early, provide screenings, link to community care, train staff in de-escalation, and create proactive support, ultimately helping to prevent mental health crises. Inevitably, the occasional crisis will still occur but studies show trauma-informed supports substantially reduce the use of restraints and seclusion. 
A similar legislation has been successfully implemented in Sacramento County, California. They launched a county-wide initiative under the state’s Mental Health Student Services Act to place a full-time mental-health clinician in every public school. This model has expanded prevention, early intervention, and crisis services for more than 250,000 students and has been credited with transforming schools into “centers of wellness” by strengthening daily mental health support, not just emergency response.
This mandate would move the special education system from largely reactive discipline and punishment to proactive support and prevention. Rather than falling back on restraint, seclusion, suspension or exclusion, policy must promote services that prevent escalation. There is a lack of dedicated mental-health staffing in schools that needs to be corrected. I believe it can lead to measurable improvements, like reduced restraints, improved school climate, and better access to mental health for a vulnerable population. Supporting these students can improve well-being and educational outcomes. 
We owe it to every child, especially those with special needs, to create schools where mental health is not an afterthought, but rather a foundation. No child should have to endure the trauma of physical restraint simply because our system lacks the resources to support them better. By embedding dedicated mental health professionals directly into special education classrooms across Connecticut, we can transform schools from places of crisis to places of care, growth, and true inclusion.

Ned Lamont in September of 2019.
Since that time, transitioning our state from fossil fuel energy to the stated target of 100% zero carbon for our electric sector by 2050 has had some serious setbacks.  Unfortunately, Connecticut’s leadership has not stood up for major provisions stated in that executive order.  While political times have changed, Mother Nature has continued to obey laws of science and will not pause while we take a break from implementing our own state laws.
On the same day that nine activists from Don’t Destroy Our Future held a peaceful sit-in in the governor’s office in opposition to multiple new gas expansion projects, Eversource announced a proposed 13% increase in its “winter electricity rate,” subject to approval by PURA.  The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that Connecticut’s residential rate is already 92% higher than the national average.  According to Hartford Business Journal reporting, the reason is because the cost of electricity Eversource purchases for customers has gone up. This increase “reflect{s} constrained natural gas supplies and increased heating demand” in the winter months. 
The rate increase would be effective January 1, 2026, about a month away.   With an estimated 1.3 million customers in 157 of Connecticut’s towns and cities, Eversource is encouraging customers “to explore competitive suppliers through the Energize CT rate board, where alternative providers may offer lower prices or renewable energy options.” Hmmmm… so why doesn’t Eversource pursue renewable energy options?  Why is Eversource wedded to “natural” gas, an industry term that obscures the fact that it’s primarily methane gas, which has immediate emissions during the following decade that, when compared to carbon dioxide, are more than 80 times more damaging to our environment and human health?
In a November energy forum hosted by the Hartford Business Journal, speakers including State Department of Economic & Community Development Commissioner Daniel O’Keefe urged that our state move away from individual state level power purchase agreements and instead look to ISO-New England for regional energy procurement.  Their reason? Connecticut commercial energy prices are 140% higher than the U.S. average.  So, with gas still comprising 60% of our state’s energy supply, both our homes -–remember the “winter electricity rate” noted above–- and businesses are facing higher rates with no end in sight year after year.
The initial financial costs for transition away from fossil fuel energy to renewables -–solar, wind, geothermal-– sounds like a big investment.  It is a big investment up front.  But right now, the Lamont administration is approving a number of gas pipeline expansions with costs of $8 million to $15 million per mile that are simply being passed along to rate-payers in our monthly bills as part of delivery charges.  And those pipeline expansions are investments in the next 20 or 30 years of continued gas energy.  So, either we’ll get our money’s worth–- or rather the industry’s money’s worth–- or the pipelines will only be used for the next five to ten years, which makes it a short-term investment for them that consumers have paid for with no choice or questioning.
Unfortunately, in his January, 2025, State of the Union address, Gov. Lamont made no reference to these Executive Order No. 3 goals:  to implement strategies “to assess and prepare for the impacts of climate change in areas such as infrastructure, agriculture, natural resources and public health” and to “spur innovation in carbon-reduction strategies and economic development throughout the state and the region.”  Instead, in proclaiming accurately that most of our power comes from natural (methane) gas, he predicted that it will continue “for the foreseeable future.”  
This indicates that his administration intends to continue to issue permits for further gas pipeline expansions.  So our families and business financial security will continue to be at the mercy of investor-owned utilities like Eversource, with decisions made to increase their profit.  Eversource apparently finds changing to renewable energy too expensive because wind, solar or geothermal power cannot be charged to ratepayers, unlike methane gas construction costs. Also note that, while geothermal infrastructure costs more to install, there is no fuel cost for decades after.
To support implementation of  Executive Order No. 3, we needed state officials to end the continued expansion of fossil gas by opposing the doubling of Brookfield’s compressor station capacity.  Instead, DEEP has issued preliminary approval.  We needed the Department of Administrative Services to support updating of the Hartford Capitol Area System energy infrastructure with geothermal conversion.  Instead, the choice was to replace old gas boilers with more gas boilers.  
We need to hear Gov. Lamont’s opposition to an Eversource plan to build new pipelines between Middletown and Montville by drilling and laying such pipe underneath the Connecticut River.  To date, no such statement has been reported.
In short, we need our state leadership to deny all such permits and projects that undermine or directly conflict with Gov. Lamont’s stated executive order goals. Such action has not been forthcoming, just when the people of our state and the New England region need it most.
Following the Don’t Destroy Our Future activists’ attempt to meet with the governor, his spokesperson responded with a press statement: that the administration looks forward to conversations with “regional partners” about how to increase our state’s energy supply, lower costs for ratepayers and to protect the state’s investment in renewable energy. Maybe including some of his own constituents, such as the youth-led SunRise Movement, as one of those “regional partners” is a good place to start.
Our young people have the highest stakes in this one-planet-or-no-liveable-planet future we are all facing now.  Indeed, it is young people who will benefit from, or pay the prices–both financial and environmental–for any action taken or promises broken by our state leadership. We need climate heroes now who have the commitment to follow through on Gov. Lamont’s Executive Order No. 3 promises made in 2019.  Please step up now.

(Getty Images)The Alaska Court of Appeals has rejected an appeal from a man who received one of the highest prison sentences ever given in Alaska to a juvenile convicted of murder.
In an order published Friday, the court concluded that the recantation of a key witness is not enough to warrant a retrial for Brian Hall, who was 17 at the time. In 1995, Hall was sentenced to 159 years in prison for the killing of two men in Anchorage, Mickey Dinsmore and Stanley Honeycutt. 
Despite the rejection, wrote Judge Marjorie Allard on behalf of the court, Hall is eligible for resentencing as part of a wave of juvenile punishments being reconsidered by state courts.
“At sentencing, the court sentenced Hall to 159 years to serve, one of the highest sentences — if not the highest sentence — that a juvenile tried as an adult in Alaska has ever received,” she wrote. “As a juvenile sentenced in 1995 to a de facto life without parole sentence, Hall has been granted the opportunity for a resentencing in which his youth and the unique attributes of youth will be appropriately considered.”
In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Eighth Amendment prohibits courts from sentencing children to life in prison without the possibility of parole, except in homicide cases.
Two years ago, the state appeals court said the Alaska Constitution imposes further limits in addition to those provided by the U.S. Constitution.
Since then, Alaska courts have resentenced several former juveniles who were sentenced to long terms in prison. In September, Alaska’s youngest convicted female murderer was released from prison on parole after 40 years behind bars. 
Hall, who has been in prison for 30 years, could receive similar treatment.
At the time of his trial, Hall claimed he acted in self-defense and that he believed, based on a statement from then-15-year-old Monica Shelton, that Dinsmore and Honeycutt — the people he killed — were armed.
At trial, Shelton denied telling Hall that the two were armed. Hall was convicted and sentenced with that testimony.
While in prison, Hall married Angela Diaz (now Angela Hall), and Angela hired a defense investigator who got in contact with Shelton. In a recorded interview, Shelton said she was scared at trial and lied in her testimony.
In an interview with the Anchorage Daily News, Hall said he is full of remorse about his crime and isn’t the same person he was at 17.
Years of legal arguments followed the investigator’s interview as Hall first requested a new trial, then asked for post-conviction relief. 
Superior Court Judge Adolf Zeman dismissed that request, siding with state prosecutors who had raised procedural errors, including the idea that Hall’s filings were too late. 
He also concluded that Hall failed to show that Shelton’s recantation would “probably result in an acquittal,” the standard that applies to timely filings for post-conviction relief.
Allard, writing on behalf of the appeals court, overruled Zeman on the procedural elements of Hall’s argument but concluded that even with the recanted testimony, it wasn’t clear that a new trial would result in a new outcome.
“The problem that Hall still faces, notwithstanding Shelton’s recantation, is that the rest of the evidence from trial indicates that Hall’s mistaken belief that he had to use deadly force … was not objectively reasonable,” she wrote.
“Hall was required to show that, viewing all the well-pleaded facts in the light most favorable to Hall, it is “highly probable” that Shelton’s recantation would result in an acquittal at any retrial,” Allard said.
“But while Shelton’s recantation constitutes important new evidence that sheds more light on Hall’s motivations and the reasons for his subjective fear, it does not alter the fact that his actions in shooting both men still appear overly impulsive and objectively unreasonable under the circumstances.”
Even with that finding, Hall is eligible for resentencing, Allard said.
“As part of that resentencing, the court should take into account Shelton’s recantation and the effect of that recantation on Hall’s level of culpability.”

(File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Maryland’s largest historically Black university is not doing enough to ensure Black and women-owned businesses can participate in state contracts, state Treasurer Dereck Davis said Wednesday.
Two contracts drew Davis’ attention and criticism during Wednesday’s Board of Public Works meeting: First, a $10.5 million contract for campuswide electrical upgrades at the Baltimore campus, and then a $1.6 million contract to provide engineering services for a security wall at the university.
A campus official defended the university’s performance, and said the contracts angering Davis were atypical. But Davis said he “can’t hold majority folks to goals that Morgan’s not meeting. They’ve got to be held to the same standard.”
The university set minority business enterprise participation at 17%. Davis said those targets were too low and expressed concern that the university reduced the initial 33% MBE goal for the engineering contract.
“I guess after the school had some conversations with the industry, and they said that, ‘Oh, we couldn’t find qualified MBEs,’ or whatever the case may be, it got lowered to 17%. The winning bidder came in and ended up at 33%,” Davis said. “Why? Because this is what it sounds like to me, it sounds like the same old — as we say — okie-doke.
“We can’t find anybody qualified. We don’t know anybody that can do it, and so then the state just sort of falls for that, and goes, OK, what can you do?,” he said. “And they lower it to 17%.”

Davis said dealing with contractors is “no different than for those of you who have children.”
“If you set goals, the kids will meet those goals that you set,” Davis said. “It’s no different with this. If you set the goals, they will meet the goals that we set. However, if they can get out of it, they will and it’s up to us to be diligent and try harder.
“They’re going to test you at first to see if they can get out of it,” he said. “And if we go, OK, then they will get out of it. But if you push back on their pushback, they’ll get there.”
Warren Builds LLC, based in Upper Marlboro, was awarded the contract for the security wall. The company’s bid included 33% minority business participation.
Kim McCalla, senior vice president for facilities, design and construction, defended the contracts. She said the university lowered the goal after a review of available contractors.
“There was some pushback on the goal,” she said, adding that the university originally wanted to see if they could double the original 15% goal on the contract.
The Upper Marlboro company, which is a certified MBE contractor, is handling much of the work itself. In doing so, rather than subcontracting work, it raised the total participation rate above 30%, McCalla said.
“Typically, and if you’ve seen in our past history, our MBE goals are typically much higher than the state’s goals and even Morgan’s goal,” she said. “But there’s a limited amount of scope of work that’s occurring in this project. It’s very finite where I believed it was going to be more difficult in order to achieve the goals for doing this specific type of work, it’s very limited. There’s not a lot of sub-trades with it to be farming out to other firms to do it, which is why we had lower goals.
While McCalla said the contracts drawing Davis’ attention were the exception, rather than the rule, but Davis disagreed.
“There have been other issues we’ve had with Morgan not meeting” MBE goals, Davis said.
“I also know for a fact, at least in my four years being here, we’ve had issues where the school’s goals haven’t been met, either or they’ve been very low,” he said.

Wes Mpore speaks at the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washigton's ""Lox and Legislatotrs"" breakfast in Rockville on fDec, 3, 2025. (Photo by Joe Andrucyk/Governor's Orrice)The Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington has a long list of legislative priorities, from fighting antisemitism and poverty to supporting reproductive and immigrant rights, and more.
But you might not have known it from the group’s annual Lox and Legislators breakfast Wednesday in Rockville, where antisemitism and security for houses of worship dominated the conversation by lawmakers, and where an impassioned Gov. Wes Moore pledged millions for security.
“There’s an entire legislative agenda that includes reproductive freedom and the environment and health equity and combating homelessness and immigration and all the things that you see on our paper that … we lobby for every year,” said Ron Halber, CEO of the JCRC. “But it was very interesting that the elected officials chose to spend more time focusing on antisemitism.
“But you’ve got to understand, this has become something that has consumed the Jewish community, OK?” said Halber, who added that if you’d told him three years ago that he would be “focusing all my time on Jewish security … I’d have felt like you’re crazy.”

But three years ago was before the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas on Israel that sparked the Gaza war.
Since then, hate crimes against Jews have risen sharply, jumping from 77 in Maryland in 2022 to 284 in 2023 and 276 in 2024, according to Maryland State Police data. That report said anti-Jewish hate crimes accounted for 28.5% of all hate crimes in 2024, trailing only attacks against Blacks.
As a result, institutions like B’nai Israel, where Wednesday’s event was held, have had to add security features and police or security officers on what Halber said is “almost like a tax on our own membership.”
For that reason, Halber said, the JCRC is pushing for a doubling of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Nonprofit Security Grant Program, from the current $500 million to $1 billion next year; an increase in state funding for school-based security from $3 million to $5 million; and a doubling of Montgomery County funds for nonprofit security, from $1.2 million to $2.4 million.
A state fund, the Protecting Against Hate Crimes program for security at houses of worship and nonprofit facilities, was doubled from $5 million last year to $10 million this year. Halber said the JCRC, with an eye toward the state’s looming budget deficit, asked that the fund be kept level at $10 million next year.
Moore announced Wednesday that his budget for next year would include $10 million for that program, part of what he called the state’s “ironclad commitment to stop antisemitism in its tracks” and building a future “where hate as no oxygen.”
“There is no higher goal for any chief executive than ensuring their people feel safe where they live, where they work and where they worship,” Moore said, according a copy of his speech as prepared for delivery. “Last year, we doubled state funding for grants that protect against hate crimes. I am proud to announce that this year, my budget proposal will preserve historic funding of $10 million for hate crime protection grants.
“We are going to preserve funding for hate crime prevention because we talk to Jewish leaders … they tell us that their chief concern is being protected from violent acts of antisemitism,” Moore said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But the governor’s office also said, in a press release announcing the funding, that the preservation of the funds was also welcomed by the Pride Center of Maryland and by the Islamic Society of Baltimore.
While he welcomed the funding, Halber said it’s unfortunate that it’s needed and the JCRC can’t focus on the other issues in its legislative agenda.
“Like Marc [Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich] has said many times, ‘I’d rather this money go for social services or something else.’ Me too,” Halber said. “I don’t want to have the level of security we have here today, But we have to do it, because this is the crazy world we live in.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ja9_5012-1024x819.jpeg,,,2025-12-04 09:56:38.171520

(Photo by McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)A federal judge has temporarily blocked a Trump administration plan to halt Medicaid funds for Planned Parenthood and similar health care providers.
The prelimnary injunction handed down Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts said a coalition of 22 Democratic attorneys general, including Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown, had “demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits of their claim” that the denial of fund unconstitutionally attached conditions to congressionally approved spending without giving notice to the states.
U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani wrote the law “is impermissibly ambiguous” and an “unprecedented incursion into States’ traditional discretion over the regulation of medicine that Plaintiff States could not have anticipated when joining Medicaid.”
Talwani also wrote if the administration kept this law in place, it “would increase the percentage of patients unable to receive birth control and preventive screenings, thereby prompting an increase in States’ healthcare costs.”
The plan to withhold Medicaid funding was part of an expansive tax and spending cuts package signed into law by President Donald Trump (R) on July 4. The law bans Medicaid funding for health care providers “primarily engaged in family planning services, reproductive health, and related medical care.”
Planned Parenthood Federation of America, along with two of its affiliates in Massachusetts and Utah, filed a lawsuit three days after Trump signed the tax cut and spending plan.
Justice Department sues six more states, including Maryland, for voter lists

Later in July, the states filed a lawsuit that challenged a provision that eliminates Medicaid reimbursements for one year to health care providers that provide abortions and received more than $800,000 in federal and state Medicaid funding in 2023.
The defendants listed in the suit are the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and its administrator, Mehmet Oz.
An HHS representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.
Karen J. Nelson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Maryland, released a statement Wednesday welcoming the court’s “recognition that this law is unconstitutional.”
“We offer our most sincere gratitude to the tireless work of Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown, who joined officials from 21 states and Washington, D.C. to fight against a ‘defund’ provision that will inevitably harm patients seeking crucial health care services,” she said.
The judge granted seven days for the Trump administration to appeal her ruling.
The Planned Parenthood lawsuit is just one of more than 100 legal actions – briefs and lawsuits – that the Maryland Attorney General’s Office has joined or led this year against the Trump administration. About four more were filed in November, including an amicus brief in support of California’s motion to dismiss a federal lawsuit that demands unredacted voter registration databases.
Brown, who serves as a co-led on the brief with 15 other attorneys general, argues in the brief the federal government seeks to collect personal information nationwide.
“Maryland voters deserve to cast ballots without worrying that their registration information will be mishandled,” Brown said in a statement. “The administration’s unlawful demands threaten both individual privacy and our collective confidence in our elections. We won’t allow federal overreach to undermine voting rights or discourage participation in our democracy.”

“NorthWestern and NW Colstrip have employed a strategy to violate Montana law and avoid FERC scrutiny of transactions,” the Public Service Commission said.
In July 2024, NorthWestern Energy announced it would acquire shares from Puget Sound Energy at the Colstrip electricity generation plant, and existing customers would benefit starting in January 2026.
But the utility holding company later formed a subsidiary, called NorthWestern Colstrip 370 PuLLC, and the utility is directing all the new shares to the subsidiary, an entity it said isn’t subject to Public Service Commission authority.
NorthWestern said it transferred the Puget purchase agreement to the subsidiary, so the subsidiary will acquire the new shares directly on Jan. 1, 2026, and the utility itself will not acquire or hold them.
In October, the subsidiary submitted a proposal to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to sell electricity generated from the new shares on the wholesale market, and it told the PSC it plans to do so until its existing customers need the capacity.
Wednesday, the Public Service Commission filed a motion to intervene in the federal docket, raising numerous objections to the deal.
The filing, signed by PSC President Jeff Welborn and Vice President Jennifer Fielder, said NorthWestern Energy is a public utility, and the transfer of assets without PSC authorization likely violates Montana law.
It also said Puget Sound’s transfer of assets to NorthWestern (and NorthWestern directing them to its NW Colstrip subsidiary) without approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission violates federal law.
Additionally, the Public Service Commission said the subsidiary is attempting to sell energy and capacity it “neither legally owns nor controls” without the federal approval required.
In an earlier letter, however, NorthWestern told the Public Service Commission its plan protects existing customers from costs and liabilities associated with the new shares, and it allows the utility to offset operations and maintenance through wholesale sales — an assertion a conservation watchdog said demands examination.
NorthWestern also previously argued that questions regarding transfer of assets are squarely outside the scope of the proposal it submitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission — about a rate for wholesale sales.
In its filing with FERC, the Public Service Commission said a failed bill from the 2025 Montana Legislature is relevant in the case.
It said the proposed legislation attempted to exclude legally separate entities established by public utilities from the definition of a “public utility,” exactly the scenario NorthWestern asserts exists now.
The bill failed, but NorthWestern continued to try to shield its transfer from scrutiny and attempt an end run around Montana law, according to the Public Service Commission.
In failing to request approval for a transfer and instead seeking to sell on the wholesale market, the utility is “hoping to avoid state- and federal-level scrutiny regarding ownership and the associated state law violation,” the PSC said.
NorthWestern argues the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s jurisdiction isn’t triggered yet on any transfer, but the PSC said the deal to handle the Puget asset “was engineered to avoid Montana regulation, stop-gapped with a last-minute attempt at legislative change.”
The Public Service Commission also said NorthWestern’s move to direct Colstrip shares to the new subsidiary “before” they were officially acquired doesn’t mean the deal is outside the scope of federal authority — the subsidiary’s “most questionable argument.”
“It appears that NorthWestern’s strategy all along has been to avoid FERC and state scrutiny of this transaction,” according to the filing.
In its motion, the Public Service Commission asked the federal regulatory commission to reject NorthWestern’s filings and launch an investigation; “Montana will do the same.”
In an email, Public Service Commission spokesperson Alana Lake said regulatory staff identified the critical issue at the federal commission, and “their swift action” allowed the PSC to make a timely intervention.
“We are hopeful that FERC will acknowledge and address our concerns,” Lake said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG-0026-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-03 21:58:15.551056

Gov. Tony Evers appointed John W. Miller, a venture capitalist who previously served on the University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents, to serve as the next secretary and CEO of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation.
Miller will fill the spot left vacant by Missy Hughes, who had served in the position since 2019 but stepped down from it in September just ahead of launching her campaign for governor. She joined a crowded field of candidates seeking Democratic nomination in 2026.
Evers said in a statement that Miller has a “proven track record of helping spearhead business growth and success in Wisconsin and around the Midwest, which makes him uniquely qualified to lead the exceptional team at WEDC.” 
“Under my administration, WEDC has entered a new era, focused on helping build an economy that works for everyone from the ground up. From investing in our workforce and higher education to bolstering entrepreneurs and budding businesses to leveraging public and private partnerships, John understands what it takes to build the 21st-century economy Wisconsinites need and deserve, and I have no doubt that his leadership will help us continue our work toward a stronger future for our state and communities across Wisconsin,” Evers said. 
Miller, who currently lives in Fox Point with his family, started his career as a congressional staffer for former U.S. Rep. Jerry Kleczka, a Democrat who represented Wisconsin’s 4th Congressional District (now represented by U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore). He went on to attend the University of Wisconsin Law School, graduating in 2006.
Miller then worked at Miller-St. Nazianz Inc., his family’s agricultural equipment manufacturing business, including as president and CEO for several years. He founded a venture capital fund called Arenberg Holdings LLC. in 2015 in Milwaukee; the firm works to mentor and invest in early-stage companies in the Midwest. 
Miller said in a statement that he is “honored” that Evers selected him for the position.
“WEDC celebrated a record year of investments in 2025, and I have every intention of using my experience in the business community to continue that success into 2026 and beyond,” Miller said. 
Evers previously appointed Miller to serve on the UW Board of Regents in 2021, though the state Senate fired him from the position in 2024 after he rejected a deal reached between Republican lawmakers and the UW System that traded concessions on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) for funding for employee raises and capital projects.
Miller was also previously appointed to and served on the Library of Congress Trust Fund Board of Directors under President Barack Obama and on the United States Trade Representative Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations under President Joe Biden. 
His appointment takes effect Dec. 15.

Brad Little speaks at the Associated Taxpayers of Idaho annual conference on Dec. 3, 2025, in Boise. (Photo by Laura Guido/Idaho Capital Sun) Idaho’s potential budget deficit, which will be exacerbated if lawmakers chose to conform with the tax changes under the federal “Big Beautiful Bill Act,” will be the central challenge for the Legislature as members return to the state Capitol in Boise in January. 
State elected officials who spoke Wednesday at the Associated Taxpayers of Idaho conference were somewhat at odds over the cause of that deficit and how to handle it, but everyone agreed budget cuts are coming. 
Idaho may need to find $600 million to $1 billion for next year’s state budget

Idaho is about $58 million behind revenue projections for the current fiscal year, with the Legislature’s projected deficit of at least $555.2 million for fiscal year 2027. Importantly, that number doesn’t include the estimated $167 million cost of Idaho adopting federal tax cuts in the federal tax and spending legislation adopted and signed by President Donald Trump in July. Other projections that include the cost of the federal tax bill show between a $600 million to $1 billion deficit for fiscal year 2027, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
Legislators will vote during the 2026 session on whether to adopt the federal tax changes. 
The annual tax policy conference featured speakers who were lawmakers, tax experts, industry leaders and other officials. It was attended by many legislators, lobbyists, business and corporate representatives, and other stakeholders. 
 Idaho Lt. Gov. Bedke blames deficit on budget-making process, encourages use of ‘rainy day fund’ 

Lt. Gov. Scott Bedke began the day-long conference by critiquing the Legislature’s actions during the 2025 session, including passing a number of large spending bills before adopting a projected revenue number.

“For the first time in Idaho’s history, (in) last year’s budgeting session, we acted more like Washington, D.C., than we did Idaho,” Bedke said. “… We created a list of things that we wanted to accomplish and passed that list of things before we set the revenue number, and then we backed into the list with the revenue number, and adjusted the revenue number to pay for that list of things.” 
As lieutenant governor, Bedke presides over the Idaho Senate and can cast tie-breaking votes, but otherwise is not often directly involved in creation and passage of legislation. 
Idaho’s budget-making process requires a projected revenue number to balance the budget against. The joint Economic Outlook and Revenue Assessment Committee will listen to projections from a variety of economists, university professors, state budget officials, and other stakeholders, and vote on a recommended revenue based on those presentations. The state’s budget writers on the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee then ultimately decide the revenue projection. 
In 2025, it took several tries for the committee to agree on a revenue estimate, doing so on March 6, eight weeks into the legislative session and after $5.1 billion in spending had already been approved, the Sun reported. 
Bedke said the state’s traditional method of garnering a consensus on a revenue number and then using a conservative estimate for that to keep money on the bottom line had been “the envy of every Western state.” He said Idaho had typically erred on the side of trying to under-project. 
“Being wrong on the upside, like we are now, results in tough choices and (to have) a tough budget year,” he said. “We all get a little buzz of finger-pointing and denying and blaming and even gaslighting, but that buzz needs to be short-lived. And we need to roll up our sleeves and make some tough decisions, because the math is going to win eventually.” 
To address the tough choices, he highlighted the state’s reserve fund, known as the “rainy day” fund. Idaho has around $1.4 billion in reserves, and Bedke argued it is “prudent that we use some of that to help and bridge over.” 
However, he opposed the idea of not adopting the federal tax changes under the “big beautiful bill,” which include no taxes on tips, no taxes on overtime for some workers, and no taxes on interest on auto loans. Despite the cost, Bedke argued that rejecting this for the state’s taxes would give other states an advantage who accept the tax breaks. 
“We cannot for long even entertain that thought of non-conforming to those federal changes,” he said. 
 Gov. Little says it’s ‘not raining,’ highlights positive state economic trends 

Idaho Gov. Brad Little in brief remarks to the conference painted a more optimistic picture than the lieutenant governor. 
He noted that Idaho had healthy reserves in its rainy day fund but said, “it’s not raining, maybe a cloud or two,” seemingly indicating he didn’t support tapping the fund for the current budget situation. 
Little did acknowledge “there are many challenges facing Idaho,” but they weren’t unique to the Gem State.  
He echoed his budget director, Division of Financial Management Administrator Lori Wolff, who earlier said that every state was dealing with revenue volatility as the infusion of federal funds from the pandemic are drying up. 
He did acknowledge that, as the state looks to the next fiscal year, fiscal year 2027, Idaho “will have to do more with less.” 
Little said the effects of the federal tax and spending bill will factor into making Idaho’s “budget environment very difficult going forward,” and will be approached “prudently,” but did not indicate if he supported or opposed conforming to the federal tax code. 
The governor highlighted positive trends such as high personal income growth and the state’s high ranking for “tax-friendliness” due to the $6.1 billion in tax reductions or rebates approved since 2019. He pointed to the state’s rapid growth as the source of its challenges. 
“We have been a victim of our own success, and I will not apologize for that,” Little said. “Our focus on common-sense policies continues to make Idaho a desirable place to relocate.”

 Legislative budget writers say budget is ‘fixable problem,’ downplay concern as ‘irresponsible’ 

Co-chairs of the Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, known as JFAC, acknowledged that current estimates show a budget shortfall if the states do not do further cuts. In August, Little directed all state agencies outside of public K-12 education to reduce spending by 3% across the board for the current fiscal year, and in September, directed agencies to cut 3% for the next fiscal year. 
Rep. Wendy Horman, R-Idaho Falls, and Sen. Scott Grow, R-Eagle, said all projections are essentially a guess. Horman downplayed the projected deficit, saying its current shortfall when taking into account the budget from all sources — which include federal and dedicated funds in addition to general funds — “could almost be considered a rounding error.”

“You might have seen some headlines and some doom and gloom,” Horman said “Unconstitutional, crisis, these sorts of sound bites. I believe those terms to be inaccurate and irresponsible in some cases.” 
The state’s total budget, using all sources, is about $13.9 billion. Federal and dedicated funds typically are earmarked for certain programs or projects. The general fund budget is around $5.2 billion for fiscal year 2025, and it consists of unobligated money that the state uses to pay many of its bills and to enact policies. The general fund is typically the focus of the state budget because there is little control over dedicated or federal sources of funds. 
Idaho’s Constitution requires the state to have a balanced budget. If the state reaches the end of the fiscal year on June 30, 2026, and its expenses still exceed revenues, the deficit will violate the constitution. Horman argued the state will not reach this point, but spending cuts will be needed.  
“(People) should expect those reductions to come,” she said. “Don’t anticipate that there are going to be huge increases in budgets this year. A predicted $555 million in requests in excess of predicted revenue has to come from somewhere.” 
Grow said a lot of the growth creating challenges for the current fiscal year budget are driven by forecasts coming in below actual expenditures in Medicaid and the state Department of Correction system. Supplemental requests, to cover costs incurred that weren’t funded the previous legislative session, include an additional $87 million for Medicaid and $17 million for covering the costs of the inmate population in state prisons. 
For the next fiscal year, there is a projected $133.7 million increase in the cost for state employee health insurance, he said. 
“That’s huge; that’s a 26% increase over last year’s budget,” he said. 
Horman cautioned against using the reserve funding for ongoing expenses to cover budget shortfalls. 
“That is a recipe for disaster,” she said. 
Grow and Horman indicated that tax conformity will be a major conversation during this year’s legislative session. Horman said the budget committee likely won’t set a revenue number until the tax policy committees produce a proposal for how to handle the federal tax changes and the income reduction that come with them. 
“We will see what the tax committees do,” Horman said. “I think it’s risky to even set a revenue number before we have some general idea of what that bill is going to look like, just because the variance could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, and that would make setting the budget very tough if we don’t have some indication a ballpark figure of what that number is going to be.”",https://idahocapitalsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC_0639-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-12-03 20:56:42.146916

Immigrants in Whatcom County are feeling scared after federal officials responded to last week’s shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C., with harsh rhetoric about those without United States citizenship — and the announcement of drastic policy changes.
Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national living in Bellingham, is accused of traveling to D.C. and shooting Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom and Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe. Beckstrom, 20, died on Thanksgiving, and Wolfe, 24, remains in serious condition but has shown promising signs of recovery.
The federal government has reacted to the shooting with a slew of measures restricting immigration to the United States, including stopping Afghans from receiving visas and pausing asylum decisions for all nationalities.
Gabe Harrison, a Bellingham immigration attorney, said since the attack, he’s spoken to the handful of Afghan clients he’s had in recent years.
“They’re worried that their cases are going to be jeopardized by the actions of this one person who doesn’t represent them in any way,” Harrison said. “So the general feeling is, ‘What’s going to happen to us now?’”
Norma Suarez Govea, executive director and president of the Bellingham-based Immigrant Resources and Immediate Support, said the shooting was a “horrible, horrible event.”
“I can’t imagine what the family of the young person is going through, losing a child,” she added.
Lakanwal, who was shot by another guard member and remains hospitalized, has pleaded not guilty. He had been living in Bellingham with his family after leaving Afghanistan, where he was part of a military unit backed by the CIA, in 2021.
In Bellingham, Lakanwal struggled to find work and his mental health appeared to decline, it has been widely reported.
For six months in 2022 and 2023, he worked at Northwest Health Care Linen, the Bellingham medical apparel and linen company confirmed. Lakanwal did not speak English, so most employees’ interactions with him consisted of “explaining jobs by showing,” according to a spokesperson for the company. Lakanwal had gotten the job with the help of Evergreen Goodwill, the spokesperson said. Evergreen Goodwill has historically helped connect immigrant and refugee communities to jobs; in August 2022, Goodwill hosted a job and resource fair, hoping to expand outreach.
In a statement Wednesday, the Islamic Society of Whatcom County said Lakanwal “was not an integrated part of our community.”
“Like any house of worship, our doors were open to those who wished to pray alongside us, and as such he had visited a limited number of times,” the statement read in part. “Our interaction with him was very sparse, and we are sharing everything we know.”
The society is “fully cooperating with the FBI and local authorities,” the statement continued.
“Our hearts go out to the victims, their families, and all those impacted,” the group wrote. “We condemn this act unequivocally.”
World Relief Western Washington, a refugee resettlement organization with a Whatcom County branch, said in a statement Monday it “cannot confirm whether or not we have served any specific client without permission from our federal government partners.”
“We are shocked and devastated” by the attack, the statement read in part. The organization urged “our country to recognize these evil actions as those of one person, not to unfairly judge others who happen to share those same characteristics.”
In a statement Tuesday, Dec. 2, U.S. Rep. Rick Larsen, D-Everett, expressed support for World Relief and said, in part, “Refugees and humanitarian nonprofits that support refugees should not be punished because of the actions of one violent person.”
President Donald Trump wrote in a social media post last Thursday he would “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries,” adding, “Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation.” The next day, the Department of Homeland Security called for “remigration now,” a term that has been used to refer to mass deportation of a country’s non-white population, CNN reported.
To Jeremy Dorrough, executive director of Lynden nonprofit Racial Unity Now, that kind of talk is “un-American.” Lack of support for refugees has “been a national failure for decades,” he said.
“I think people who are on the sidelines don’t realize how little we really do to help people transition to the U.S.,” Dorrough said. “We do almost nothing.”
Much of the burden of helping people in that position rests on nonprofit or state agencies, of which few specialize in refugee assistance, he said. As a result, refugees end up living in homeless shelters and waiting in food bank lines.
“It would be difficult for the most established U.S. citizen to have to start over in that way,” Dorrough said, never mind someone fleeing a war zone.
Govea echoed the sentiment. The majority of refugees are already traumatized, she said. In a new country, they must learn a new language, find work and even navigate a new way of buying groceries.
Afghan refugees who have come to Whatcom County in recent years have not found a large community of those who share their culture, Dorrough and Govea agreed.
“There’s a lot of isolation,” Dorrough said. “There are dozens — not hundreds, not thousands — but I would say dozens of Afghans” in Whatcom County.
In 2021, World Relief helped settle at least 31 Afghan refugees in Whatcom County after Kabul fell to the Taliban and the U.S. withdrew from Afghanistan, CDN previously reported. But by May 2022, 16 of those refugees had left to live in the Seattle area.
Those having difficulties adjusting may benefit from mental health services. But accessing that care can be challenging — especially for those whose native language is not English.
“We have some refugees from Spanish-speaking countries and finding therapists that speak Spanish is difficult,” Govea said. “I can’t imagine … how difficult it can be to find a therapist that speaks one of the languages from Afghanistan.”
The Trump administration’s push for tougher immigration enforcement has already left many without citizenship feeling fearful. For them, those fears have now been compounded by recent events.
Harrison, the immigration attorney, said before now he wouldn’t have thought of Afghan clients as at particular risk for enforcement. Their home country doesn’t share a border with the U.S., he pointed out, and many had already served the U.S. in some capacity in Afghanistan. The threat presented by the Taliban is well-known.
Now, he is concerned about Afghans in the U.S. being deported to a third country — and, once there, potential removal to Afghanistan. Back in their home country, some could face “death, torture, incarceration,” he said.
Sending people back to Afghanistan is “a death sentence for many people,” Dorrough said. “The Taliban has been hunting down people who cooperated with the U.S.”
The current location and status of Lakanwal’s wife and five children are unknown. His five boys were not in the apartment when the FBI executed a search warrant at the Bellingham complex, neighbors told Cascadia Daily News.
Fear of what happens next isn’t limited to Afghans, or even to refugees. One immigrant, who is not from Afghanistan, told Dorrough he has been carrying his U.S. passport everywhere he goes. Govea is worried about the impact of the shooting on all the families she works with.
“I don’t think people understand the difference between a whole bunch of different statuses,” Govea said. “To people, sometimes it’s just a brown person. Just an immigrant.”

As Immigration and Custom Enforcement agents increase arrests in Minnesota — part of a targeted campaign ordered by President Donald Trump — Democratic elected officials and immigrant rights activists say they are sorting through hundreds of messages claiming to have spotted ICE agents or immigrant arrests. 
Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Minnesota, said he received several reports of ICE arrests but couldn’t put a number on it since news of the ICE deployment emerged Tuesday morning.

The federal government doesn’t release statistics on daily immigrant arrests, and immigrant detention center rosters are not searchable online without knowing the name of a detainee — and those records are not always up-to-date, said Michele Garnett McKenzie, executive director of Advocates for Human Rights. 
That means activists must verify arrests with family members or witnesses, trawling through a sea of panicked messages to sort out the truth. 
“There have been some false alarms because the level of anxiety is so high, and we’re trying our best to not only disseminate information but facts  — find out what’s real, what’s happening, what’s not happening,” said state Sen. Omar Fateh, DFL-Minneapolis, during a press conference Wednesday afternoon. 
Advocates are focused on informing Minnesota residents — immigrants and non-immigrants — of their rights. Those include the right to refuse to open the door to federal agents if they do not have a warrant; the right to remain silent; and the right to a lawyer. 
State Sen. Zaynab Mohamed, DFL-Minneapolis, and Hussein were among others who spent the morning handing out small red cards, in Somali and Oromo, summarizing individuals’ constitutional rights. 
ICE agents have been accused of violating the constitutional rights of immigrants and American citizens, including detaining U.S. citizens for days. They have used munitions including pepper spray, tear gas and rubber bullets on protesters — including in the Twin Cities — resulting in injuries. 
“We are a nation of immigrants and of rights, but only if we are brave enough to defend it,” Mohamed said Wednesday.

Authorities suspect Andi Summerville embezzled $31,000 from the Wyoming Association of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Centers. She says she’s innocent. 
The post Former Laramie mayor charged with stealing from Wyoming mental health group appeared first on WyoFile .","The former director of a Wyoming mental health advocacy group faces felony charges accusing her of stealing more than $31,000 from the organization, court documents show.
Albany County prosecutors charged Andi Summerville on Tuesday with seven counts of theft and a single count of forgery. An arrest warrant was issued the same day, according to documents filed in circuit court in Laramie.
A Laramie police investigator found evidence suggesting Summerville used the organization’s debit card for personal trips to the Omaha Zoo and Mall of America and to pay for purchases at Target and Dick’s Sporting Goods, according to an affidavit of probable cause signed by Police Sgt. Jacob Bury, who investigated the case. The investigation also uncovered more than $28,000 in checks made out to Summerville from the group’s bank account.
Until this fall, Summerville served as executive director of the Wyoming Association of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Centers. In that role, she was a prominent voice on mental health issues in Wyoming, testifying before the Wyoming Legislature and giving interviews to various media outlets. The organization put her on administrative leave this fall and later fired her, the affidavit states.
Summerville also previously served as Laramie mayor and as a member of the city council.
In a statement to WyoFile, Summerville’s defense attorney Tom Fleener said his client is innocent.
“Ms. Summerville maintains that she is innocent of these charges and is looking forward to her day in court,” he said in a text message Wednesday. “All of these charges largely stem from issues with her expense reimbursements of which there was nothing improper.”
Summerville was booked into jail and subsequently released, Fleener said.

Police began their investigation in October after they were contacted by the mental health organization’s president, who shared concerns that Summerville had allegedly misused the group’s money. At the time, she was the organization’s only paid employee, working primarily from home.
In July 2024, following a leadership transition in the group’s board of directors, Summerville received full electronic access to the organization’s bank account and possession of the only debit card tied to that account, the police affidavit states. After that time, she was allegedly the only person with active access to the group’s financial accounts.
Police investigate
In September of this year, the board found seven expenditures totaling nearly $2,870 that didn’t appear related to the organization’s business. Police say those purchases included:

$419 at a Target store in November 2024.
$573 spent at three stores in the Mall of America in Minnesota in February 2025.
$469 at the Omaha Zoo in Nebraska in May 2025.
$875 between two visits to Dick’s Sports Goods in Broomfield, Colorado, in April and June 2025.

Police say Summerville acknowledged the purchases to the group’s president, who did not immediately respond Wednesday to a message from WyoFile, and attributed them to accidentally using the group’s debit card on personal trips. She said she had reimbursed the account afterward, but police said no deposits or transfers matching any reimbursements were found during a review of the group’s bank statements.
Investigators also found six checks — dating between August 2024 and September 2025 — written from the group’s account to Summerville, the affidavit states. The memos on the checks, which together totalled $28,500, all indicated they were for expenses.
“No receipts, invoices, or supporting records were located to justify any of these payments,” Sgt. Bury wrote in his affidavit. He also noted that the checks were out of step with expenses from the group’s previous budgets.
“Summerville’s self-issued checks exceeded the organization’s entire annual travel budget by more than $11,000 and far surpassed every other discretionary category,” Bury wrote. “Budgets recovered during the execution of a search warrant of Summerville’s home, including those prepared in prior years, show no historical pattern of reimbursements of this size. 
“These documents collectively demonstrate that the checks issued by Summerville were not consistent with [the group’s] planned or authorized spending,” the investigator continued.
The group’s board made formal requests on Oct. 3 and Oct. 6 for Summerville to provide all receipts for spending from July 2024 to October 2025, police say. The affidavit alleges she did not comply.

Invoking tradition, he led the people in noontime prayer. But rather than reciting it, as his predecessors generally did, he sang.
In chanting the traditional Regina Caeli, the pope inspired what some have called a rebirth of Gregorian chant, a type of monophonic and unaccompanied singing done in Latin that dates back more than a thousand years.
The Vatican has been at the forefront of that push, launching an online initiative to teach Gregorian chant through short educational tutorials called “Let’s Sing with the Pope.” The stated goals of the initiative are to give Catholics worldwide an opportunity to “participate actively in the liturgy” and to “make the rich heritage of Gregorian chant accessible to all.”
These goals resonated with me. As a performing artist and scientist of human movement, I spent the past decade developing therapeutic techniques involving singing and dancing to help people with neurological disorders. Much like the pope’s initiative, these arts-based therapies require active participation, promote connection, and are accessible to anyone. Indeed, not only is singing a deeply ingrained human cultural activity, research increasingly shows how good it is for us.
 The same old song and dance

For 15 years, I worked as a professional dancer and singer. In the course of that career, I became convinced that creating art through movement and song was integral to my well-being. Eventually, I decided to shift gears and study the science underpinning my longtime passion by looking at the benefits of dance for people with Parkinson’s disease.
The neurological condition, which affects over 10 million people worldwide, is caused by neuron loss in an area of the brain that is involved in movement and rhythmic processing – the basal ganglia. The disease causes a range of debilitating motor impairments, including walking instability.
Early on in my training, I suggested that people with Parkinson’s could improve the rhythm of their steps if they sang while they walked. Even as we began publishing our initial feasibility studies, people remained skeptical. Wouldn’t it be too hard for people with motor impairment to do two things at once?
But my own experience of singing and dancing simultaneously since I was a child suggested it could be innate. While Broadway performers do this at an extremely high level of artistry, singing and dancing are not limited to professionals. We teach children nursery rhymes with gestures; we spontaneously nod our heads to a favorite song; we sway to the beat while singing at a baseball game. Although people with Parkinson’s typically struggle to do two tasks at once, perhaps singing and moving were such natural activities that they could reinforce each other rather than distract.
 A scientific case for song

Humans are, in effect, hardwired to sing and dance, and we likely evolved to do so. In every known culture, evidence exists of music, singing or chanting. The oldest discovered musical instruments are ivory and bone flutes dating back over 40,000 years. Before people played music, they likely sang. The discovery of a 60,000-year-old hyoid bone shaped like a modern human’s suggests our Neanderthal ancestors could sing.
In “The Descent of Man,” Charles Darwin speculated that a musical protolanguage, analogous to birdsong, was driven by sexual selection. Whatever the reason, singing and chanting have been integral parts of spiritual, cultural and healing practices around the world for thousands of years. Chanting practices, in which repetitive sounds are used to induce altered states of consciousness and connect with the spiritual realm, are ancient and diverse in their roots.
Though the evolutionary reasons remain disputed, modern science is increasingly validating what many traditions have long held: Singing and chanting can have profound benefits to physical, mental and social health, with both immediate and long-term effects.
Physically, the act of producing sound can strengthen the lungs and diaphragm and increase the amount of oxygen in the blood. Singing can also lower heart rate and blood pressure, reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases.
Vocalizing can even improve your immune system, as active music participation can increase levels of immunoglobulin A, one of the body’s key antibodies to stave off illness.
Singing also improves mood and reduces stress.
Studies have shown that singing lowers cortisol levels, the primary stress hormone, in healthy adults and people with cancer or neurologic disorders. Singing may also rebalance autonomic nervous system activity by stimulating the vagus nerve and improving the body’s ability to respond to environmental stresses. Perhaps this is why singing has been called “the world’s most accessible stress reliever.”
Moreover, chanting may make you aware of your inner states while connecting to something larger. Repetitive chanting, as is common in rosary recitation and yogic mantras, can induce a meditative state, inducing mindfulness and altered states of consciousness. Neuroimaging studies show that chanting activates brainwaves associated with suspension of self-oriented and stress-related thoughts.
 Singing as community

Singing alone is one thing, but singing with others brings about a host of other benefits, as anyone who has sung in a choir can likely attest.
Group singing provides a mood boost and improves overall well-being. Increased levels of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin during singing may promote feelings of social connection and bonding.
When people sing in unison, they synchronize not just their breath but also their heart rates. Heart rate variability, a measure of the body’s adaptability to stress, also improves during group singing, whether you’re an expert or a novice.
In my own research, singing has proven useful in yet another way: as a cue for movement. Matching footfalls to one’s own singing is an effective tool for improving walking that is better than passive listening. Seemingly, active vocalization requires a level of engagement, attention and effort that can translate into improved motor patterns. For people with Parkinson’s, for example, this simple activity can help them avoid a fall. We have shown that people with the disease, in spite of neural degeneration, activate similar brain regions as healthy controls. And it works even when you sing in your head.
Whether you choose to sing with the pope or not, you don’t need a mellifluous voice like his to raise your voice in song. You can sing in the shower. Join a choir. Chant that “om” at the end of yoga class. Releasing your voice might be easier than you think.
And, besides, it’s good for you.

Reeves speaks at Madison restaurant,Simeon Gates,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/03/protest-immigration-crackdown-reeves/,About a dozen people who oppose immigration raids protested Wednesday outside a Madison restaurant where Gov. Tate Reeves was speaking.,"MADISON — A small group protested outside a monthly community meeting Wednesday in Madison to raise awareness about an immigration crackdown in Louisiana and Mississippi — a campaign known both as “Operation Swamp Sweep” and “Catahoula Crunch” – and to oppose the Mississippi government’s collaboration with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
While the group of about 12 protested outside, Gov. Tate Reeves, a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump’s immigration policies, spoke inside of the Madison restaurant. The protesters were far enough away from the restaurant to prevent any direct communications with Reeves.
Beginning this week, ICE and the Department of Homeland Security are conducting a two-month immigration crackdown in Louisiana and south Mississippi. Protestors marched in New Orleans during the weekend to oppose the campaign.
The group also opposed Mississippi’s state agencies and local law enforcement in working with ICE’s immigration enforcement efforts through the 287(g) program.
On Wednesday, protestors in Madison stood across the street at the intersection in front of Mama Hamil’s, where Reeves was the keynote speaker at Grip N Grin, a monthly meeting to discuss current events. They waved signs as cars drove by, and some drivers honked as they passed.
Kathleein O’Beirne, a Ridgeland native, said this protest was made possible by a coalition of groups, including Mississippi United.

O’Beirne said immigrants contribute greatly to American society and the economy, and the president’s rhetoric around immigration is not rooted in truth.
“The truth of the matter is we Mississippians are smart enough to realize that there is a humane and civil way that respects families, that protects our communities, to address our immigration issues,” she said.
The crackdown in Louisiana and Mississippi is part of the Trump administration’s larger campaign of mass deportations, which O’Beirne described as a campaign of intimidation and harassment against immigrant communities in Mississippi.
Among the group was Paula Merchant, a U.S. Army veteran and former English as a Second Language teacher who founded Adelante, which works with the immigrant community in Jackson and helped organize the protest.
Her experience as an immigrant inspired Merchant to establish the group. She believes the current immigration system is broken and the focus should be on fixing it rather than deporting people. 
“They’re not going to work,” she said of the immigrants. “The kids are not going to school, and they don’t want to separate from one another because they don’t know if they’re going to be taken.”
Merchant was born in Mexico to a Mexican mother and an American father. She and her mother moved to the U.S. when she was 4 after her father died. Her parents never married, making it difficult to prove her father was biologically related to her. Merchant said this meant she and her mother had to take the standard immigration process, which was long and expensive. 
She said she didn’t get a green card until she was 14, and didn’t become a naturalized citizen until she was 28.
“Irregardless how you feel, they’re still your brothers and sisters,” she said. “They’re humans, you should want for them what you have for yourself.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/03123422/3X0A6452.jpg,,,2025-12-03 19:57:08.908965

Idaho mental health clinics sue state over Medicaid contractor’s cuts

The decision clears a legal hurdle for an Idaho Medicaid contractor, Magellan of Idaho, to proceed with its plan to cut specialized mobile teams that treat patients with severe mental illness who have struggled in routine settings. The cut took effect Monday, Magellan spokesperson Kristen Durocher told the Idaho Capital Sun in a statement.
Since the contractor announced the decision — which is part of a series of cuts meant to help the state avoid a budget deficit — mental health providers and even the Idaho Sheriffs’ Association have warned that the cuts could risk public safety, as people with severe mental illness lose accessible treatment through the program. In attempts to block the cuts, some mental health clinics and patients on the program sued the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare and top state health officials.

Idaho 4th District Judge Derrick O’Neill on Wednesday denied a request by four mental health clinics to pause the cuts, saying he didn’t believe he’d received enough information to suggest their case would succeed on its legal merits.
“Appreciating the fact that everybody involved is burdened by a difficult reality, I do not believe there is sufficient evidence before the court at this time to upset that reality,” the judge said at a Wednesday court hearing.
Federal judge Amanda Brailsford on Monday denied patients’ request for a temporary restraining order that could have required the state to continue offering the service.
The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare could not be immediately reached for comment. Magellan is a private company that runs Idaho Medicaid mental health benefits.



 How to submit public comments on the Idaho Medicaid mental health cuts

On Nov. 26, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare notified Tribal representatives about planned Idaho Medicaid mental health service cuts by a private contractor, Magellan of Idaho. 
Tribal representatives can submit public comments by Dec. 26 via email to MCPT@dhw.idaho.gov. 



 Patients will go to homeless shelters, jails, if program is cut, mental health clinics say

The clinics asked the state court to pause Magellan’s plan to end the program, called Assertive Community Treatment, until the cuts’ legality is determined. An attorney for the clinics, Preston Carter of Givens Pursley, argued that the state health agency didn’t adequately notify providers about the cuts. Last week, the Department of Health and Welfare published a notice of the cuts and announced public comment opportunities for Tribal representatives, weeks after Magellan first announced the cuts in late October.

“The patients will disperse among homeless shelters, in jail, in institutions, in hospitalizations, and the providers will not be able to relocate them because of the characteristics of this population,” Carter told the judge Wednesday. “And the trust that has been built up between providers and their patients will evaporate and will be very difficult, if not impossible, to reestablish.”
An attorney for the Department of Health and Welfare, Deputy Attorney General Anita Moore, said the agency has few options for cuts because many Medicaid services are protected by federal and state law. But if the department’s cuts were delayed, she said future cuts could be more drastic. 
“It’s tempting to look at the Department of Health and Welfare as a bunch of faceless bureaucrats, heartless and cold, just cutting stuff left and right just because. …. That’s a cartoonish depiction or idea of how the department operates,” she told the judge Wednesday. “A lot of careful deliberation of what services have to be given priority over others or which amongst its myriad of services can be paired back with the least amount of negative impact on beneficiaries, or with the least amount of ripple effect across services, goes into these decisions.”
The judge, O’Neill, said later in the case attorneys will debate whether the department adequately notified the public about the cuts.",https://idahocapitalsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/teenmentalhealth.jpeg,,,2025-12-03 19:57:08.908965

A district court judge on Tuesday ruled in favor of the Northwest Landowners Association in its suit against the North Dakota Industrial Commission, which approved a permit for underground storage for carbon pipeline developer Summit Carbon Solutions. 
The landowner group successfully challenged a law that can force landowners to allow storage beneath their property. Northeast Judicial District Judge Anthony Swain Benson ruled the law allows a government-authorized taking of property without an avenue for “just” compensation determined by a jury.

Summit’s project would transport greenhouse gas emissions from ethanol plants in five states, including Tharaldson Ethanol near Casselton, to the sequestration site. 
The lawsuit isn’t specific to Summit, but seems likely to have implications for the project.
In a statement, Summit Carbon Solutions said it is reviewing the court decision and evaluating its options. 
Summit said the North Dakota storage area “remains an important long-term asset for the project and our partners, including the State of North Dakota, our ethanol plant customers, and the communities we serve.” 
The ruling also could impact the coal and oil and gas industries.

Jonathan Fortner is the president and CEO of the Lignite Energy Council, a leading coal group in North Dakota. 
“The district court’s decision creates new uncertainty for carbon capture projects at a time when reliable, affordable electricity is more important than ever,” Fortner said in a statement. “When projects stall, the impacts are not abstract. They show up in grid reliability, electricity bills, and the loss of high-paying, local careers.” 
Minnkota Power Cooperative has been working to develop Project Tundra, which would capture carbon from a coal-fired power plant near Center for underground storage. 
The Energy and Environmental Research Center in Grand Forks, has worked on both the Summit and Minnkota projects. 
“It puts a shadow on projects and the projects underway,” John Harju, EERC’s vice president for strategic partnerships said of the ruling Wednesday. 
The law that was challenged requires landowners to allow carbon dioxide storage beneath their property if at least 60% of the affected landowners agree to the project. 
About 92% of landowners in Summit’s storage area  in Oliver, Mercer and Morton counties had chosen to participate in the project when the Industrial Commission approved the storage permit last year.
The Dakota Resource Council, an environment group, said the ruling strengthens the position of landowners. 
“We see it as a major win for family farmers, ranchers, and rural landowners who have been standing up to CO2 pipelines and storage projects,” the group said in an email. 
Owen Anderson, an energy law scholar who began his career in North Dakota, was surprised by the decision. He’s not aware of any courts in other states that have reached a similar conclusion and said the decision, if upheld, opens the door to challenges of other pore space uses such as saltwater disposal, which could impact the oil and gas industry. 
“I would assume the state would appeal this,” Anderson said. “It’s a key case, no question about that.”
North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley said Tuesday his office was still evaluating next steps.
National leader
North Dakota has been a leader in carbon capture and storage. It was the first state to be granted primacy in permitting Class VI injection wells, the kind of well needed for CO2 storage. Previously, all permitting had been done at the federal level. 
North Dakota has two ethanol plants injecting carbon underground, Gevo’s site near Richardton, formerly Red Trail Energy, and Blue Flint Ethanol at Underwood.
A representative of Colorado-based Gevo said the company is glad to work with the local community and landowners.
“We believe in fair compensation for our landowner partners and this has not been an issue for us in Richardton, nor do we expect it to be an issue in the future,” Gevo said in a statement.
Basin Electric Power Cooperative also operates a carbon storage operation at the Great Plains Synfuels Plant near Beulah. 
Representatives from Minnkota did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday. Basin Electric did not provide a statement Wednesday. An official with Blue Flint declined to comment.
Legislature’s role
The decision creates uncertainty around how carbon capture projects could move forward and whether the Legislature will need to take further action.
Sen. Dale Patten, R-Watford City, is one of the legislative branch’s biggest proponents of carbon sequestration. He’s not sure what the next step will be if the district court ruling isn’t overturned.
“If the Supreme Court upholds the decision, what would be the alternative language that we could use?” Patten said. “I don’t know.”

Pore space, unlike surface land, cannot be fenced off. Carbon dioxide injected into underground pore space will migrate horizontally without regard for property lines on the surface. 
“This concept lets a small minority of pore space owners, even just one owner, dictate to the majority of owners — the majority have property rights as well,” Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, said in a statement Wednesday.
Patten fears the court’s decision will prevent landowners from realizing the value of their pore space. 
“You cannot realize that value individually very effectively,” Patten said. “You have to realize it collectively.”

Troy Coons, chair of the Northwest Landowners Association that challenged the law in court, said a company could use good business practices and work with landowners to lease 100% of the pore space in a project area. If it is a public utility using the pore space for a public use, and they can’t lease 100% of the pore space, they have the option to use eminent domain. 
He does not think the Legislature should step in again. 
“I say they need to stay out of it,” Coons said. “They seem to have a real hard time allowing the organic, natural path of business to happen.”
He and the association’s attorney, Derrick Braaten, pointed out oil and gas companies in the Bakken routinely manage to work with landowners every day.
“It’s possible,” Braaten said. “It’s been done and it is being done.”

Last year both my son and I were unfairly fired from a taqueria that we worked at in downtown Minneapolis. This firing happened right after we asked for the hours we were owed from our first paycheck, which was already a month late. At the time of our dismissal it was unclear when we would receive payment. 
A friend recommended we go to Restaurant Opportunity Center MN, or ROC MN, to seek support. We were relieved to hear that they could speak with us in Spanish. ROC educated us on our rights as workers in Minneapolis and an organizer accompanied me to my workplace to ensure that we would receive our full pay immediately. Thanks to ROC, my son and I not only recuperated our wages, but also our dignity and the confidence to stand up for ourselves.
My story is far from unique. Every year, workers in Minneapolis lose millions of dollars in hard-earned wages due to employer noncompliance with the city’s labor standards. National estimates show that 1 in 5 low-wage workers are victims of wage theft — the unlawful failure to pay workers the wages they have earned.
On Tuesday December 9, the City Council will present their amended budget for 2026. This will include their proposal for co-enforcement funding. The co-enforcement program is a partnership between the city and worker centers aimed at protecting workers from wage theft, recovering stolen wages, and improving compliance of labor standards across the city. 
The partnership has helped recover over $2 million of stolen wages, and has trained tens of thousands of workers across the city on their workplace rights and how to bring forward complaints.
Worker centers in the co-enforcement program provide education, accompaniment and interpretation, which is fundamental for bridging cultural gaps and language barriers. Thanks to the program, immigrant workers are empowered with the tools to understand our rights, lift up our voices, and defend ourselves. 
I attended the second round of the city budget hearings on October 6 to share my wage theft story with City Council members, and I was far from the only worker to show up and share my story at the hearing. 
The program is proven to be successful — so why do we need to fight for it to be included in the city budget year after year? 
In August, Mayor Jacob Frey released his budget, which would cut the program in half — from $658,824 to $309,646. This is out of the city’s 2026 proposed civil rights budget of $7.8 million 
This is unacceptable — are workers rights really only worth 4% of the total civil rights budget? 
When employers fail to pay workers the wages or sick time they earn, all Minneapolis residents pay the price: Workers lose their earnings, taxes go unpaid, businesses that follow the rules are unfairly disadvantaged and public health suffers. And this is undeniably a civil rights issue: Black and Latino workers are three to four times more likely than white workers to experience wage theft. 
Minimum wage violations in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan statistical area cost Minnesota workers nearly $900 million over the past decade, with an annual underpayment of over $2,700 per worker. Based on analysis of LSED reports compared to the estimated total number of violations, the majority of cases in high violation industries like accommodations and food services remain undetected and unreported.
Frey stood with workers in February of 2025 to celebrate the success of the co-enforcement program, touting over $2 million in recovered wages. At a time when the highest-violation industries are expected to grow over the next decade, some as much as 20-40%, workers and the city stood together to emphasize the timely and critical nature of this program. 
Frey said: “The quickest way to erode trust in government is to pass laws that you don’t intend to enforce.” 
I wholeheartedly agree with the mayor. The quickest way for low-wage workers to lose trust in our city is if we lose this co-enforcement funding. Minneapolis needs continued, robust labor co-enforcement funding, not as a luxury or a political gesture, but as a necessity to protect those who have always gotten the short end of the stick and continue to struggle to protect our rights. 
Co-enforcement is key because laws mean nothing if they’re not enforced — our mayor said it himself. Will the city choose to do the right thing and fully fund the co-enforcement program? 
Workers are ready to fight for our rights. ¡Porque cuando luchamos, ganamos! Because when we fight, we win!

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)Politicians, philanthropists and an excited public are celebrating the opening of the Montana Heritage Center, a $107 million project showcase of the state’s history.
During a ceremony Tuesday, Gov. Greg Gianforte called it a “world class facility,” and its historical exhibits and art galleries would not be out of place at major museums in Chicago, San Francisco or New York.
“This accomplishment is remarkable and highlights the generosity and the love that Montanans have for Montana,” Gianforte said.
Tuesday’s ribbon-cutting ceremony was the result of decades of work from many Montanans who wanted to help preserve the state’s history. A 70,000-square-foot addition was added to the building and an existing 90,000 square foot area was remodeled. 
The Homeland Gallery will likely become a destination for visitors to the state capitol, taking them through Montana’s rich history all the way back to the Ice Age. The space has exhibits from the state’s Indigenous peoples, with artifacts and deep explanations of nuanced history.
“If you think about it, 160 years ago, a number of pioneers met in Virginia City to talk about the process of starting to collect and preserve and honor the history of this area, and to be sure, it didn’t start with them, right?” Tim Fox, board president of the Montana Historical Society, said. “Our indigenous peoples were the first humans here, and our history goes back way beyond the discovery of gold, copper or silver.”
As visitors walk through that section, they’re treated to sounds that change as they move through the gallery. There’s interactive exhibits, things to watch and plenty to read. There’s also a smudge room, gardens, paths and gathering areas outside, as well as a cafe and event space.	
Montana Heritage Center Hours:
– M-W & F: 9am-5pm
– Thursday: 9am-6:30pm
– Saturday: 10am-5pm
– Sunday: 12pm-5pm
• Gift Shop Hours:
– M-W & F-Sat: 10am-5pm
– Thursday: 10am-6:30pm
– Sunday: 1pm-5pm
• Norm’s Café Hours: To be determined.
• Holidays: Open 7 days a week, year round, except for Christmas day and Thanksgiving day.


The Charlie M. Russell Gallery also houses an extensive collection of work from the famed western artist. With low light, some incredible frames and even a sitting area, it is a home for many paintings that had been in storage.
There’s also another rotating gallery that will house additional exhibits. Only about 10% of the total collection is on display, museum officials said.

And in the Homeland Gallery, there’s even a covered wagon, a simulation of going down a Butte mineshaft and an exhibit on where the nuclear missiles in Montana are.
“One of the goals that we’ve had in this gallery is to make sure that there are lots of different stories and lots of different perspectives presented,” Amanda Streeter Trum, head of curatorial with the Montana Historical Society, said. “History is not just told from one group’s point of view. And so we’ve got lots of stories and lots of people represented here, as it should be.”
The final $60 million for constructing the facilities was privately funded. The Dennis and Phyllis Washington Foundation, Norm Asbjornson, and BNSF Railway together contributed more than $40 million, according to a release from the governor’s office.
Gianforte helped fundraise after taking office, he said at the ceremony. He was supportive of the project, but wanted cost overruns to be paid for by private donations.
“I called every major business in the state … telling them about our plans and asking them for support,” Gianforte said. “Many of you got those calls and are here today.”
Hundreds of people filled the main atrium of the building for the ceremony and then were able to wander the facility after.

Gianforte also announced about $3.5 million had been donated toward an endowment to support Montana students getting to experience the museum. The goal, Gianforte said, is that every student in the state gets a tour the year they study the state’s history. 
The target for the endowment is $10 million.
Some facilities and parts of the center are still under construction and a full grand opening is planned for next summer.
“I hope that we can be a space where we can talk about difficult things and present challenging topics in addition to the fun, joyous topics as well,” Streeter Trum said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/HeritageCenter1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-03 19:57:08.908965

The products were widely distributed and sold by Chedrauui USA, Inc. – which owns grocery store chains El Super and Smart & Final – throughout store locations in Arizona, California, and Nevada under various titles including “S&C Sanitizer”, “S&C Disinfectant”, “Perfect Professional Advanced Multi-Surface Sanitizer” and “Prinex Sanysol.”
“Unregistered disinfectants can not only be ineffective, but can contain dangerous ingredients,” said EPA Pacific Southwest Region Enforcement and Compliance Assurance Division Director Amy Miller. “Companies have a responsibility to protect their customers from illegal, potentially harmful disinfectant products, and can do so by making sure they are registered with EPA.”
In a release issued Tuesday, the EPA said their findings were based on inspections performed by the federal agency and California Department of Pesticide Regulation in 2021. 
An investigation at an El Super store in Santa Ana, California found that two of the pesticides being sold – “S&C Sanitizer” and “S&C Disinfectant” – contained ternary ammonia, a product with high toxicity that requires a “danger” label.
That store location and a Smart & Final in Hayward, California also sold two products – “Prinex Sanysol” and “Perfect Professional Advanced Multi-Surface Sanitizer” – that made unverified statements about their effectiveness at killing germs and other microorganisms, according to an investigation by the EPA.
Further investigation revealed that the grocery store chains widely distributed these disinfectants on numerous occasions to store locations throughout Arizona, California, and Nevada. The EPA found Smart & Final distributed the unregistered pesticide “Perfect Professional Advanced Multi-Surface Sanitizer” on at least 53 occasions.
The EPA stated the unregistered disinfectants were removed from stores as a result of the investigation and that Smart & Final and parent-company Chedraui confirmed the products are no longer being distributed to or sold in their stores.
The distribution or sale of unregistered and misbranded disinfectants and other pesticide products is a violation of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). The federal pesticide law requires disinfectants be registered with the EPA.
Unregistered products can be harmful to human health and the environment, and may not be effective against the spread of germs. Registration and labeling ensures pesticide and disinfectant products are tested in accordance with specific guidelines and can be safely used for their intended purposes.The most up-to-date list of EPA-registered disinfectant products can be found on the agency’s website.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/elsupersmart-1024x562.jpg,,,2025-12-03 19:57:08.908965

Their homecoming was no exception.,"Homecoming remains an important enough tradition in the Mississippi Delta that the violence that happened in Leland and Rolling Fork in October didn’t diminish the crowds. Relatives still traveled home. Dozens still set up grills and canopies at games. Mississippi Today produced a collection of stories of homecoming events in the Delta, where traditions have evolved over time.
CLARKSDALE — At the end of the first quarter, the Clarksdale High Wildcats were down by 8. 
Mosquitos bit into the ankles of players and spectators. Cheerleaders and majorettes rallied for a new routine in tune to the school band’s thumping brass bass. Coaching assistants white-knuckled clipboards as superfans on the sidelines winced at an interception by the visiting Ripley High School Tigers. 
Doubt crept in between sips of homemade lemonade and chips scooped into spicy cheese dip, manifesting itself in side-long glances, short prayers and yelps of support for quarterback Tommie Magsby. A murmur passed through the crowd in Clarksdale on a balmy 76 degree night: Would the Wildcats lose the coveted homecoming game?
The Wildcats have long produced stars and dominated football statewide. The NFL has recruited 17 Clarksdale players, the second-highest number of any Mississippi high school. This season, Clarksdale has only lost to perennial rival South Panola High School. Clarksdale has won two division championships in the last decade. At last year’s homecoming, the Wildcats lost by a single touchdown to Southaven High during a game some fans described as a heart breaker and nail biter.

Under the harsh stadium lights and amid the roar of an antsy marching band, forceful head coach Curtis Kemp gathered the team on the sidelines with at least four assistant coaches in tow. 
He pulled his tight end and wide receiver into the huddle. Kemp exhorted them all to “run the ball,” execute the plays they practiced in the near equatorial heat of summer, be physical, and in the words of one of his assistants, get the smell and “homecoming feel” out of your mind. 
“You don’t want to lose the homecoming game,” Kemp said.
Visiting Green Bay Packers offensive lineman and former Wildcat Elgton Jenkins was in the audience. So were family and friends.
Even before kickoff, the aroma of rib tips wafted from smoker to serving plate, from tailgate to tent. Near the back fence, a truck let down a neon green shaved-ice hut from its trailer. Teachers folded programs.
‘You feel connected to something bigger’
When Tomika Bates first arrived in her hometown, she made sure to visit Rice Bowl, the greasy spoon Chinese spot that has her favorite shrimp. She and her high school friend group — all from the class of 2001 — missed other comforts of home such as Double Quick chicken and time with family.
Most of Bates’ friend group now live in the suburbs of Memphis or Jackson and in Nashville. They are bankers, morticians, instructional coaches at schools and principals. But today, in matching royal blue jerseys decorated with red iron-on patches, they are Wildcat superfans. 
“I’m here for a good time,” Bates said. “We all look forward to seeing old friends, rehashing old memories, and creating new ones year after year.”
Dennis Jackson, a multimedia teacher at Clarksdale’s vocational school and a Wildcat alum, stood by the 50-yard line during much of the game. He congratulated his students as they traded places by the bench between plays.
Jackson played football at Clarksdale while serving in the Marines and for an Australian football team. He was based in Wollongong, Australia, for much of his life between leaving the military and recently returning home. He also spent time as an actor in Hollywood.
“You get to know your home more when you’re far away from it,” Jackson said. “People know us from out there.”
Clarksdale High homecoming court candidates greet their family members by the bleachers at school’s homecoming game on Oct. 3, 2025.
He remembers when he first left Clarksdale at 20.
It was near noon on a weekday in January in the late 1980s. Jackson was in the 900 block of Lower Brickyard, a Clarksdale neighborhood by McKinley Street, sitting across from his grandmother at her dining room table. They were enjoying a send-off meal of pinto beans and some of his other favorite dishes. She smiled at him.
When Jackson returned to Clarksdale two years ago, he hardly recognized his hometown with its many empty lots and closed storefronts. He looked around the streets for neighborhood kids playing outside but encountered an eerie quiet. 
“It was the depopulation that you can see most,” Jackson said.
At Walmart, he began to feel at home. He ran into an old teacher and some former neighbors. One offered him a job at the school district. He is now enjoying his second year as a multimedia instructor at the vocational school.
After years as a retired athlete, he has become a Wildcat superfan again.
“It’s always been a tradition, you know, running into friends, getting a chance to tell a few lies,” Jackson said of homecoming night. “You feel connected to something bigger.”
‘I gotta be there’
By the second quarter of the homecoming game, Clarksdale’s fortunes had turned. The Wildcats were up by a touchdown. The team was playing with renewed vigor.

Magsby, the team’s star player, intercepted the ball near the 40-yard line. The audience was electric. Kemp led Magsby and his teammates to the field house as the buzzer sounded for halftime.
Kemp used the moment to impart wisdom and a winning strategy.
“I just told ’em it was going to be a long practice next week if we couldn’t get it done,” he said about the homecoming victory in a post-game interview.
The homecoming court was announced during halftime. Escorts led candidates across the muddy field. The students’ families descended from the bleachers to get a closer look.
One contestant, Erin England, and her brother carried a life-size portrait of her late father. The other contestants, in flowing gowns and hoop skirts, batted away bugs with white satin gloves and pushed curls behind bedazzled earlobes.
“Our next senior maid enjoys playing sports and spending time with friends. She loves going shopping and spending her mom’s money,” the announcer declared, describing England. “Her favorite Bible verse is Psalms 28:7: ‘The Lord is my strength and shield. I trust him with all my heart.’”
Mary Miller, the mother of quarterback and homecoming king Tommie Magsby, beamed from the stands during the third quarter. She held up a posterboard with his jersey number until the last play.
“I know his plays. I know when he’s going to run it. And each time, it’s a touchdown,” Miller said. “It’s like I know what he’s gonna do before he does it. He’s generous with the ball, and he’s got vision. You can’t teach people that.”

Since Magsby’s peewee league days, Miller has driven him to practices and made sure he had his water bottle and cleats. She remembers his first tackle and early victories. Even as a child, he spoke of little else than football.
In a recent game against Cleveland Central, Magsby ran a 90-yard touchdown. He might have scored five touchdowns if not for an opposing player tugging on his face mask. Coahoma Community College has offered him a football scholarship.
“I’ll miss seeing how good he plays out there,” Miller said. “Now, I work out of town. I have to put in time to make sure that I’m here. If I miss a game, it just does something to me. I gotta be there because that’s my son on the field. I want to let him know that he does have support and we follow him wherever he goes.”
Taking home the win
The locker room had a sour stench by the homecoming game’s triumphant conclusion: 43-14. Shoeless players in muddied pants blasted music from speakers. Admirers and superfans lingered just outside where equipment was being pulled in from the field.
Kemp reclined in his office beside a white board covered with Xs, Os and initials.
“As a coach, you really have to tamp it down,” he said with a wide smile, hardly able to contain his glee.
It was his students’ night, not his.
Kemp graduated from Clarksdale High in 1999 and became head coach three years ago. He’d worked as Coahoma County High School’s head coach for three years. He had wanted the job for much of his coaching career.
“Clarksdale has been a good team for some time,” he said.

More than developing star players and bringing home wins, Kemp said he is mostly in it for the mentorship.
If you’re an upstanding guy, the football part will work itself out, he said. He just asks for commitment and accountability.
The young men Kemp coaches sometimes remind him of a time when he was young, and shared NFL dreams with his teammates.
One of his fondest memories was playing during the 1999 homecoming football game. The Wildcats were playing Greenville’s T.L. Weston High School. The lights were bright and the fans were loud. Kemp was on the field with his best friends. The Wildcats had a handful of injured players and weren’t favored to win.
Kemp scored four touchdowns. The last one sealed Clarksdale’s win, and players and fans mobbed him at game’s end.
His wildest dreams seemed within reach.
“I wanted to go pro,” Kemp said. “Most players won’t. But if I could see them doing something, taking care of their families and doing stuff around town as young men, I’m fine.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/26115933/MG_8645-8.jpg,,,2025-12-03 18:59:47.754969

“You can apply tariffs on whoever you want, but if you want to rub it in somebody's face and nose, you're going to get reactions like this,” Tom Kavet said of the president’s policies toward Canada.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  ‘A costly unforced error’: Vermont Legislature’s top economist slams Trump’s trade war.","MONTPELIER — The Vermont Legislature’s top economist called President Donald Trump’s trade war with Canada and Trump’s disparaging rhetoric toward the country a “costly unforced error” that is putting pressure on the state’s budget at an already challenging time.
Tom Kavet was speaking to members of the Vermont House and Senate at a briefing Wednesday in Montpelier on some of the major issues legislators will face when they reconvene for the 2026 legislative session, which starts the second week of January.
Kavet said a drop in visitors from Canada this year compared to years past — something that is a direct result of Trump’s actions — has meant less tax revenue is being collected from tourists to support state services. That’s likely to make it harder for legislative leaders, working with Gov. Phil Scott’s administration, to balance the books when they start developing a new state budget next month, Kavet said. 
At the same time, top legislators have already pointed to how rising costs at home and shrinking federal support for key social services could force them to trim other programs and initiatives that residents rely on, though they have not yet proposed specific cuts.
Traffic at Vermont’s welcome and visitor centers was down 9% between January and mid-November 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, according to data Kavet presented Wednesday. Most of those centers are situated on or near Interstates 89 and 91.
At the centers located closest to Canada — in Alburgh and Derby Line — the drop between those time periods was far higher, about 36%, data shows. At centers located slightly farther south, including in Georgia and Lyndonville, the drop was about 18%.
Meanwhile, data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection shows that traffic into the U.S. at border crossings in Vermont fell below 2024 levels immediately after Trump took office in January 2025, and has remained below 2024 levels every month since.
In October 2025, cross-border traffic — which includes cars, trucks, pedestrians, and airplanes — was down about 22% compared to October 2024, federal data shows.

Kavet called the decline in cross-border visitors this year “needless.” 
Kavet is the president and co-founder of a Williamstown consulting firm that provides fiscal analyses guiding Vermont’s state budget-building process each year.
“I say needless just because you can apply tariffs on whoever you want, but if you want to rub it in somebody’s face and nose, you’re going to get reactions like this,” he said. “And it just doesn’t help when it comes to revenue that we’re wanting — and needing.”
The decline in traffic comes as Vermont has brought in less tax revenue from hotel room rentals and purchases at restaurants and bars than the state was expecting, Kavet said.
Meals and rooms tax revenue landed about 2% below October targets, according to the latest data from the state Agency of Administration. The amount the state put into its education fund from that same tax was about 4% below officials’ targets, according to the data.
Meanwhile, between January and the end of October 2025, the data shows meals and rooms tax collections were about 1% lower than they were over the first 10 months of 2024.

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderA key advisory panel that oversees nationwide vaccine recommendations may vote to restrict access to hepatitis B immunizations for newborns and reconsider recommendations for a wide variety of other childhood vaccines when it is scheduled to meet this week at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
The committee, known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, is charged with setting national guidelines around which people should be vaccinated against a plethora of preventable diseases and when those vaccines should be administered. The recommendations play a key role in determining which vaccines insurance companies are willing to cover and how accessible those immunizations are to the public.
CDC panel abandons, for now, more controversial vaccine proposals but casts doubt on safety

According to a draft agenda posted to the CDC’s website, the committee plans to discuss the current childhood and adolescent immunization schedule, which includes vaccines against diseases like polio, diphtheria, tetanus, and RSV. They will also vote on new recommendations around hepatitis B, an incurable viral infection that attacks the liver.
The current three-dose series for hepatitis B includes one vaccine administered to infants within 24 hours of birth, and subsequent booster shots given one month and six months after the initial dose. ACIP has been recommending a hepatitis B vaccine for all infants since 1991, which resulted in a 99% drop in serious infections between 1990 and 2019.
A resolution seeking to alter current CDC recommendations around hepatitis B vaccines for newborn children was initially scheduled for September’s meeting, but was later postponed.
If ACIP members choose to implement the changes, official CDC guidelines may recommend that pediatricians delay administering the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine until at least 30 days after birth for all children whose mothers test negative for the disease.
Chari Cohen, who serves as president of the Hepatitis B Foundation, said she was deeply concerned about the push to alter the childhood vaccine schedule, arguing that efforts to delay doctors from administering the hepatitis B vaccine to newborns are rooted in misinformation.
“There’s no scientific argument that one could really make to get rid of the vaccine,” she said. “There’s been no new data published, no scientific, rigorous data that would change anyone’s mind.”
And while private health insurance plans may elect to continue covering the hepatitis B vaccine, Cohen says she worries about vaccine access for children enrolled in Medicaid or the Vaccines for Children program, which provides free immunizations to children who are uninsured or underinsured.
Ahead of the panel’s vote, states like Massachusetts and Rhode Island have preemptively announced that they will continue to provide access to the hepatitis B vaccines for newborns, regardless of what the CDC panel decides. 
However, Georgia’s state government has taken a different approach. The state’s Department of Public Health said it “will monitor updates and federal guidance on administering the hepatitis B vaccine and assess how these changes may affect the health of Georgia’s newborns,” according to a statement from Nancy Nydam Shirek, the department’s communications director.
Shakeups at the HHS
The panel’s December meeting is its first since Trump promoted a scientifically unsupported link between Tylenol and autism, more than 600 CDC workers were fired from the CDC, a prominent vaccine skeptic was appointed to the second-highest office at the CDC and U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. instructed the CDC to update its website to display unproven claims linking vaccines to autism.
A CDC page on vaccine safety now states that “studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism,” though a small disclaimer at the bottom of the page notes that the header stating “vaccines do not cause autism” has not been removed due to an agreement with U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who heads the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. 
Cassidy, a doctor, cast the deciding vote to confirm Kennedy as health secretary on the condition that Kennedy “maintain the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices without changes.” Kennedy later backtracked on that promise, firing all 17 previous members of the committee and replacing them with a slate of hand-picked appointees, many of whom are seen as vaccine skeptics.

Since the panel’s most recent meeting in September, former ACIP Chair Martin Kulldorff — a doctor and former Harvard Medical School professor who is known for his opposition to vaccine mandates — has been appointed to another position within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, where he will serve as a key advisor to Kennedy. 
Dr. Kirk Milhoan, a Hawaii-based pediatric cardiologist and senior fellow at the Independent Medical Alliance, will serve as the committee’s new chair, according to a press release from the HHS. The Independent Medical Alliance — formerly known as the Frontline COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance — advocated for the use of the drug ivermectin and other unproven methods to treat COVID-19.

Fewer than half of Montana students in grades 3 through 8 are at or above grade-level proficiency standards in language arts and math. 
That’s according to the first statewide results of a new standardized assessment implemented during the last school year. 
The Office of Public Instruction released the statewide scores of the Montana Aligned to Standards Through-Year Assessment, or MAST, before the Thanksgiving holidays. State superintendent Susie Hedalen said while OPI has work to do training teachers on administering the test and early data shows a need to improve student outcomes, the format has been well received by students and offers usable data for educators. 
Montana’s average of students who tested at or above proficiency levels for their grade was 43.1% in language arts, and 36.9% in math. 
While OPI says that the new testing format precludes direct comparisons from previous years, the scores are similar to those from the 2021-22 school year, which showed 46.1% and 36.5% of students proficient in language and math respectively following a well-reported slump in student achievement attributed to COVID-19’s impact on education. 
“In literacy we are higher than in math. That’s a trend we’ve seen for many years,” Hedalen told the Daily Montanan in an interview. “I look at this as really important data for us to make data-driven decisions. 
Hedalen, a Republican, said she’s excited that the new MAST format allowed educators to receive feedback on student outcomes quickly.
MAST was implemented statewide during the 2024-2025 school year after piloting the test for two years under former state Superintendent Elsie Arntzen. 
As opposed to previous standardized testing formats, MAST involves “testlets,” smaller math and English Language Arts tests that take place during four testing periods in the school year, creating a “through-year assessment model.”
The goal is to offer more immediate feedback to educators, students, parents and administrators by providing multiple data points to track progress and alter curriculum or teaching strategies throughout the year to benefit students. 

But it may take some time for educators to smoothly integrate the new testing regimen in classrooms. 
A survey, shared with the Board of Public Education during the summer, collected responses from 246 teachers across the state and showed that while the more frequent but shorter test format helped engage students and provide feedback, some teachers found they tested topics not covered in classes and they seemed “irrelevant to instruction.”
According to the survey, 72.8% of teachers felt “unable to schedule testlets in a way that aligns with their syllabus,” and a vast majority reported insufficient training in the new protocol. 
Hedalen, elected in November 2024, said she had heard similar feedback from educators and administrators since she came into the position this year. 
“I believe this has been very challenging … coming from the field I felt that myself,” Hedalen said. “Educators needed more professional development. We didn’t get an understanding of the new assessments to a broad enough audience. We needed to do more with school leaders and educators”
“There’s lots of work to back up, make sure we’re on the same page, schedule testlets, and align with curriculum,” she said. “And then teachers have the data on which students are connecting on the standards, and which students are reaching proficiency and which ones might need more support.”
The survey conducted last school year included responses from more than 35,000 students, and a majority reported preferring the distributed assessment format over a single end-of-year exam, and most reported feeling positively about how the testlets helped their learning outcomes. 
Hedalen said that the first round of MAST scores should be taken with a grain of salt given it’s the first year, and that when she looks at the bigger picture of Montana students across all grade levels and compared to national standards, students are doing comparatively better. 
She said that comparing national testing data shows that Montana students have had one of the highest bounce-back rates from COVID-era scores. Scores from 2024 National Assessment of Educational Progress assessments show Montana 8th graders ranking 10th in math proficiency and 4th in reading proficiency compared to all states.  
In addition, Hedalen said high school ACT scores this year showed the highest language arts proficiency for Montana students since the test was adopted in the state, and she pointed to data coming in from new early literacy programs which show promising trends for younger students. 
“Those are all exciting data points to me, but I completely acknowledge we have work to do,” she said. “It is really great we have a new, more accurate baseline on how students are doing in language arts and mathematics according to our state standards, and we’re going to work to provide students what they need to get college and career ready, especially with math.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-200443854-001-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-03 18:59:47.754969

The $4.7 million project has been in the works for about three years, said Peggy Allen, president of the Upper Valley Agricultural Association.

This story by Clare Shanahan was first published in Valley News on Nov. 28, 2025.
NORWICH — The town has granted permission to a nonprofit to build a permanent all-season structure for the Norwich Farmer’s Market on a property across Route 5 from the market’s current location.
The Norwich Development Review Board approved the nonprofit’s plans to develop about 9.5 acres of a 35-acre property it plans to purchase. 
The project includes constructing a 7,500-square-foot building in the shape of a large barn, an outdoor vendor area, a picnic area and parking, according to the board’s written decision, filed on Nov. 13.
The Upper Valley Agricultural Association, a nonprofit created in 2024 “with the primary intent of trying to find a permanent home for the market,” proposed the project, association President Peggy Allen said at a mid-October Development Review Board hearing. A group has been working on the $4.7 million project for about three years, she said.
The nonprofit began eyeing the vacant property for the project in summer 2024 and since then has finalized a purchase-and-sale agreement with the out-of-state landowner, Rose Z Dyke Trust in care of Judith Currier of Leesburg, Va.
Allen declined to say when the sale will close, although she did say it will be “soon” and is “on schedule.”
The new property sits across the road from the current summer market location on Route 5 in Norwich. The Norwich Farmers Market leases the current summer market site from the Hanover Consumer Cooperative Society and holds its winter market days in Tracy Hall.

In addition to creating a permanent home for the market, the project aims to reduce traffic congestion, parking and capacity issues with the winter market at Tracy Hall. Also, the outdoor market’s current site sits below Route 5 and is prone to flooding in heavy rain.
One of the biggest challenges with the current summer market location is parking, which often fills up early in the morning and overflows into the parking lot for Fogg’s Lumber and Hardware next door.
Because the current parking lot has no lined spaces, it is difficult to say how many cars come to the weekly market, Allen said. On one Saturday in August, she counted 850 cars between when the first customers arrived to get parking before 9 a.m., and 1 p.m. when the market wraps up for the day, she said.
The market runs 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. every Saturday from May through October and twice a month on Saturdays from November to April.
There are no current plans to expand market hours, but they “certainly” would not be reduced and can be adjusted in the future if that would help the market “thrive,” Allen said Monday.
The new property will have 270 parking spaces.

Under the proposed plan, the summer farmers market would be hosted mostly in the outdoor vendor area, but the building would have large garage doors that could be opened to host some vendors inside.
“If we’re going to build this kind of building it’s ridiculous for it to only be utilized for a winter market,” Allen said.
In the winter, the market would be inside the building with some vendors set up under an overhanging roof around the outside of the building.
In addition to hosting the weekly market in the building, the nonprofit plans to host related activities, classes and events and to rent the facility out for community events. This will hopefully help to cover operating costs.
Allen said she does not know what the market is currently paying in rent, but said the goal is to create an “easy transition” with similar expenses to the current market.

As a condition of development review board approval, the facility can be rented out only for “community use,” or events that are for the town, community or school groups or “gatherings that are intended for the benefit of the public.”
The nonprofit has raised $1 million as of last week, Allen said. The next phase is to raise another $3.7 million by the end of next year to cover the cost of the land, infrastructure and the building.
The nonprofit has started seeking money from local donors and is looking at other sources, including applying for a $1 million Northern Border Regional Commission catalyst grant.
As for water and sewer connections, the society has been in talks with Hartford about connecting to its municipal infrastructure.
The Hartford Selectboard unanimously approved moving forward with discussions about the water system at a July meeting, but said a feasibility study had to be completed first. At the time of the meeting, Allen said the market was prepared to move forward with the project even without Hartford’s infrastructure but that would be very challenging.
Members of the Hartford town staff are discussing with engineers for the project the work necessary to connect the building to the town’s infrastructure, Hartford Town Manager John Haverstock said Tuesday.
The Agricultural Association also has been in talks with Twin Pines Housing Trust about building affordable housing on the property, but Allen said that possibility is not part of the current proposal. If the project moves forward, the land will be subdivided and developed separately.
The review board approval this month marks another step forward for the project. This summer, the Norwich Planning Board cleared one hurdle by adjusting the town’s zoning code to create a definition for open-air markets.
The nonprofit also has to secure an Act 250 permit from the state before it can move ahead with the development. The nonprofit has not yet filed a permit application, but it has taken some “proactive” steps such as completing a survey for indigenous artifacts on the land, Allen said. The survey found that there were no artifacts, clearing one of many steps that could have been a “brick wall” for the project.
The current plan is to break ground next spring and finish construction “before the snow falls in 2026,” but this timeline could shift depending on how fundraising goes, according to the application.

Since its opening in the summer of 2021, the suit alleges, “Resorts World has proven beyond question that it is unfit and incapable of operating a casino and hotel complex in compliance with the law” and the resort and its owner, Genting Berhad, “have proven their bona fides as a corrupt racketeering enterprise that operates with complete disregard of basic governance, corporate ethics and the law.”
The suit, filed by high-stakes gambler Robert Cipriani and businessman James Russell, alleges Resorts World “adopted a deliberate business strategy — premised on ignoring regulatory and legal restrictions — to maximize revenues by welcoming criminals at Resorts World to launder their illicit proceeds,” conducting not a legal casino business, but rather  “a criminal racketeering Enterprise.”
The suit alleges Chesnoff, formerly a partner in a lounge at Resorts World, enriched himself by “arranging and disguising investments in Resorts World business on behalf of known criminals and prohibited persons” with the approval of Sibella, who received “a piece of the action. Chesnoff invested in, participated in and owned business interests at Resorts World, which were used to facilitate money laundering, and other illegal activities.”
Resorts World did not respond to a request for comment. Chesnoff referred the Current to his attorney, James Pisanelli, who did not immediately respond. Sibella also did not respond. 
The suit is the second Cipriani has filed against Sibella and Resorts World.  District Judge Miranda Du last year dismissed a suit filed by Cipriani. In November, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals remanded the case to Du, but without Sibella as a defendant. 
Sibella and Chesnoff, the new suit alleges, conspired to oust Cipriani from the casino in 2021 because he reported to law enforcement that Resorts World executives allowed unsavory individuals to gamble.    
“Working together, the Defendants arranged to ‘arrest’ Plaintiff Cipriani on false charges, and, for good measure, manufactured a separate criminal charge of cheating at blackjack, with the clear intent and message to silence and prevent Plaintiff Cipriani’s future Cooperation,” the suit asserts. 
The Nevada Current was first to report in 2023 that federal authorities from the Central District of California were investigating a variety of allegations involving Resorts World Las Vegas,  MGM Grand, and Sibella, who served as president of both hotels. 
Resorts World terminated Sibella weeks after the story’s publication for violating internal policy. 
Sibella later pleaded guilty in federal court to failing to comply with anti-money laundering laws while president of MGM Grand. He later lost his Nevada gaming license. 
Resorts World LV agreed to a $10.5 million fine imposed by state gaming regulators for allowing illegal bookmakers Mathew Bowyer and Damien LeForbes to gamble at the casino. The two, who lost close to $24 million at Resorts World LV, were permitted to gamble despite the lack of documented sources of income required by casinos. Both pleaded guilty to money laundering and illegal bookmaking.  
Federal prosecutors have yet to file charges or impose a long-anticipated fine against Resorts World. 
The episode could be a factor in Resorts World’s effort to expand a New York City electronic gambling facility into a full-service casino. 
The company was one of three applicants with casinos in Las Vegas to win a recommendation Monday from the New York State Gaming Facility Location Board to be licensed in that state. 
The New York board’s selection report noted that Resorts World, asked to disclose disciplinary actions within the past five years, omitted “violations resulting in fines at Resorts World Catskills, Resorts World Hudson Valley, and its current video lottery gaming facility at Aqueduct.” Resorts World “disclosed a settled disciplinary action involving (parent company) Genting Berhad – RW Las Vegas LLC without providing details.”
The New York board “views this lack of transparency as concerning and recommends that the Commission weigh this in its licensing evaluation.” 
“As a consequence of this deliberate scheme to operate as a racketeering enterprise, not as a legitimate business, Resorts World stands as one of the worst examples of a governance and compliance disaster in the casino industry,” the suit asserts. 
Russell alleges Resorts World, by allowing gambler Brandon Sattler to bet in the casino, is responsible for Russell’s inability to collect a $10 million loan he made to Sattler. Sattler, who owned an audio-visual company that performed work at Resorts World, is described in the lawsuit as “a member of the enterprise.” 
Sattler is currently serving prison time for defrauding investors, including Russell, out of $7 million.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/resorts-world_exterior_hero-expanded-1-e1723756620194-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-03 18:59:47.754969

Unofficial results from Tuesday’s election show Jill Davidson won nearly 95% of the vote, besting Republican opponent Axel Brito for the council seat that represents the neighborhoods of Blackstone, College Hill and Wayland on the city’s East Side.
Davidson, who serves as the director of development and communications at the Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council, won a four-way Democratic primary in November, securing her chance at a contest with Brito. 
Davidson said in a statement Wednesday that she’s “looking forward to working toward long-term success for our public schools, pushing for increased environmental resilience, fighting for a more affordable Providence for everyone, and more.”
There were 700 votes in all, according to the unofficial results. That included 491 ballots cast on election day, 148 mail ballots, and 61 early votes.
The special election was held to fill the seat left by Helen Anthony, who resigned in early September to continue her recovery from injuries received in a 2023 accident.
City Council Chief of Staff June Rose said on Wednesday that Davidson’s swearing-in is tentatively scheduled for Dec. 17, following the anticipated certification of the election results on Dec. 11. 
Brito, a 21-year old Brown University senior, did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.

James Malone (D-Lancaster) addresses supporters at his reelection campaign launch at Lancaster Distilleries on Dec. 1, 2025 (Photo courtesy of the Malone campaign)It was an early sign of Democrats’ off-year electoral strength when James Malone, the former mayor of East Petersburg, defeated Lancaster County Commissioner Josh Parsons in a March special election. He became the first Democrat to represent Lancaster County in the chamber since 1889. 
His victory was only by a mere 529 votes, but it was a shock to many political observers who thought a Democrat would never stand a chance in the race. The win gained national attention.
On Monday evening, Malone (D-Lancaster) officially launched his reelection campaign at Lancaster Distilleries in Columbia Borough.
“In that special election, voters from this community came together to say they were ready for something different,” Malone said. “This campaign isn’t about the noise or the chaos. It’s about neighbors. It’s about making our communities thrive. It’s about making sure Lancaster continues to grow in a way that reflects our values and our future.”
For both Malone, and Pennsylvania Democrats more broadly, the campaign launch was something like planting a flag. Despite the unique circumstances that led to his victory, the state party says it’s ready to help him win again, and are even aiming for the longshot goal of flipping the entire Senate, which is currently controlled by a 27-23 Republican majority.

“We are prepared to marshal every resource necessary,” Pennsylvania Senate Democratic Campaign Committee (SDCC) Chair Vincent Hughes told the Capital-Star. “And anyone who doubts that need only look at the results of the special election in Senator Malone’s seat earlier this year. We won it before. We can win it again. The Trump Agenda carried out by Republicans in Pennsylvania is wildly unpopular and they will answer for that in 2026.”
The 36th District race is likely to be one of the most closely watched in Pennsylvania. While the district voted strongly for Trump, it also went for Gov. Josh Shapiro by a less than 1% margin in 2022, according to data shared by the SDCC.
The path to a Senate majority is narrow, and would likely rely on Democratic Lt. Gov. Austin Davis presiding as a tie-breaker. But Democrats say they believe there are enough vulnerable Republicans up for election, and a favorable enough political environment, to eke out that victory.
Brittany Crampsie, a spokesperson with the SDCC, said along with holding onto Malone’s seat, Democrats are working to flip four other districts. They’d need to win all of them, without losing a single seat, to get a majority.
Specifically, they’re targeting the 6th District, which includes parts of Bucks County and is represented by Sen. Frank Farry (R-Bucks); the 16th District, which contains Lehigh County and is represented by Jarrett Coleman (R-Lehigh) ; the 24th District, which includes parts of Berks and Montgomery Counties and is represented by Tracy Pennycuick (R-Montgomery); and the 40th District which includes Monroe County, and is represented by Rosemary Brown (R-Monroe).
Democrats have reason to be optimistic. A number of Pennsylvania races in November’s municipal elections went their way. And a special election in a strongly Republican congressional district in Tennessee on Tuesday night has shown that momentum for the party remains strong.

The district swung from one that voted for Trump by a 22 point margin in 2024, to electing a Republican by only 9 points on Tuesday.
That’s a 13 point shift. All of the Senate Districts Democrats are targeting in 2026 voted for Trump by a smaller margin in 2024, according to data shared by Crampsie.
Republicans, however, see a chance in the 36th District to retake a seat and cement their majority.
“The biggest difference from the 2025 special to the 2026 election is voters will actually know who James Malone is now,” said Michael Straw, the communications director with the Pennsylvania Senate Republican Campaign Committee (SRCC). “They’ll be well-informed about his voting record that has harmed small businesses and doesn’t represent the voters of the 36th Senate district.”
Straw added that Democrats’ recent victories have all come in off-year elections, where turnout is typically low. Only 29% of eligible voters participated in the March special election, relative to the near-80% who voted in the 2024 presidential election, an environment which Republicans believed favored Trump.
But, Republicans aren’t relying on turnout alone.
James Markley, the communications director for the Pennsylvania GOP, began his job on the day of Malone’s special election victory in March.
“It was a whirlwind,” he said and laughed.
Asked how Republicans plan to combat Democrats’ electoral gains since the 2024 election, he said they plan to pull a page from Democrats’ playbook, nodding to their recent victory in the statewide Supreme Court retention elections, which saw voters elected to retain a liberal majority on the bench.
“We saw what happened this November on election day, and we’re gonna be working extremely hard to do what we can to cut into the margins, to do a much better job facilitating and using mail-in ballots,” Markley said.
But, embracing mail-in ballots may mean Pennsylvania Republicans will be fighting against the leader of their national party, President Donald Trump.
“I am going to lead a movement to get rid of MAIL-IN BALLOTS,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, the social media site that he owns, in August. Trump has long opposed mail-in voting and claimed, without evidence, that the practice is rife with fraud.
Still, Markley is optimistic, especially looking at voter registration trends across the commonwealth. While Democrats have maintained higher numbers of registered voters in Pennsylvania for decades, Republicans are starting to catch up.
“The biggest Republican victory in my lifetime in Pennsylvania was 2024,” Markley said. “There’s gonna be some pushback and there’s gonna be some victories for the other side in the next few years. We’re definitely seeing that, but I think Republicans are doing a great job pushing back everywhere they can. If you look at the registration numbers, they’re trending Republicans’ way.”
Another source of confidence for Malone’s team is the sustained popularity of Gov. Josh Shapiro, who will be on the ballot in 2026. Shapiro won his gubernatorial election by a roughly 15 point spread in 2022 against pro-MAGA candidate Doug Mastriano. And his approval rating remains relatively high.
Despite Shapiro eking out a victory in the district, in 2024, voters overwhelmingly chose Trump to be the next president.
Sexton hopes to use Shapiro’s popularity to Malone’s advantage, saying they plan to run “along with the governor.”
“We have good relationships there to do so,” she added. “Plus, we now have the benefit of incumbency.”
A spokesperson for Shapiro’s own reelection campaign did not respond to questions from the Capital-Star about what that might entail, or how Shapiro plans to get involved. In 2024, however, Shapiro was a visible surrogate for both the Biden and Harris presidential campaigns. His PAC also backed all Democratic row office candidates, save one who opposed Shapiro’s vice presidential ambitions.
However, Shapiro faced a far-right and conspiracy-prone candidate, Doug Mastriano, in 2022, who lost by a 15% margin. Now, the leader in the Republican primary race to unseat him is Stacy Garrity, who won reelection as treasurer in 2024 by a larger margin than any statewide candidate.
“A unique individual”
Stella Sexton, Malone’s campaign manager and vice chair of the Lancaster County Democratic Committee, called Malone “a unique individual, who is really the perfect person to have won and to hold this seat.”
She cited his eight years as mayor in East Peterson, a position he wasn’t paid for, and his upbringing in Wyoming.
“He’s not a typical politician,” she said. “He’s from Wyoming and grew up hunting and fishing for subsistence. He knows how to farm. He knows the building trades and put himself through school as a roofer. This is a guy who knows the value of hard work and can relate to people. And people sense that and feel that.”
Sexton said their campaign will focus on issues close to home: affordability, rising housing costs, school funding and supporting first responders.

“People are very concerned about the cost of living,” she said. “People want to be able to live and work in areas where they feel like they have a good home, and they have a good school district to send their kids to. We hear that a lot.”
Malone, who has a background in software development, has also been working in Harrisburg on issues related to artificial intelligence safety. He authored an amendment to a bill regulating sexually explicit deepfake images of children, known as CSAM. He was motivated by an issue in a Lancaster County school where sexually explicit images of students were created with AI and shared without consent. The bill would require teachers and other authority figures to notify investigators when made aware of such images. It passed the Senate unanimously last month.
Malone’s victory in March was something like a proof of concept for the upcoming elections. With Trump’s popularity dwindling since entering office, Democrats believe they can win in unlikely places. Holding the seat, however, in an election year that is likely to have much higher turnout, may be the real test.
Though Sexton sees November’s municipal elections as proof that they can hold on. Manheim Township’s board of commissioners, for instance, is now controlled by Democrats.
“I think we did such a good job of talking about how that was a Trump 15+ District, which it was in 2024, that some folks think, ‘Oh my gosh. How are we gonna win that?’” Sexton said. 
But she pointed to Democrats’ victory in the district, with voters supporting the retention of Democratic judges on the Supreme Court.
“We’re seeing some increasing purpling here,” Sexton said. “One of the reasons for that, I think, is that the people in the district — both our candidates and our voters — were energized by [Malone’s] win, and saw a path for themselves, and really worked hard.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Malone-reelection-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-03 18:59:47.754969

Zach Nunn has expressed support for a bipartisan deal to extend federal health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, Iowa’s other U.S. representatives said they are looking at other ways to pursue lower health care costs.
Enhanced ACA tax credits, introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic and extended through the Inflation Reduction Act under President Joe Biden, are set to expire at the end of 2025. This lapse is expected to cause health care premiums to rise — and potentially double — for people receiving health coverage through ACA-established Health Insurance Marketplaces.
Extending these tax credits was the main issue Senate Democrats sought to address through the 43-day federal government shutdown. The government reopened with no action taken on ACA enhanced tax credits — though Senate Majority Leader John Thune agreed to hold a vote on the subject in December as part of the agreement to end the shutdown.

While a vote on ACA subsidies is expected in the Senate, no such agreement has been reached in the U.S. House — and talks appeared to have stalled with President Donald Trump’s administration on moving forward with a measure to extend these tax credits for a limited period of time.
While House GOP leadership has not moved forward with any commitments to address the issue, certain U.S. House Republicans — including Nunn, representing Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District — have proposed legislation to address the issue. Nunn cosponsored a bill called the “Fix It Act” on Nov. 25, a bipartisan measure that would extend the ACA premium tax credits by two years while also implementing new income limits and creating new penalties aimed at eliminating fraud in the system.
Nunn said in a statement provided to the Des Moines Register the bill was “the kind of bipartisan fix we need for short-term stability so that we can negotiate long-term reform.”
Katie Smith, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said in a statement that Nunn has changed his stance on ACA tax credits because he is expected to face a competitive reelection race in 2026.
“After trying to destroy it for years, Zach Nunn is waking up to the reality that his opposition to the Affordable Care Act will cost him his job next year,” Smith said in a statement. “No amount of phony rhetoric or lies will change that. The DCCC will not let so-called Republican moderates like Nunn trick voters after refusing to do a single thing to address the health care crisis they created.”
Nunn was the only member of Iowa’s all-GOP delegation to sign on to the bipartisan proposal — the three other Iowa Republicans in the U.S. House have not supported a measure to temporarily extend ACA tax credits.
U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, who is also predicted to have a close race in the 2026 election season, said in a statement she supports lowering health care costs but the ACA enhanced premium tax credits are not the best way to address rising costs. Miller-Meeks, a physician, characterized the tax credits as a “corporate welfare bailout to the health insurance companies done by the Democrats in 2021” at a November town hall.
“The enhanced premium tax credits subsidize profitable insurance companies, but doesn’t lower premiums,” Miller-Meeks said in a statement. “I will continue to work with leadership and the administration to bring down health care costs for EVERYONE, not just a select few or profitable insurance companies.”
Miller-Meeks and Nunn are the two incumbent candidates running for Iowa’s U.S. House seats in 2026. U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson is running for the state’s U.S. Senate seat and U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra is running for governor in the upcoming election.
A spokesperson for Hinson said the congresswoman backs efforts to address health care inflation, but is more supportive of ideas on shifting funding to a Health Savings Accounts (HSA) model that directs money to individuals rather than health insurance companies.
“Health care is too expensive, no one should go broke trying to keep their family healthy,” Hinson said in a statement. “We should ensure working families — not just big health insurance companies — can directly access dollars meant for their health care needs and that no one can get away with profiting off seniors and sick Americans with sky high prescription drug costs. I will continue working on bipartisan solutions and reforms that lower premiums, improve access to care, and bring down the cost of prescription drugs.”
Feenstra also said in a statement he supports lowering health care premiums, but did not say if he backed any specific proposals that could come before Congress.
“As a former volunteer EMT for 15 years in my hometown of Hull, I want all Iowans to have access to high-quality, affordable healthcare,” Feenstra said. “The reality is that too many Iowa families, farmers, seniors, and small businesses can’t afford health insurance and prescription medications. That’s unacceptable. It’s why I’m focused on lowering healthcare premiums, increasing access to affordable insurance, and protecting our rural hospitals. We must do everything possible to lower healthcare costs and ensure that Iowans can receive the care and treatment they need and deserve.”
At a gubernatorial campaign event in November, Feenstra told reporters he and other members of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee were considering multiple proposals aimed at lowering premiums, including efforts that would “directly give money to the small business, or give directly money to the family, to lower that premium cost.”

(Photo by Michele Jokinen/House Public Information Services)The Minnesota Department of Human Services has issued a two-year moratorium on licensing for Home and Community-Based Services, a Medicaid program that helps people with disabilities receive care in their home or a community, such as group homes, instead of in nursing homes or hospitals.
DHS will stop issuing new licenses and cancel existing applications starting in January, according to a letter from the agency’s Temporary Commissioner Shireen Gandhi to lawmakers dated Monday. The Legislature passed a law this year allowing DHS to pause licensing if it finds that new applications are growing beyond program needs.
There are currently 2,549 active licenses and 2,314 pending applications as of mid-November, according to the letter. Compared to 2015-2019, the past five years have seen an increase in disability waiver recipients, i.e., people who need services, of 25%, much smaller than the 55% increase in the average annual number of licenses and 283% increase in new applications for licenses. Gandhi said DHS compared the growth in provider licenses to the growth in people seeking services to conclude that it should no longer accept new applications.
Still, providers warned that the decision will harm the disability community. A statement from the Association of Residential Resources in Minnesota, which represents disability service providers, said they were only notified Tuesday, and that the “sweeping, system-altering policy” decision was made “in complete secrecy.”
Josh Berg, a service director at Accessible Space, an assisted independent living provider, said that the decision to stop licensing new providers is “a really clear example of [DHS] saying that they don’t have things under control.”
ARRM, in the statement, said that home and community care providers have been blindsided by DHS twice in just over a month now: Once when the governor’s office and DHS released an audit program with a press release that left providers confused and panicked, and again with the licensing moratorium this week.
DHS appears to be tightening controls in the same programs. For example, the moratorium will affect Integrated Community Supports, a program that DHS has already been pausing payments for and investigating.
Fraud in Minnesota’s human services has become a high-profile political issue, recently drawing attention from President Donald Trump after the publication of an article claiming — with little evidence — that Somali-American immigrants accused of defrauding Minnesota’s public programs are sending the money to the terrorist group al-Shaabab. Trump’s administration is now planning to launch an “intensive immigration enforcement operation” targeting the Somali-American community in Minnesota.
Following federal charges against dozens of people alleging they defrauded a child nutrition program, an autism treatment program and Housing Stabilization Services, DHS moved to address fraud in other services, turning its attention to ICS starting in September and 13 other programs starting in December.
Berg said that he understands why DHS would pause licensing for programs they “can’t oversee effectively,” but was upset at the decision to retroactively cancel existing applications.
“There’s gonna be some providers that have bought properties that have been teeing up to be able to start services once they get their license approved that are now stuck,” Berg said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/shireen_gandhi-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-12-03 18:59:47.754969

Jimmie “Chris” Duncan walked out of the Ouachita Parish Correctional Center and into the arms of his parents last week after spending the past 27 years on death row.
Seven months ago, a Louisiana district court judge vacated his murder conviction for killing his former girlfriend’s toddler, citing doubts about the evidence used to convict him. The judge granted bail after multiple legal delays, including an unsuccessful request by prosecutors to the Louisiana Supreme Court to stop his release. Now free, Duncan spent Thanksgiving with his family — then celebrated his 57th birthday the next day.
“We thank God for Jimmie coming home,” Duncan’s stepmom, Sharon Duncan, said in an emailed statement on behalf of the family.
But Duncan’s journey to freedom is far from over. Prosecutors have asked the state Supreme Court to reinstate his death sentence. Duncan’s attorneys declined to make him immediately available for an interview.

The April decision by Judge Alvin Sharp to set aside Duncan’s conviction and death sentence came after a Verite News and ProPublica investigation examined the reliability of the key forensic evidence used to convict him. At the time, Duncan faced the possibility of being put to death as Gov. Jeff Landry, a staunch death penalty advocate, made moves to expedite executions after a 15-year pause.
Sharp, of the 4th Judicial District in Ouachita Parish, found that Duncan’s conviction was based in part on bite mark evidence now considered by experts to be junk science. That original analysis came from forensic dentist Michael West and pathologist Dr. Steven Hayne, whose longtime partnership as state experts has been questioned following concerns about the validity of their techniques. West, who did not respond to previous requests for comment, admitted in a 2011 deposition in another case that he no longer believed in bite mark analysis. Hayne died in 2020.
Over the past 27 years, nine prisoners have been set free after being convicted in part on inaccurate evidence given by West and Hayne. Three of those men were on death row. Duncan was the last person awaiting an execution based on the pair’s work.
Robert Tew, district attorney for Ouachita and Morehouse parishes, insisted in his appeal that the evidence prosecutors presented is sound, that Duncan raped and murdered 23-month-old Haley Oliveaux, and that he should be executed without delay. Tew’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Duncan’s release.
Police arrested Duncan on Dec. 18, 1993. He was babysitting Haley that day in the home he shared with the girl’s mother in West Monroe. Duncan told law enforcement he had put the toddler in the bath before going downstairs to wash dishes. When he heard a noise coming from the bathroom, he rushed upstairs to check on her and found Haley floating face down in the water. She was pronounced dead a few hours later.
Duncan was initially arrested for negligent homicide, until Hayne and West conducted Haley’s medical exam and claimed they discovered evidence she had been sexually assaulted and intentionally drowned. Hayne said he found bite marks on the girl’s body,  which West then examined, claiming to find that they were a match for Duncan’s teeth.
Based in part on those findings, prosecutors upped the charge against Duncan to first-degree murder. After about two weeks of testimony in 1998, the jury found Duncan guilty and sentenced him to death. He would spend the next quarter-century in a cell on death row at Angola.
During that time, however, his attorneys with the Innocence Project in New York, the Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner firm in Atlanta, and the Mwalimu Center for Justice in New Orleans uncovered a trove of evidence that eventually led to his conviction being vacated in April.
The most damning of that new evidence calls into question whether the bite marks Hayne said he found on Haley’s body were manufactured. In a video of West’s 1993 examination of Haley, which was not shown to jurors at the trial, the dentist can be seen taking a mold of Duncan’s teeth and grinding it into the girl’s body. (West has previously said he was simply using what he called a “direct comparison” technique — in which he presses a mold of a person’s teeth directly onto the location of suspected bite marks.)
In his ruling vacating Duncan’s conviction, Sharp said the work Hayne and West did on Duncan’s case was “no longer valid” and “not scientifically defensible.”
Additional evidence that undermined Duncan’s conviction included testimony from an expert witness who said that the child’s death was the result not of a homicide but of an accidental drowning. And investigators working for Duncan’s legal team spoke to a jailhouse informant who recanted his earlier trial testimony that Duncan confessed to the crime.
Haley’s mother, Allison Layton Statham, has come to support Duncan’s release, telling Mississippi Today in a July interview that she believes Duncan “was falsely accused of a crime he didn’t commit.”
As the higher court weighs the state’s appeal, Sharp, who had already ruled that Duncan was factually innocent of the crime, granted him bail on Nov. 21, setting it at $150,000. In his decision, Sharp said that the “presumption is not great” that Duncan is guilty and proof against him is “not evident.” The state fought the release but lost in court, setting the stage for Duncan to be freed the day before Thanksgiving.
“When Chris got out and I went to hug him, I was very emotional,” said attorney Ann Ferebee, a member of Duncan’s legal team for the last decade who greeted him shortly after his release. “I was kind of choked up, and he asked me, ‘Are you doing OK?’
“‘Really good to see you,’ is what I told him.”


Let us know what you think...


 

Following his release, Duncan went to live with a family member in central Louisiana. Christian Bromley, another attorney of Duncan’s, said he expects oral arguments in the state’s appeal to take place before the state Supreme Court in early 2026. Should prosecutors lose that round, they could take the matter to the U.S. Supreme Court, retry Duncan on the same charges or retry him a new set of charges, Bromley said.
Or they could drop the charges altogether. But that seems unlikely, he said.
“We met Chris almost 10 years ago and have believed in his innocence, just like he has, that entire time,” Bromley said. “I think it is something that we always hoped for but knew that it was potentially an insurmountable feat to get there.”
Until this year, Louisiana had not carried out an execution since 2010 as it has been unable to procure the necessary drugs. But following Landry’s election, the state approved the use of nitrogen gas, a controversial method allowed in only three other states.
That led to the March 18 execution of Jesse Hoffman Jr. Saving Duncan from a similar fate has been “the most rewarding experience of my career,” said Ferebee, though she acknowledged that prosecutors are still pushing for the execution of Duncan. “We are celebrating this victory, but we know that there’s still more to come.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Duncan-Barnes-for-IP_maxHeight_3000_maxWidth_3000.jpg-1024x683.webp,,,2025-12-03 18:59:47.754969

Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall’s troubles with a potential scandal over Detroit Lions tickets he received from a lobbying firm have been resolved, as the attorney who made a formal complaint rescinded his request for the state to investigate the matter.
Bob LaBrant, the former general counsel for the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, filed a complaint Monday in reaction to news that Hall, of Richland Township, had received tickets to a Nov. 2 Lions home game from Bill Wort of Public Affairs Associates.
Both Hall and Wortz said the speaker paid for the tickets, but neither provided a copy of the reimbursement check when asked. That led to questions on whether Hall paid Wortz or the firm, and if the reimbursement occurred before or after Hall obtained the tickets.
Now, LaBrant appears satisfied after seeing a copy of the check. In a statement to Michigan Advance, Hall said the story was “manufactured” to attack him “from the beginning.” The story was originally reported by The Detroit News, who Hall took a jab at in his statement to the Advance.
“I won’t hold my breath waiting for a correction or an apology,” Hall added.
If Hall had obtained the tickets before paying the full market value price, Wortz could have been found to be in violation of a section of lobbying law that LaBrant helped institute. LaBrant worried the issue would go ignored if he didn’t file a formal complaint compelling Wortz to show that he had proof that the tickets were paid for and in line with applicable law.

Wortz told Michigan Advance on Wednesday that he had that proof and was willing to show the state, as well as LaBrant, who indicated on Monday that if he saw the check and that Wortz had complied with the law, he would ultimately drop his complaint.
LaBrant and Wortz separately contacted the Advance to let a reporter know that the complaint has been withdrawn.
Although the complaint has been resolved, LaBrant told the Advance that he doesn’t know why Hall and Wortz were so reluctant to initially share the details when asked by reporters. Still, he was happy to see that the law was being followed in the Hall matter.
“I’ve labored in the vineyards on reimbursements of ticket gifts for some time now, and as a result, I didn’t want to see this either be ignored with the new administrative rules on gift reimbursement, and have this all turn into some sort of dead letter,” LaBrant said. “So that was my incentive to file the complaint.”
LaBrant was also puzzled why Hall, who has fashioned himself as a House speaker deeply preoccupied with transparency and ethics reforms, would take tickets from a lobbyist, especially given the corruption scandals that have plagued previous speakers in Lee Chatfield, Jason Wentworth and Rick Johnson.
“Why risk unfavorable press on something like this?” LaBrant asked.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6343-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-03 18:59:47.754969

Kyle Walker won’t seek reelection next year, making him another opponent of the proposed GOP-redraw of Indiana’s congressional maps who will be leaving the Legislature.
Walker announced Wednesday that he would complete his Senate term through the November 2026 election.
Walker’s Senate District 31 is one of the state’s few politically close Senate districts, covering the northeastern corner of Indianapolis and the Fishers area in Hamilton County. He won the 2022 election with 55% of the vote.
Walker’s statement did not mention the congressional redistricting that’s been demanded by President Donald Trump, who has berated several Republican state senators who’ve come out against the redraw.
“I remain fully committed to serving with the same focus and energy for the remainder of my term, and to ensuring a smooth transition for the district’s future leadership,” Walker said in his statement. “But I also want to make this announcement now, in advance of the February filing deadline, so that potential candidates have some time to consider their interest and ability to serve this district.”
Walker is among about a dozen Republican senators to publicly oppose redistricting. Their opposition leaves the fate of the redistricting push uncertain even though Republicans currently hold 40 of the 50 Senate seats as about a dozen GOP senators have not yet revealed their stance.
Walker joins Sens. Eric Bassler of Washington and Greg Walker of Columbus as Republican redistricting foes who won’t seek reelection in 2026.
Kyle Walker announced his redistricting opposition last month despite his close ties with a leader of a pro-redistricting group and being a member of the 24-person Indiana Republican Party State Committee as the party’s 7th Congressional District vice chair.
“I’ve spent the past several months listening closely to my constituents on mid-decade redistricting,” Walker said at the time. “With 93 percent opposed, and as their voice in the Indiana Senate, I’ll be voting no.”
A Walker spokesman told the Indiana Capital Chronicle that Walker has resigned from his position as executive vice president of MO Strategies, a political consulting firm where he worked for several years that is led by Marty Obst.
Obst is the chair of Fair Maps Indiana, a nonprofit group that launched a six-figure advertising effort targeting undecided Republican senators pushing for their support of redistricting. Obst served in senior leadership roles in Trump’s 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns and was a senior political adviser to former Vice President Mike Pence.
Walker alluded to the job change in his statement Wednesday without giving any details.
“As some of my colleagues, friends and family know, this is a decision I’ve wrestled with for several months,” his statement said. “I am forever grateful for having the opportunity to represent the people of our district. This, however, is a season of change for me. Looking forward, I have also decided to start a new chapter in my professional career.”
Walker campaign spokesman Luke Thomas said Walker planned to continue as a state Republican committee member.
“He and Marty are great friends, and he’ll continue working with him and the team long enough to ensure a smooth and successful transition,” Thomas said.
Walker’s announcement cited key accomplishments from his Senate tenure, including a change the state’s local income tax distribution formula to ensure the city of Fishers receives a more equitable share of local income tax revenue. He also created a Sports and Tourism Bid Fund to help communities across Indiana access resources to host major events to stimulate local economic growth.

,DC,2025-12-03 22:58:16+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"High tensions around law enforcement, ICE tactics on display in heated US House hearing",Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/high-tensions-around-law-enforcement-ice-tactics-display-heated-us-house-hearing,,"Members of the U.S. House Homeland Security Committee decried violence against law enforcement, but seemed to make little headway in identifying how to address the issue during a Wednesday hearing that often saw each party harshly blame the other.Chairman Andrew Garbarino of New York, at his first hearing since taking over as for the retired Mark Green of Tennessee, sought to strike an even tone in an opening statement, condemning violence against police while noting that officers have a responsibility to maintain the public’s trust.“Law enforcement personnel are public servants, not public figures. They stepped forward to safeguard our nation and uphold the laws enacted by this body,” Garbarino said. “But that alone does not absolve them from facing any form of accountability. Public trust and public safety go hand in hand.” Other members of the panel, though, were less even-handed, with Democrats strongly criticizing some tactics used by federal law enforcement officers under President Donald Trump and Republicans denouncing such criticism as fueling violence against police.Several members of the panel, of both parties, acknowledged the two West Virginia National Guard members shot in a Nov. 26 alleged ambush in Washington, D.C.Police witnesses denounce Nazi comparisonsWitnesses from three police organizations, the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Sheriffs’ Association and the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, largely agreed that heightened rhetoric about law enforcement activity was a danger to their members.“The rhetoric coming from the top, calling officers Nazis and Gestapo, it better stop right now,” Jonathan Thompson, the executive director of the National Sheriffs’ Association, said. “You are inflaming dangerous circumstances. You're attacking people that wake up every single day and do one thing: they put on their uniforms, they put on their star and… enforce the laws of this country.”Daniel Hodges, a D.C. Metropolitan Police officer who responded to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack and who Democrats invited to testify to the panel as a private citizen Wednesday, said protocol of federal officers under Trump invited the comparison.“There is a semi-secret police force abducting people based on the color of their skin and sending many of them via state-sponsored human trafficking to extraterritorial concentration camps,” he said. “Before we go around the room clutching our pearls, wondering how people could possibly compare law enforcement in this country to the Gestapo, maybe we should take a moment and ask ourselves if there isn't some recent behavior on the government's part that could encourage such juxtaposition,” Hodges said.Patrick Yoes, the national president of the Fraternal Order of Police, said violence against officers was a nonpartisan issue.“My members are both Democrat and Republican,” he said. “And we’re all having the same problem.”ICE under microscopeSeveral Democrats said the tactics used by officers of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, undermined their law enforcement mission and endangered them, while Republicans blamed that rhetoric for making police targets.New York Democrat Daniel Goldman, a former federal prosecutor, objected to Thompson’s testimony that police officers “put on their uniforms.”“The problem is that's not the case,” Goldman said. “They don't put on a uniform, they don't wear identification, and they go out with masks on to — violently in many cases — arrest unsuspecting immigrants, non-violent, many of whom are actually here legally.”Goldman said as a federal prosecutor he worked with DHS officers “who represented the very, very best of our country.” But under Trump, the department’s behavior had grown irresponsible, he said.Illinois Democrat Delia Ramirez went further, calling DHS “the single biggest threat to public safety right now.”“They use anonymity to terrorize our communities and to violate our rights,” she said. “They reject accountability. They disregard court orders and they violate consent decrees. Bottom line: DHS agents lie. They act with impunity. They reject checks and balances, and they ignore Congress and the courts.”GOP defends DHSRepublicans on the panel deflected blame from DHS and drew a direct line from the rhetoric of some Democrats opposed to ICE’s tactics to physical attacks on law enforcement.Tennessee Republican Andy Ogles said Ramirez’s comment “pisses me off” and characterized DHS agents as carrying out the rule of law.“This is about the rhetoric against law enforcement, violence against law enforcement,” Ogles said. “This isn't about ICE. This isn't about deportations, or the (Homeland Security) secretary doing her job, securing the border and deporting those who are here illegally.”Rep. Eli Crane, an Arizona Republican, played a video showing Rep LaMonica McIver, a New Jersey Democrat who also sits on the panel, confronting ICE agents at a detention facility in her district.“What do you think it means to people that are out there watching and listening, watching social media, watching the news, and they see a member of Congress who sits on this committee go out there and behave like that?” Crane asked the witnesses.Thompson answered he was “appalled.”“Quite honestly, I find it reprehensible, and it’s obviously dangerous,” he said.McIver said she had been doing her job to provide oversight.Jan. 6 pardons at issueDemocrats also cited Trump’s pardons of people convicted of crimes as part of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol as condoning violence against law enforcement.McIver suggested committee Republicans were hypocritical in condemning some anti-police rhetoric while staying silent or praising Trump’s decision to pardon Jan.6 rioters.“It is not Democrats who are praising, let alone pardoning, people who stormed this very Capitol complex to beat police officers and hunt down elected officials,” she said.",,,,2025-12-03 17:58:39.254713

State Rep. Andrea Romero (D-Santa Fe) and Sen. Heather Berghmans (D-Albuquerque) at a news conference Wednesday afternoon said they were alarmed by the findings of a new analysis of federal data on firearm trafficking. The report — published by Everytown for Gun Safety, a national organization that advocates for stricter gun laws — found that three out of four guns found at New Mexico crime scenes were originally sold by a firearm dealer.
The report, titled “The Supply Side of Violence: How Gun Dealers Fuel Firearm Trafficking,” urged legislative action to hold retailers to account for selling weapons that are later trafficked and used in crimes. Across New Mexico, in particular, it appears that most weapons recovered at crime scenes were trafficked, the report says. In nearly 90% of cases, someone other than the original purchaser possessed the gun used in a crime, an indication of a “straw purchasing,” in which someone legally buys a weapon and then sells it to someone who cannot legally purchase a gun or doesn’t want their name tied to the transaction.
The report ranked New Mexico fifth in the nation for most “crime guns” recovered per 100,000 people and fifth for the highest rate of firearm homicides.
Romero and Berghmans said they plan to introduce legislation in January that will place greater training and licensing requirements on gun dealers, similar to the requirements that barbers, cannabis proprietors and bartenders must undergo.
“We really want to focus on the adoption of security measures for these dealers, accurate tracking of their inventory, training for their employees,” Berghmans said. “We have regulations in the state of New Mexico that require a waitress or waiter to get a server’s license before they can serve alcohol so they can recognize people who maybe should not be served…we want firearms dealers to have the same type of training and the same type of licensing.”
Berghmans added that they want to “refrain from the selling of military-grade weaponry that could be used in the wrong hands.”
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in 2023 called on state lawmakers to pass a ban on assault rifles and heavier weaponry like .50 caliber rifles. Romero co-sponsored the 2023 bill to prohibit assault rifles, which ultimately failed. The following year, Lujan Grisham in her State of the State address called firearm legislation “the most important work” facing state lawmakers and announced a “gun safety package” that would have banned assault weapons and raised the legal age to purchase a firearm to 21. Most recently, Romero sponsored a failed bill that would have banned gas-operated semi-automatic firearms, magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds and devices that can effectively convert semi-automatic weapons into fully automatic weapons.
The recent Everytown for Gun Safety report found that the overwhelming majority of “crime guns” in New Mexico were pistols, though it noted that rifles made up a larger share of guns used in crimes in New Mexico compared to other states. 
Proposed laws in the upcoming 30-day legislative session are limited to budgetary matters and issues placed on the governor’s agenda. Romero and Berghmans said they have asked Lujan Grisham’s office to include this issue on her agenda.
“This is an epidemic of gun violence,” Romero said. She likened the legislative plan to that of combatting the national opioid crisis. Lawmakers and attorneys general across the U.S. went after pharmaceutical companies, which resulted in settlement payouts for thousands of local governments. “We know that the source — the seller of these guns — needs to be held accountable.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/abqguns-e1764796732207.jpg,,,2025-12-03 17:58:39.254713

Underhill elects to stay in the dark, axing plan to light up ski trail: “The lights are BLINDING,” one resident says

Tomasi Meadow, a wide field at the base of Mount Mansfield, is beloved by Underhill residents.  It’s so popular that in October, the Mansfield Nordic Club, a ski group that voluntarily grooms  the trails, asked: Why not make it better by adding lights that could extend the hours along the trail two evenings a week? 
Not so fast. Dozens of people turned up at an October town meeting about the lights and even more spoke out on Underhill’s Front Porch Forum, according to messages forwarded to VTDigger. Commenters brought up issues of light pollution, potential energy costs — even though the lights were donated and ran off a generator — and whether the lights would attract more people, increasing upkeep. 
Robin Farrell, a resident near Tomasi Meadow said she and her husband adamantly opposed the lights. “The lights are BLINDING,” Farrell wrote on Front Porch Forum. She called the impact “extreme and unnecessary.” 
“We are against them for many reasons – wildlife, impact on our peace, the message to the people who don’t ski that the field belongs to others, light pollution,” she wrote. 
After the backlash, the plan to light up the meadow was abruptly extinguished Wednesday. The issue highlights a fact of life in small Vermont towns: Change is not always met with open arms, especially when it comes to land use. In a state that prides itself on conservation, issues of development, like solar or housing, are often contentious.
Had the plan gone through, it would have brought 20 floodlights, donated by a ski club member, covering about a quarter of the public property owned by the Jericho Underhill Land Trust. The selectboard planned to offer a preview of the lights on Thursday evening for the town, and to take public comment a week later. There was no cost to the town, according to Bob Stone, chair of the Underhill Selectboard.
“Traditionally that field has been dark,” Stone said. “So this is a change. It’s never been done before. That’s really the heart of the matter.”
About 24 hours after VTDigger reached out to local leaders involved in the decision process, and after weeks of pushback in selectboard meetings and on message boards like Front Porch Forum, the Mansfield Nordic Club decided to step away from the night lights.
“We met a surprising amount of negative pushback and it does not seem that the community is open to a trial run of lighted community trails,” Jenn Carlson, president of the Mansfield Nordic Club, said in an email Wednesday morning. 
The change happened so quickly that Stone said he was unaware of the group’s withdrawal. 
“You’re telling me something for the first time,” Stone told a VTDigger reporter.
The day before, Adam Terko, executive director and head coach of the Mansfield Nordic Club, said the lights were exciting for their club.
“Daylight is sparse in Northern VT in the wintertime, and having lights at Tomasi Meadow would expand and extend recreation options while also increasing safety,” Terko said in an email. “I feel it is a relatively low-impact way to have a positive impact on the community.”
The club’s quick switch was in response to public opinion. The lighting itself was fairly straightforward: Light was an allowable use for the meadow, and no town permits were required because of the temporary nature of the lights, according to Anton Kelsey, chair of the town’s recreation committee who spoke during an October selectboard meeting. The lights would be on Tuesdays and Thursdays; they would be turned off by 7 p.m. They were also free, according to Stone. 
“It’s zero cost to the taxpayer or the town,” said Stone, who added he was initially against the lights. But he wanted to stay open minded, so he opened up the proposal to public comment. 
One resident brought up the potential concern of PFAS, also known as forever chemicals, in ski waxes, making their way into the local water supply. The potential pollutants brought into question whether the meadow be used for skiing at all, they asked. Another resident argued that darkness increased the solemnity of night skiing. 
Kelsey said in an email that the reason the proposal was removed was that “the groups involved felt the negative energy and support around the project was not worth the benefits involved.” 
“How we use common land is an important discussion,” Kelsey said. But in a draft message he prepared for Front Porch Forum, he asked his community members to stick to the facts. He added that ski wax used in Vermont should not contain fluorocarbons, a PFAS substance that was banned in the state in 2023. 
For now, the field will continue to be used for skiing, sledding and other winter activities by the light of the sun and the moon. Or as Carlson said in an email: “Back to headlamps for everyone!”

(Provided by SC Parks, Recreation and Tourism)COLUMBIA — The state parks department is asking legislators for nearly $186 million to fund sprawling upgrades and renovations in what the agency’s director described as “a generational move.”
The request is the largest in agency history, agency director Duane Parrish said Wednesday.
With it, the parks department could upgrade its campgrounds, buy new furniture for lodges, improve trail systems and build welcome centers for upcoming parks, among other projects, he said.
“People will look back 40, 50 years from now and say, ‘I’m really glad we did this,’” Parrish told the SC Daily Gazette.
The parks department’s ask, which it listed as its top priority for the year, would sum up more routine requests for maintenance, upgrades and new projects, Parrish said. Instead of coming to legislators for each project separately, that would allow the agency to get started on renovations statewide.
In recent years, construction costs have risen so quickly that projects broke their initial budgets before even making it to the end of the state’s lengthy approval process, said agency lobbyist Emily Frierson. The agency is also asking legislators to help speed up those approvals, according to the budget request.
“These projects have just skyrocketed with inflation, and then we have to go back to the Legislature two years after that” to ask for more money to finish the same project, Frierson said.
An overhaul of the sort the agency is requesting could allow the department to keep up with increasing demand for years to come, while also drawing in more visitors and more revenue, Parrish said. Although taxpayer money funds major projects at state parks, day-to-day operations are paid for through revenue the agency generates from store sales, as well as fees to get into parks and stay overnight.

The state’s parks are “some of the most natural and beautiful places we have throughout the state for the public to see and enjoy,” Parrish said.
Since he started leading the agency in 2011, more people than ever want to see those places, he said.
The COVID-19 pandemic sent more people outside, causing a boom in the popularity of hiking, biking, boating and other outdoor activities. Local, state and national parks, including South Carolina’s Congaree National Park, all reported record numbers of visitors in the ensuing years.
“Looking back, it wasn’t just a fad,” Parrish said. “It stuck, and outdoor recreation is at an all-time high.”
Combine that with a growing state population, and the parks department has seen “the wear and tear of 10 to 12 million people a year going through the parks,” Parrish said.
The park system doesn’t track exact visitor numbers, but a rough estimate would put the number of visitors a decade ago at around 6 or 7 million each year, he said.
Roads, water systems and lodges where campers can stay overnight need upgrades or repairs, Parrish said. Nearly $7.5 million of the requested cost would go toward those sorts of repairs, according to the agency budget request.
The biggest part of the request, just over $96 million, would help built visitor centers at six upcoming state parks expected to open over the next five years, along with installing and updating water and sewer systems and laying cables for internet access at new and existing parks, Parrish said.
Another $59 million would upgrade cabins, campgrounds, shops and golf courses. That could mean updating old furniture in the state’s cabins, renovating the interiors of park stores and upgrading RV hookups to supply more power, Parrish said.
Most of the state’s RV hookups don’t provide enough energy to run a dishwasher, which is a modern standard. That keeps some people from staying overnight, Parrish said. Other campgrounds lack sewer systems, another inconvenience for visitors.
The funding could also pay for new and improved trails and more parking lots, Parrish said.
SC parks department seeks $18M to open 4 new state parks

At some parks, guests have to reserve a parking spot before visiting because the demand is so high. At Jones Gap State Park in Greenville County, all 50 or so reserved parking spots might fill up before 9 a.m. during the fall season, when people flock to see the leaves turn colors in the mountains, Parrish said.
The department owns a stretch of land across the highway from the park where it could build a new parking lot, but it would need money for paving and to create a trail from the park to the new lot, he said.
“I think there’s an opportunity for us to take this money, maximize the usage of it and modernize state parks to the point where we have one of the finest modern state parks in the country,” Parrish said.
The final $23 million of the request would go toward restoring and preserving structures built as part of the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression. President Franklin Roosevelt created the program in 1933 in an effort to kickstart the economy by creating jobs for tens of thousands of young men. It ended in 1942 after the United States entered World War II.
South Carolina’s approximately 49,000 corps members built structures in 16 state parks, and evidence of their work remains in still-standing lodges and cabins. The parks department has restored some, such as Gaines Lodge at Table Rock State Park, but the agency could restore other, smaller cabins to the way they looked 80 years ago, Parrish said.
Whether the department gets what it requested is another story.
Every agency must contend for a finite amount of funding, and Parrish acknowledged state parks are not usually at the front of the line.
Still, Parrish said he’s hopeful legislators will agree to fund the request, even if they do so over a number of years instead of all at once. Parrish proposed pulling from the state’s unspent surpluses to fund the request.
The state ended up collecting $411 million more than expected in the fiscal year that ended June 30, according to the state’s Board of Economic Advisors. The board’s latest revenue estimates, which include the higher-than-expected revenues and prior years’ unspent surpluses, give the Legislature an additional $2.4 billion to spend in the 2026-27 budget. Of that, $1.7 billion is meant for one-time expenses.
“I thought it was a good time to ask for that $186 million to say, ‘OK, this is a critical product for the people, the public of South Carolina,’” Parrish said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SCPRT_OutdoorAdventure_Biking_018-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-03 17:58:39.254713

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Supreme Court appeared skeptical Wednesday about a case alleging fraud in and seeking invalidation of last year’s medical cannabis petition campaign, which voters widely supported.
Former State Sen. John Kuehn of Heartwell, a longtime opponent of medical marijuana, continues to allege widespread “fraud” in the 2024 medical cannabis petitions. 
His lawsuit argues a district judge incorrectly ruled last November that the measures had enough signatures to reach the ballot despite allegations from Kuehn and two top state officials, largely based on questions about notaries.
Supporters of medical cannabis helped two measures reach the 2024 general election ballot, Initiatives 437 and 438. Some spoke during a public hearing at the University of Nebraska at Omaha on Oct. 25, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Kuehn sued Secretary of State Bob Evnen and the ballot sponsors, but Evnen and Attorney General Mike Hilgers largely joined forces with Kuehn. Together, they argued that at least enough signatures would lose a “presumption of validity” to force the trial into a second phase involving greater scrutiny of signatures.
“Notaries are, in effect, walking stamps of approval,” Zach Pohlman, state deputy solicitor general, said Wednesday. “They are professional truth tellers. And so when they lie, that presumption of truth … gets pierced, and they become just like every other witness.”
If the justices reverse, the 2024 medical cannabis ballot sponsors might need to rehabilitate enough signatures to show at least 86,499 valid signatures on two petitions apiece for the voter-approved laws to stand, or 172,998.
The campaign had 6,822 more signatures validated than it needed.
No other court in the country has adopted such a legal argument that would extend or “impute” one instance of notarial fraud to other documents that person had notarized, Daniel Gutman, attorney for the ballot sponsors, has repeatedly said.
Timing of election case
Some justices probed how a ruling would fit more than a year after the 2024 election.
“What impact does it have that the signatures have already been verified?” asked Justice Stephanie Stacy, referring to county-level verification in summer 2024, before the ballot was certified.
“We know how the election turned out. What effect does that have?” asked Justice William Cassel.

Pohlman and former State Sen. Andrew La Grone of Dunbar, for Kuehn, said the Supreme Court could still legally invalidate the petitions. La Grone noted local election officials are not handwriting experts and can’t catch everything.
“When there are bad acts related to the affidavit … the value of the verification is destroyed, and the petition must fall unless the genuineness of the signature is permanently shown,” La Grone said.
Pohlman said the state’s highest court has invalidated a notary’s actions before, citing a 1944 case about a mail-in ballot. He said some other documents have also been invalidated.
“Of that document. But other documents notarized by the notary, have we invalidated those types of situations?” asked Chief Justice Jeffrey Funke.
“Not in Nebraska, your honor,” Pohlman responded.
A new legal theory
Justice Jonathan Papik pressed whether the arguments from Pohlman and La Grone have ever been used in other states. Pohlman pointed to Oklahoma, where he said that because a notary failed to post a notary bond, 7,000 signatures the person had notarized were tossed.
Attorney Daniel Gutman, for the ballot sponsors, pointed to a case from North Dakota where the state supreme court declined a “wholesale rejection” of signatures and chose not to “impute” one bad act to other notarizations.

La Grone and Pohlman said the cases are different, in part because they’re not seeking “wholesale” invalidation, just a second trial phase. Gutman said the result is the same.
“The remedy the appellants seek in this case — which is the mass invalidation of petition signatures — is inconsistent with the high value this court places on the initiative right,” Gutman said. “It is inconsistent with the Election Act, which facilitates, not undermines, the initiative process. And it is inconsistent with common sense.”
State attorneys had previously asked the trial judge to toss the petitions without a second phase last year, a position that appears to have narrowed.
Circulators and notaries
Wednesday’s arguments largely revolve around a 1919 Nebraska Supreme Court case — Barkley v. Pool — in which the court said a circulator’s fraudulent behavior could be extended to other actions. In that case, three men against women’s suffrage forged signatures in a petition campaign seeking to force a vote to overturn a 1917 law giving women some voting rights.
One circulator for the medical cannabis petitions from Grand Island pleaded guilty last year to forging signatures, including by using a phone book. Campaign officials maintain he worked alone and agree any signatures he gathered should not be counted.

Lancaster County District Judge Susan Strong ruled last year that there were some signatures she said lost a “presumption of validity” and would need to be rehabilitated, identifying 711 signatures on the legalization petition and 826 on the regulatory petition.
However, Strong ruled that the challenges still fell “well short” of affecting access to the ballot.
Pohlman said Strong should have extended the wrongdoing she found to all other signatures the people touched, potentially tens of thousands of signatures. He said county-level verification is “some evidence on the front end” but that circulator oaths are critical.
Justice Jason Bergevin asked La Grone whether there was any evidence that electors who purportedly signed the petitions, outside of the Grand Island case, didn’t actually sign. La Grone said that’s a “very open question,” one which Kuehn wants to get to in the second trial phase.

Funke asked La Grone whether he was asking the court to transition Barkley to notaries. La Grone said the “focal point” is a circulator’s “oath,” one which requires a notary.
“We think it is merely an application of the rule to the notary context,” La Grone said.
Funke also asked whether, under Barkley, a trial judge must extend fraudulent acts to all other actions, or whether there is judicial discretion. La Grone told Funke it is “slightly unclear.” Strong ruled that, either way, the ballot sponsors would survive the Evnen-Kuehn challenge. 
Future of petition law
Gutman said the medical cannabis and women’s suffrage cases are different, and he asked the high court to consider whether the century-old case law is still good. He pointed to technological advancements and county officials now being part of the signature verification process. 
For example, only the secretary of state verified signatures in 1919, Gutman said, so Barkley relied on a circulator’s oath more as “the only evidence of the genuineness of the signature.”

“Every expansion of the scope of wrongdoing that may be imputed increases the risk of unjustly depriving an honest [signer] of the right to have his or her signature counted,” a legal brief from the ballot sponsors reads.
The AG’s Office has sought to frame the case as protecting the integrity of the ballot measure process. Pohlman said Wednesday that if the “proven fraud” in this case didn’t require a second phase of trial, “then the public’s confidence and the precious power of initiative may be shaken.”
Many medical cannabis supporters and campaign attorneys have said the opposite, arguing that continued attacks from top officials against the medical cannabis petitions and laws are more harmful. Gutman has said ballot litigation is also made “extremely difficult” when the secretary of state certifies an initiative but “tries to pull the plug at the last minute.”
A case about ‘numbers’
Gutman said the Kuehn-Evnen case is about “numbers,” specifically at least 3,464 signatures on the campaign’s petition to legalize up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis with a physician’s recommendation and at least 3,358 signatures on a petition to set a framework for regulating the new medicine. 
The legalization law received 71% support statewide, including a majority in all 49 legislative districts. The regulatory law received 67% support, including a majority in all but three legislative districts.

(Pool photo by Kenneth Ferriera/Lincoln Journal Star)
Gutman said that if the one bad notary act invalidates all others, those arguments could mean wills, real estate documents and more are “presumptively invalid right now.” Some targeted notaries have helped other petition drives in the state. La Grone said he was not asking to extend notarial wrongdoing on petitions to unrelated documents.
Of the notaries named in the Kuehn-Evnen challenges, just one — Jacy Todd of York — faces a criminal case in Grand Island. He is believed to be the first notary to face charges, with a trial set to begin Dec. 15. He is also running a 2026 GOP campaign for governor.
According to the Secretary of State’s Office, no notaries have had their notary commissions administratively canceled in 2025. According to a state-run database of notaries, all named notaries retain active notary licenses except Todd, whose commission expired July 29. 
What would a second phase look like?
Funke asked what a second phase would look like, to which Gutman said he doesn’t imagine doing anything more than local election officials.
“If we go back to a second trial, there’s nobody we can hire, nothing we can do, nothing I can say, that is better than what the election officials have already done to verify the signatures,” Gutman said.
Pohlman said a second phase would mean sponsors have to prove “by a preponderance” that they have enough signatures. He said the Supreme Court would need to require the trial move forward “as quickly as possible” and could prohibit circulator affidavits from being repaired by “self-serving testimony.”

“So does that mean they’d call 86,000 signatories to testify that the petition was read to them, they understood what they were signing and they actually signed it?” Funke asked.
“And do that quickly?” Papik added.
Pohlman said he doesn’t think the sponsors would need to call that many people, just circulators, notaries and enough voters to clear the threshold, if possible. Some of the notaries targeted in the case also served as circulators.
The 2024 campaign marked the third attempt for Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana to reach a statewide vote. In 2020, a divided Supreme Court, 5-2, said the first attempt was too broad. Papik wrote the dissent and would have let voters weigh in. In 2022, the campaign did not garner enough signatures.
Some campaign volunteers have privately worried about issue fatigue for voters or campaign workers. Some have also expressed concern about whether some circulators, notaries or voters would come forward as the state continues to pursue civil, criminal and political penalties against some medical cannabis supporters.
In a Wednesday statement, Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, which ran the 2024 campaign, said: “They cannot undo the will of the voters. Every lawsuit, every delay, every political maneuver is confirmation that we are winning.”
The Supreme Court will issue a ruling in the coming months on the case.

Fiona McFarland debating her sovereign immunity bill on April 8, 2025, in the House Judiciary Committee. (Photo via the Florida Channel)Despite overwhelming opposition from city, county, hospital, and school district lobbyists, a House spending panel Wednesday approved a bill to increase the amount of money people injured by the government can recover in negligence cases.
The House Budget Committee spent less than 15 minutes Wednesday discussing the merits of HB 145, offered by Sarasota Republican Rep. Fiona McFarland, before voting 22-2 to pass the bill.
HB 145 would increase the “sovereign immunity” limits per person from $200,000 to $500,000 and up the cap per incident from $300,000 to $1 million. The new limits would apply to claims that occur between Oct. 1, 2026, and Sept. 30, 2031. After five years, the caps would increase to $600,000 and $1.2 million, respectively.
HB 145 still must be considered by the House Judiciary Committee before it is ready for a House floor vote. Although the bill is being fast tracked in the House and is a priority for House Speaker Daniel Perez, its fate is less certain in the Florida Senate. There is no companion bill filed as of now and the Senate didn’t consider similar legislation last year.
Bob Harris with the Panhandle Area Education Consortium testified that his clients, a group of 14 school districts in northwest Florida, won’t be able to afford the insurance premium increases that, he said, would occur if the bill becomes law.
“The difficulty is this: We know if these increase in caps go in, we’ll see an increase in the number of cases. It’s the pot-of-gold-at-the-end-of-the-rainbow syndrome. We know that will happen,” Harris said.
Sovereign immunity stems from the Latin phrase “rex non potest peccare,” which translates to “the king cannot commit a legal wrong.” In legal terms, it refers to the state’s authority to exempt itself as a legal sovereign from civil lawsuits, although the state does allow negligence claims against itself and its subdivisions — agencies, cities, counties, and public hospitals — within limits.
Complicated process
Injured parties can sue for damages and collect within the liability thresholds established by law, but if they win awards in excess of the limits they must go to the Legislature in the form of what’s called a “claims bill” to collect. But the claims bill process is lengthy. It also allows the defendant to challenge the jury verdict at the legislative level.
Once a claims bill is filed, each chamber’s presiding officer refers it to a special master, who essentially reconsiders the jury’s recommendation. Claims bills also go before House and Senate committees that consider special masters’ recommendations. Ultimately, the bills must pass in both chambers.
McFarland, who has sponsored similar  legislation for the past three years, didn’t disagree that the bill increases liability for government entities.
“I know it’s hard. I know their costs will go up, their costs for insurance, their costs for liability. I know that it will increase. Of course, that’s what the numbers say,” McFarland said. “I’m just saying that its worth it. It’s time to update it. ”
The House this week also passed a bill that allows wrongful death lawsuits for the loss of developing fetuses,

DemasJudge Indira Talwani, in the U.S. District Court in the District of Massachusetts, granted a preliminary injunction to attorneys general and governors in 22 states, including Michigan, seeking to block a provision of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” known as the “Defund Provision.” The law sought to exclude certain health centers, including Planned Parenthood health centers, from receiving federal Medicaid reimbursements for any type of health care services. 
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, one of the attorneys general suing in the case, said in a press release that these health care centers provide essential healthcare services, including cancer screenings and birth control, especially to low-income patients. 
“Unlawfully defunding the health clinics that Michiganders rely on – especially those living in Northern Michigan’s healthcare deserts – would have left residents without access to essential care,” Nessel said in the press release. “I am relieved that the Court saw the Trump Administration’s effort for what it was: another illegal political tactic aimed at undermining the healthcare people need.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The lawsuit was initially filed in July, and the states asked for the preliminary injunction in September after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit ruled in a separate case that the Defund Provision could go into effect. 
Talwani ruled that the Department of Health and Human Services and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services “shall take all steps necessary to ensure that Medicaid funding continues to be disbursed in the customary manner and timeframes to Plaintiff States to reimburse claims without regard to whether the claims were filed by entities that may be ‘prohibited entities’,” requiring the federal government to continue funding medical services at Planned Parenthood and other impacted health centers. 
The order notes that the states are likely to succeed on the merits of their case, which argues that the scope of “prohibited entities” is too vague and unclear as to which health care facilities it would impact, and would be retroactively changing the terms of Medicaid after states had already joined it.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_9096-1-1024x732.jpg,,,2025-12-03 17:58:39.254713

(Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)The same day Ravalli County Commissioners called for a slowdown on the Sheep Creek mine proposal, members of Montana’s Congressional delegation echoed the sentiment.
“Montana knows better than anyone there’s a right and wrong way to mine,” Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke said in a statement. “Fast tracking a mine with overwhelming public opposition and bypassing the mechanisms that allow for transparency and accountability is the wrong way to do it.”
Representatives from U.S. Critical Materials have said they want to conduct exploratory mining of rare earth minerals to see if a fullscale operation is feasible.
But the mine would be at the headwaters of the Bitterroot River, and the proposal has drawn pushback for numerous reasons, including because mine representatives have not kept locals informed of their plans.

Tuesday, Republican U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy said he supports “unleashing Montana’s resource economy and mining industry,” but he had weighed other considerations, too.
“I also believe local voices must be heard loudest when considering public lands policy,” Sheehy said in a statement. “Regarding the Sheep Creek Mine, local Montanans have made their opposition clear, therefore I oppose efforts to approve the proposed Sheep Creek Mine and encourage the Permitting Council to remove it from their fast-track list.”
A couple of weeks ago, Ravalli County Commissioners learned the Sheep Creek project landed on the federal FAST-41 list of priority infrastructure projects, Title 41 of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act.
Four other projects are listed as “transparency projects” in Montana, ones posted “in the interest of transparency,” all in the mining sector. They include a Stillwater Mine underground platinum and palladium project in Nye and the Becky’s Mine Modification in Bridger to expand surface mining of bentonite.

At a meeting on Monday about the proposed Sheep Creek project, roughly 700 citizens turned up, according to an estimate in a letter Ravalli County Commissioners sent to members of the Congressional delegation and Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte.
“We received NO public testimony in support of including the proposed mine in the FAST41 program,” commissioners wrote in the letter dated Tuesday. “If the mine is to be considered, it MUST be reviewed under the highest environmental standards.”
At the meeting, mine representatives said they were proposing to explore “around” 3.9 acres for critical minerals, including gallium, tied to U.S. defense needs. They described the Sheep Creek area as “a geologic unicorn,” rich with minerals but without some of the environmental challenges in other mountain areas.
U.S. Critical Materials representative Scott Osterman said the FAST-41 acronym was a “misnomer” that incorrectly implied being listed was about “being fast.” However, the federal FAST-41 dashboard said listed projects are in response to Executive Order 14241, which calls for “expedited review” for domestic mineral production.
At the meeting, members of the public said company officials have been opaque or contradictory about their plans, withholding records and keeping Bitterroot Valley residents in the dark, or reporting one thing to Montanans and another to potential investors.
They also questioned whether the company is foreign-owned. At the meeting, Osterman said foreign ownership is “being taken out” and “we’re moving forward with zero foreign ownership.”
In their letter, Ravalli County Commissioners requested a full environmental impact study with no shortcuts or exclusions, “strong environmental protections,” and accountability from U.S. Critical Materials.
They also outlined a list of specific concerns, including water quality and supply; ecological and wildlife impacts, including on species of concern; transparency and public participation, in this case, a lack of it; long-term economic and cultural costs; and local impacts.
Rare-earth mining is “very water intensive,” and water resources may not be adequate to support the operations in the closed basin “without harming existing uses,” the commissioners said. They said exploration could lead to contamination and threats to surface and groundwater.
The commissioners also said the Bitterroot Valley economy is tied to its natural landscape, from agriculture to recreation, and damage to water quality or wildlife “could impose long-term costs on local businesses and livelihoods.”
“There is also a moral and cultural question: Do we want to risk our clean water and heritage for a potentially disruptive industrial operation that may or may not deliver commensurate local benefit?” the commissioners asked.
In a social media post, Republican U.S. Sen. Steve Daines also raised concerns about the lack of information from U.S. Critical Materials officials to locals.
“We must increase critical mineral mining but in a responsible, locally driven way,” Daines said. “Unfortunately the developers of Sheep Creek Mine didn’t engage w/the local community. Until they do, I can’t support the project & call on the admin to ensure transparency and local engagement in the permitting process.”
Zinke, who represents the western district in Montana, also called for more information from mine representatives and consideration of Ravalli County residents and elected officials.
“Ravalli County officials and residents have been clear in their concerns and opposition to this project,” Zinke said. “It has fallen on deaf ears and they have received no communication from the company. I urge the council to remove Sheep Creek from the FAST 41 process.”
The Permitting Council did not respond Wednesday to a request for comment in time for this story.
Wednesday, the Sheep Creek exploration was still listed as a mining project on the “transparency” dashboard, projects posted in response to the executive order calling for expedited reviews for proposals that would increase American mineral production.

(Photos by Fran Baltzer and Roman Broszkowski)It might seem like democratic socialism is having its moment in the sun, with two of the movement’s members snagging council seats in Jersey City’s runoff election Tuesday just a month after Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York City mayoral race.
Supporters say the wins — marking the first time a democratic socialist has been elected to public office in New Jersey in over a century — represent more than a moment. They signal a trend. And many in the movement, which rejects capitalism in favor of community ownership, have their eyes set on higher office.
“This is watershed for us, absolutely,” said Jake Ephros, who was elected to Jersey City’s council along with fellow democratic socialist Joel Brooks.
The movement’s activists have worked for years to build a bench of electable democratic socialist candidates, relying on labor unions to help grow grassroots support and taking lessons from prominent politicians who identify as democratic socialists including Reps. Alexandria O’Casio Cortez (D-NY) and Rashida Talib (D-MI), a national organizer said.
But the growing resentments of the working class, backlash against corporate-funded Democratic incumbents, and frustration with President Donald Trump’s policies coalesced to ensure a banner year for the Democratic Socialists of America, said Chanpreet Singh, a national electoral organizer with the group.
Voters elected more than half of the 21 democratic socialist candidates the group endorsed and funded across the country this year, including Ephros and Brooks, Singh said.
The group’s fundraising slogan: “Socialist cash takes out capitalist trash.”

“There is a lot of exasperation with the establishment, with the way things are going, just business as usual,” Singh said. “Candidates like Jake and Joel, they championed really bold, unapologetically socialist policies, like universal rent control and child care. These are things that speak to people in a moment when they’re feeling really frustrated, the cost of living is rising, and they want something more than what your typical Democratic incumbent offers.”
The group hopes to get more democratic socialists elected to Congress in coming years, Singh added.
Dan Cassino is a professor of government and law at Fairleigh Dickinson University and the executive director of the school’s poll. He agreed socialism has largely lost the stigma, at least among progressives, that it historically has carried due to its association with authoritarianism.
“In urban areas of New York and New Jersey, socialism just isn’t the bugbear that it used to be,” Cassino said.
While the proportion of New Jersey Democrats who identify as socialists has remained around 10 percent in recent years, even voters who don’t consider themselves socialists are willing to vote for a candidate who is, Cassino said. For Democratic candidates, being an avowed democratic socialist can give them an edge with Democrats who have become alienated from the institutional party, he added.

Still, Cassino noted, political ideology tends to matter less to voters than policy priorities and campaign promises.
“These candidates are running almost more as technocrats than anything else. They’re identifying problems, especially with regard to affordability, and offering what seems to voters to be reasonable solutions to those problems,” Cassino said. “At the end of the day, people want to hear that candidates understand the problems they’re facing, and have a solution. Ideological labels don’t matter as much as a belief that they can solve real problems.”
Ephros and Brooks both ran on platforms focused on affordability and quality-of-life issues, calling for more state funding for schools, the creation of a municipal transit council to improve mass transit, and more investment in public health care, among other things.
Brooks, a labor organizer who will represent Jersey City’s west side, also ran for city council in 2021 but fell short by about 200 votes. He did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.
Ephros, a teacher and union organizer who will represent the city’s northern neighborhoods, told the New Jersey Monitor that his first priorities, once he’s sworn in next month, will be to enact universal rent control, tackle trash issues including making collection a municipal function instead of privatized, and enforce existing laws to hold absentee landlords accountable for property problems.
Ephros credited his election success partly to the same voter frustrations Singh mentioned, adding that working people overburdened by the ever-climbing cost of living were hungry for change.
And while widespread frustration with Trump’s policies united Democrats and mobilized them to the polls, Ephros thinks his and Brooks’ solutions-focused platforms and can-do attitudes made the difference at the ballot box.
“We can’t only fight against something. We have to be fighting for something. And so we aren’t only saying: ‘Vote for me. I’m going to fight Trump!’ It’s: ‘We’re going to pick up the trash. We’re going to get our streets paved. We’re going to cap our rents. We’re going to fight back against the tax breaks that we’ve been giving billionaire developers on the backs of ordinary homeowners,’” Ephros said. “We’re going to do all of these concrete, tangible, and positive things to make life better for ordinary people here — with their help, not for them, but with them.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-03 22:20:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Trump plan would weaken vehicle mileage rules that limit air pollution,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/03/trump-fuel-economy-standards/,"The proposal significantly reduces fuel economy requirements, which set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a proposal to weaken vehicle mileage rules for the auto industry, loosening regulatory pressure on automakers to control pollution from gasoline-powered cars and trucks.
The plan, if finalized next year, would significantly reduce fuel economy requirements, which set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, through the 2031 model year. The rules will increase Americans’ access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford, officials said. The administration projects that the new standards would set the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles per gallon in the 2031 model year.
The move is the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles. Burning gasoline for vehicles is a major contributor to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.
“From day one I’ve been taking action to make buying a car more affordable.” Trump said at a White House event that included top executives from the three largest U.S. automakers.
The rule reverses a Biden-era policy that “forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse,” Trump said.
Rule change will save money, Trump says
The action is expected to save consumers about $1,000 off the price of a new car, Trump said. New cars sold for an average of $49,766 on average in October. according to Kelley Blue Book.
Automakers applauded the planned changes. They had complained that the Biden-era rules were difficult to meet.
Ford CEO Jim Farley said the planned rollback was “a win for customers and common sense.”
“As America’s largest auto producer, we appreciate President Trump’s leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities. We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability,” Farley said.
Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said the automaker appreciates the administration’s actions to “realign” the standards “with real world market conditions.”
Since taking office in January, Trump has relaxed auto tailpipe emissions rules, repealed fines for automakers that do not meet federal mileage standards and terminated consumer credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchases.
Environmentalists decried the rollback in mileage standards.
“In one stroke Trump is worsening three of our nation’s most vexing problems: the thirst for oil, high gas pump costs and global warming,” said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign for the Center for Biological Diversity.
“Gutting the (gas-mileage) program will make cars burn more gas and American families burn more cash,” said Katherine García, director of the Sierra Club’s Clean Transportation for All program.
Polluting cars to stay on road
“This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans, particularly children and the elderly,” she said.
Trump has repeatedly pledged to end what he falsely calls an EV “mandate,” referring incorrectly to Democratic President Joe Biden’s target that half of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. EVs accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the United States in 2024, according to Cox Automotive.
No federal policy has required auto companies to sell EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state be zero-emission by 2035. Trump and congressional Republicans blocked the California law earlier this year.
Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy urged his agency to reverse existing fuel economy requirements, known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, soon after taking office. In June, he said that standards set under Biden were illegal because they included use of electric vehicles in their calculation. EVs do not run on gasoline. After the June rule revision, the traffic safety agency was empowered to update the requirements.
Under Biden, automakers were required to average about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon of gas for passenger cars by 2031, compared with about 39 miles (63 kilometers) per gallon today. The Biden administration also increased fuel-economy requirements by 2% each year for light-duty vehicles in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% per year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031. At the same time, it called for stringent tailpipe rules meant to encourage EV adoption.

Free.,"Lawmakers press for Epstein files briefing, as Dems release photos of his private island",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/lawmakers-press-epstein-files-briefing-dems-release-photos-his-private-island,,"WASHINGTON — A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers is pressing Attorney General Pam Bondi for a briefing this week to review the contents of the Epstein files ahead of the Justice Department’s legally binding public release date later this month.Sens. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Ben Ray Luján, D-N.M., and Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., sent a letter to Bondi Wednesday urging “transparency and clarity” as the department prepares to release evidence collected during the federal investigation of the sex offender. Epstein died in a Manhattan jail in 2019 awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.“We write as the bipartisan lead sponsors of the Epstein Files Transparency Act to express our shared interest in supporting the Department of Justice’s efforts to carry out the provisions of this critical new law,” the lawmakers wrote. “In light of the short 30-day deadline to release the Epstein Files, we are particularly focused on understanding the contents of any new evidence, information or procedural hurdles that could interfere with the Department’s ability (to) meet this statutory deadline.”The U.S. House overwhelmingly approved legislation, 427-1, to compel the Justice Department to publicly release the material. The Senate agreed unanimously. President Donald Trump, after months of calling the files a “hoax,” signed the bill into law on Nov. 19, starting the clock for the Dec. 19 release deadline.Epstein surrounded himself with influential politicians and celebrities, and had a well-documented friendship with Trump.‘New information’ emergesThe lawmakers highlighted in the letter that the Federal Bureau of Investigation released a memo in July stating that the department would not be publicly releasing any further information or material related to the Epstein investigation as officials “did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.”But on Nov. 14, the department announced the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan would begin “new investigations” into any connections between Epstein and former President Bill Clinton, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, and prominent investor Reid Hoffman.Bondi said Nov. 19 during a press conference that “information has come forward, new information, additional information.”“In the interest of transparency and clarity on the steps required to faithfully implement the Epstein Files Transparency Act, we request a briefing either in a classified or unclassified setting, to discuss the full contents of this new information in your possession at your convenience, but not later than Friday, December 5th, 2025,” the lawmakers wrote to Bondi.The law has a carve-out to exempt the release of any material that is part of an ongoing investigation.In response to States Newsroom’s request for comment, Department of Justice spokesperson Natalie Baldassarre wrote in an email, “I can confirm receipt of the letter but will decline to comment further.”‘Never-before-seen’ Epstein island photos The letter to Bondi comes as Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released “never-before-seen” photos and videos of Epstein’s residence on Little Saint James, a small private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.The committee requested the images from the U.S. Virgin Islands Department of Justice as part of the lawmakers’ ongoing inquiry into Epstein’s activities.

“These new images are a disturbing look into the world of Jeffrey Epstein and his island. We are releasing these photos and videos to ensure public transparency in our investigation and to help piece together the full picture of Epstein’s horrific crimes. We won’t stop fighting until we deliver justice for the survivors,” committee ranking member Robert Garcia said in a statement.Some of the files, released publicly in a cloud folder, contain images of furnished bedrooms, bathrooms, a room with masks on the wall and what appears to be a dental exam chair, a telephone with a list of names on speed dial, some redacted, and a chalkboard with notes, some redacted, containing what appear to be the words “power” and “deception.”

Videos reveal a large compound with an inground swimming pool and winding stone walkway toward the sea, as well as short clips of bedrooms and at least one medicine cabinet.The Republican-led committee investigation began in August and is separate from the new law requiring the Justice Department’s disclosure of evidence.

Committee Republicans did not publish a press release as of Wednesday afternoon on the Democrats’ release of the images and videos.Last month, committee Democrats released select emails provided by Epstein’s estate. Within hours, committee Republicans released a cache of 23,000 pages of correspondence.

The committee, chaired by Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., has issued several subpoenas, including one to the Department of Justice for all Epstein investigation files. Others include subpoenas to interview Epstein’s co-conspirator and convicted sex offender Ghislaine Maxwell, Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and several former attorneys general.Epstein had over 1,000 victims, according to the FBI.Epstein, a former hedge fund manager who claimed he only managed assets for billionaires, pleaded guilty to state charges of soliciting sex from a minor and soliciting prostitution. He avoided a federal investigation when the then-U.S. attorney in Miami, Alex Acosta, cut the plea deal with Florida prosecutors.Acosta would later become Trump’s Labor secretary in 2017.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-12-03 17:58:39.254713

Dec. 3, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Capitol’s annual Christmas tree-lighting event that has been marked in recent years by singing children and sometimes interrupted by protests focusing attention elsewhere is getting more private in a public place.
Gov. Jim Pillen moved this year’s event to 6 p.m., after the Capitol’s public hours, and required tickets obtained from state senators to attend. The Governor’s Office said it was an effort to keep the event focused on the season’s meaning. 
The move spurred some criticism from lawmakers, including State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha, who argued in a Facebook post that the people’s event in the people’s house should be open to the public and questioned why lawmakers needed to handle tickets.

Pillen spokeswoman Laura Strimple said the program was moved partly to make sure the lighting happened after the sun had gone down and that ticketing was required to host an event in the Capitol after regular business hours.
She also acknowledged that the changes came a year after people posted videos on social media of protesters in support of Palestine last year that some 2024 attendees complained interrupted the flow and feel of the celebration for student performers and families.
“In recent years, this wonderful Christmas program has been severely disrupted by Free Palestine and assorted other radical protesters,” Strimple said. “That has been frightening for kids in attendance and a serious concern from a security standpoint.” 
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, in a Facebook post, said her office had received ticket allotments from other senators and would work with others to make sure the public could still attend. She asked people to reach out if they needed tickets.
“The holiday season should extend goodwill to all Nebraskans who want to join together for the traditional tree-lighting festivities in the people’s house,” Conrad wrote.

Last year, some social media posters amplified the tree-lighting protest as evidence of Christians being bullied and praised the response of the Nebraska State Patrol, which removed at least one person for yelling during the event.  
Others questioned why the Christmas-themed event was being held in a public building and venue, in a seat of state government meant to represent a pluralistic society of multiple faiths, including the right of Nebraskans to worship no faith.
Pillen has argued that too many of Nebraska’s Christians and people of faith have been too quiet. He blamed the majority’s silence for a lack of moral clarity. He recently visited Israel, meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the American ambassador, Mike Huckabee.
Strimple said the revamped process was “designed” to ensure that the ceremony remains accessible and safe for the families and several “small children who attend.” Some expect protesters to make their way in and exercise their First Amendment rights. 
“Hopefully, this change will help ensure this Christmas program can be enjoyed safely, securely and without disruption for the families in attendance,” Strimple said.

Free.,U.S. House punts vote on college-athlete compensation bill,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-punts-vote-college-athlete-compensation-bill,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. House GOP leadership pulled a bill from the House floor Wednesday that would set a national framework for college-athletes’ compensation. The Student Compensation and Opportunity through Rights and Endorsements, or ‘‘SCORE” Act, would bar student-athletes from being recognized as employees and provide broad antitrust immunity to the NCAA and college sports conferences. The measure was on the House schedule for Wednesday, before the office of Majority Whip Tom Emmer announced Wednesday afternoon its consideration would be postponed. The notice did not provide a reason for the cancellation, as is typical. The bill’s lead sponsors are GOP Rep. Gus Bilirakis of Florida and Democratic Reps. Janelle Bynum of Oregon and Shomari Figures of Alabama.The other original co-sponsors are all Republicans: House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Brett Guthrie of Kentucky, Education and Workforce Committee Chair Tim Walberg of Michigan, and Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Lisa McClain of Michigan, Scott Fitzgerald of Wisconsin and Russell Fry of South Carolina.Bipartisan oppositionThe bill has faced widespread Democratic opposition over concerns it would roll back student-athletes’ rights and give “unchecked authority” to the NCAA while failing to protect student-athletes. Though the bill has garnered broad GOP support, some in the party have pushed back against it. House GOP critics include Texas’ Chip Roy, who dubbed the bill a “Band-Aid on a gunshot wound” during a House Rules Committee hearing Monday. Roy, along with fellow House Freedom Caucus members, Byron Donalds of Florida and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, joined Democrats in voting against the rule governing floor debate alongside several other measures Tuesday. The rule was still adopted, 210-209. The bill advanced in July out of the House Energy and Commerce and Education and Workforce committees, which have jurisdiction over elements of the bill.The college sports world has grappled with the fallout from the NCAA’s 2021 guidelines, which let student-athletes profit from their name, image and likeness, or NIL. A patchwork of NIL laws exists across states, with no federal NIL law in place. In June, a federal judge approved the terms of a nearly $2.8 billion antitrust settlement that paved the way for schools to directly pay athletes. Senate Dems’ competing billMeanwhile, the bill would face a tough path in the Senate, where Democrats have expressed opposition. Democratic Sens. Maria Cantwell of Washington state, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut introduced competing NIL-related legislation in September. Known as the Student Athlete Fairness and Enforcement Act, or “SAFE Act,” the bill “gives all athletes Name, Image and Likeness (NIL) rights, establishes uniform health and safety standards, protects scholarships and requires agents to register with a state and abide by clear contract requirements, including a 5 percent cap on fees,” according to Democrats on the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, where Cantwell serves as ranking member.",,,,2025-12-03 17:58:39.254713

The Vermont Conversation with David Goodman is a VTDigger podcast that features in-depth interviews on local and national issues. Listen below and subscribe for free on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get podcasts.




Leila Stillman-Utterback graduated from Middlebury Union High School in June and decided to take a gap year to pursue a dream. The 18-year-old Vermonter traveled to Israel to participate in a solidarity program that included  volunteering with Rabbis for Human Rights in the Israeli-occupied West Bank to help Palestinians harvest olives. She was part of an effort to provide “protective presence” for Palestinians who are under constant attack from right-wing Israeli settlers. She said she wanted to live the Jewish values of tikkun olam (repairing the world) and b’tselem elohim (a belief that everyone is created in God’s image). 
On October 29, Stillman-Utterback was detained by Israeli soldiers, spent a night handcuffed in a police station and was accused of violating the terms of her tourist visa by entering a closed military zone. After being hauled before a judge at 3 a.m., she was deported and banned from Israel for 10 years.
Leila’s treatment at the hands of Israeli authorities was deeply personal for her mother. Danielle Stillman is the rabbi of Middlebury College. She teaches the values that Leila is living. Her daughter is now paying the price. 
The Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu may have hoped that by coming down hard on a young American activist that it would silence her. The opposite has occurred. Stillman-Utterback has spoken out in multiple interviews in the Israeli press. 
“My deportation felt like a betrayal,” wrote Stillman-Utterback in a powerful essay about her ordeal in The Forward, an independent Jewish American news publication. “Israel was supposed to be for me, for every Jew. But the settler movement and the current government would like to redefine what it means to be Jewish along political lines.”
Stillman-Utterback rejects the notion that criticizing Israel is somehow antisemitic. “I’ve grown up my entire life with a connection to Israel, with a love for it even,” she told The Vermont Conversation. “I have also grown up my entire life being allowed to be critical of Israel and … frustrated [and] angry.” She added that it was essential that “in a time of real rising antisemitism globally, that we are able to hold criticism and love at the same time. I really do think that it’s possible.”
Stillman-Utterback’s treatment is part of a larger crackdown on Palestinians and Jewish activists by the Israeli government and right-wing settlers who operate with near impunity in Palestinian communities. In October, there were 126 olive harvest-related settler attacks against Palestinians, and Israel detained and deported 32 foreign activists who were accompanying Palestinian harvesters near the town of Burin, according to the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
Stillman-Utterback, who two years ago was named a Bronfman Fellow, a cohort of high-achieving Jewish teens, is appealing her ban from Israel and is committed to staying engaged. “We need to maintain our relationships in order to show that there are people who are committed to a peaceful and just future. It doesn’t matter what it looks like, whether it’s a two state solution, whether it’s binational, it only matters that that we end the violence and that we end the occupation, that we move towards equality. Any movement towards equality and towards an end in violence, towards accountability for settler actions, is a move in the right direction.”
Rabbi Danielle Stillman said that she’s “inspired by [Leila’s] principled willingness to hang in with Israel despite this really harrowing, dramatic experience, and that that really comes from her Jewish values … to contribute to building a better society in a place that she’s come to really care about.”
Rabbi Stillman said that American Jews are deeply divided about Israel, especially along generational lines. A recent Washington Post survey found that just over half of Jewish Americans — and two thirds of those over 65 — say they are emotionally attached to Israel, but only about one third of those ages 18 to 34 feel that attachment. About half of younger Jews are more likely to say Israel has committed genocide in Gaza, compared to about one third of older Jews.
Leila’s arrest and expulsion “just makes me really concerned about the future of the relationship between Israel and the diaspora, between American Jews and Israeli Jews,” said Rabbi Stillman.
Rabbi Stillman criticized how antisemitism is being “used in a certain way to further an agenda of silencing solidarity with Palestinians and silencing speech in general on many college campuses.”
Leila Stillman-Utterback is now back home in Middlebury figuring out what she will do with the rest of her gap year before attending Williams College in the fall of 2026.  She expressed gratitude towards her parents. 
“I was taught to always stay in a place of not knowing, even if it’s uncomfortable, and I feel immensely grateful for never being told that only one answer is right, and for always being taught to live in that liminal space.”

(Kennedy Thomason/ Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — An Oklahoma electric utility company requested that a commissioner on a governing board recuse himself from a case because of an “unacceptable bias.” 
Oklahoma Gas & Electric Company, or OG&E, requested on Nov. 26 that Corporation Commissioner Todd Hiett recuse himself from a case that would allow the company to expand its power generation sites. This includes building natural gas turbines at the Horseshoe Lake Power Plant in Oklahoma County, which OG&E estimated would total more than $506 million in capital costs. 
Hiett said in a filing that OG&E would recover these millions from ratepayers. 
The Oklahoma Corporation Commission is a three-person statewide elected board that regulates the state’s oil and gas, utility and transportation industries.
OG&E’s general counsel Chase Snodgrass argued in a filing that Hiett’s public comments demonstrate a bias against the company and he should recuse because “actual bias and the appearance of bias” violate Oklahoma’s ethical rules for public officials.  
Hiett said OG&E is “evil” and called the company a monopoly spreading “propaganda,” according to Snodgrass’ filing. 
“So, this is nothing more than the monopolies – once again, just like they have been doing at the Legislature, but now they are doing it at the Commission, they are trying to capture this regulatory body, utilize this regulatory body through an order to promote propaganda,” Hiett said at a public meeting Nov. 13, according to the filing. 
“What we have in the state of Oklahoma is the two major utilities, both PSO and OG&E, have been working for several years over at the Legislature to systematically do two things, remove themselves from regulation and strengthen their monopoly status.”
At the same meeting, he said utilities have spent millions to send out mailers to consumers with “propoganda” about saving millions. 
Hiett declined to comment Wednesday, but said he would offer comment at the Corporation Commission’s meeting Thursday. 
Christi Woodworth, OG&E’s vice president of marketing and communications, said in a statement that the company didn’t want to take this action but was forced to because of Hiett’s comments. 
OG&E did not send any mailers, she said. 
“This case is about ensuring sufficient power generation for OG&E to serve our customers …,” she said. “On Nov. 13, the Commission approved three projects selected through the Commission’s competitive bid process. We also requested to use a particular accounting treatment that would have saved our customers $176 million in unnecessary interest costs over the life of the project.”

(Courtesy photo)The Rhode Island State Police’s second-in-command will step down from his $250,000-a-year job to ensure the state’s Roman Catholic clergy and staff adhere to the law and their own internal policies.
Lt. Col Robert Creamer was tapped by the Diocese of Providence Tuesday to be its next director of compliance, a role established in 1993 as part of its “commitment to protecting children,” according to the church’s announcement.
Creamer begins his new job Jan. 5.
He will succeed Kevin O’Brien, himself a former major and commander with the State Police who has led the office since 2015.
Creamer will be responsible for ensuring that diocesan entities and employees “follow policies, procedures, and law.” That will include overseeing investigations, background checks of clergy and employees, alongside cooperation with law enforcement.
District Court Judge Stephen M. Isherwood, who chairs the Diocesan Review Board for the Protection of Children and Youth, described Creamer’s new role as one that necessitates “a diversity of talents.”
The Bishop Bruce Lewandowski said Creamer is more than up to the task.
“Col. Creamer brings to our diocese his extensive career experience and stellar reputation as a top leader in our state’s law enforcement,” he said in a statement.
A parishioner at St. Peter’s Church in Warwick, Creamer is a graduate of Providence College where he received a bachelor’s degree in finance. He received a master’s degree in cybersecurity from the University of Rhode Island and one in business administration from Bryant University.
Creamer’s career with the State Police spans nearly 29 years. 
According to his LinkedIn, Creamer started as a trooper in June 1997 — a position he held through 2009. He then served as the officer-in-charge of the State Police’s major crimes unit and directed its detective bureau.
Under Col. Darnell Weaver’s leadership, Creamer was promoted to the No. 2 position of deputy superintendent and chief of field operations in 2022, which involves helping to oversee the 650 employees that make up the state’s Department of Public Safety. He is also the public information officer for the State Police.
Creamer told Rhode Island Current he will leave the State Police on Jan. 2.
His replacement has not been announced.

McCuskey has filed documents in a federal appeals court supporting the continued presence of National Guard members in Washington, D.C.
Twenty-three attorneys general from other states joined McCuskey in a friend of the court brief, filed Tuesday, that pushed back on a federal judge’s recent ruling that President Donald Trump’s deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops to D.C. was illegal.

Gov. Patrick Morrisey supported Trump’s proposed “crime crackdown” in the nation’s capital, sending 300 state National Guard members to D.C. in response. 
Nearly 2,000 National Guard troops are in D.C. West Virginia National Guard members who have remained in D.C. — about 160 to 170 troops — have volunteered to be there, according to Morrisey. 
Two members of the West Virginia National Guard were shot last week while on duty blocks from the White House. U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died on Thanksgiving as a result of her injuries, and U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains in the hospital with severe wounds.  
“This mission has already produced strong results, but still more work must be done, and danger still lingers,” wrote the attorneys general, including McCuskey.
U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb said Trump sending National Guard members to D.C. was “unlawful,” and she sided with D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, who sued the federal government over the Guard deployment. Schwalb also argued that it exceeded the president’s legal authority. 
The judge paused the order until Dec. 11 to give the Trump administration time to appeal the decision. The Trump administration has already filed an appeal, asking to stop the preliminary injunction and saying the National Guard deployment is legal.
McCuskey and his colleagues support the Trump administration’s authority to authorize the National Guard in D.C. They believe the president has legitimate authority to make that call and that their presence has helped reduce crime in the nation’s capital. The brief filed by attorneys general was first reported by MetroNews. 
Residents, government officials and federal workers and more “have endured assault, robberies at gunpoint, and even murder,” the attorneys general wrote. 
They continued, “President Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops in the District has caused crime rates to drop substantially.”
The attorneys general also said that “troops have worked on beautification projects to clean up neighborhoods.” 
“This type of work supports the efforts to prevent crime by ensuring that those neighborhoods are not ‘recognized as invitations to violent and property crimes,’” they said.
The attorneys general pushed for a stay in the injunction so that Trump can continue his efforts to decrease crime in D.C., “but still more work must be done, and danger still lingers.”
“Not only is the President likely to succeed on the merits, but the equities weigh heavily in favor of a stay,” they wrote. 
U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth pledged last week to send 500 additional troops to D.C. following the shooting of two West Virginia guard members. West Virginia has not been asked to send additional guard members, according to the governor. 
Following the shooting of Beckstrom and Wolfe, Morrisey has been questioned about his decision to send National Guard members to D.C. Only six states sent Guard members to participate in Trump’s “Operation D.C. Safe and Beautiful.” 
Earlier this week, the West Virginia Democratic Party called on Morrisey to clarify the scope and purpose of the ongoing deployment of Guard personnel to D.C., “particularly in light of multiple public reports documenting that Guard units — including those from West Virginia — have been assigned to landscaping, beautification and trash-removal duties in the nation’s capital.”
“At a moment when families are grieving and communities are asking hard questions, it is entirely appropriate for the governor to explain the true nature and purpose of this deployment,” said Mike Pushkin, chair of the state Democratic Party.
The West Virginia National Guard said in August that, “WVNG service members are not conducting beautification projects, such as litter collection and site restoration.”

(By Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star) Deering High School senior Jack Borland said during his sophomore year he wanted to start a club. He told his soccer teammates about it after practice one day, hoping they’d join. They nodded along politely, he said, but when the first meeting rolled around only one showed up: Joel Andre. 
“That’s the kind of person Joel is: loyal, supportive,” Borland said. “He’s the guy who shows up when no one else does.”
On Wednesday, hundreds of people showed up for Joel Andre and his family, including another Portland high schooler, who are now detained in Texas. Students and teachers walked out of class and were joined by local and state officials and other community members to protest in Portland. 
Border agents in New York detained the mother and her three teenage children in November after the family attempted to seek asylum in Canada. An immigration judge had issued a deportation order for the family in February and their appeal for asylum in the U.S. was denied in October, court records show. The family is originally from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and first entered the U.S. in 2022, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
The mother, Carine Balenda Mbizi, and oldest sibling, 19-year-old Olivia Mabiala Andre, are currently detained in Texas at the Dilley Immigration Processing Center, according to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainee locator system. The system doesn’t track people under 18 years old and therefore doesn’t capture records for the two high schoolers, though they are believed to also be at that facility. 
During the protest, which was organized by the youth activist group Voices for Portland Maine Students, attendees marched along Congress Street from Monument Square to City Hall. Speakers including Borland called for broad changes to immigration policy, to one that centers individual humanity, and shared stories about how their classmates bettered their community.

Casco Bay High School teacher Kerry Herlihy said Joel Andre’s sister, Estafania Andre, was consistently the first student in her room each morning. She is a gifted writer with many passions, Herlihy said, including being “married to math after a rocky courtship,” as Estafania Andre had put it.
Herlihy said Estafania Andre had dreams for her future, including working for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and making her community a better place. 
“Don’t we want a future where that kind of determination and joy is rewarded and cultivated?” Herlihy asked. 
The protest was spearheaded by Casco Bay seniors Evie Jones and Caroline Chong, who began the rally with chants including, “No hate, no fear. Refugees are welcome here.”

Some of the speakers know firsthand what it is like to navigate the U.S. immigration system, including state Rep. Deqa Dhalac, who left her home country of Somalia before the start of the civil war that still lingers today. 
“We can and must reimagine a system that centers dignity and fairness,” Dhalac said. The South Portland Democrat is the sponsor of a bill that seeks to place restrictions on local immigration enforcement activities, which the Maine Legislature passed earlier this year but the governor delayed her decision on until next year. 
Several speakers called for policy change but also a general change in how the country views immigrants. 
“If we as a nation wish to evolve beyond this, if we wish to overcome these cycles of oppression,” said Omari Brent, a junior at Waynflete, “we must embrace and we must never exclude.” 
Casco Bay senior Lachlan Gartland is in a mentor group with Estafania Andre. When he heard what happened to the freshman student and her family, he told Maine Morning Star he was outraged but didn’t know what to do. The protest on Wednesday provided the tangible action he and many others were seeking. 
“Obviously, we’re not going to topple the government. Obviously, we’re not going to take over the world,” Gartland said. “But we can change it while we exist in it. That’s what’s important. That’s the message I hope that is portrayed today.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_5340-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-03 16:58:53.207857

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Prosecutors in Salt Lake City filed a criminal charge Wednesday against the armed security volunteer who mistakenly shot and killed an innocent bystander at a No Kings protest in June. 
Matthew Scott Alder, 43, of Murray, is charged with one count of manslaughter, a second-degree felony. 
“While you may have a right to use lethal force, that doesn’t mean that lethal force can be used in a reckless manner,” Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill told reporters Wednesday in announcing the criminal charge. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Gill’s decision to prosecute comes nearly six months after the fatal shooting of Arthur “Afa” Ah Loo, a father and fashion designer from Clearfield. Ah Loo was taking video of fellow protesters marching in downtown Salt Lake City when he was killed on June 14. 
Alder fired three shots in total, also wounding his intended target, a man carrying a rifle. He told investigators he thought the man was about to commit a mass shooting when he shot toward a crowd on State Street, Gill said. An attorney who previously represented Alder did not immediately return a request for comment. 
Ah Loo’s widow, Laura Ah Loo, said in a news conference the district attorney’s decision to file a criminal charge represents “a significant first step in the right direction and establish a precedent that I hope will lead to a safer environment of public gatherings in the future.” 
Laura Ah Loo said the months since her husband’s death “have been long, painful and deeply frustrating” as her family has waited for answers. She held back tears as she talked about her grief and said her husband was an incredible father.

Police did not initially arrest Alder, identifying him as a peacekeeper who was working with protest organizers at the event. Gill said he’s not asking for Alder to be jailed before trial because he doesn’t see him as a flight risk. Instead, Gill said he’ll request a summons ordering him to appear in court. 
On the day of the protest, police did arrest Arturo Gamboa, the man who was carrying the rifle that day, as Utah law allows, but did not shoot anyone. Gamboa spent almost a week in jail and was released without being charged with any crime. His attorney Greg Skordas has said his weapon was unloaded and pointing down at the time he was shot. 
Gill confirmed Wednesday that his office is not filing criminal charges against Gamboa, saying there’s insufficient evidence he committed a crime. 
Gill, a Democrat, noted state law permits people to openly carry guns in public spaces and called Utah’s self-defense law “robust,” saying together, those factors can leave innocent bystanders vulnerable to being shot. 
Alder is not charged with wounding Gamboa, Gill said, because Utah law shields him from such liability.
If convicted in Ah Loo’s death, he faces up to 15 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.

His first day as the director will be July 1.,"The Mississippi Department of Archives and History announced Wednesday that Barry White will succeed Katie Blount as the agency’s director when Blount retires next year.
White has been director of  the department’s  Historic Preservation Division since 2020.
In his current role, he administers statewide grant programs, oversees major preservation initiatives and works on building partnerships with local, state and federal agencies. He is also part of the leadership team for the partnership between Archives and History and Mississippi State University to turn Historic Jefferson College near Natchez into a regional hub for education, research and workforce development. 
White will begin transitioning to his new role early next year. His first day as the director will be July 1, after Blount steps down.
“Our stories belong to every Mississippian, and I am committed to strengthening our connections to communities across the state,” White said in a press release. “As we look to the future, collaboration will continue to drive our efforts to preserve and share Mississippi’s history in meaningful ways.”
MDAH announced Blount’s planned retirement in August. After becoming director in 2015, she oversaw the opening of the Two Mississippi Museums in 2017 and helped efforts to redesign the state flag in 2020. She is the second woman to hold the position. The American Association for State and Local History gave her a lifetime achievement award in June.
“Barry has earned the trust of colleagues and communities throughout Mississippi,” Blount said in the press release Wednesday. “He’s forged strong relationships with key stakeholders through his thoughtful approach to preservation and his dedication to public service.
Spence Flatgard, president of  the Archives and History Board of Trustees, said, “Katie Blount’s leadership has strengthened this agency in profound and lasting ways, and Barry is the right person to lead MDAH into our next chapter. His experience, integrity, and relationships across the state give him a deep understanding of both our mission and our partners who help carry us forward.”

(Photo: Ahmed Jallow/NC Newsline) Ten North Carolina school districts will share more than $392 million in state lottery-funded grants to replace and renovate aging facilities, state education officials said Wednesday.
The grants target some of the state’s most economically distressed counties. The projects cover seven elementary schools, two high schools, and one Career and Technical Education center. They involve the complete renovation of two existing buildings and the construction of 14 replacements.
State officials said several of the facilities slated for demolition were built in the 1950s and 1960s.
“This funding is critical to sustaining and nurturing excellence in North Carolina public schools. It’s an important step in our journey to ensure that a zip code does not determine the quality of a child’s education,” state Superintendent of Public InstructionMo Green said during a press conference.
Altogether, the state received 92 applications totaling nearly $2 billion in requested funding, but only 10 districts were selected, according to officials. The Department of Public Instruction reviewed each proposal against seven criteria established in state law, including the county’s economic tier designation and the severity of facility deficiencies.
“These projects will transform the learning environments and positively impact the daily lives of thousands of children and families across the state,” said Nathan Maune, Director of the Office of School Facilities.
In Transylvania County, Superintendent Lisa Fletcher said the investment, which includes rebuilding the high school campus and adding a new CTE facility, represents more than bricks and mortar.
“We’re doing this so a student who loves working with their hands can learn a trade in a space that looks like a real shop,” Fletcher said. “We’re doing this so a student who dreams of nursing and physical therapy can practice in a space that looks like a real clinic.”
Tyrrell County, the state’s smallest school district with 436 students, will use its $62 million award for a new PK–13 facility to replace aging, flood-prone buildings. “This is going to be a state-of-the-art facility for students in early childhood development through grade 13,” said Tyrell County School Superintendent Brianna Williams.
The grants represent the largest one-year allocation from the state’s lottery-funded school construction program since its creation in 2017, officials said.
Awards are capped at $42 million for elementary, $52 million for middle, and $62 million for high school projects.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_2114-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-03 16:58:53.207857

(Photos by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch. Logo via Iowa Board of Regents)The Iowa Board of Regents has charged its investment and finance committee with taking another look at increasing efficiencies in public higher education and identifying potential new revenue streams as the future of higher education becomes more uncertain.
Regent Sherry Bates, in her capacity as president, called upon regents and committee members Kurt Tjaden, Nancy Dunkel and Christine Hensley to undertake the “revenue enhancement efficiency study” and bring recommendations to the board.
“The board has been clear that this is a priority, and our universities have been doing their part, but the time is right for a new formal review to see what additional measures can be undertaken,” Bates said.

Each of the universities governed by the board have already been identifying and implementing administrative savings and efficiencies “for some time,” Bates said, leading to the state of Iowa ranking fourth in the U.S. for most efficient administrative costs.
Board of Regents Executive Director Mark Braun said during the meeting this review is similar to past studies of revenue streams and cost-saving measures during the COVID-19 pandemic and in 2014. Board documents described these previous reviews as “fruitful,” but stated further study should be conducted with the uncertain future of higher education.
Launched in 2014 and worked on for multiple years, the Transparent, Inclusive Efficiency Review, or TIER, was an undertaking by the board, universities and consultants contracted with the board to find opportunities to reduce costs, increase savings or improve service. From this review, the University of Iowa, Iowa State University and University of Northern Iowa each created task forces and plans to improve in areas of virtual and distance learning, enrollment management and the availability and efficiency of courses and resources.
Regent Kurt Tjaden, chair of the investment and finance committee, said he agrees with Bates that while “universities have done excellent work in this area,” more work is still necessary. He said he looks forward to heading the committee’s efforts in the study and will provide updates to the full board “on a regular basis.”
“This strategic opportunity is an ability to jointly engage the board, office, regent institutions, and third party experts, to challenge and expand our thinking and explore new areas of opportunity to ensure our future financial foundation remains strong,” Tjaden said.

Dec. 2, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan Advance The Michigan Senate is considering a pair of payroll tax withholding bills in the spirit of the since-expired “Good Jobs for Michigan” and other economic development programs that were not extended by the Legislature.
Members of the Senate Regulatory Affairs Committee took testimony Tuesday on Senate Bill 472 and Senate Bill 473, both sponsored by state Sen. Sam Singh (D-East Lansing). The package, if passed as introduced, would task the Michigan Strategic Fund with creating a new jobs program where eligible businesses could apply for withheld tax capture revenue collected under the Michigan Income Tax Act. Payment would be contingent on fulfilling a set of goals outlined in the bill, such as tangible efforts to create new jobs or maintain protected jobs in the state.
A fund would also be created to further that goal, managed by the Michigan Department of Treasury. Businesses deemed eligible that have signed written agreements with the state could receive up to 100% of withholding tax capture revenues for certified new jobs for a period of up to 10 years, and the Strategic Fund would be allowed to extend the period by up to 10 years if certain requirements were met.
An eligible business could also receive up to 100% of withholding tax capture revenues for protected jobs for a period of up to 20 years. 

 


The requirements for eligibility include: 

25 or more certified new jobs that paid at least 175% of the prosperity region median wage;
25 or more certified new jobs at a facility in a county with a population of up to 50,000 that paid at least 135% of the prosperity region median wage;
250 or more certified new jobs that paid at least 150% of the prosperity region median wage; and
1,000 or more certified new jobs that paid at least 150% of the prosperity region median wage, if the applicant also proposed investments in the facility that exceeded $1 billion.




Singh said that the bills, introduced in June, were similar to the state’s previous Good Jobs for Michigan program. The “good jobs” program had a two year sunset, but the Legislature did not extend the sunset. That opened the opportunity to create a new tool – the Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve Fund, or SOAR, which has been the subject of controversy and has a poor track record in fulfilling its stated goal.
“I don’t know if I’ve found anyone in either party or either chamber that has been very excited about that program,” Singh said. “That program has sort of lived its life and it’s time for us to find different types of tools.”
Singh added that the goal of the proposed “prosperity regions” and median hourly rates are to ensure that the jobs being created and incentivized are higher paying jobs compared to the median wage of the area.
Singh said he had some conversations with colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle, which led him to consider that some smaller counties might not ever get to the 150% or 175% threshold of the median income, so a piece was created in the bill for rural areas, with businesses there being able to apply with targets of jobs with pay 135% of the area median wage.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Again, this is for smaller projects, so 25 new jobs, and we specifically gear that toward counties of 50,000 and below,” Singh said.
Sen. Jeremy Moss (D-Bloomfield), the committee’s chair, said Singh was taking a thoughtful approach to hear concerns on all sides. He added that all of the incentives mentioned could be for naught if the Legislature can’t get local government and agency buy-in. Moss said he fought for that with the Good Jobs legislation and with SOAR, but he didn’t have to do that this time because Singh baked in local hearings and community votes as part of the new process.
Singh said local control was definitely a component in the new legislation.
“We can always create stronger language if there is a desire, but we want to allow the local community the ability to sort of create what the right mechanism is for themselves,” Singh said.
Sen. Dan Lauwers (R-Brockway) said that programs like the one being proposed, and previously enacted, tend to take taxpayer money from businesses and if they are not eligible, they don’t receive the incentive, but a competitor might now have an advantage.
“It seems a little unrealistic in even how it operates,” Lauwers added. “If these programs took people that were not working and put them to work, I would be recommending this. That’s great, but I have lived through enough of these programs to know what happens when a new employer comes to town and they pay a premium over the going rate. It’s not the people who aren’t working who go to work for this new company. It’s the people that are already working for me and my other colleagues.”
Lauwers said that puts businesses in positions where they now have to go out and recruit, which could take years and additional investment.

,DC,2025-12-03 21:05:12+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,US Senate panel seeks speedy bipartisan deal on health insurance subsidies,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-panel-seeks-speedy-bipartisan-deal-health-insurance-subsidies,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate committee that oversees health care started coalescing around an approach to lower costs for Americans during a Wednesday hearing, though several hurdles lay ahead.Republicans and Democrats on the panel appeared to accept that enhanced tax credits for people who purchase their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act marketplace should not expire at the end of the year. Just days are left for open enrollment and premiums are expected to greatly increase. The bipartisan momentum among a select group of senators will need to build significantly in the days ahead if an extension of the subsidies is going to speedily garner the 60 votes needed to advance in the Senate and then move through the GOP-controlled House. It will also need President Donald Trump’s signature to become law, and he has so far not signaled support for an extension.“I'm hoping that we can find a bill that can get 60 votes, that can fix the problem with the exchanges for January 1, 2026,” Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Bill Cassidy, R-La., said. “It shouldn't be a Republican solution. It shouldn’t be a Democratic solution. It should be an American solution.”Cassidy cautioned lawmakers on the panel from pressing for “grandiose ideas,” saying Congress must “have a solution for three weeks from now.”  A ‘political problem’ seen for the GOPBut extending the ACA marketplace subsidies, possibly with tweaks, is just a short-term solution that senators on the committee agreed will need to be followed up with an overhaul of the American health care system. Any efforts on larger-scale legislation will bump up against the deeply entrenched politics of the Affordable Care Act, well-funded lobbyists and next year’s midterm elections, none of which will make the process easy. Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, the ranking member on the panel, said he appreciated Cassidy’s “sentiment about wanting to do something quickly,” but said Republicans should have focused on the expiring ACA tax credits earlier in the year, instead of leaving it until now.  “The reason for this hearing, to be frank, is that my Republican friends understand they’ve got a political problem,” Sanders said. “Their political problem is that all over America today, people on the Affordable Care Act are opening up packages coming from the insurance companies, and guess what? Their premiums on average are doubling and in some cases in my state are tripling or quadrupling.”Sanders said Congress should extend the enhanced ACA marketplace tax credits for another year, or two, or three, while lawmakers sort through larger, structural issues around health care costs. “Yes, the current system is broken. Yes, we need to create a new system,” Sanders said. “But unfortunately, we aren't going to do it in two weeks.”Sanders suggested the committee hold a series of hearings in the months ahead featuring leaders from other developed countries that provide health care to all of their residents.Extensions of tax credits debatedMaine Republican Sen. Susan Collins said “there's a limit to what we can do in this first year” and that lawmakers are “going to need a two-year plan.”Collins indicated that she wants to see “reasonable” income caps to limit eligibility for ACA marketplace tax credits in any short-term extension that Congress may pass. Washington state Democratic Sen. Patty Murray said Republicans who are serious about addressing the spike in costs for ACA marketplace enrollees should work with Democrats to pass a “clean, one-year extension” of the enhanced subsidies. “And if their call for reforming tax credits is serious, we should look at that. We can talk about those reforms ahead of the 2027 year,” Murray said. “But I have to say, I'm not optimistic that most Republicans are serious about this because they refused to talk about this problem before right now, and I've been down this road before.”Murray also rebuked Cassidy for not focusing the committee’s attention on the expiring tax credits earlier in the year by taking a swipe at his vote to confirm Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.“This is about as serious as expressing concern about RFK Jr.'s anti-vax crusade after voting to make him the most powerful public health official in the country,” Murray said.‘Reasonable caps’ backedAlaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski said members of the committee need to focus on what the next few months and years look like for Americans' health care costs. “I think we're going to need to have a short-term extension. But I think we can put reasonable caps on. I think that we can put some of the parameters that we have been talking about. There's no great secret sauce here to how we're going to deal with this particular dilemma that we're in,” Murkowski said. “But we've got to be looking longer term to — how do we ultimately reduce these costs of care?”Murkowski said she was also concerned about a decrease in funding for public health and prevention initiatives, before asking the witnesses appearing before the committee what their top recommendations would be for “prevention-type programs that have the strongest evidence for reducing long-term costs.”Joel White, president of the Council for Affordable Health Coverage in Washington, D.C., said Congress should allow “premium discounts in the individual market for wellness programs,” which he said is currently illegal.Marcie Strouse, owner and partner at Capitol Benefits Group in Des Moines, Iowa, suggested lawmakers open up health savings accounts “to allow for more holistic and preventive services.” She also said Congress could highlight “direct primary care and making sure people are actually getting the care that they need.”Dr. Claudia M. Fegan, national coordinator at Physicians for a National Health Program in Chicago, suggested enhanced primary care and screening people for diseases like cancer that can be easier to treat when caught early. Wisconsin Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin said the hearing clearly demonstrated that there is “underlying agreement that this system needs a lot of reform.”But, she said, Congress needs to take a look at the entire health care system, not just the Affordable Care Act. “I want to make a point that just under 50% of Americans get their health insurance through employers or group insurance, 20% are on Medicaid, 15% on Medicare, 1% on TRICARE or VA, and just over 6% are in this market,” Baldwin said. “There are problems with this market. But I have to say that abandoning the ACA … is not going to solve the system as a whole.”Ohio Republican Sen. Jon Husted appeared supportive of a short-term extension of the enhanced ACA tax credits to provide Congress more time to address larger issues with health care affordability.“We can freeze the subsidies where they're at right now for a temporary period of time. I don't know if that's one year or two years to help give some relief,” he said. “And by the way, just because we continue those tax credits does not drive down the cost. It transfers the burden to the taxpayer and future generations. But it is a little help right now that we both can agree on. And then we’ve got to fix it.” Husted said there are easily a dozen bills that Congress could take up individually to start bringing down health care costs. Hawley offers plan for health costs tax exemptionMissouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley also appeared to side with extending the enhanced ACA marketplace tax credits in the short term.“We are looking at a massive crisis unless Congress acts and acts soon,” Hawley said. “And my message is to the leadership of this body — to the leaders of the House, the leaders of the Senate —maybe it's time we all locked ourselves in a room and got to a solution here.”Halwey pitched a bill he just introduced to exempt health care from taxes. “If you pay premiums, you ought to be able to deduct that from your taxes. If you have out-of-pocket medical expenses, you ought to be able to deduct every dollar off of your taxes. You want to lower the cost of health care immediately. Do that. No taxes on health care for any American,” Hawley said. “And you set an upper limit so you don't have rich people gaming the system. I get it. That's fine.

If enough signatures were collected, the map will be placed on hold until voters decide its fate at the ballot box next year. 
“This unprecedented show of grassroots power signals the overwhelming public demand for Missourians to have a say in whether (the map) becomes law,” People Not Politicians, the political action committee behind the referendum campaign, said in a statement Wednesday.

The new map was crafted at the urging of President Donald Trump in order to give Republicans control of seven of Missouri’s eight seats in Congress. To do it, GOP lawmakers broke up the Kansas City-based 5th District represented by Democrat Emanuel Cleaver.
Soon after lawmakers passed the map, People Not Politicians submitted paperwork for a referendum to the Missouri secretary of state. Since then, the group has raised millions of dollars — mostly from out-of-state nonprofits who don’t have to disclose their donors — and reportedly collected more than 200,000 signatures. 
To succeed, a referendum petition must have at least 106,000 signatures from registered voters distributed among six of the state’s eight congressional districts.
From the moment the referendum campaign launched, Republicans have worked overtime to undermine it.
Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a first-term Republican, announced he would not accept any signatures collected before the governor signed the new map into law, a move that would invalidate more than 90,000 signatures. A Cole County judge is scheduled to hear arguments over that decision next week. 
Missouri GOP goes scorched earth to keep its gerrymandered map off the 2026 ballot

Hoskins is also in court defending the ballot summary he wrote for the referendum in which he informs voters the map “better reflects statewide voting patterns” and replaces a “gerrymandered” version that “protects incumbent politicians.”
Attorney General Catherine Hanaway filed a federal lawsuit arguing that even though the congressional map is a piece of legislation approved by the General Assembly, it should not be subject to a citizen referendum. 
Hanaway has also accused a company hired by People Not Politicians to collect signatures of bringing undocumented immigrants into the state to assist with the campaign. The attorney general has presented no evidence to support this claim, and the company has adamantly denied it. 
The company, Advanced Micro Targeting, filed a federal lawsuit alleging four Republican consulting firms are involved in an effort to pay the company’s employees to abandon their work, turn over any signatures they gathered and badmouth the company — all to sabotage the petition drive.
The Republican National Committee has bombarded Missourians with text messages attacking the referendum campaign, and on Wednesday, the president’s son — Donald Trump Jr. — called People Not Politicians Director Richard Von Gahn a “leftist nut” on social media, drawing a response from the Missouri Republican Party accusing Von Gahn of being a “communist.”

Alan Powell, a Hartwell Republican, said the committee's concerns revolved around declining profits amid increased spending. Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderThe head of the Georgia Lottery painted a rosy picture of the lottery’s contribution to education at a Georgia House committee hearing Wednesday, but lawmakers pressed Georgia Lottery Corporation CEO Gretchen Corbin about spending and long-term revenue trends amid a slowdown in lottery sales.
The Georgia House Regulated Industries Committee hearing served as a financial checkup for what is now the state’s only major current form of legal gambling, coming amid the ongoing work of the House Study Committee on Gaming in the State of Georgia, which is tasked with researching the impacts of expanded gambling. Another committee, the Senate Study Committee on Making Georgia the No. 1 State for Tourism, recently published its legislative recommendations, which include expanding gambling through legalizing sports betting.
“Concerns that I had are we’re looking at a decrease in the net (revenue) as we see the (expenses) increase going up, and I think that’s where the genesis of a lot of the questions is going to be coming from,” said Hartwell Republican state Rep. Alan Powell, the chair of the committee.

Corbin said the Georgia Lottery has returned more than $30 billion to the state for education since its inception in 1993, supporting over 2.25 million students through the HOPE Scholarship and Grant programs and more than 2.2 million children through the Georgia Pre-K program.
“We are thinking of these students when we walk into the building. We’re thinking of the students when we walk out of the building, and we see, and we know, and we hold tightly to our responsibility to provide the greatest amount of revenue to send to you and the governor to allocate for education,” Corbin said.
Corbin also touted what she called the lottery’s strong start to the current fiscal year, with a revenue of $414.8 million in the first quarter and a profit of $51 million, which she said was the strongest in the lottery’s history.
Despite the positive tone, lawmakers pressed Corbin on a recent slowdown in traditional lottery sales  — for fiscal year 2024, gross ticket sales decreased by $132.8 million, or 2.2% as compared to 2023, according to the Georgia Lottery’s 2025 financial report. 
Corbin said the recent fluctuations are due to economic “anomal(ies),” including the COVID-19 pandemic and years with unusually high numbers of large-jackpot draws, such as six separate $1 billion jackpots in one period.
“During that year, we had over six $1 billion jackpots, and so that was an anomaly. The industry had never seen over six $1 billion jackpots,” Corbin said.
Lawmakers also questioned lottery officials on the substantial budget for advertising and vendor contracts — the lottery spent $53 million on marketing last year. Committee members asked about a dip in net returns, raising questions about the return on investment from the marketing’s sizable budget.
“It seems like the education is getting the crumbs here,” said Rep. Karen Bennett, a Stone Mountain Democrat.
Corbin defended the spending, pointing to independent evaluations showing that the value exceeds the cost.
The committee floated the possibility of conducting a performance audit to evaluate the efficiency of the Georgia Lottery’s’s operations.
“I would like to maybe, for the purview of the committee, that maybe it is time that we see a performance audit done to evaluate certain things, if that’s the wishes of the committee,” Powell said before adjourning.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/P1030620-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-12-03 15:58:40.566192

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)TAMPA — Democrats and voting rights advocates this week voiced vehement opposition to Gov. Ron DeSantis’ call to redistrict Florida’s congressional map in a special session next year, calling it an “illegal” gerrymander in violation of the Florida Constitution.
Not surprisingly, Desantis disagrees.
The governor was asked Wednesday whether he feared a strong turnout for Democrats in the 2026 midterms could backfire on Republicans creating a new map and actually put more of the state’s 28 congressional districts in play.
“They’re not allowed to use the partisan data,” he said of the Legislature’s intent in creating a new congressional map for 2026.
The governor was alluding to a section of the Florida Fair District amendments passed by the voters in 2010 saying no reapportionment plan or individual district can be drawn “with the intent to favor or disfavor a political party or incumbent.”
Another section says districts cannot be drawn with the “intent or result of denying or abridging the equal opportunity of racial or language minorities to participate in the political process or to diminish their ability to elect representatives of their choice.”
In 2022, DeSantis vetoed the congressional map sent to him by the Republican-dominated Florida Legislature and reconfigured a district in North Florida to erase Black representation in that area and help elect more Republicans to Congress.
Voting rights groups sued in both state and federal court, claiming the map violated Fair Districts, but both lawsuits were unsuccessful. The Florida Supreme Court upheld the DeSantis-approved map in July, writing that the old Congressional District 5 map likely was an illegal race-based gerrymander that violated federal equal-protection rights. A panel of federal judges also upheld the constitutionality of the 2022 map a year ago.
Texas (and several other states around the country) undertook to redraw their congressional maps this year following a demand to do so by President Donald Trump in July.
1965 Voting Rights Act
DeSantis said his motivation for redrawing congressional districts is that the state will “be forced to do it because the Supreme Court’s VRA [Voting Rights Act] decision is going to impact the current map. No matter what else, that is going to have to be addressed.”
The U.S Supreme Court heard oral arguments in October in a case out of Louisiana that could lead to sweeping changes in longstanding rules requiring mapmakers to ensure that racial minorities get a chance to be an electoral majority or plurality in some areas.
The court is using the case to determine whether Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act remains constitutional. The section prohibits voting laws or procedures that deny or abridge voting rights due to a person’s “race or color” or membership in a language minority.
In July, the governor said it was “appropriate” for the state to conduct a mid-decade congressional redistricting because he contends Florida unfairly lost a seat to which it was entitled in the 2020 U.S. Census. He followed up on that in August, saying he and Attorney General James Uthmeier supported an update to the 2020 Census.
No update to U.S. Census 
That hasn’t happened, however, and DeSantis acknowledged in Tampa Wednesday that it likely wouldn’t. He insisted it’s still appropriate to do the redistricting in Florida because the state’s political demographics have changed significantly since 2020, with Republicans surpassing Democrats in voter registration over the past five years (more than 1.4 million additional Republicans).
“I just haven’t seen the movement that I was hoping for,” he said about an updated Census.
“When did the Census stop? It stopped basically at the end of March of 2020. But what’s happened in Florida since then? We’ve had a big population [increase]. So, the districts are not well apportioned, and I don’t think that people are getting equal representation. And that was a demographic shift that I don’t know that we’ve necessarily seen in modern history before.”
DeSantis’ call for a special session on the topic following the regular legislative session would seem to fly in the face of efforts about to be undertaken by the Florida House, which will begin its own committee meetings on the issue Thursday afternoon.
The governor did not respond to the Phoenix’s question to him Wednesday as to whether his special session means the House’s work during the regular session may prove irrelevant.
Asked if his staff were already working on alternative congressional maps, he said no.
“There’s nothing that anyone on my staff has done with respect to actually doing the map,” he said.
Meanwhile, state Rep. Daryl Campbell, D-Fort Lauderdale, filed a resolution Wednesday (HJR 619) that attempts to end partisan gerrymandering once and for all. He would allow voters to decide via a constitutional amendment whether to create independent commissions (one each for the state House, state Senate, and Congress) to redraw legislative and congressional districts.
“The people should choose their representatives, not the other way around. These commissions would be made up of regular Floridians — not lawmakers, not lobbyists, not campaign insiders,” Campbell said in a press release. “If you’ve recently made money in politics, you’re out.

Although evidence of a new infusion of bloodlines is lacking, both transplant animals are alive, and breeding is anticipated to occur soon if it hasn’t already. 
The post What happened to the grizzlies Wyoming trucked in from Montana to boost genetic diversity? appeared first on WyoFile .","In the months after Grizzly 1126F hit the ground in Wyoming two summers ago, the young translocated bear went on an impressive walkabout that had state biologists eagerly watching her movements. 
And move she did.
“She moves everywhere,” said Dan Thompson, who leads large carnivore management for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. 
Grizzly 1126F’s unique history ups the intrigue in her travels all over the map. The 4-year-old sow is one of two bears that were trucked south from Montana’s Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem in July 2024, along with Grizzly 1129M, a male. The translocation, partly in response to a federal judge’s 2018 ruling, was intended to increase the genetic diversity of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem’s population of grizzlies, which remains geographically isolated.  
So where’d Grizzly 1126F go after being captured near Montana’s Middle Fork Flathead River and deposited southwest of Togwotee Pass in the Blackrock Creek drainage? 
“She has made several loops around the entire ecosystem,” Thompson said. “Around Yellowstone, into Idaho, up toward Cody. Then she went down toward Jackson, Wilson, into Idaho again and came back across the north end of the Tetons.” 
The female grizzly has stopped, for now, to den at a remote site deep in the Teton Wilderness beyond the North Fork of the Buffalo Fork River, he said.

Meanwhile, the translocated male has had the opposite proclivity since being turned loose along a remote shoreline of Yellowstone Lake. Grizzly 1129M basically stayed put. 
“He really has maintained a location in the southern half of Yellowstone, south of Yellowstone Lake,” Thompson said. 
Typically, males make big dispersals and females stay put — the opposite of what’s happened with the translocated grizzlies. It’s led biologists to joke that they missexed the two animals. They didn’t, Thompson said.
Ultimately, it’s not where grizzlies 1126F and 1129M go that’s most important to those biologists. It’s what they do: Ideally, other grizzlies. The goal is for them to reproduce.
“She should have bred this year,” Thompson said, “so it’ll be interesting to see if she has cubs this spring.” 
Grizzly bear crews that keep close tabs on the population will be monitoring to see if that’s the case. 
Ascertaining whether Grizzly 1129M has spread his genes will be less straightforward. The boar is also estimated to be 4 years old, which isn’t considered a “prime age,” Thompson said, but he still should have bred females in summer 2025.
“We can only discern that through DNA tests,” he said. 
Eventually, analyses of blood extracted during routine grizzly bear captures will be able to pinpoint bears on the landscape that have genetic markers from both the Greater Yellowstone and Northern Continental Divide populations.

For now, Thompson and his fellow carnivore managers are just happy that both bears have stayed within the Yellowstone region and stayed out of trouble — neither has been involved in any known conflict.  
The translocation of two grizzlies was an interagency effort that’s related to the status of the species: Ursus arctos horribilis is classified as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Populations in both western Montana’s Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem and the tri-state Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem are considered robust and have long exceeded goals, but about 35 miles separate the two populations and there has never been a proven case of a grizzly departing one recovery zone and breeding in another. (They’ve come close: In 2023, a Yellowstone ecosystem bear dispersed to the northeast and ended up in Montana’s Pryor Mountains.)
North Montana’s grizzlies are connected to a much larger Canadian population, and so specifically, biologists want to see new genetic material introduced to the isolated Yellowstone population. It’s unclear if that’s happened yet, but there are no grave concerns about inbred grizzlies.
“This was not because we were worried about the genetic vigor of the population,” Thompson said. 
But the 2018 ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Dana Christensen, which overturned the states’ bid to manage and hunt grizzlies, cited concerns about the population’s long-term genetic health. The federal judge out of Montana faulted the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for not planning to intervene unless “the Greater Yellowstone grizzly’s genetic health is demonstrably weakened.”
“In short, the Service has failed to demonstrate that genetic diversity within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, long-recognized as a threat to the Greater Yellowstone grizzly’s continued survival, has become a non-issue,” Christensen wrote. 
Seven years later, two grizzlies born in Northern Montana — 1126F and 1129M — are spending their winters in Wyoming den sites. Evidence that they’ve reproduced could be months away.

Javitz Federal Building on Sept. 3, 2025, in New York City. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)The Wisconsin Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to hear a lawsuit from the immigrant-rights group Voces de la Frontera against the authority of the state’s county sheriffs to hold people in county jails based on detainers from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
The lawsuit from Voces will be immediately heard by the Supreme Court as an original action, meaning it won’t begin at the circuit court level and work its way up to the Supreme Court. The case comes as jurisdictions across the country wrestle with the effects of the Trump administration’s increased immigration enforcement and the level to which local law enforcement should participate.  
Courts in New York, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Montana have previously ruled that state law bars local law enforcement officers from complying with federal immigration detainers. A state law in Illinois prohibits local cooperation with federal immigration agents. 
Here in Wisconsin, more than a dozen county sheriffs offices have signed 287(g) agreements with ICE that grant sheriff’s deputies some immigration enforcement authority, including the ability to question people in custody about their immigration status and hold people in jail under federal detainers. 
The Dodge County sheriff maintains an agreement with the federal government to hold many types of federal detainees in the department’s jail — including immigrants. That agreement includes sheriff’s deputies transporting detained migrants to and from a controversial ICE facility in Broadview, Ill. 
Some departments in the state, including Madison and Milwaukee, have explicitly said they won’t cooperate with federal immigration efforts. 
Voces’ lawsuit argues that state law does not give Wisconsin law enforcement officers the authority to conduct civil immigration enforcement. 
In accepting the case, the Court said it would consider whether Wisconsin sheriffs have the authority to arrest people as part of a civil immigration enforcement action and how 287(g) agreements affect the application of state law. 
Departing from usual practice in which state Supreme Court decisions to accept cases are unsigned, conservative Justices Annette Ziegler and Rebecca Bradley dissented from the decision to hear the case. 
In a written opinion, conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn wrote Supreme Court rules state it takes four justices to agree to accept an original action and that normally these decisions are unsigned to prevent observers from inferring if the justices hold pre-established views on an issue. He added that just because some justices publicly dissented, that does not reveal how every justice voted in the decision to accept the case. 
“The public may begin to infer that if a justice does not publicly dissent to an order granting review in a case, that justice has joined the order taking the case,” he wrote. “That assumption would be unwarranted. Even if some of my colleagues publicly record their dissent, as in this case, that does not necessarily reveal which justices voted for or against the petition in closed conference. A grant order simply means the requisite number of justices voted to grant a petition — in this case, four —nothing more.”
Under Wednesday’s order, Voces has 30 days to file a brief in the case.

(Photo by John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)In some of his first public remarks since taking the helm of the South Dakota Department of Corrections, Secretary Nick Lamb told an oversight commission Wednesday that the state “has a long way to go” to address challenges in its prison system.
Gov. Larry Rhoden appointed Lamb in late October, days after the departure of former Secretary Kellie Wasko, who announced her resignation weeks before the state Legislature voted to endorse the construction of a $650 million men’s prison in Sioux Falls.
Lamb came to South Dakota in mid-November with decades of correctional experience, most recently in Iowa.

He took the helm of an agency bedeviled for half a decade by controversies, among them:

A staff shakeup over allegations of nepotism and harassment by prison leadership, spurring a revolving door of wardens and cabinet secretaries.
Unrest among inmates that left offenders and staff members injured in Sioux Falls and Springfield.
Heated pushback against a men’s prison construction proposal that forced Rhoden to restart discussions — and cost taxpayers $20 million in sunk costs on a prison site in Lincoln County that was abandoned for a location in Sioux Falls.
A tally of fatal prison overdoses higher than the state has seen in recent memory, which have persisted in the face of investigations and arrests.

Lamb spoke for less than two minutes in his introduction to the Corrections Commission, which met virtually for the second time since the group’s new leadership signaled their intention to expand their involvement in prison policy discussions.
The new secretary talked about “a very busy three and a half weeks” meeting staff and reviewing policy and thanked Wasko for her leadership and her “great work” during her three and a half years with the agency.
Lamb said much needs to be done, particularly with two new prisons in the works (a women’s prison in Rapid City, in addition to the men’s prison in Sioux Falls) and persistent challenges with staff retention, repeat offenses and security concerns inside existing prisons.
Overdoses addressed in, out of commission setting
Lamb also offered a nod to the overdoses, the most recent of which came last week at the maximum-security Jameson Annex of the South Dakota State Penitentiary in Sioux Falls.
“South Dakota is not any different than any other state with its continued struggle with synthetic cannabinoids,” Lamb said, referring to synthetic drugs like K2, which is responsible for most of the eight overdose deaths that have occurred in 2025.
State apologizes, but can’t explain missing evidence in prison overdose case

Lamb did not elaborate on the extent of the drug problem in other states, but news reports on the issue have appeared in multiple states this year. Kansas officials cited K2, which typically lands in prison on paper that’s been soaked with intoxicants and dried out for distribution, as the reason for restricting access to newspapers. A jail in Wisconsin signaled plans to scan all inmate mail for delivery via electronic tablet in an effort to restrict access to K2, mirroring a policy in place since 2021 at state institutions.
South Dakota has long had such a scanning policy for inmate mail, all of which is delivered via tablet.
Attorney General Marty Jackley’s office has investigated each of the South Dakota overdose deaths, and issued charges for an inmate and Colorado resident accused, respectively, of delivering the drugs involved in two of those deaths. Separate to those charges, Jackley’s office indicted other inmates and a former correctional officer in September for allegedly distributing K2 in prison.
Three more inmates have died of overdoses since the September indictments. In an interview that aired Wednesday on South Dakota Public Broadcasting, Jackley told Lori Walsh that there are other investigations involving other correctional officers, and that he intends to work with lawmakers to stiffen penalties for drug-dealing Department of Corrections staffers.
“Absolutely these deaths are preventable,” Jackley said.
Commissioners pledge greater oversight
At the Corrections Commission meeting that began a few hours after Jackley’s remarks hit the airwaves, the group’s members doubled down on their September promise to take a more active role in prison policy.
The commission’s role diminished under Wasko’s tenure, typically only voting to approve meeting minutes and hear financial updates on prison industries, even as the law that created the group defined it as one meant to advise the Department of Corrections.
David McGirr, a longtime commission member, agitated for a more active role in mid-2024. On Wednesday, he again pointed out that past commissions had such a role, and encouraged the lawmakers now serving to endorse a return.
Head of state prison system wants to ‘close the doors’ to public scrutiny of security incidents

“Secretary Wasko felt like she didn’t have to share anything with us because we aren’t elected officials, but we’re appointed by the governor,” McGirr said.
Although some of the board members are not elected officials, others are. One of the new members, Sioux Falls Republican state Rep. John Hughes, told McGirr he agreed, and called out the overdose situation as proof that the group needs to step up its oversight.
Hughes said he spent the weekend reading up on K2, and was troubled by the impact it’s had in South Dakota.
“The inmate deaths are sickening,” Hughes said, adding that inmates are “our people” during their time in state custody.
“We have to own the responsibility for these people,” he said.
Lamb did not speak up to address his view on the commission’s role, and no commissioner asked him to.
Rep. Kadyn Wittman, D-Sioux Falls, now chair of the group, said she intends to call more frequent meetings in the coming years, noting that she called December’s meeting — one more than the group had on its calendar prior to her ascension — to set that tone.
“It didn’t sit right that we met so infrequently,” Wittman said.

Gretchen Whitmer is applauding a $400 million grant to support the deployment of two small modular nuclear reactors at the same West Michigan Nuclear plant pursuing a first-in-the-nation restart. 
U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement on Tuesday that the reactors would supply power to support manufacturing as well as data centers and the growth of artificial intelligence. 
Whitmer cheered the announcement as a win for energy affordability and business in the state. 
“Today’s announcement will lower energy costs, reaffirm Michigan’s clean energy leadership, and show the world that we are the best place to do business,” Whitmer said in the Tuesday statement. “This historic investment will double Palisades’ capacity, provide more clean energy for Michigan homes and businesses, and protect good-paying Michigan jobs.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
After the Palisades plant was shuttered in 2022, it was sold to Holtec, which has been working to restart the plant with the federal government granting the company a $1.5 billion conditional loan. The United States Department of Agriculture has also awarded Palisades more than  $1.3 billion to help restore service. However, the restart has received pushback from some environmentalists and anti-nuclear advocates raising safety concerns in reviving the reactor.
While the reactor is set to produce 800 megawatts of energy upon resuming operations, the two modular reactors supported by the $400 million award will add an additional 680 megawatts of power to the facility, 340 megawatts per unit. 
Kevin Kamps, a radioactive waste watchdog with the group Beyond Nuclear, raised concerns about having multiple reactors on the same site, pointing to the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident, in which a massive earthquake struck Japan causing three of the plant’s six reactors to meltdown, leading to the release of radioactive material. 
“If you’ve got a zombie reactor that’s essentially 60 years old next to brand-new, untested reactors, the test is happening in real time on these designs and their construction,” Kamps told Michigan Advance. “You have both extremes of the risk spectrum.”
According to the World Nuclear Association, there are only two small modular reactors in operation globally: one in Russia and one in China. Due to the limited development and deployment of the facilities, the technology is generally considered unproven. A report from Stanford University also found that these reactors could produce two to 30 times the amount of nuclear waste compared to a traditional reactor. 
Alongside his concerns about safety, Kamps also questioned the financials around the award, calling it a “bailout” for Holtec.
“They’re gouging us, and Governor Whitmer says it’s great we’re lowering energy costs. On whose back?” Kamps said, emphasizing that Michiganders pay both state and federal taxes.

Jeffery Walker, who was a Flex Unit officer, pleaded guilty Tuesday to one count of deprivation of rights under color of law – when a person acting with government authority wilfully deprives another of a constitutionally protected right. 
The felony charge carries up to a decade in prison, a $250,000 fine, three years of supervised release and a $100 special assessment. 
He is scheduled for sentencing on April 8 and will remain free until then  on a $10,000 unsecured bond. Plea documents weren’t immediately available Wednesday. 
Walker’s plea comes the day he was set to begin a jury trial. 
On July 27, 2022, Walker drove an unmarked police car and tried to stop a car driven by a man identified as E.S. in court records. The man led Walker on a pursuit, which several Jackson Police Department officers joined. 
The chase ended when Walker cut E.S. off, causing the officer to run into a tree and the man to swerve into a yard. A Jackson police officer pulled E.S. from the car and handcuffed him. 
While the man was under control and handcuffed, Walker slammed E.S.’s head into the hood of his car and kicked him in the head and face while he was on the ground, according to court records. 
Walker also faces state charges for another incident while working for Capitol Police. 
He and Officer Michael Rhinewalt were indicted for aggravated assault stemming from the Aug. 14, 2022, shooting of Sinatra Jordan and Sherita Harris. 
Harris was the passenger in a car Jordan was driving that Capitol Police officers stopped near State and Amite streets. Walker and Rhinewalt were later identified as those who opened fire.
A civil lawsuit Harris filed in 2023 which represents one side of a legal argument, alleges Jordan initially complied with a command to pull over, but then tried to drive away when shots were fired into the car. Gunfire hit Harris in the head and required her to undergo surgery to remove the bullet fragments. She has suffered “permanent neurological and facial injuries,” according to the lawsuit.
Walker and Rhinewalt were expected to start trial Monday. The trial did not take place, and court records do not list an updated trial date. 
Jordan, the driver, was charged in 2023 with fleeing felony law enforcement, assault on a law enforcement officer, resisting arrest and possession of marijuana. 
In March, he pleaded guilty to fleeing law enforcement, which was reduced to a misdemeanor, and the other charges were dropped. He received a six-month sentence, and as of Wednesday, prison records do not show anyone under his name incarcerated.  
Harris’ civil lawsuit has been put on hold until the state cases are finished.
Rhinewalt is facing another state charge from his role with Capitol Police.
He and now former Capitol Police Officer Steven Frederick Jr. were indicted for manslaughter in the Sept. 25, 2022, death of Jaylen Lewis during a traffic stop on East Mayes Street. 
They are scheduled to go to trial in Hinds County on Dec. 8. 
The officers, who were conducting a drug narcotics operation, saw the car driven by Lewis turn and then run a red light on another street. They turned on their police lights to pull the 22-year-old over and blocked him from moving forward with their car.  
The former officers reportedly told investigators that one of them shot Lewis in the head in self-defense because he drove his car toward them. 
A federal lawsuit by Lewis’ mother, which represents one side of a legal argument, states he reversed his car and bumped the cruiser behind him, and it states that he did not show a weapon, reach for one, “or take other actions that could be reasonably perceived as endangering officers or others.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/06120328/Capitol-Police-4.jpg,,,2025-12-03 15:58:40.566192

Firefighters who responded to the blaze reported dropping retardant nearly 2,500 times, according to data the Santa Fe National Forest provided to Source New Mexico. (Courtesy SFNF)Firefighters responding to the 2022 Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire reported nearly 2,500 retardant drops as they fought the blaze that destroyed hundreds of homes in Northern New Mexico, according to data the federal Forest Service provided Source New Mexico.
Where those drops occurred — and what was in the retardant — is the subject of renewed interest after an independent geologic study discovered elevated levels of potentially dangerous contaminants, including arsenic, antimony and uranium, in 72 private wells in the burn scar, mostly in Mora County. 
Kate Zeigler, the geologist who discovered the metals, has said fire suppressants are a likely culprit behind at least some of the contamination, noting that many of the newly discovered contaminants exist in fire retardant and are not naturally occurring. She also stressed other possible sources of contamination, noting fire suppressants “are most likely not the sole and only source.”
Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire victims grapple with latest crisis

It’s a “super complex system we’re working to understand,” Zeigler told Source. 
Zeigler’s findings prompted the state Health Department on Nov. 14 to issue a public health alert, and state and local agencies have since moved quickly to provide bottled water and try to expand the number of wells tested.
Testing all the wells in and around the 534-square-mile area the fire burned through  has emerged as a key next step in mitigating the issue, local leaders said at a meeting last week at a Mora library. But that could prove to be quite an undertaking, according to a Source New Mexico analysis. 
A little more than 900 are registered with the Office of the State Engineer in the burn scar alone, according to OSE data Source analyzed. That’s more than twice as many as Zeigler and others  previously estimated and doesn’t include unregistered wells or those outside the burned area that draw from the same aquifer. 
Stacy Timmons, assistant director for hydrology programs at the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources, reviewed the OSE data at Source’s request. She confirmed Source’s findings about the number of wells, but noted location data might be inaccurate for some of the older wells. 
The average  depth of those wells is about 224 feet, though two are more than 1,000 feet and others as shallow as 16 feet, according to the OSE data. The wells Zeigler has tested up to this point are all less than 100 feet deep, though she’s monitoring a handful of deeper “gatekeeper” wells, she said, to detect whether contaminants are deep in the aquifer. 


So far, no contaminants have been found more than 100 feet deep, she said. The deeper the contaminants spread, the harder mitigation will be, she said. 
As for determining the role of fire suppressants, a spokesperson for the United States Forest Service said the agency is joining the search for an answer.
“We remain committed to working with local communities, Mora County commissioners and Dr. Zeigler to help identify the source of heavy metals,” Claudia Brookshire, a spokesperson for the Santa Fe National Forest, told Source in an email.
New Mexico officials, Mora residents say feds should respond to groundwater contamination

Brookshire noted that the retardant drop information the Forest Service collects may include “missing or duplicate data.” That’s because not all aircraft that responded to the wildfire— the largest in state history—were equipped with equipment to monitor the drops. Not all aircraft consistently report that data, and some are not required to, Brookshire said. 
Zeigler also reviewed the drop data and believes it could be incomplete. She is asking people who witnessed the fire to send any evidence they have of suppressant drops to her team. As she’s conducted tests, she’s heard multiple reports of retardant dropped in Monte Aplanado and near Morphy Lake, for example, areas that do not appear in the Forest Service data. 
“We’ve been trying to chase down anecdotal stories of people coming back to a house coated in pink dust,” she told Source in an email, referring to the characteristic pink color of the retardant.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/472909739_1002231225279491_2238023694336978293_n-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-12-03 15:58:40.566192

The request was the latest administration effort to extract details about registered voters in the state. Secretary of State Jena Griswold previously shared only publicly available voter roll information in response to U.S. Department of Justice requests. The latest request seeks more sensitive data.
“We will not comply with the Trump Department of Justice’s request for Coloradans’ sensitive voting information,” Griswold, a Democrat, said in a statement. “The DOJ can take a hike; it does not have a legal right to the information. Colorado will not help Donald Trump undermine our elections and hurt the American people.”

The DOJ’s Civil Rights Division asked Griswold’s office on Monday to enter into an agreement to share unredacted voter data including full names, dates of birth, addresses and identification numbers including a full driver’s license number or the last four digits of a Social Security number. 
Griswold’s office has already shared copies of the state’s master voter list and a copy of the master voter history list. The data includes the names of voters, addresses, birth year, and, if provided by the voter, phone numbers. This is all public information.
The agreement the DOJ proposed to Colorado says its purpose is to verify the state’s compliance with federal election record maintenance rules. An attorney with the Civil Rights Division said the new request was a follow-up to the original request in May.










The DOJ can take a hike.


– Jena Griswold, Colorado secretary of state


“Clean voter rolls and basic election safeguards are requisites for free, fair, and transparent elections,” Harmeet Dhillon, assistant attorney general for civil rights, said in a statement. “The DOJ Civil Rights Division has a statutory mandate to enforce our federal voting rights laws, and ensuring the voting public’s confidence in the integrity of our elections is a top priority of this administration.”
The Colorado request is part of a Trump administration effort to collect voter information from states across the country, which raises concerns about the security of the information and future elections, according to election security advocates. The initial Colorado request, which sought “all records” related to the 2024 election, was among the most sweeping. 
Federal officials later acknowledged that the DOJ shared voter roll information with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to search it for noncitizens as a way to “scrub aliens from voter rolls.”
Griswold and other Democratic secretaries of state wrote to Trump administration officials in November expressing concern that the administration misled them about how it would use voter data collected from their states. Griswold has said voter data requests are just one of many ways the Trump administration has “made our elections less secure.”
In response to a Newsline inquiry about the latest request for sensitive data, Natalie Baldassarre, a DOJ spokesperson, included department announcements of lawsuits against other states that refused to supply sensitive voter data, appearing to suggest that Colorado could be at risk. The Trump administration has sued multiple states that have refused to provide the DOJ with their voter rolls.
Jack Todd, a spokesperson for Griswold, said “it certainly seems possible” that Colorado will be sued for refusing to provide voter data considering how many other states the DOJ has sued. “But only time will tell,” he said in a statement.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-03 19:35:25+00:00,CT Mirror,Arbiter gives 2.5% cost-of-living raise plus step increase for 3 CT unions,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/03/arbiter-gives-2-5-cost-of-living-raise-plus-step-increase-for-3-ct-unions/,The COLA and step raise effectively represent a 4.5% increase and could help all state employees get similar raises.,"A labor arbitrator has awarded three bargaining units within Connecticut’s Judicial Branch a 2.5% cost-of-living raise and a step increase this fiscal year, which effectively represents a 4.5% increase.
The raises ordered for judicial marshals, their supervisors and a third group that includes probation officers, information technology analysts, assistant clerks, counselors and other support staff, are retroactive to July 1, when the fiscal year began.
The award announced Wednesday also increases the likelihood that dozens of additional bargaining units in state government — which haven’t yet settled compensation deals — will get similar raises. And if that happens, it will mark the fifth consecutive year state employees’ compensation has increased by about 4.5%. (A step hike typically adds about 2 percentage points to the overall raise value.)
“Every day, we keep our communities running — protecting the public and providing the essential services we all count on,” the unions wrote in a statement directed at Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration. “It’s time to stop the games and respect us.”
Though Judicial Branch administrators technically negotiate with the employees assigned to the court system — just as higher education leaders handle contracts with college and university staff — they follow guidelines set by the governor’s budget office, which handles talks with most of the state’s unionized workforce.
The governor, who repeatedly promised healthy wages for all state workers during the summer and fall, expressed appreciation Wednesday for all state workers.
“My administration continues to negotiate in good faith with all of the Executive Branch unions and has had informal discussions with the [State Employees Bargaining Agent] Coalition regarding health, retirement, and other benefits for the past several months,” Lamont said in a written statement. “As we saw yesterday, when DOT crews worked overtime in Litchfield County to keep our roads safe during the snowstorm, our state employees are the backbone.”
The governor added that “this award is consistent with what we have put on the table in negotiations for our bargaining units for the first year of the contract. It is my hope we can reach a multi-year agreement in the near future with all of our labor partners.”
The administration insisted legislators include more than $200 million in the new state budget adopted last June, which would be sufficient cover 4.5% raises for most workers.
Still, several bargaining units became frustrated once the fiscal year began and new wage agreements had not been resolved. By July 8, all three Judicial Branch units, which represent about 2,100 workers in total, had broken off talks.
By the end of September, that number had grown to six, as unions representing rank-and-file correction officers, their supervisors and various education professionals also declared negotiations to be at an impasse.
Despite the governor’s public promises for healthy raises, the state and unions hadn’t resolved any contracts, disagreeing over work conditions and particularly work-from-home rules established during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Lamont administration has argued that workers should be spending more time in the office, while unions counter remote work is not an impediment to productivity.
This week’s arbitration award only addresses compensation for this fiscal year. The state and more than 30 bargaining units — including the three Judicial Branch units involved in the arbitration award — still must resolve compensation for future years as well as any changes to working conditions.
Tensions between Lamont and state employee unions also have worsened because of employment vacancies.
Labor leaders say the governor, a fiscally moderate Democrat, has left most agencies under-staffed since he took office in 2019 — even as state government has used aggressive budget caps to leave historic levels of money unspent.
“The longer these contracts are delayed, the less our agencies will be able to retain critical talent, let alone recruit effectively to fill the thousands of vacancies” across all departments, the three Judicial Branch units wrote in their statement.
State government has averaged more than $1.8 billion in surpluses since 2017 — which equals 8% to 9% of the General Fund. Lamont’s budget office projects a $2 billion surplus for the current fiscal year.
Given that more than three-quarters of Connecticut’s budget is largely fixed by contract or other legal obligations, 8% or more can be substantial.
These surpluses largely have been used to whittle down Connecticut’s hefty pension debt, which was amassed over seven decades prior to 2011 and still exceeds $33 billion.
Lamont largely has resisted scaling back this debt reduction effort to grow state agency staffing, despite surging overtime expenses.
Still, those surpluses have helped state employees enjoy raises far beyond those offered in the 2010s.
Arbiters consider the state’s ability to pay, among other factors, when deciding whether to order raises. And unions can cite those huge surpluses when seeking arbitration, which means this week’s award could provide a blueprint for more than 30 other bargaining units to seek hikes equal to about 4.5%.
Unions also noted that Lamont and the General Assembly back in May awarded a 2.5% cost-of-living raise and a step hike — effectively a 4.5% raise — to state police troopers for the 2025-26 fiscal year. The trooper’s union is the one major bargaining unit not in the State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_5682.jpg,,,2025-12-03 14:57:50.416400

Ryan Fazio.","John Healey said Wednesday he is leaving as chief of staff to the Senate Republican minority, an acknowledgement that his advocacy of former Mayor Erin Stewart of New Britain for governor puts him at odds with a caucus committed to her GOP rival, Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich.
“What’s become very clear as the weeks go by and as the 2026 season takes hold, it will become difficult to remain,” said Healey, a New Britain native who was Stewart’s first chief of staff after her election in 2013. “Now that she’s all in as governor, I will want to have the freedom to be all in to support her.”
He’s expected to play a significant role in Stewart’s campaign.
Stewart, who had been raising money through an exploratory committee since January, declared her candidacy for the Republican gubernatorial nomination two weeks ago. Fazio, a candidate since August, has been endorsed by key lawmakers, including Healey’s boss, Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding of Brookfield.
Bringing back Healey was among Harding’s first moves after the Senate GOP caucus forced out Sen. Kevin Kelly of Stratford as its leader in February 2024, an unusual if unprecedented change of leadership at mid-term. Kelly’s abrupt dismissal of Healey the previous month was a factor in the demand for new leadership.
Kelly had hired Healey a year earlier, bringing onto his staff a lawyer and campaign operative who had been a senior advisor to House Republican leaders for nearly seven years until departing to become Stewart’s chief of staff.
“That was a very odd circumstance in the history of the legislature,” Healey said. “It has been a great privilege to work alongside Sen. Harding.”
Harding said Healey was crucial in helping with the unusual transition.
“I think John has been awesome for this caucus. The senators love him,” Harding said Wednesday. The decision to leave was Healey’s, Harding said.
Healey is expected to remain as Harding’s top aide into January, giving the senator a month to hire a successor. The annual legislative session opens on Feb. 4.
Healey made a point of praising Fazio and expressed hope the GOP eventually will unite in 2026 as the party tries to unseat Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat seeking a third term.
“I think very, very highly of Sen. Fazio, and I have valued the relationship we have developed over the years,” Healey said. “If I can use my experience to bring the party together when the time comes, I think that will be valuable.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/7DB4C06F-7AA1-4783-900F-4D7CE1D6EC5B-1024x781.jpg,,,2025-12-03 15:58:40.566192

The warning was issued during a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, the latest volley in a battle between states and the federal government over a program that feeds more than 360,000 Connecticut residents.
According to the Associated Press, a USDA spokesperson later explained that the Department of Agriculture would target the administrative funds for the program, not the benefits people receive. 
Officials in Connecticut called the warning “cruel” and indicated they would work to “protect the rights” of state residents should the directive, which had already been challenged in court, become official.
Gov. Ned Lamont released a statement on Wednesday saying that his office is aware of the comments by Rollins. “However, Connecticut has not received any formal notice from USDA that any funds may be impacted,” the governor said. “If a formal warning is received, we will work in collaboration with the Attorney General to protect the rights of Connecticut and its residents.”
In Connecticut, data protections were recently strengthened in a bill that prohibits state and municipal agencies, including schools, from sharing an individual’s address, hours of work, public agency appointments or “any other information that provides the date, time or place where such individual may be located.” That bill was intended to protect immigrant communities from the increased presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. 
Scott Gaul, the state’s chief data officer, said that “the underlying intent of the legislation is to make sure people can trust in government and feel that they can interact with state agencies and the benefits that they’re entitled to.”
But Tuesday’s warning by Rollins indicates that the Trump administration is intent on securing that information.
Connecticut is one of the states that filed a legal motion against the U.S. Department of Agriculture in August over the demand that states hand over personal information. In the complaint, the states argued that while the federal government contends that such information is needed to root out fraud and waste, the information is instead being collected as part of a broader effort to amass a vast database that can be used “for a variety of purposes, including to locate and deport people.”
Immigrant rights groups have rallied for data protections. On Wednesday, Constanza Segovia, organizing director of Connecticut for All coalition and director of Hartford Deportation Defense, said in a statement that the policy was among many waging war on working class families.
“They are using immigrant communities as scapegoats but what they’re really doing is gutting the safety net for all people in our state, tripling the costs of health care for middle class families, and dismantling our public institutions to profit themselves and their billionaire friends,” she said. “Now more than ever we have to stand with working class immigrants, and with all people who work for a living and make our state thrive.”
Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a statement on Wednesday that a court order currently prohibits the U.S. Department of Agriculture from forcing states to turn over this information and that, “court orders are not optional, and we will not hesitate to use every legal tool available to ensure that the Trump Administration respects and follows the law.
“The Trump Administration is free to do its job and prevent fraud and abuse without trolling through grocery lists and years of sensitive personal information for tens of millions of families. And, if they care one bit about American families during the holidays, they will drop this cruel and depraved attack on families and kids.”
Connecticut’s delegation also spoke out against Rollins’ comments.
“I am sickened by President Trump and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins’ continued abuse of hungry families in American,” U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd, said in a statement released Wednesday. 
DeLauro decried the treatment of parents, children, veterans and others who depend on SNAP at a time when the cost of household items and groceries are rising precipitously. “Yet this administration is so cruel and cold-heated that all they see are pawns in their political game,” she said. “They are so out of touch that they think starving our neighbors is good for their politics.”
U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., also equated the Trump administration’s treatment of SNAP recipients as that of “political pawns.
“Donald Trump and his administration see hungry kids and seniors as nothing more than political pawns in his quest for power,” he said. “Since taking office, Trump has slashed billions in funding for food aid, waging an all-out war on hungry families. Now he wants to weaponize hunger to punish his political enemies for daring to obey the law of the land and protect Americans’ private information rather than cave to his demands.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25304719118315-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-03 16:58:53.207857

Both Cramer’s and Tjaden’s leadership terms will end April 30, Bates said. Cramer was appointed to the board in 2023 and his term lasts until 2029, and Tjaden’s term will end in 2031 after being appointed to the board this year.
Cramer outlined three goals for his leadership during the meeting, saying Iowa’s public universities should provide an affordable education, academic excellence and a “fair and balanced place for vigorous debate.”
As Bates directed the board’s investment and finance committee to once again review university efficiencies and new revenue streams, Cramer said some of the work of the board and universities, either already completed or in progress, is already moving his goals forward. He said people at all levels of university operations should continuously work to better academic excellence in order to produce better students and create an atmosphere where students can engage in debate.
As a “bridge builder,” Cramer said this could be his chance to bring together those “who want to make our universities better together.”
“I think we can flip the narrative on higher education, and that is that here in Iowa, a degree from one of our public universities is a great investment, and it’s going to help these students going forward for the rest of their lives,” Cramer said.
Tjaden concurred with Cramer’s goals for the board and universities and said he’s thankful for the trust put in him by his fellow board members.
“Our public universities are among some of the best in the country, and quite frankly, our most valuable assets in the state,” Tjaden said. “And I’m confident with the university leadership, the regents office and the board of regents, we can continue to advance to the goals that Robert has talked about, and I’m excited to be a part of that.”

Members unanimously voted to approve an advisory opinion allowing a former Alabama Department of Human Resources employee to represent foster parents in private practice. (Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Ethics Commission Wednesday approved guidance allowing a former employee of the Alabama Department of Human Resources to represent foster parents in cases with the agency.
Members of the commission  approved an advisory opinion that the “Revolving Door” provision of the Alabama Ethics Act does not prohibit Kimberly Dobbs, an attorney currently in private practice, from representing clients who are foster parents in adoption proceedings before the agency.
The advisory opinion comes after a request from Dobbs. According to Brian Paterson, assistant general counsel for Alabama Ethics Commission, Dobbs retired from the ADHR in 2025 after working at the department for 17 years, but continues to be a part time employee, working as an administrative law judge for the agency when needed.

The Revolving Door provision prohibits people from working for two years in specific capacities that are related to the previous state agency in which they worked.
ADHR oversees situations in which parents have lost custody of their children. In many cases, parents seek to adopt children in their custody with consent of the agency.
“During her 17 years with ADHR, Ms. Dobbs represented them at trial court and appellate levels in dependency and termination cases,” Paterson said.
Dobbs asked the Alabama Ethics Commission if she can represent foster parents as a practicing attorney in private practice in adoption proceedings with consent of ADHR in cases she was not involved in as an attorney or as an administrative law judge.
Staff said they found nothing in the Revolving Door provision of the Alabama Ethics Act applied to Dobbs’ situation.
The Alabama Ethics Commission also approved an increase to the maximum amount that state officials can accept without reporting it to $35 per occasion and $70 annually. A couple of years ago, the Commission approved an increase from $22 to $32 per occasion and from $50 annually to $64.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250806_093132-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-03 14:57:50.416400

Ann Bollin (R-Brighton) and Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R_Richmond Township) attend the ALEC Conference in Ft. Worth, Texas. Dec. 2, 2025 | Photo from Bollin's official Facebook accountA number of Republican members of Michigan’s state House are in attendance at the American Legislative Exchange Council States and Nation Policy Summit in Fort Worth, Texas this week. Only one day of session was scheduled for the House this week, on Tuesday, which was a no attendance, no voting session. 
The organization, referred to as ALEC, is a conservative, corporate-friendly nonprofit known for drafting and promoting “fill-in-the-blank” legislation on issues such as tightening voter ID laws and loosening environmental regulations.
House Appropriations Committee Chair Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton Twp.) received the 2025 Bob Williams Memorial Award for Policy Leadership at the conference for her work on the state’s budget, she posted on her official Facebook page. Rep. Ken Borton (R-Gaylord) congratulated Bollin on her award in a Facebook post from the conference. 
Some legislators also enjoyed their time in Texas — Borton also posted photos of himself and his wife Brenda enjoying time at the Fort Worth Stockyards while on the trip. 
The Michigan Democratic Party criticized the trip — including what they called a lack of transparency on how the lawmakers funded their travel and attendance at the conference, which has registration costs of hundreds of dollars. 

“Under Matt Hall’s consistently lackluster leadership, Republicans are out of session in Michigan and spending a week in Texas at a luxury hotel instead of doing the job Michiganders pay them for without any explanation for who’s footing the bill for this extravagant vacation,” Michigan Democratic Party Chair Curtis Hertel said in a statement. 
“While Democrats are ready and fired up to do the work to help middle-class families, Republicans are spending their time rubbing elbows at a convention held by the extremist ALEC organization,” Hertel added.
House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Twp.), in attendance at the conference, pushed back against the criticisms from Hertel, writing in a statement, “House Republicans are at ALEC to receive an award for having the best fiscal policies enacted in a budget this year. We cut pork spending by 87%, slashed waste, fraud, and abuse by $800 million, eliminated 2,000 ghost jobs, and made Lansing-insiders and politicians put their name on the pork projects they love so much by passing HEAT. And Gov. Whitmer signed it.”
“At this time, in 2023, failed Speaker Tate had already been at home for 19 days, starting his Thanksgiving and Christmas vacation early,” Hall added. “But House Republicans don’t operate like that. We do big things and plan on advancing our Regulation Rollback plan and other key priorities in the coming weeks. Democrats are just upset they’re going to have to come to work.”
There are six more days of session scheduled in the House in 2025. 
ALEC has recognized Michigan legislators in the past — Hall was named the organization’s State Legislator of the Month in February and was interviewed by the group at their annual meeting in June. Rep. Phil Green (R-Millington) also serves as the chair of ALEC’s Energy, Environment and Agriculture Task Force.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/594948726_1248296387107995_1156461055590955424_n-1024x755.jpg,,,2025-12-03 14:57:50.416400

Jeff Landry’s cabinet has been chosen to lead the state’s community and technical college system despite his lack of experience in higher education.  
The Louisiana Community and Technical College System Board of Supervisors voted Wednesday to name state Revenue Secretary Richard Nelson as its next system president. Nelson will replace current President Monty Sullivan, who is retiring after serving in the position since 2014. Nelson will officially take office Jan. 1. 
The board hired Nelson without conducting a search. It is standard practice for boards to convene search committees and undergo a months-long search process for college and university leaders. 
Nelson, a Republican, has no prior work experience in higher education. Before Landry selected him to serve as secretary of the Louisiana Department of Revenue when he took office in 2024, Nelson ran against Landry for governor in 2023 and was previously a one-term member of the Louisiana House of Representatives.
By comparison, Sullivan has more than 30 years experience at two-year and four-year schools in Louisiana and Virginia. 
“​​I’ll tell you with humility, I have a lot to learn about the nuts and bolts of this,” Nelson said in remarks to the board after his hiring. “I really think that the mission of this system is one of the most honorable in the state, and I think one of the most impactful that we can have on the future of the state.” 
Nelson will receive a base salary of $400,000, an increase from his $225,000 salary as revenue secretary. Nelson will also receive a $45,000 annual housing allowance, a $25,000 automobile allowance and $20,000 in deferred compensation. 
Landry spokeswoman Kate Kelly did not respond immediately to questions regarding when Nelson’s replacement will be announced. 
Nelson, 39, is 2010 graduate of the LSU Law Center. After graduating, he worked in the U.S. State Department’s Foreign Service for seven years before returning to Louisiana. 
Nelson’s appointment comes amid a major reorganization of higher education leadership in Louisiana. 
Last month, LSU hired Wade Rousse, formerly president of McNeese State in Lake Charles, as its system president, and Jim Dalton, the former provost at the University of Alabama, as its Baton Rouge campus chancellor. LSU is also replacing the chancellor at its medical school in Shreveport.
Last week, Southern University System President Dennis Shields announced he would step down, though its board has not yet announced his replacement. 
The University of Louisiana System is hiring campus leaders at McNeese and the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Florida needs to pony up another $50.6 million to help administer the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, members of a House health care spending panel were told this week.
The additional money is needed as a result of the One Big Beautiful Bill and Congress’ decision to reduce spending on the SNAP program by $156 billion over a decade. To help accomplish that goal, Congress reduced the federal government’s share of the program’s administrative costs from 50% to 25% effective Oct. 1, 2026.
Congress increased the states’ share of administrative costs from 50% to 75% resulting in the need for an additional $50.6 million.
Department of Children and Families (DCF) Assistant Secretary for Administration Chad Barrett tried to soften the financial blow in his appearance before the House Health Care Budget Subcommittee Tuesday.
“Please keep in mind Florida has the lowest administrative rate in the country, which is $13 per case per month, which puts Florida in the top percentile compared to all other states,” Barrett said.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
SNAP is the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s  program that offers nutrition assistance to eligible, low-income individuals and families in the form of funds to purchase eligible food. As of October, more than 2.7 million Floridians in more than 1.5 million households participated in SNAP, Barrett said.
DCF, which administers the SNAP program, included the $50.6 million funding request in its proposed legislative budget request for state fiscal year 2026-27. Although it’s just a wish list, an agency legislative budget request can foreshadow spending priorities in the governor’s proposed budget.
Gov. Ron DeSantis will release his budget for state fiscal year 2026-27 sometime this month. The Legislature is not bound by the governor’s budget but can use the blueprint to guide its spending decisions.
Barrett explained that most of the amount ($34.7 million, or 69%) will cover the salaries and benefits of employees who help the program run — working at the call center, reviewing applications, overseeing investigations and benefits recovery. Another $9 million will be spent on contracted services, such as fraud detection and identity verification.
“I know we use the term administration a lot in this presentation, with the largest impact around staff and the tools required for them to complete their job requirements. But these are frontline staff providing support to Floridians in need and the department does not consider this workforce a true administrative component,” he said.
The $50.6 million is an estimate for annual recurring costs. But because the funding shift doesn’t take effect until Oct. 1 (three months after the start of the state fiscal year) it will only increase the state’s costs by $38 million next year.










Any change to the legislative budget request to the $50.6 million could directly impact the state's overall performance and the eligible Floridians we support.


– Department of Children and Families Assistant Secretary for Administration Chad Barrett


Nevertheless, Barrett stressed the need for the full infusion.
“Any change to the legislative budget request to the $50.6 million could directly impact the state’s overall performance and the eligible Floridians we support,” he said.
Barrett’s presentation was limited to the shift in administrative costs under the One Big Beautiful Bill and its hit to Florida.
But that didn’t stop some committee members from pressing him about another change in the One Big Beautiful Bill that will affect Florida. The bill requires states with high SNAP error rates to contribute to the costs of the food benefits. States with error rates below 6% won’t be required to contribute to the costs.
Error rates include under- and overpayments. Florida’s error rate in 2024 was more than 15%, the majority of which were categorized as overpayments.
Unless lowered, Florida would be required to contribute to 15% of the costs of the food benefit, or an estimated $1 billion, in 2027.
Committee Vice Chair Karen Gonzalez Pittman, a Tampa Republican, asked Barrett whether there could be a connection between the state’s low SNAP administrative costs and a high error rate.
“So, you are saying we have lean administrative costs; we’re lean. But yet we are going to have to pay billions because of the error rate. So, would it be better to have better administration than to pay out penalties?” she asked.

(Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The University of Kansas and public universities in Arizona and Michigan will collaborate on a $3.75 million federal grant to recruit master’s degree recipients into a collaborative doctoral program focused on special education leadership.
The objective of the U.S. Department of Education initiative at University of Arizona in Tucson, Wayne State University in Detroit and KU in Lawrence would be development of a new generation of administrators prepared to be part of reforming special education and fostering partnerships in the discipline that deliver better academic achievement among students.
“There is a pressing need to improve outcomes for students with disabilities,” said Alison Zagona, an assistant professor of special education at KU. “Preparing doctoral students to take leadership roles, we believe, will help improve those outcomes.”
Doctoral students enrolled in the four-year program would receive financial support, including full tuition for four years, a living stipend, health insurance and funds for organizational membership and travel funds. The Department of Education said the program would begin in fall 2026.
The three universities would recruit people to the program who earned master’s degrees and had experience in special education teaching or a comparable career. Graduate students at each of the universities would work with one another as well as faculty on the three campuses.
They also would serve internships at high-need schools to learn directly from educators in the field and to collaborate on research with leaders in the schools.
“We have a wide range of research specialties they will have the chance to take part in and learn from, and they will also be able to explore their own research interests,” Zagona said.
Zagona said graduate students completing the program would be prepared for leadership jobs involved with special education teaching, research and administration.
“One of the biggest jobs of special education leaders is networking and building collaborative partnerships, and our students will get that through this program,” she said.
The Department of Education said applicants must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident of the United States to qualify. In addition, the federal agency said it was interested in enrolling scholars with disabilities.

(Photo: Duke Energy) Democratic Attorney General Jeff Jackson is intervening in Duke Energy’s proposal to raise electricity rates in North Carolina.
Duke Energy’s request, filed with the NC Utility Commission Nov. 20, asks for a 15% rate increase over the next two years. This would apply to Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, the company’s two utilities in the state.
“With costs rising everywhere, it’s important we take a close look at Duke Energy’s proposed rate increase to ensure it is necessary,” Jackson said in a statement on Tuesday. “My office is intervening to make sure we find the right balance between investing in our energy infrastructure and protecting North Carolinians’ wallets.”
Jackson’s move is backed by Democratic Gov. Josh Stein, who held the role of attorney general prior to his election as the state’s top executive.
In a statement released Tuesday afternoon, Stein described the proposed rate hike as “simply too high.” He also criticized Duke Energy for cutting back on affordable clean energy.
“At a time when families are struggling to make ends meet, we should be doing everything we can to make life more affordable, not less,” Stein said.
Duke Energy spokesperson Bill Norton told NC Newsline the company does not take requests to increase rates lightly.
He said the company is still awaiting a scheduling order from the NCUC for public hearings across the state in 2026.
A decision on the request requires evaluation from the NCUC and the commission’s public staff. Stakeholders like customer advocates and the attorney general are able to voice their concerns as well.
“We look forward to continuing a constructive dialogue with all parties as the review moves forward next year,” Norton wrote in an email.
The rate hike would result in a revenue increase of $1 billion for Duke Energy Carolinas each year, and $729 million for Duke Energy Progress, according to the company. If approved, the increases would increase beginning in 2027.
Monthly electric bills for a typical Duke Energy Carolinas residential customer using 1,000 kilowatt-hours per month would increase by $17.22 each month in 2027 if approved, according to the utility. For the same metric, the rate would increase by $23.11 each month for a typical Duke Energy Progress residential customer.
“Our goal is to deliver reliable power at the lowest possible cost for customers,” Duke Energy’s North Carolina president Kendal Bowman said in a statement announcing the proposed increases. “It’s important to strike the right balance of prioritizing investments that enhance the energy grid for current and future needs while also maximizing cost-saving measures for our customers.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Duke-Energy-Substation_684bcc11-fe6b-4e3a-b86d-f6e7f7b0e0f1-prv1.jpg,,,2025-12-03 14:57:50.416400

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Maine officials say they will continue to fight the Trump administration over its latest threat to withhold food assistance if the state refuses to share sensitive personal information with the federal government.
“It’s outrageous that we have an administration that focuses this much on cutting funding for food to its citizens,” U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, a Democrat who represents Maine’s 1st Congressional District, told Maine Morning Star. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, is threatening to withhold millions in federal funding from Maine and other states that have refused to comply with its request for information on program recipients.
The Trump administration argues the data is necessary to verify recipients’ eligibility, including immigration status. But Maine officials say the state is already using federal systems to conduct these checks and that the additional data request is illegal and would put Mainers’ privacy at risk.
Roughly 165,000 people in Maine receive benefits through SNAP each month, including more than 50,000 children and 39,000 seniors. More than $200 million in SNAP benefits have been issued so far in 2025.
Federal food aid has been repeatedly used by the Trump administration to try to coerce Democrats or Democratic-led states to comply with its agenda, including freezing payments during the federal government shutdown. 
“This administration has done everything it can to withhold SNAP benefits from people,” Pingree said. She pointed out that each time there’s a news story about these benefits potentially being taken away “there’s hungry people, senior citizens, veterans hearing this…and that causes a lot of stress and worry about food.”
Last spring, the USDA sent its initial request to states to provide information about individuals who receive SNAP benefits, including Social Security numbers, birth dates, home addresses, and immigration status.
In September, a coalition of attorneys general, including Maine’s Aaron Frey, won a temporary injunction after arguing that this sensitive data would likely be shared across federal agencies and used for immigration enforcement, in violation of the law.
During a White House cabinet meeting on Tuesday, USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said 28 states and Guam have complied with the data request, and the remaining states, including Maine, have until the end of the week before federal funding is withheld.
Trump administration threatens to yank food stamps funding from Maine, other Democratic-led states

“The governor and attorney general will stand in the way of this cruel and callous attempt by President Trump to cause Maine people to go hungry,” Ben Goodman, a spokesperson for Gov. Janet Mills, said in an emailed statement.
Pingree said while they don’t “have the legal ability to do what they say they are going to do,” she “can’t put it past them to go against the court order.”
As a member of the U.S. House Committee on Agriculture and the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees agriculture, Pingree said she and her colleagues are “trying to use whatever leverage we have” in ongoing negotiations over the Farm Bill and budget “to push back on these issues.”
A spokesperson for the USDA told States Newsroom that administrative funds are specifically being targeted. For Maine, the amount of administrative costs paid by the federal government amounts to roughly $13 million over the course of the year, which Pingree notes would be a “hardship” for the state.
Ian Yaffe, director of the Maine Office for Family Independence at the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, has argued the data request violates state and federal law.
In an August filing in the Northern California district court, Yaffe said Maine DHHS “cannot share confidential SNAP participant data with a third party without executing an appropriate data sharing agreement or Memoranda of Understanding or similar document. USDA has not offered to execute data and security protocols that might address concerns that the requested data would be redisclosed or misused in violation of federal law.”
The Trump administration has also been pressuring states to provide confidential voter and driver’s license data to help build a sweeping citizenship verification program. Maine is currently among the states being sued by the U.S. Department of Justice for refusing to hand over voter data.
Pingree said it’s clear there’s two things they are going after, “a desire to suck up data from the states and a desire to stop food benefits.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/no-kings-maine-25-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-12-03 14:57:50.416400

“For me, it’s personal,” the Republican said in recorded remarks at a Wednesday news conference by Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety.
Kansas families rely on safe road travel for essentials, including health care, employment, education and “everything in between,” Mann said.
The safety advocates organization Tuesday released a report, outlining why most states, including Kansas, received mediocre grades for road safety and how to address lapses in traffic laws.
This year’s report “makes it clear we still have major challenges on our roadways,” Mann said.
Politicians, advocates, law enforcement and mothers who lost their children in car crashes urged lawmakers during the news conference to shape their 2026 agendas to prioritize improving road safety.
The report rates all states and Washington, D.C., based on the organization’s key safety measures, including laws for seatbelt use, motorcycle helmets, child safety, young driver inexperience, impaired and distracted driving, speeding and red light running.
Red, the lowest ranking, means danger, indicating a state with inadequate road safety laws. Yellow means caution and includes states that have some of the organization’s optimal safety measures. Green signifies a good ranking for states that have enacted and enforced most of the measures.
Cathy Chase, president of the safety advocates organization, said 534 laws across the country need to be advanced to meet the organization’s safety criteria.
Kansas is one of 36 states in the yellow because of its lack of child passenger safety, adult occupant protection and young driver programs, according to the report.
Kansas records almost $3 billion in annual costs because of motor vehicle crashes, the report said. In the past 10 years, more than 4,000 people have died in Kansas traffic incidents. That includes 340 deaths in 2024.
In 2023, more than 40,000 people were killed in the U.S. in motor vehicle incidents. Texas had the most traffic deaths that year at 4,291, followed closely by California with 4,061 people. Both states’ numbers decreased in 2024, according to early estimates from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. D.C. had the fewest number of traffic deaths in both years at 44 people in 2023 and 47 people in 2024.
Annual traffic deaths have decreased across the board in recent years, but 2023’s number is still above 2011’s all-time low of 35,303 deaths.
Nearly one third of 2023’s traffic deaths were caused by drunk driving.

(File photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster signed an executive order Wednesday ending quotas for minority-owned businesses with state contracts.
The order directs state government agencies not to award future contracts or spend state dollars based on “unconstitutional and discriminatory race-based quotas or set-asides required by existing state law.”
The governor pointed to two sections of state law:

One requires the state Department of Transportation to award a minimum of 5% of certain highway contracts to minority businesses every year.
The other requires all state agencies to submit reports showing each agency spends at least 10% of its annual budget with minority-owned businesses.

“These policies rest on the false assumption that the solution to perceived historical wrongs is to racially discriminate against individuals in the present,” the governor’s order reads.
The order applies to future contracts only. Agencies won’t breach existing contracts.
“Nowhere should any person be treated differently because of their race,” the governor said in a statement “State government spending and procurements should be awarded based on merit and value to the taxpayer, not on set-asides or quotas. This order ensures that until South Carolina’s procurement process complies with the United States Constitution and treats every individual equally under the law, contracts will not be executed.”
The order also calls on state agencies to inform the governor’s office, by Jan. 9, 2026, of any other regulations or policies that require or allow an agency to take race into consideration when awarding a state-funded contract.
Republican Senate President Thomas Alexander and House Speaker Murrell Smith also plan to pre-file bills ahead of the upcoming legislative session to repeal these provisions when the General Assembly returns next month.
“We are a nation and a state dedicated to the principle that ‘all men are created equal, endowed by their Creator,’ as reflected in the Constitution’s requirement of equal protection of the laws,” Alexander, of Walhalla, said in a statement. “When existing laws no longer align with that constitutional command, it is our duty to correct them. I am confident my colleagues in the Senate share my belief that state government must reflect equality under the law in all its endeavors and ensure our statutes fully comply with the Constitution.”
In April, South Carolina’s Republican-controlled House passed a bill prohibiting state agencies, local governments and universities from violating federal discrimination laws with initiatives promoting diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI. That bill also would have required private businesses with government contracts to certify they don’t violate federal discrimination laws.
SC House passes bill banning ‘illegal’ DEI across schools and government

“I am proud the members of the House began addressing these issues during last year’s legislative session,” Smith, of Sumter, said in a statement. “Discrimination is wrong, and its misguided use as a remedy is worse. The House will address this when we return in January.”
The Senate, however, has yet to take up the measure.
During the House debate, Democrats argued the loss of DEI programs would leave those who face economic or other disadvantages that more often impact minority populations without support to overcome hurdles not encountered by more affluent peers.
“This is no longer the anti-DEI bill to me. This is the anti-opportunity bill,” Rep. Wendell Jones, D-Piedmont, said on the House floor in April. “You’re closing the door on so many people.
House Republicans trumpeted the measure as South Carolina leading the national anti-DEI movement by adopting the framework of executive orders signed by President Donald Trump banning DEI initiatives at the federal level.
In his executive order, the governor cited those same Trump policies.

(Screenshot | WisEye)Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Annette Ziegler misquoted a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a recent dissent, stating that the country’s highest court said the opposite of what it ruled in a 2023 redistricting decision. Ziegler’s opinion pushed back against  the state Supreme Court’s decision to appoint a pair of three-judge panels to decide challenges to Wisconsin’s  congressional maps. 
On Nov. 26, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled 5-2 that two lawsuits alleging the state’s congressional maps are unconstitutional should be heard by the panels because of a 2011 law requiring that action. The Court’s four liberal justices were partially joined in the decision by conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn, who wrote in a concurring opinion that he disagreed with the majority’s decision to appoint the six judges who will sit on the panels. 
In a dissenting opinion written by Ziegler and joined by Justice Rebecca Bradley, the two conservatives argued the decision was made “in furtherance of delivering partisan, political advantage to the Democratic Party.”
But Ziegler wrote in her opinion the U.S. Supreme Court had recently affirmed that “the role of state courts in congressional redistricting is ‘exceedingly limited.’” 
Ziegler cited the Court’s 2023 decision in Moore v. Harper — which was about the North Carolina Supreme Court’s authority to weigh in on congressional redistricting. The phrase “exceedingly limited” does not appear once in the decision.  In that case, a 6-3 majority of the Supreme Court found the opposite of what Ziegler claimed.
“State courts retain the authority to apply state constitutional restraints when legislatures act under the power conferred upon them by the Elections Clause,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion. 
The misquote was first reported by Slate and Urban Milwaukee’s Bruce Murphy. 
The day after the decision was published, the opinion was withdrawn from the state court’s website and replaced with a different version. The change wasn’t publicly acknowledged by the Court and only removes the quotation marks around the phrase “exceedingly limited.” The correction does not change Ziegler’s mischaracterization of the decision in Moore v. Harper.

Free.,Federal judge blocks sweeping immigration arrests in D.C. without warrants,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-judge-blocks-sweeping-immigration-arrests-dc-without-warrants,,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge late Tuesday barred federal agents from carrying out warrantless arrests in the District of Columbia unless they can demonstrate probable cause, after immigration advocates sued.Under the preliminary injunction granted by U.S. District Senior Judge Beryl A. Howell, immigration agents can only arrest a person in the district without a warrant if they can establish that the individual is in the United States unlawfully and poses a flight risk before a warrant can be obtained from an authority. Advocates who brought the suit had said they believed Latinos were being targeted for arrests in the district, even those with legal status.“Consequently, viewing all immigrants potentially subject to removal as criminals is, as a legal matter, plain wrong,” wrote Howell, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama.Howell noted Trump administration officials' public comments on the need to meet immigration arrest quotas, rather than focusing on targeted enforcement and probable cause.“Here, ‘the record’ as a whole ‘leaves no doubt’ that defendants in practice have consummated a decisionmaking process that resulted in the implementation of a new policy of conducting warrantless civil immigration arrests based on a lower standard than probable cause,” according to Howell’s order.National Guard presenceThe suit stems from President Donald Trump’s August emergency declaration in the district that flooded the 68-square-mile capital with federal law enforcement and National Guard troops. As a result, there has been an uptick in aggressive immigration enforcement by federal officers, both in plain clothes and masked, in neighborhoods with high immigrant populations.The four individual plaintiffs in the case are all immigrants with some form of legal status, such as a pending asylum case or temporary protections. But all were arrested and detained by federal officers, sometimes for days. In statements to the court, they described feeling like they were being kidnapped and argued they were targeted because of their ethnicity. They said they feared they will continue to be targeted because they are Latino.The legal organizations representing the plaintiffs pushed for two class certifications, which means others who were affected would be represented in the suit. Howell said in her order that she would make a determination on those two class certifications at a later time. ACLU, others praise preliminary injunctionLegal groups representing the plaintiffs celebrated the preliminary injunction.“Despite the Trump administration’s attempts at fear and intimidation, everyone in D.C. has rights, regardless of who they are and their immigration status; and all federal agents are required by law to respect these rights,” according to a joint statement from the legal groups who brought the suit against the federal government. Those legal groups included the American Civil Liberties Union of the District of Columbia; the American Civil Liberties Union; Amica Center for Immigrant Rights; CASA; National Immigration Project; the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs; and the law firm of Covington & Burling LLP.",,,,2025-12-03 13:59:07.951382

It came as no surprise whatsoever Tuesday night when Ole Miss Rebel Trinidad Chambliss stepped to the podium to a standing ovation to receive the C Spire Conerly Trophy as Mississippi’s  most outstanding college football player.
No, the bigger surprise is that Chambliss, a dynamic quarterback largely responsible for the Rebels 11-1 season and coming NCAA playoffs berth, has for the most part been omitted from the lists of viable candidates for the Heisman Trophy, the one that goes to the best college football player in America. I can’t say for certain Chambliss is the best in the country, but I know he belongs in the first sentence of any 2025 Heisman discussion. I know he deserves to go to New York as one of the finalists for the ceremony on Dec. 13.
The Heisman Trophy Trust normally invites four finalists to the New York Downtown Athletic Club for the presentation. I haven’t seen a prediction yet that expects Chambliss to be there.
Rick Cleveland
On3, the network of sports websites, recently published a poll of college football experts around the country that had Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia leading the list of likely Heisman winners, followed, in order, by Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza, Ohio State quarterback Justin Sayin, Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love and Alabama quarterback Tyler Simpson. In sixth place, with far fewer votes than the top four, was Chambliss.
Pavia, the leader (and a great player), has completed 71 percent of his passes for 3,192 yards and run for 826 yards and nine touchdown. He has thrown 27 touchdowns and eight interceptions. Chambliss has completed 66 percent of his passes for 3,016 yards and run for 470 yards and six touchdowns. He has thrown for 18 touchdowns, only three interceptions. He seems at his best when it matters most. He makes plays when there doesn’t seem one there.

The individual stats are quite similar, especially when you consider Chambliss didn’t start the Rebels first two games and largely missed the opportunity to pad his stats against Georgia State and Kentucky. Chambliss’s numbers are as good or at least slightly better than those of the other three quarterbacks ahead of him.
Most Heisman voters are sports writers and sportscasters who presumably love a good story. There is no better story in college football than Chambliss, unless its Pavia (Vanderbilt? 10-2!), than Chambliss. Last year, Chambliss led Division II Ferris State to the Division II National Championship and transferred to Ole Miss only after assistant coaches Joe Judge and Charlie Weiss Jr. saw some Ferris State tape on him last spring and couldn’t believe what they were watching.
Said Judge, who accompanied Chambliss to the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame Museum Tuesday night, “The more we watched, the more impressed we were. He was clearly a great athlete. You couldn’t tell from that tape whether he was an SEC calibre quarterback but we knew he was a guy with the ability to help us win as a slot receiver or a punt returner.”
Turns out, Chambliss was a quarterback deluxe. As Judge, the former New York Giants head coach, put it, “Trinidad has impacted our team both on and off the field. He’s great in the locker room. His teammates love him and believe in him. In my career, I have been around a lot of great football players and I can tell you with absolute certainty he is one. I don’t have a Heisman vote obviously, but I can tell you Trinidad Chambliss is without question one of the best college football players in America.”
Patrick Kutas, the mammoth Ole Miss junior offensive tackle who Tuesday night took home the Kent Hull Trophy as the state’s most outstanding offensive lineman, says he didn’t know what to expect when learning that Ole Miss had signed a Division II quarterback in the transfer portal.
“The first thing you saw was the competitiveness in him,” Kutas said. “Trinidad is the ultimate competitor. He’s been fantastic all season long. He 100 percent deserves to be in the Heisman race.”
One strike against Chambliss – strange as it sounds – might be that he came to Ole Miss from Division II. The thinking: How can anybody who wasn’t even recruited by a DI school be the best player in America?
Said Chambliss Tuesday night, “There are great players at every level of college football.” 
Myriad examples exist, including a Super Bowl hero named Malcolm Butler, from Vicksburg, Hinds Community College and the University of West Alabama, and former Pro Bowler Fred McAfee, from Philadelphia (the one in Mississippi) and Mississippi College. For the record, 40 former Division II  players currently play in the NFL.
Said Chambliss of his storybook season and the Conerly Trophy, “This is all a dream come true for me. I am blessed.”
Asked about the Heisman Trophy, Chambliss smiled and mentioned that not starting those first two games probably hurt his chances but that, “I really do feel like I am one of the best players in college football. I really do.”

Business owners have been leaving the area for more than a decade. 
But one vacant bank may hold promise for the future. Come January, it will open as a different kind of bank – one where resources, referrals and health services are offered for free or low cost. 
Magnolia Medical Foundation, a network of five clinics and resource centers across the state that focus on providing holistic care to low-income Mississippians, is expanding to the most under-resourced part of Mississippi’s capital city. The bank will retain its layout: a drive-through where patients pick up prescriptions, a counter where tellers dole out supplies, such as diapers, and offices where patients meet with providers, social workers and other patient navigators. The bank will take walk-ins, as well as appointments.
“We all at some point in our life are able to make deposits, and sometimes, we’re just only able to make withdrawals,” said Dr. Erica Thompson, founder and executive director of the Magnolia Medical Foundation. “It’s important to have a space where you feel comfortable and you feel safe and you’re able to get the things you need.”
The expansion is made possible by a $200,000 donation from Molina Healthcare, a company based in Long Beach, California, that is a one of the entities that manages the care of Mississippi Medicaid beneficiaries. 
A vacant bank at 3311 Terry Road in south Jackson will reopen as a health clinic and resource bank in January. 
“We are grateful to be a part of the Magnolia Medical Foundation,” said Laurie Williams, assistant vice president of growth and member engagement at Molina Healthcare, during a press conference at the new space Monday. “Dr. Thompson, your vision has just always been epic from the very beginning … We’re not going to be last anymore.”
Mississippi ranked last in the nation for its rate of preterm births – and has failed every year for nearly two decades – a recent report card from March of Dimes showed. While the bank will serve everyone, regardless of insurance status, it will also have services focused on improving outcomes for women, such as pregnancy and birth support from doulas. 
Other patient navigators will include medical providers, mental health providers and social workers, who will help low-income people traverse the complex processes surrounding applications for benefit programs – or help them understand their rights in legal matters. Thompson hopes that businesses and community members will make “deposits” when they can by partnering with the bank, volunteering, making donations and adding to the services offered. 
“Just like a regular bank brings in their investment brokers and all that, we want to bring in other folks who are able to make an investment in south Jackson,” said Thompson. 
Providers at the Magnolia Medical Foundation Midtown clinic spend at least an hour with each patient, according to Belinda Mundora, the foundation’s project director. That’s more than triple the average amount of time family physicians spend with their patients. When providers spend more time with patients they strengthen patients’ trust in them and get a better sense of how circumstances such as unstable housing may influence physical and mental health. 
Kathryn Carroll Barham, a nurse practitioner currently working at the foundation’s Midtown clinic, said the work she does is more often social than medical. Carroll said she’s excited to continue that work in a place where the need for it is great. 
“That’s why I want to work in a place like this – that has something that’s so holistic, working with people who think about every part of the patient rather than just the physical aspect,” Carroll Barham said.  
The Midtown clinic also operates a food pantry Monday through Thursday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Thompson said she hopes to do food drops at least once a month at the new location. 
The foundation’s expansion couldn’t come at a more opportune time. Food Depot, the last remaining full-service grocery store in south Jackson, shuttered two weeks ago. Kroger and Piggly Wiggly of south Jackson closed in 2015. 
Food Depot on Terry Road was the last full-service grocery store in south Jackson before it closed in mid-November. 
Living in a food desert means people either go without fresh meat and produce, or they travel to supermarkets where their tax dollars support cities other than their own. In these areas, local economies collapse and people tend to be sicker. 
Those effects are expected to be exacerbated by major changes to social safety net programs coming down the pipeline. Tens of millions of dollars previously covered by the federal government for programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid will shift to states, due to the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill signed into law by President Donald Trump over the summer. Experts predict this will force states to limit benefits, cap enrollment or shut down services altogether. 
Thompson knows these changes will impact most of the patients she sees. Jackson’s median income is $43,000 – well below the state median income of $54,000. Mississippi is among the poorest states in the nation. To be eligible for SNAP, individuals must make less than about $20,000 annually. New work requirements from the federal budget bill are expected to make it harder for eligible people to remain enrolled. 
“I always think about the scripture, ‘for such a time as this,’” Thompson said. “This is the perfect place for the storm.”

Austin-based Saronic Technologies will spend $300 million at its facility in Franklin, where it purchased the former Gulf Craft shipyard in April. Its expansion will include three new boat slips, a larger warehouse and a new production line where it will build larger vessels.
The additional jobs announced Wednesday will have an average annual salary near $88,000, officials said. 
Saronic builds vessels that operate without a crew for military and commercial purposes. The company laid the keel of its first 150-foot ship, the Marauder, in August. The shipyard workforce has increased from 35 after the April acquisition to more than 100, according to the state agency. 
According to online federal contract records, the U.S. Navy agreed in May to hire Saronic to build an unspecified fleet of unmanned vessels for $392 million. The “small craft” contract calls for the work to be completed by May 30, 2031, and the Navy awarded about half that dollar amount to the company in July. 
Saronic launched in 2022 and has previously worked with the Defense Department on autonomous watercraft technology. In October, the company revealed plans to mass produce a 24-foot boat called the Corsair to meet the Pentagon’s call for more unmanned resources. 
Saronic has also developed 6-, 14-, 40- and 60-foot vessels. 
In addition to its Louisiana shipyard, Saronic is outfitting a 420,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Austin.

The appeal was filed in New Britain Superior Court by Eversource, Aquarion’s owner, and the South Central Connecticut Regional Water Authority, known as RWA, which is seeking to buy the water company and turn it into a quasi-public entity.
PURA rejected the sale last month after regulators raised concerns with the governance structure of a new quasi-public authority set up to oversee Aquarion and said that the sale “contravenes the public interest.”
In their complaint filed on Tuesday, however, attorneys for the two utilities pointed out that the structure of the newly-created Aquarion Water Authority was dictated by a law passed during a special session of the legislature in 2024 to facilitate the sale of the private utility. While the law also required PURA to review and approve the sale, the utilities argued that regulators had no authority to second-guess how lawmakers chose to structure the authority.
“This appeal is an opportunity to address legal aspects in a regulatory decision that praised AWA and RWA for their operational expertise, financial management, and customer service,” Aquarion President Lucy Teixeira and RWA Chief Financial Officer Rochelle Kowalski said in a joint statement following the filing of the lawsuit. 
“The proposed sale to AWA is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to shift ownership to a model that truly benefits all parties involved: residential customers, communities, and businesses for years to come and puts affordability and predictability at the forefront,” the statement continued. 
A spokesperson for PURA did not respond to requests to comment on the appeal Wednesday. 
Critics of the deal, including Attorney General William Tong, have argued that the sale would result in higher water rates for Aquarion’s roughly 250,000 customers, as well as a loss of sales tax revenues in dozens of towns where the company owns reservoirs, pipelines and other assets. (As part of the deal, Aquarion planned to sell off its assets New Hampshire and Massachusetts to the utility company Unitil.)
“Eversource is desperate to offload Aquarion after not getting the massive rate hike they wanted,” Tong said in a statement Tuesday. “They need to take no for an answer — no one wants this deal. PURA was right to reject this costly loser, and we are prepared to vigorously defend this decision on appeal.”
While officials at both Aquarion and RWA had pledged not to immediately increase rates as part of the deal, filings submitted to PURA projected that Aquarion’s customers would have seen annual rate increases of between 6.5% and 8.35% over the next decade under the new quasi-public authority.
After PURA announced its decision to block the sale last month, Eversource Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer John Moreira released a statement saying the company would seek a rate increase of between $60 million and $70 million for Aquarion customers sometime in 2026.
Rates for privately-owned utilities must be approved by PURA. In Aquarion’s last rate case prior to its proposed sale, regulators opted to cut the company’s rates by nearly 11%. 
Since then, PURA has undergone a shakeup with its former chief, Marissa Gillett, stepping down in October. Gillett was replaced by interim Chair Thomas Wiehl along with two new commissioners and a third on the way.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/saugatuck.jpg,,,2025-12-03 13:59:07.951382

McNamara, a Warwick Democrat, announced Tuesday that he has “pre-filed” a bill which would create a zero tolerance policy for hazing and set up clear disciplinary standards for student athletes who engage in such behavior. The possible punishments for hazing include suspension from a team and potential cancellation of a team’s season as appropriate, according to a press release on McNamara’s current draft of the proposal.         
“As a retired educator, coach and former student athlete, I can state without reservation that hazing is degrading, abusive and dangerous,” McNamara, who once served as the director of the Pawtucket School Department’s Alternative Learning Program, said in a statement. 
“We’ve all worked hard to make schools safer, more welcoming and more inclusive,” McNamara continued. “Athletics should not be an exception to that rule. Regardless of what form it takes, hazing creates an environment of trauma and humiliation, and we have to take it more seriously.”
McNamara cited two high-profile cases of hazing this school year, both involving football teams, as the impetus behind the bill. In late September at Smithfield High School, a freshman player was trapped in a locker room bathroom and allegedly sprayed with aerosol cleaner. Amid accusations that the hazing also included antisemitic slurs, players who participated in the hazing were suspended but later reinstated. 
At Newport’s Rogers High School in late November, four football players were arrested and the team’s season canceled after a student with special needs was assaulted in the locker room, an incident which was recorded on students’ phones. The Newport School Committee met in closed session on Nov. 26 and voted to hire an independent investigator of the incident.
James Dring, the Newport School Committee’s chair, confirmed in an email Wednesday that the committee has hired retired Rhode Island State Police Superintendent Steven O’Donnell to carry out the investigation.    
“He started his investigation on Monday and we hope to have it wrapped up by the end of this month,” Dring said. 
The Newport police department’s own investigation is ongoing, Newport Police Capt. Joseph C. Carroll said via email Wednesday. He said there were no further updates at the moment. 
“We need a statewide policy where every student-athlete, coach and administrator will understand that these behaviors will no longer be acceptable and there will be consequences to both athletes and teams,” McNamara said in his statement. 
Legislators can pre-file bills ahead of the upcoming Jan. 6 legislative session from Nov. 15 to Jan. 5. McNamara intends to submit his bill in January.
Larry Berman, a House spokesperson, said in an email Tuesday that around 200 bills have been pre-filed in the past several years. The bills typically hit the floor of their respective chamber within the first few weeks of the new legislative session in January, he added. 
Pre-filed bills are not usually highlighted publicly ahead of the legislative session unless they involve high-profile issues. Pre-filed bills publicized in the past have included legislation related to reproductive health care, insulin prices, hit-and-run accidents, and extending the statute of limitations for childhood sexual abuse.  
The state does not have a specific statewide policy on addressing hazing, Victor Morente, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Department of Education, said via email Tuesday. But there is a policy called the Safe School Act, which, according to the act, seeks to “ensure a consistent and unified statewide approach to the prohibition of bullying at school.” 
Morente added that Rhode Island General Law prohibits hazing at educational institutions across grade levels, including colleges and universities. The law allows for misdemeanor charges for hazing and, with conviction, potential fines of up to $500 or imprisonment between 30 days and one year.  
Morente said that the education department will “carefully review the proposed legislation” which McNamara submitted in draft form to the agency. 
McNamara also sent the bill to the Rhode Island Interscholastic League, with whom he intends to collaborate to craft the bill’s final version. The Interscholastic League is the non-governmental body responsible for regulating scholastic sports in Rhode Island.

Gov.-elect Ghazala Hashmi in a Jan. 6 special election for her Richmond-area Senate seat. (Photos courtesy of campaigns)Virginia Senate President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, has set a Jan. 6 special election to fill the soon-to-be vacant seat of Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, clearing the way for a fast, intraparty fight in one of the state’s safest Democratic districts.
Two Democrats — Del. Debra Gardner of Chesterfield County and Del. Michael Jones of Richmond — have already launched campaigns to succeed Hashmi. The party has not yet set its nomination process, though officials expect a firehouse primary given the compressed calendar.
Hashmi, first elected to the Senate in 2019, won the lieutenant governorship last month and will vacate the 15th District seat just a year into her second term. 
Under state law, the responsibility for calling a special election falls to the Senate’s highest-ranking member while the chamber remains in session. Lucas, a Hampton Roads Democrat who has long held the pro tempore role, exercised that authority after weeks of anticipation from party leaders.
Sen. Lamont Bagby, D-Henrico, who chairs the Democratic Party of Virginia, said the timing of the contest leaves little room for error.
“I feel good about our chances of winning the district, but we still have to run through the tape and do the work and not take it for granted,” Bagby told the Virginia Mercury last month.

Democrats caution that even overwhelmingly blue seats can tighten when turnout is unusually low — a common dynamic in Virginia special elections, which often fall during holidays or legislative deadlines. “You can’t just assume that you put a Democrat on the ballot and folks are just going to come,” Bagby said.
The 15th District, redrawn in late 2021, includes large portions of Richmond and northern Chesterfield. According to the Virginia Public Access Project, it has reliably supported Democrats running for statewide and federal office in recent years and is home to more than 133,000 registered voters. 
Analysts say shifting demographics — including diversifying neighborhoods in south Richmond and growing Black and Latino communities in Chesterfield — have only strengthened the party’s advantage.
No Republican had formally declared. Hayden Fisher, the GOP’s 2023 nominee, said in an email last month that he would not seek a rematch. 
The Democratic field, however, is already taking shape. 
Gardner, first elected to the House of Delegates two years ago, said she intends to build on Hashmi’s legislative work and pointed to her background in social work, advocacy and local government. “I’ve spent my career serving Virginia families — from protecting survivors of abuse to fighting for fair wages and affordable health care,” she said.
Jones, a former Richmond City Council president who also entered the House in 2024, emphasized his progressive record on public safety, housing, education and health care. He also noted his work on Confederate monument removal and police reforms. “I am eager to continue to provide strong, progressive, compassionate, energetic leadership to Chesterfield County and Richmond in the state Senate,” he said.
Because Jan. 6 falls just days before lawmakers return to Richmond for the 2026 General Assembly session, Democrats expect a tight turnaround for voters and campaigns alike. 
Special elections traditionally draw modest participation, and the early-January timing — following the holidays and coming on the heels of statewide turnover — may push turnout even lower.

Cox proposes millions for homeless campus while also hoping for federal funds,Katie McKellar,,,,,https://utahnewsdispatch.com/2025/12/03/utah-gov-cox-proposes-millions-for-homeless-campus/,"As part of his $30.7 billion state budget recommendation unveiled Wednesday morning, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox proposed the Utah Legislature — which controls the purse strings — use $25 million in one-time money and $20 million in ongoing funding for “homelessness and criminal justice high utilizers.” The governor’s budget recommendation doesn’t explicitly say t[...]","A conceptual rendering depicts what state leaders envision for a new ""transformative campus"" meant to house and rehabilitate people experiencing homelessness. (Courtesy of the Utah Office of Homeless Services)As part of his $30.7 billion state budget recommendation unveiled Wednesday morning, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox proposed the Utah Legislature — which controls the purse strings — use $25 million in one-time money and $20 million in ongoing funding for “homelessness and criminal justice high utilizers.”
The governor’s budget recommendation doesn’t explicitly say that money should be used to fund a 1,300-bed homeless campus that the state’s stop homelessness leaders have proposed in northwest Salt Lake City. But the governor recently said that campus — envisioned to help Utah be a “pilot” state to fulfill President Donald Trump’s executive order titled “Ending Crime and Disorder on America’s Streets” — is a top priority for his administration. 
The “intent” is to use that funding for the proposed homeless campus, Sophia DiCaro, executive director of the Governor’s Office of Planning and Budget, told reporters in a briefing ahead of Cox’s announcement Wednesday morning. But she also said specifics for that funding and its uses are still being fleshed out. 
Utah Gov. Cox says homeless campus — envisioned to fulfill Trump’s order — is a ‘top priority’

“The details are still being developed in terms of what exactly that would look like,” she said. “But the idea is the target market is the population that is tending to be the high utilizers of the criminal justice system.” 
Plans for the campus are still taking shape. The Utah Homeless Services Board last week fielded input from homeless service providers, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County and others within Utah’s homeless services network. 
But over the last several months, the state’s top homelessness leaders have proposed including in the campus hundreds of beds for people who are civilly committed — or court ordered into mental health treatment. They have also envisioned an “accountability center” or a “secure residential placement facility” for substance abuse treatment as an alternative to jail, where people who are “sanctioned” to go there would not be able to leave voluntarily. 
DiCaro noted that the governor’s newly appointed state homeless coordinator, Rep. Tyler Clancy, R-Provo, is slated to start his new position in March after the state’s current homeless coordinator, former Senate President Wayne Niederhauser, retires in December. 
Clancy won’t start in his new role until after the Legislature’s 2026 general session concludes, so “there’s going to be some time needed to develop exactly what” the proposed funding entails, “but the idea is for that to be flexible as that gets developed,” DiCaro said. 
“It’s fair to say that the intent is for that (funding) to be used for a campus. It’s what kind of services go into the campus that I’m not able to answer at this time because those kind of details will likely require involvement by the courts, corrections, public safety, as well as the other service providers,” DiCaro said, adding that figuring out those details will require “collaboration and partnership.” 
Some homelessness, housing and low-income aid advocates have criticized the proposed campus project and expressed concerns about forcing drug or mental health treatment on people while shifting away from “Housing First” strategies. But Cox has defended it as a way to bring more “accountability” but also more “compassion” into Utah’s homelessness system by not letting people addicted to drugs or those with mental illness to languish on the streets. 
Homelessness advocates, environmentalists rally against homeless ‘mega shelter’

“Gov. Cox remains committed to ending the harm and prevalence of homelessness and addressing criminal activity associated with substance use and behavioral health,” the governor’s budget proposal says, adding that the additional funding “will help Utah align” with Trump’s executive order. 
Trump’s order encourages cities and states to enforce stricter anti-camping laws, expands power to involuntarily treat and civilly commit people experiencing homelessness, and directs federal officials to end support for “Housing First” strategies, an approach to homelessness that prioritizes providing housing while offering — but not requiring — treatment. 
“Legislative adoption of this recommendation will signal Utah’s commitment to doing its part to address a nationwide problem while leveraging matching federal dollars to fund solutions that work,” the governor’s budget recommendation says, while adding that Cox’s administration “recognizes that this will entail a long-term effort.”
The campus — which state officials have estimated will cost at least $75 million to build, plus north of $34 million a year to operate — is a long way from becoming a reality, which largely hinges on funding. 
Last year, the Utah Homeless Services Board initially voted to set a deadline of Oct. 1 of this year for it to be built, but after state leaders spent more than a year searching for a property, that deadline was pushed. Now state leaders estimate the first phase of the campus won’t be built until sometime in 2027. 
Utah’s Republican-controlled Legislature usually doesn’t finalize the budget until the final days of its general session, which is slated to begin in January and end in early March. Even if lawmakers agree to fund all of Cox’s 2026 and 2027 budget recommendations, the campus would still need tens of millions of dollars more to be fully funded.

That’s where the Trump administration may come in. 
The governor has said he’s “hopeful” the federal government will “see the wisdom in this, and they expressed interest in helping these types of projects.” But whether the federal government does help fund the campus or related projects remains to be seen. 
“There’s going to be some federal grant opportunities that will be connected to (Trump’s executive order),” DiCaro said, pointing to the Continuum of Care Competition and the Youth Homeless Demonstration Program as grants state leaders will “try to compete for.” 
“We think we’ll be in a good position in terms of competing for the opportunities there,” she said. “So we definitely want to use this to leverage federal opportunities and large private contributions as well.”

(Getty Images)Indiana will begin allowing some state employees to bring their infants to work under a pilot program announced Tuesday by Gov. Mike Braun and detailed in a newly issued policy.
The move comes months after Braun’s administration ended hybrid schedules for most state workers and rescinded thousands of remote-work agreements as part of a broader return-to-office directive that requires employees to report in-person unless granted narrow exceptions.
The “Family First Workplace” initiative has already launched for staff in the governor’s office, the Indiana Department of Health and the State Personnel Department, according to Braun’s announcement. 
The governor said the effort is part of Indiana’s commitment “to strengthening families, supporting parents in the workforce, and promoting healthy early childhood development.”
“Indiana is going to lead the nation in pro-family policy. The parental bonding that happens in the first months of a child’s life are irreplaceable, and our new Family First Workplace pilot program helps parents stay connected to their newborns while continuing their careers,” Braun said in the news release. “Indiana is building a culture that puts families first.” 
The governor’s announcement followed an executive order issued earlier this year that expanded paid childbirth leave and parental leave, as well as paid leave for state employees who experience a stillbirth or infant loss.
SPD policy sets standards, restrictions
The new, four-page policy officially took effect Dec. 2 and aims to “provide a framework for a pilot program that will allow parents to bring their infants to the workplace where operational needs and the environment make such opportunities feasible, safe, and effective without impeding productivity,” according to the document.
The policy states that time spent with parents in the first six months of a child’s life “is important to their health and wellbeing, and that having opportunities to have their infants nearby can generate higher morale, increase job satisfaction, and motivate higher productivity in employees who are new parents.”
Story continues below.
Infants-at-Work-Policy
 
But the document emphasizes that participation in the program “is a privilege, not a right,” and it’s only available to employees once an agency establishes its own formal program.
SPD defines eligible state workers as full-time employees of the governor’s office, IDOH, SPD and any other agencies later authorized to participate in the pilot program by Braun’s office. Participants must be employed by the state at the time the infant is born.
An “infant” is specifically described in the policy as “the biological or adoptive child of an eligible employee who is between four weeks and six months of age, and who is not yet able to crawl or walk without assistance.”
Children can only be in tow for up to six months. An infant becomes ineligible at the end of the calendar week in which they turn six months old — or when they become mobile — “whichever occurs first,” per the policy.
What the program requires
Before bringing an infant to work, an employee must submit a written request at least 10 business days in advance and complete a series of documents, including a participation agreement and waiver, a pediatrician clearance form, and a supervisor sign-off confirming the details of participation.
Indiana governor expands paid parental leave for state employees

Signatures are also required from coworkers who agree to serve as “alternate care providers” — defined in the policy as fellow employees “who ha(ve) expressly agreed to step in to care for the Infant for not more than one-hour per workday if the eligible employee must attend to duties that cannot be effectively performed if the infant becomes disruptive at that time.”
Alternate providers are prohibited from providing care more than a total of one hour per workday, and supervisors cannot assign subordinates to serve in that role.
The policy does not make clear how many coworkers must agree to help, however.
Participating employees must also “maintain productivity,” including meeting quality, quantity, and timeliness” performance standards; keep the infant’s area clean and sanitary; ensure the child has all required vaccinations; and remove the infant if management deems the child disruptive.
Agency management is responsible for determining if a child is disruptive. In such instances, employees “will use appropriate leave for the remainder of the workday.”
Where infants are — and are not — allowed
Agencies must determine which workplace locations are safe and appropriate. 
But the policy lists several areas where infants can’t be present, including:

stairwells
state vehicles
laboratories
fabrication, maintenance or construction areas
storage rooms
kitchens with hot appliances
loading docks
utility or mechanical rooms
server rooms
fitness rooms during active use
locations accessible by incarcerated individuals or federal detainees
Family and Social Services Administration/Division of Mental Health Addiction hospital patient areas
any posted restricted or high-noise area


Infants have to remain in the employee’s regular work station or designated infant-care areas unless being taken to a lactation or diaper-changing space.
Employees are additionally prohibited from placing their Infant in state vehicles and taking their Infant with them while traveling for conferences, inspections audits or other field work.
Participating agencies have obligations, too, like creating lactation spaces; identifying coordinators to handle questions and approvals; determining which positions and work locations are suitable; and enforcing safety and productivity requirements.
They’re also directed to terminate an employee’s participation if operational needs or performance standards aren’t being met.

(Screenshot from TikTok)When Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials swept into North Carolina, Governor Josh Stein urged people to pull out their phones and record any inappropriate behavior. 
It’s good advice. Filming law enforcement in public is one of the few tools ordinary people have to hold powerful federal agents accountable. The right to record police in public is also protected by the First Amendment. 
But federal officials have repeatedly chased, assaulted, and even arrested Americans, including North Carolinians, for recording them. This isn’t just unconstitutional. It’s dangerous.
Take Charlotte resident and U.S. citizen Miguel Angel Garcia Martinez. On November 16, after Martinez photographed federal agents in public places around the city, Border Patrol officers stopped his car and told him to step out “voluntarily.” When Martinez refused and drove away, agents chased him for nearly two miles through busy streets.
Video shows ICE agents suggesting smashing Martinez’s vehicle and imagining him being shot. They laughed that the chase was “fun,” even as Martinez swerved into oncoming traffic and medians to avoid crashes. Martinez was arrested and charged with two felonies. A court later dismissed the charge accusing him of using his vehicle as a deadly weapon, finding that it was federal agents who tried to hit Martinez with their vehicles, not the other way around.
Or look at Oregon, where a U.S. citizen, Berenice Garcia-Hernandez, took pictures of unmarked ICE cars in a Chick-fil-A parking lot. ICE officers pursued her in their cars down public streets and violently arrested her. They accused Garcia-Hernandez of aggressively following and obstructing them, but a cellphone video showed that wasn’t true. 
In Chicago, federal agents surrounded three members of a local “rapid response” group with multiple vehicles and arrested them in September, simply because they were filming the officers. 
Federal officers in Chicago also shot Marimar Martinez multiple times on a public street after she followed them in her car. The Department of Homeland Security accused her of using her vehicle as a weapon and said she had a history of “doxing” officers. Martinez said it was agents who had rammed her. Prosecutors dismissed the charges against her after inconsistencies in the government’s story emerged.
Maybe you think some of these people should have complied or shouldn’t have fled. But what’s more important is that federal agents never should have stopped them in the first place. Exercising your constitutional rights isn’t a crime. 
And when people flee an illegal stop, federal officers put everyone at risk by giving chase. Police chases kill innocent people every year. That’s why many local police departments rightly restrict them. Officers in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department, for instance, may only pursue someone when there’s a threat to life or risk of public harm.
Recording federal agents isn’t a threat to anyone’s life. The government claims that recording agents puts them at risk of doxxing and harassment. But law enforcement already has criminal statutes to handle cases of actual threats or harassment. What they can’t do is punish people for recording in public. 
The dangers don’t stop with car chases. They also show up at protests, where federal agents often use dangerous crowd control munitions against journalists and others photographing or filming them. These weapons can maim or kill. 
Ask photojournalist Nick Stern, who had shrapnel surgically removed from his leg after being struck by a “less lethal” munition while covering a protest in June. Or Lisa Tirado, a journalist blinded in one eye and left with a traumatic brain injury after she was struck by a crowd control round during the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests in Minneapolis. Tirado is now in hospice care, dying from the injuries she suffered. 
Federal courts have said repeatedly that attacking journalists at protests violates the First Amendment. But what’s received less attention is that these actions put innocent people in grave danger: journalists, peaceful protesters, and even bystanders.  
And for what? So federal agents can operate without the public seeing what they do?
These tactics aren’t about safety. They’re about control. Federal agents don’t want cameras pointed at them because it can force accountability. When they lash out at people who record them, it’s not just those targeted who are in danger; everyone around them is at risk too. Agents’ reckless responses to being recorded are threatening both our constitutional rights and the public’s physical safety.

Jeff Landry speaks in the Louisiana House of Representatives on the opening day of a legislative special session, Nov. 6, 2024, at the State Capitol in Baton Rouge. (Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate, Pool)Gov. Jeff Landry left no room for doubt in late October when asked whether then-LSU Athletics Director Scott Woodward would hire the university’s next football coach. With harsh criticism of the buyout terms in Brian Kelly’s contract, the governor all but said outright that Woodward would also be dismissed for having crafted the deal that will pay Kelly nearly $54 million not to coach the Tigers. 
Landry strongly suggested LSU make an incentive-based offer to its next football coach, implying any losses would directly impact their pay. 
“We’re going to make sure that he’s compensated properly, and we’re going to put metrics on him because I’m tired of rewarding failure in this country and then making the taxpayers foot the bill,” Landry said during an Oct. 29 news conference. 
Setting aside the fact that taxpayers have never been on the hook for LSU’s coaching buyouts, the governor appeared intent on reining in the soaring salaries of college football coaches.
Then market forces entered the conversation.

When Lane Kiffin became the primary target for new LSU Athletics Director Verge Ausberry, it became crystal clear he would have to be made one of the highest-paid coaches in the nation to leave Ole Miss. Kiffin’s seven-year, $91 million deal with LSU elevates him from 10th on the college football compensation list to No. 2, with an annual pay of $13 million. That’s barely behind Georgia’s Kirby Smart and just ahead of Ohio State’s Ryan Day, who both have national championship trophies on their mantles.
Should Kiffin lead LSU to a national title, with a single trophy being the minimal expectation from Tiger fans, his contract calls for him to become the highest paid coach in the country.
While he apparently placed no limits on what LSU could spend to corral Kiffin, the governor certainly seemed intent on ensuring the new coach’s buyout terms would be far more modest than Kelly’s.
Not so fast, my friend.
If LSU wants to fire Kiffin just because he loses too many games, he would be owed 80% of his remaining salary. His contract doesn’t include any contingencies to offset what he’s owed if he is terminated and then takes another coaching job.
LSU is also covering the $3 million Kiffin owes Ole Miss to get out of his contract there, plus it will cover any post-season bonus he would have made had he remained the Rebels’ coach. It’s all but certain that will include $150,000 for Ole Miss playing in the first round of the playoffs, and it could mean $1 million more if the Rebels win the national title.
Landry is far from the first Louisiana leader to take an active interest in LSU athletics. It’s well known that Huey Long did everything but suit up for the Tigers during his tenure as governor and U.S. senator, helping flesh out the school’s new campus along Highland Road with a state-funded football stadium that doubled as a dormitory. 
John McKeithen, the governor from 1964-72, was arguably a more ardent booster, regularly attending LSU football practices and away games as well as actively recruiting future legends like Bert Jones and Tommy Casanova. McKeithen also put in motion plans to build what’s now the Pete Maravich Assembly Center.
It’s too soon to tell whether Landry will rival these predecessors with his involvement in LSU sports, though he set a clear precedent when he okayed the rental of a live tiger to appear on the sidelines for last year’s Alabama game. 
Landry easily wields more power over the university than any other governor in modern history. He has the loyalty of not only his personal appointees to LSU’s Board of Supervisors but also those who predate his administration. 
Scott Ballard, Landry’s hand-picked board chairman, has helped implement the governor’s higher education agenda, exorcising campus policy and curriculum linked to diversity, equity and inclusion. Ballard also orchestrated the hiring of a Landry-favored candidate for LSU president, Wade Rousse. 
But for all the might the governor has displayed when it comes to LSU administration, the Kiffin contract reveals Landry’s limits. Even he seemed to acknowledge as much Monday during an interview with Fox News, when he was asked about LSU’s “poach” of the Ole Miss coach with the Rebels heading into the playoffs.
“You don’t hate the player,” Landry said. “You can hate the game if you like, but that’s where we are in college sports right now.”

Oct. 1, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceMichigan’s Republican House Speaker Matt Hall has come under fire for receiving tickets to a Detroit Lions game supplied by a lobbyist, which is also now the subject of a lobbying law complaint from a campaign finance attorney with a long history in Michigan politics.
The lobbyist involved in the matter has also since said that he has a copy of the check he says shows Hall, of Richland Township, paid the full market price of the tickets before he took possession of the tickets, in line with current law.
Hall has said that he paid for the tickets, which were allegedly purchased for just under $600. The game in question was the Nov. 2 matchup against the Minnesota Vikings, which the Lions lost. It’s unclear where Hall sat during the game, but in September, the starting value of the lowest priced tickets of a Lions home game was around $260 each. It was also reported that other matches had market ticket values ranging $266 to more than $400.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The complaint, filed Monday by Bob LaBrant, asserts that Hall received the tickets from William Wortz of Public Affairs Associates.
Wortz, in an interview with Michigan Advance, said Hall did pay the full market value for the tickets and that he had a copy of the check. Wortz also said that he plans to comply with the Michigan Bureau of Elections, and quite possibly the Michigan Department of Attorney General if the complaint advances that far, by providing the agencies with copies of the check.
“I have the check. It’s full for full market value, and I got it three days before the game,” Wortz said. “It came from a personal account, not a political account of any sort. From Matt Hall’s personal account.”
LaBrant is the former general counsel for the Michigan Chamber of Commerce. He has filed various complaints against Republicans and Democrats alike for lobbying and election law concerns over the past several years.
In the complaint filed Monday, LaBrant references The Detroit News’ reporting on the tickets, which said Hall obtained them through a lobbying firm. 
The Nov. 2 game occurred in the days leading up to Hall saying he would not entertain expanding the state’s Freedom of Information Act laws to cover the governor’s office and the Legislature. At present, current FOIA law does not extend to the executive office and lawmakers’ offices, but a group of legislators, led by state Sen. Jeremy Moss (D-Bloomfield), is hoping to change that.










I don't know what we could have done wrong then. We believe we did what we were supposed to do under the new law.


– William Wortz of Public Affairs Associates


In the interim, there is no current process through FOIA to compel Hall to release a receipt or a reimbursement check that he provided to Wortz or his firm for the tickets.
Enter LaBrant’s complaint, which specifically states that he flagged the potential lobby law violation to compel Wortz to release the amount allegedly paid for the tickets and a photo copy of the reimbursement check.
“This would allow for administrative, investigative and prosecutorial economy of resources,” LaBrant wrote to the state.
LaBrant also noted his belief that, if the transaction was found to violate the state’s lobbying, gifts and disclosure laws, Public Affairs Associates could be charged with a misdemeanor for violating the current reimbursement rules on tickets valued more than $79 a month.
LaBrant asks the state to determine if the check was drawn from Hall’s personal checking account; if the check was made payable to the firm or Wortz, both of which is prohibited under current law; if the check was received before or after the game; and if the check was sufficient to cover the fair market value of tickets provided.
If the check was not drawn out of Hall’s personal account, LaBrant asks the state to determine if the check was drawn using a non-profit fund account linked to Hall.
“Past Speakers have used a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization linked to them to pay for personal expenses,” LaBrant wrote. “This would not be a violation of the Michigan Lobby Law if the 501(c)(4) organization is not registered as a lobbyist or lobbyist agent. If this is the case, when notified by BOE, as the undersigned complainant, I will immediately withdraw my complaint.”
LaBrant also said that if Wortz or the firm refuses to voluntarily comply with the request, should the Michigan Bureau of Elections open an inquiry, the complaint should be forwarded to the Michigan Department of Attorney General.
“Upon a showing of probable cause, the Attorney General can seek an investigative subpoena to obtain emails, bank records,and other documents from (the firm),” LaBrant wrote.
That said, Wortz told the Advance that he was willing to provide the check and any other information to the proper authorities, whether that be the Bureau of Elections or the attorney general’s office.
The Detroit News reported that it had asked Wortz for a copy of the check but he declined to provide it or show the reporter a copy. Wortz told the Advance on Wednesday that he didn’t feel it was his place to do so, especially considering that it had Hall’s personal information on it and he wasn’t sure if the speaker would be OK with sharing that personal information. 
He did not provide a copy of the check to the Advance.
Wortz also said that he was willing to provide the state with a letter that he sent to Hall, indicating that Wortz notified Hall that he has to pay for the tickets in advance of the game as required by new changes in the law.
The law change in question bans lawmakers from receiving gifts from lobbyists more than $79, although sports tickets and concerts are allowed. However, that’s only if the fair market value of the tickets is provided before the lawmakers take possession of the tickets.
“It was sent over to him. He then wrote a personal check and sent a copy of that letter back to us, so I have the letter we sent, the copy of the letter he sent back, and his check,” Wortz said. “I don’t know what we could have done wrong then. We believe we did what we were supposed to do under the new law.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA015559-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-03 11:56:39.209113

Raised in rural West Fairlee, Ailyn Langley followed her fascination with nature to Dartmouth. Now a first-generation college student exploring marine biology, she’s embracing new opportunities as she charts her path toward a future shaped by curiosity and discovery.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Dreaming big, diving deep: Ailyn Langley’s road to colleg[...]","Raised in the hills of rural West Fairlee, Ailyn Langley has always gravitated toward nature—woods, water, and everything in between. As she grew older, her interest turned seaward, sparked by a school trip to the Boston Aquarium with her class at Rivendell High School. Her job in the fish and reptile department at the West Lebanon Aquarium Center deepened that curiosity.
Now a first-year student at Dartmouth College, Ailyn hasn’t declared her major quite yet—but time around salt-water creatures has stuck with her. Ailyn is leaning toward majoring in biology with a focus on marine life.
“I’m headed toward the ocean,” she says confidently. “It’s fascinating and beautiful and I want to be able to look deeper into it. Many parts of the ocean are misunderstood in one way or another,” she says. And Ailyn means sharks, in particular. “People are generally very scared of them. But take hammerhead sharks as an example. You have to use special equipment to swim with them that doesn’t produce bubbles because they are afraid of them. It’s fascinating.”
Ailyn is focusing deeply on marine biology, but she’s also fascinated by neuroscience. Both interests are rooted in classes she took with the same teacher at Rivendell High School. And although she’s only been at Dartmouth for a few months, she is already thinking about the possibilities in front of her. Ailyn says that she wants to take full advantage of every opportunity, especially as Dartmouth was the school that was always in the back of her mind as the place she wanted to be. “I enjoy being here,” she smiles. “The faculty are wonderful and I’ve made some really good friends.” 
There are even some programs at Dartmouth that give students the opportunity to dive, says Ailyn, and she’s excited to learn more about those options. “I really want to use all the opportunities I have here to look into more specifically what I can do. There are still so many things about sharks that haven’t been researched yet, or there are still a lot of questions out there about them, like the fact that no one really knows why hammerheads have heads shaped like a hammer! What if I could help answer those?” 
Working to Reach Her Dream School
Ailyn’s mom passed away from melanoma when Ailyn was 11. Her father is very supportive of Ailyn’s choices, but he wasn’t necessarily well-versed in the college process. Getting into Dartmouth wasn’t easy, Ailyn says.
Ailyn participated in VSAC’s GEAR UP college and career readiness program in high school, and she began working with VSAC Outreach Counselor Kassidy Moore at the end of her junior year. Narrowing her interests and selecting schools to apply to was a journey. 
Initially focused on online art programs, she later shifted toward psychology and then biology. “During the summer before my senior year in high school I started realizing that I wanted art to be my hobby but not something I wanted to be doing in a job setting. I turned my attention toward psychology first, looking into neuroscience,” she says. Whenever she made a college list, Dartmouth was always on it.
Working with VSAC was a critical part of her process. “I was always going to Kassidy, every time she was available, I would be there. She helped me figure out the ideas I wanted to bring into my essays and the colleges I might want to think about,” she says. 
Kassidy also helped her with her essays. “My essay, the general one especially, went through so many drafts. Kassidy’s office was always full, but she would always fit me in,” she says. After acceptance, Kassidy helped connect Ailyn with the first-generation office at Dartmouth and brought her to the school for a campus tour.
Navigating financial aid was another area where Kassidy provided guidance. “My financial aid packages came in, and I had no idea what I was looking at. Kassidy helped me set up a spreadsheet to look at my financial aid, helped me look at scholarships, what else I could apply for, and what it meant for me. She also helped me figure out the documents I might need and what the different schools were asking for,” she says.
Ailyn says that doubts she would be at Dartmouth without help from VSAC. “I don’t know if I would have gone to college without Kassidy. There were so many people at Rivendell helping me, but Kassidy helped me with so many details and explained so many things I had no idea what they meant or what they were doing. We’d be in a totally different situation, and I doubt I’d be at Dartmouth without her help,” she says.
Receiving her acceptance brought on a mix of anxiety and excitement for Ailyn. “When Dartmouth decisions came out, the website took so long to load because so many people were looking at the same time. I was so tired. It was the last college decision I had coming in. I was nervous and anxious. I had no idea if I’d get in. I really hadn’t expected to get in, although I’d dreamed about that moment so many times. A big part of me thought it wasn’t going to happen. I was by myself upstairs in our house. I quietly went downstairs and showed Dad my computer and we really just freaked out together,” she says.
Narrowing Her Focus: “You Can Do Anything—But You Can’t Do Everything”
Ailyn is a first-generation student, and she’s tapped resources offered by Dartmouth College to help provide additional guidance and support to students whose parents did not graduate with a four-year degree. The director of the Dartmouth first-generation office helped her get oriented, she notes. “He always says, ‘you can do anything, but you can’t do everything at Dartmouth.’ It kind of helps narrow my focus a bit,” she explains. 
Ailyn especially appreciates the support system the office provides. “The director has a tissue box in his office signed by everyone who’s cried in there. There are a lot of names. You can get so overwhelmed in college, but that helps you know it’s normal to feel that way,” she says.
Ailyn says Dartmouth’s first-generation community is one of the biggest reasons she feels successful in her first term. “I have challenges with anxiety,” she shares, “so having that support system and these people around me has made a great college experience possible.”
Thinking back to the moment that she found out that she was accepted to Dartmouth, Ailyn feels a little surreal that it all happened. She’s wrapping up her first semester at Dartmouth now. And as for her future? The ocean is calling.

,DC,2025-12-03 16:32:12+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump administration puts a hold on immigration applications from 19 nations,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-puts-hold-immigration-applications-19-nations,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration late Tuesday paused all immigration applications from 19 countries the president earlier had listed for restricted travel into the United States, a move that freezes processing for green card holders and citizenship applications.After two West Virginia National Guard members were shot in the District of Columbia by an Afghan national who was granted asylum, the Trump administration has moved to halt and reexamine all forms of legal immigration, which is handled by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. One guard member, U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died, and U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains critically wounded, although his condition is said to be stable. The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, pleaded not guilty to several charges on Tuesday. The memo says that USCIS will place a hold on processing benefits requests — including citizenship processing — from immigrants hailing from the 19 “high-risk” countries and the agency will re-review any of those approved requests for immigrants who entered the U.S. after Jan, 21, 2021, or under the Biden administration. The 19 countries with travel restrictions into the U.S. are: Afghanistan, Burma, Burundi, Chad, Cuba, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Laos, Libya, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Togo, Turkmenistan, Venezuela and Yemen. In June the president issued a travel ban on those 19 countries. The hold will remain in place until otherwise directed by USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, according to the memo.The memo also states that USCIS will delay action on all applications for asylum and withholdings for removal, regardless of country of origin, “pending a comprehensive review.” A withholding of removal is granted by an immigration judge when a country is deemed too dangerous for an immigrant for deportation, so a third, safer country must be chosen.“USCIS has considered that this direction may result in delay to the adjudication of some pending applications and has weighed that consequence against the urgent need for the agency to ensure that applicants are vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible,” according to the memo. “Ultimately, USCIS has determined that the burden of processing delays that will fall on some applicants is necessary and appropriate in this instance, when weighed against the agency’s obligation to protect and preserve national security.”President Donald Trump and his administration have often criticized immigrants who were granted temporary legal protections under the Biden administration, arguing they were not properly vetted. That has included a special program created for Afghan allies fleeing the Taliban takeover after the chaotic withdrawal by the U.S. in 2021, as well as Latin Americans granted humanitarian parole from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.",,,,2025-12-03 11:56:39.209113

September 17. (Photo by Michele Jokinen/House Public Information Services)The Minnesota Department of Human Services’ effort to quash fraud has led to a new problem: Disabled Medicaid recipients aren’t getting the services they need and are legally entitled to, according to attorneys for the disabled.
Most affected thus far: People who receive Integrated Community Support services, or ICS, which help people with disabilities live independently in the community rather than in an institution.
The ICS program also helps Minnesota stay in compliance with the law, as set forth in the U.S. Supreme Court case Olmstead v. LC, which ruled that the unnecessary segregation of people with disabilities from their community is a form of discrimination.
Attorneys for people with disabilities say their clients are being cut off from ICS following DHS’s suspension of payments to ICS providers in an effort to crack down on fraud that has riddled some other programs. A Minnesota Disability Law Center client with bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, PTSD and ADHD was receiving laundry, cleaning and check-in services from her ICS provider for six months before her services were abruptly suspended in October from DHS’s payment pause.
“There was no real transition; they just stopped providing the services,” said Chad Wilson, an attorney for the Minnesota Disability Law Center.
DHS did not respond to multiple emails from the Reformer, including inquiries about how 14 “high-risk provider types” — including ICS — were chosen for an upcoming audit.
The agency has, however, released a “Medicaid program integrity” website, which offers various charts and statements such as: “We strive for transparency, but sometimes the work requires secrecy.”
Fraud in Minnesota’s human services has become a high-profile political issue, recently drawing attention from President Donald Trump, who used the issue to attack Minnesota’s Somali-American community. Following federal charges against dozens of people alleging they defrauded a child nutrition program, an autism treatment program and Housing Stabilization Services, DHS moved to address fraud in other services, turning its attention to ICS starting in September and 13 other programs starting in December.
But DHS has gone too far and is now hurting people who need help, the attorneys say.
Brianna Boone is an attorney at the Southern Minnesota Regional Legal Services, an organization which represents multiple ICS recipients who’ve been cut off from services without clear guidance from DHS on how to proceed.
“Due process is the main thing I want. DHS should at least be explaining and notifying recipients about what is going on,” Boone said.
The Minnesota Disability Law Center has also been helping several clients neglected by DHS after being cut off from services. Wilson said that one of his clients didn’t receive clear information from DHS on how to get a new provider after the client’s provider was put under investigation in September.
Providers affected by the September ICS payment pause have not yet been told by DHS why their services were flagged as suspicious, according to Josh Berg, director of services at Accessible Space, a disability services provider. While his organization was not flagged, Berg said he has spoken to providers who were. Wilson confirmed that a notice from DHS sent to an ICS provider stated that DHS couldn’t give any detail into why payments to that provider were being withheld exactly.
In Boone’s view, DHS is not doing enough to notify recipients about what’s happening or provide assistance to transfer providers; instead, she said, DHS is relying on providers and case managers to pass along information to clients.
“Our clients are not hearing from DHS at all, so they’re just confused and don’t understand what’s happening,” she said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091725-PHOTO-fraud-committee-MJ-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-12-03 11:56:39.209113
,Mississippi Today,2025-12-03 16:25:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"No, a vehicle didn’t try to run Lane Kiffin off the road, says Mississippi Highway Patrol",Taylor Vance,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/03/lane-kiffin-run-off-road-mississippi-highway-patrol/,Kiffin said in a Monday press conference in Baton Rouge that an angry Rebel fan tried to run him off the road while driving with his son Knox.,"There is no evidence that a driver tried to run former Ole Miss football coach Lane Kiffin off the road while he was on his way to the Oxford airport to accept a new head coaching gig at rival Louisiana State University, according to state and local law enforcement agencies.  
Kiffin announced last weekend that he was leaving Mississippi’s flagship university after helping it clinch a spot in the playoffs for the first time in the program’s history. He said in a Monday press conference in Baton Rouge that an angry Rebel fan tried to run him off the road while he was driving with his son Knox to the airport in Oxford.  
Bailey Holloway, a spokeswoman for the Mississippi Department of Public Safety, told Mississippi Today that Kiffin had a safety escort from the Mississippi Highway Patrol when he traveled to the airport. The agency’s officers have no record of an automobile trying to push the football coach’s car off the roadway, Holloway added.
Sean Tindell, the DPS commissioner, weighed in on the situation by posting a satirical social media video Tuesday night, stating that there were no incidents involving Mississippi Highway Patrol officers trying to run the coach off the road. 
In the video, Tindell wore a visor, something Kiffin is known for wearing, and walked a dog on a leash. Tindell said that the pet was not even his dog, a reference to lingering questions about Juice Kiffin, a dog that has become an unofficial mascot of sorts at Ole Miss. 
“He had a safe trip, and he’s on his way,” Tindell said of Kiffin. “I’m sorry, this is not even my dog. Y’all be safe.” 
Tindell runs the state’s top law enforcement agency and was poking fun at the situation that has inflamed an already bitter rivalry between two SEC schools and caused a wave of internet memes. 
Still, attempting to run a car off a roadway is a criminal offense in Mississippi, and if someone attempted to harm the football coach, state and local police could launch an investigation. 
Breck Jones, the public information officer for the Oxford Police Department, also said that the local police department received no calls or complaints about the alleged incident, and they have not been asked by anyone to look into it. 
Communications officials with LSU athletics and the university did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
This is not the first time Kiffin, now persona non grata among the Ole Miss fan base, has made national headlines over situations that occurred around an airport. The University of Southern California famously fired him in 2013 on the tarmac at the Los Angeles International Airport after the team’s plane landed.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/30155400/AP23324674514427.jpg,,,2025-12-03 11:56:39.209113

(Photo by Jamie Kelter Davis/Getty Images)A stepped-up immigration enforcement operation in and around New Orleans, first reported by the Associated Press last month, launched Wednesday morning, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced.
Dubbed operation “Catahoula Crunch,” the department press release did not provide any details on the planned scope of the operation. But according to internal plans reviewed by the AP, which reported the name of the operation as “Swamp Sweep,” the Trump administration plans to deploy 250 Border Patrol agents to the region, with a goal of arresting 5,000 people in Louisiana and Mississippi.
Catahoula Crunch follows similar operations in Chicago and Charlotte, North Carolina, where Border Patrol agents were accused of using overly aggressive tactics — including dangerous maneuvers during vehicle chases and the deployment of crowd control projectiles — against both those suspected of being in the country illegally and those protesting the enforcement action. In both cities, agents have also been accused of racial profiling.
The Department of Homeland Security press release says the operation will target “criminal aliens,” highlighting a small number of cases of area residents suspected of being in the country illegally who have criminal records.
The press release says those people were released from local custody as a result of the so-called “sanctuary” policy adopted by the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office more than a decade ago.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The policy, which state Attorney General Liz Murrill has recently fought to dissolve, prohibits the Sheriff’s Office from honoring detainer requests from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Such requests, if honored, allow local jails to hold arrestees up to 48 hours past their release date in order to allow ICE to bring them into its custody. The Sheriff’s Office policy was adopted in 2013 to settle a federal lawsuit. The plaintiffs in that suit, arrested in New Orleans on minor charges, were held for months under ICE detainer requests.
“Sanctuary policies endanger American communities by releasing illegal criminal aliens and forcing DHS law enforcement to risk their lives to remove criminal illegal aliens that should have never been put back on the streets,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement.




Though DHS has repeatedly claimed it is targeting criminals, a large number of people with no criminal records have been swept up in earlier operations. In Chicago, for example, of 4,000 people arrested as part of operation “Midway Blitz,” only about 120 have been identified as having a criminal record, The Washington Post reported. Agents have also reportedly arrested a number of American citizens.
The news of the operation has been met with mixed reviews from local and state officials. Conservative Trump allies such as Murrill and Gov. Jeff Landry have come out in strongly in support, while New Orleans Councilmember and Mayor-elect Helena Moreno and fellow Councilmember JP Morrell have pointed to allegations of abuse by Border Patrol agents in other cities recently subjected to stepped-up immigration deployments.
Moreno recently released a brief “know-your-rights” guide for those stopped by federal immigration enforcement agents, along with a list of legal resources.
New Orleans Police Department Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick has been more restrained in her response to the deployment, saying that the department would act as a “partner,” providing assistance to federal immigration agencies when needed for public safety, but at the same time pledging that NOPD officers would not be directly involved in immigration investigations or arrests. Other local, such as the Kenner Police Department — located in the city with the highest concentration of Hispanic residents in the region — have already been working with immigration enforcement agencies.
Asked Wednesday about Catahoula Crunch and how the operation would impact local policing, an NOPD spokesperson referred Verite News to DHS. “There are no updates from NOPD,” the spokesperson said.
The news of the impending sweeps has rattled the region’s immigrant communities. Some businesses have closed in an effort to protect workers and customers, and once-busy gathering spots for immigrant day laborers looking for work were largely abandoned in recent days.

GEAR Board’s Ninth Annual Report Also Highlights Modernization Efforts Across Delaware Government
WILMINGTON, Del. — Gov. Matt Meyer on Monday touted the state’s latest Government Efficiency and Accountability Review (GEAR) Board report, which claims more than $110 million in projected long-term savings and highlights efforts to modernize Delaware’s bureaucracy.
Supporters say the ninth annual report shows progress toward a more transparent and efficient state government. But some lawmakers and fiscal watchdogs note that many of the savings are projections and caution that Delaware’s government has grown significantly in recent years, even as officials promise to “do more with less.”
GEAR report claims long-term savings, modernization
Created in 2017, the GEAR Board was designed to promote a culture of “continuous improvement” in state government by modernizing systems, streamlining processes and expanding data-driven decision-making across agencies.
According to the 2025 report, more than 175 state employees are currently advancing 160 improvement initiatives that are projected to save an estimated $110 million over their lifespan. The report covers work across 23 agencies.
“State government should be honest, transparent, and efficient. Through innovative, collaborative suggestions that are driven by data, the 2025 GEAR report will help ensure that Delawareans’ tax dollars are being used effectively,” Meyer said in a statement. “From streamlining permitting to modernizing digital services, they are making sure state government better serves all Delawareans.”
Among the highlighted initiatives:

Expanded continuous improvement capacity: Employees are being trained in Lean and related methods to identify waste and redesign processes.
A permitting “efficiency blitz”: Using Lean and Agile methods to support the state’s “Ready in Six” initiative, officials say permitting turnaround times were cut by four business weeks, saving at least $1.2 million annually.
State Land Inventory Management (SLIM): A new centralized platform tracks state-owned property to help agencies make more informed decisions about land use, surplus assets, environmental impacts and economic development.
Cost controls and service changes: The report cites initiatives such as lease restructuring, fleet cost management, healthcare cost containment, streamlined employee onboarding, improved correctional officer retention, online environmental permitting, a unified school library catalog, modernized background checks and upgrades to financial, HR, criminal justice and IT systems.

The GEAR program also recognized several technology-driven projects with its Public-Private Partnership awards, honoring teams from the Department of Education, the Department of Services for Children, Youth and Their Families, and DelDOT.
Questions about “projected” savings and growth
The administration frames the $110 million figure as proof that efficiency efforts are paying off. But some center-right critics argue that “projected” savings are not the same as audited, realized reductions in spending, and say taxpayers should see clear, line-item evidence that programs are smaller, more efficient or eliminated altogether — not just reorganized.
They also argue that while digital upgrades and new platforms can improve service, they can bring their own ongoing costs for software, consultants and cybersecurity. Some fiscal conservatives say they want to see whether long-term operating budgets actually shrink or whether new systems simply become another permanent layer of government.
Recommendations: more training, more tech — and more AI
To “build on current momentum,” the report recommends:

Continuing to expand employee training in leadership, continuous improvement and project management through the First State Quality Improvement Fund.
Broadening Ready in Six permitting reforms across DelDOT, DNREC and OMB, and exploring a virtual one-stop permitting system for better predictability and faster turnaround times for businesses and developers.
Scaling digital services through the Go DE platform so residents and visitors can access government services from any device at any time.
Adopting emerging tools, including artificial intelligence and business process analytics, to speed up work and improve measurable outcomes.

Good-government advocates generally welcome better data and faster permitting, but some on the right warn that using AI inside government must be paired with strong safeguards, transparency and clear limits to protect privacy and civil liberties.

“With more than 175 State employees engaged in training, applying Lean methods, and leading projects across Delaware government, the drive for greater efficiency and a culture of continuous improvement continues to grow,” said the GEAR Program Management Team — Executive Director Charles Clark, Deputy Director Daniel Madrid and Bryan Sullivan, OMB’s Director of Management Efficiency.
They emphasized the importance of strong return-on-investment analysis, standardized business processes and improved project management to ensure measurable outcomes rather than simply new layers of reporting.
The full 2025 GEAR report is available through the Office of Management and Budget and outlines next steps in the state’s modernization agenda for residents, businesses and taxpayers.
New Office of Inspector General aims at oversight — with questions about independence
In a related move, Meyer in August signed Senate Bill 4, creating Delaware’s first independent Office of Inspector General, a long-discussed reform that passed with bipartisan support. The state is now accepting applications for the position through Dec. 15.
“Creating an Office of Inspector General is a major step toward a more open, accountable, and trustworthy state government,” Meyer said when signing the bill. “We are looking for applicants with unquestionable integrity, deep experience in oversight or investigations, and a demonstrated commitment to public service.”
The new office will investigate waste, fraud, abuse, mismanagement or corruption in state government. It is expected to coordinate with — but not replace — the Attorney General’s Office and the Office of Auditor of Accounts.
Under the statute, a selection panel appointed by the Secretary of State will review candidates and recommend a short list to the governor. From that list, the governor will nominate one candidate for Senate confirmation to a five-year term.
Supporters say the structure will give the office independence and stability across administrations. Some skeptics, however, note that the governor and his appointees still play a central role in the selection process and argue that stronger separation from the executive branch would better insulate the Inspector General from political pressure.
The office is expected to work alongside existing oversight bodies such as the State Auditor, Attorney General and Public Integrity Commission and issue public annual reports outlining investigations, findings and recommendations.
Delaware Budget Cost vs. potential savings
The office is expected to require an annual budget of about $1.5 million. Backers argue that Inspector General’s offices in other states have routinely saved or recovered many times their operating costs through audits, investigations and enforcement actions.
More than 30 states operate some form of an Inspector General’s office, though their structure and powers vary widely. Supporters in Delaware say the new office, if given sufficient independence and resources, could be one of the few initiatives that truly pays for itself by rooting out fraud and waste.
Fiscal conservatives largely welcome the concept of a watchdog but say the real test will be whether the office is willing to challenge powerful agencies, publish uncomfortable findings and recommend actual spending cuts — not just new policies and training.
For now, the GEAR Board’s report and the creation of an Inspector General mark parallel efforts: one focused on internal process improvements and technology upgrades, the other on independent oversight. Taxpayers who have watched state spending climb in recent years will be watching to see whether either effort produces lasting, measurable savings — not just new reports and new offices.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Gear-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-03 11:56:39.209113

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)With a new governor poised to take the reins in January, a public policy group has issued a roadmap for New Jersey’s future, warning that runaway housing costs, public health and educational inequities, and public transportation gaps undermine the potential of many residents.
The Fund for New Jersey convened policy experts, community leaders, and residents for a series of conversations earlier this year to come up with the policy priorities released Wednesday.
Brandon McKoy, the nonprofit’s president, hopes policymakers at all levels, from Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill “down to the dog catcher,” regard the report’s recommendations as marching orders from New Jersey’s 9.5 million residents.
“We listened closely to what New Jerseyans told us,” McKoy said. “These recommendations reflect the priorities that surfaced repeatedly and the areas where leadership is needed most.”
McKoy’s group, which has provided two grants to the New Jersey Monitor, listed seven policy priorities they deemed most urgent:
 Public health, climate, and the environment

Officials should step up ongoing efforts to eliminate lead exposure, which can cause developmental delays, behavioral changes, and other health harms, especially in children. As climate risks escalate and the clean-energy workforce expands, policymakers should create a statewide hub to train people for green jobs such as stormwater management and urban forestry.
Officials should revive a ban on trucks older than 2007 from ports operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reduce diesel emissions in Newark, Elizabeth, and surrounding areas already disproportionately impacted by pollution.
Officials should do a cost-benefit analysis of beach replenishment projects, including climate change considerations. Such work has cost more than $3 billion in federal, state, and local tax funds, according to NJ.com. The feds typically foot the bulk of the bill, but the Trump administration has cut hundreds of millions in beach renewal funds this year.
“It is a losing proposition to keep spending taxpayer dollars to replace sand that washes away in extreme weather,” the report says.
 Criminal justice reform

Officials can make the criminal justice system fairer by shortening the state’s speedy-trial timeline, in which defendants can languish for up to two years in prison waiting for their case to go to trial.
Rather than cracking down on low-level crimes like disorderly conduct, officials should divert such offenders to social services, sparing them convictions that later can block access to jobs, housing, and education, the report says.
They should also reduce barriers that threaten the successful reentry of people who leave prison. That could involve providing transitional housing, eliminating employment restrictions and driver’s license suspensions, and funding health care, educational, and vocational programs.
Allowing people with felony convictions to serve on juries also should be a priority, the report says. Excluding them separates them from a civic duty and keeps their lived experience out of jury deliberations.

 Schools

The state should shift away from a census-based funding model to cover the cost of special education services. That model uses a statewide average to fund special education, leaving districts with more special-education students than average scrambling to close budget gaps.
The state also should spend more on higher education, with the broader goal of increasing the number of residents who earn college degrees. Gov. Phil Murphy cut more than $100 million from New Jersey’s colleges and universities in the current budget. That means New Jersey’s already expensive institutions could hike tuition to make up the loss, leaving degrees out of reach for low- and middle-income students, according to the report.
Already, fewer than half — about 43% — of New Jersey residents have a bachelor’s degree or higher, the report says. And thousands of college students take longer than four years to complete a degree, adding to their debt burden.
 Affordable housing

McKoy’s group recommends reestablishing the state public advocate’s office, a watchdog former Gov. Chris Christie abolished in 2010, and making fair housing one of its key mandates.
Christie also dissolved the New Jersey Meadowlands Commission in 2015 by merging it with the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority. The commission had used regional tax-base sharing, which enabled 14 towns to share the costs and benefits of development. McKoy’s group recommends restoring the commission as an independent agency, as well as its tax-base-sharing, to ensure stronger enforcement of environmental standards.
Enacting statewide rent controls and growing the Affordable Housing Trust Fund also should be priorities for policymakers.
 Jobs and the economy

The state should repeal the New Jersey Parking Offenses Adjudication Act, which enables officials to suspend the driver’s license or vehicle registration of people who don’t pay parking fines. That disproportionately impacts lower-income residents, who may be unable to afford parking fines. Losing their license or registration could threaten their jobs, so New Jersey should follow the lead of states including Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Illinois, where lawmakers ended license suspensions over most non-moving violations.
New Jersey’s unemployment rate is higher than the national average. And 9% of residents age 25 to 64 don’t have a high school diploma or general-equivalency degree — the minimum requirement for many jobs, according to the Kids Count Data Center. Those trends show that the state should provide more and better education and vocational training.
Making child care more affordable would help, the report says. While the state has expanded free preschool, universal child care is “vital for helping families succeed,” McKoy said.
“It’s really becoming a major, major crisis that’s preventing families from being able to be economically stable, let alone successful,” he said.
The report also recommends that New Jersey establish a guaranteed basic income, in which low-income families could count on state support for their essential needs.
“It is a crucial safety net addition for today’s economy, where full-time work does not guarantee financial stability,” the report says.
Baby bonds also would help erase disparities by giving low-income infants a savings endowment they can access at age 18.
 The state’s fiscal responsibility

The record $58.8 billion budget state lawmakers approved in June contained controversial cuts, diversions, and funding freezes on affordable housing, child care, and opioid settlement funds, among other things, that left angry advocates demanding reversals. At the same time, lawmakers tacked on more than $700 million in last-minute pet projects critics have condemned as pork.
“Budgets are statements of decisions, and every budget has things in it that I would say are driving towards community benefit, and unfortunately, some things that are not,” McKoy said.
To ensure better fiscal responsibility, the fund recommended that officials review and reduce the tax breaks the state has increasingly given out to lure businesses to New Jersey.
“The effectiveness of this strategy is being questioned. At present, New Jersey does not monitor tax expenditures closely to control their growth and to determine whether they deliver their intended economic benefits,” the report notes.
New Jersey also must restore its “rainy day” reserves, which are meant to cover state operations during emergencies. The state now ranks last in the nation, with just enough money in its rainy day fund to cover two days of operations; Wyoming, in comparison, leads the nation, with enough in its reserves to run the state for 302 days, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts.

 Public transit

Public transit agencies in other states can rely on regular operating funds from the state. NJ Transit’s funding, though, is marked by “constant scarcity and instability,” the report says.
The agency consequently diverts $400 million annually in federal transit dollars meant for capital improvements to cover budget shortfalls, which contributes to chronic service disruptions, according to the report. Establishing a stable and permanent state funding allocation would improve service.
The group also called on NJ Transit, the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority, the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission, and the South Jersey Transportation Planning Organization to work together to conduct long-range planning.
“A lack of public transportation options in South Jersey in particular was a major sore spot for folks,” McKoy said. “Not only will that help folks have different ways of getting around, but also alleviate traffic on the road.”
 Other emerging issues

The report listed several other “emerging” priorities, including expanding government oversight and accountability.
Eliminating or weakening government watchdogs leaves public programs and systems vulnerable to waste, fraud, and abuse, the report says.
McKoy pointed to lawmakers’ current effort to strip the state comptroller’s office of its investigative powers. Such an effort goes against what his group heard during their community conversations, he said.
“Folks want to know that the government is properly spending public money and also cracking down on fraud, waste, and abuse,” McKoy said. “They talk about the state being expensive and needing to do a better job of officially using funds. So we need to actually invest more in these offices that are providing oversight of government processes.”
The report recommends making the state comptroller an independent position, rather than one appointed by the governor and subject to state Senate approval; reestablishing the state Office of the Public Advocate to give residents a stronger voice in holding government accountable; and expanding the Open Public Records Act to reduce exemptions that allow officials to keep records secret. Lawmakers last year instead added new restrictions to public records.
Policymakers also should embrace policies that support immigrants, who comprise 29% of New Jersey’s working population, the report says. Strategies could include boosting funding to the state Office of New Americans and creating pathways for immigrants to pursue entrepreneurial opportunities.
The report urges policymakers to expand access to voting by passing same-day voter registration and a Voting Rights Act.
McKoy’s group also implored officials to get an early start on ensuring the state’s population is correctly counted in the 2030 Census. Federal officials use census data to determine federal funding, so an accurate count is especially important as states endure unprecedented cuts made by the Trump administration, McKoy added.
“The census is the biggest non-wartime effort in the history of the nation, so it requires a lot of forethought,” he said. “Making sure we do a good job on the Census is actually really crucial over these next couple of years to make sure that we are getting all of our federal funds possible.”

For decades, corn has reigned over American agriculture. It sprawls across 90 million acres — about the size of Montana — and goes into everything from livestock feed and processed foods to the ethanol blended into most of the nation’s gasoline. 
But a growing body of research reveals that America’s obsession with corn has a steep price: The fertilizer used to grow it is warming the planet and contaminating water.
Corn is essential to the rural economy and to the world’s food supply, and researchers say the problem isn’t the corn itself. It’s how we grow it. 
Corn farmers rely on heavy fertilizer use to sustain today’s high yields. And when that nitrogen breaks down in the soil, it releases nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas nearly 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Producing nitrogen fertilizer also emits large amounts of carbon dioxide, adding to its climate footprint.
Agriculture accounts for more than 10% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and corn uses more than two-thirds of all nitrogen fertilizer nationwide — making it the leading driver of agricultural nitrous oxide emissions, studies show.
The corn and ethanol industries insist that rapid growth in ethanol — which now consumes more than 40% of the U.S. corn crop —  is a net environmental benefit, and they strongly dispute research suggesting otherwise.
Since 2000, U.S. corn production has surged almost 50%, further adding to the crop’s climate impact.

Yet the environmental costs of corn rarely make headlines or factor into political debates. Much of the dynamic traces back to federal policy — and to the powerful corn and ethanol lobby that helped shape it. 
The Renewable Fuel Standard, passed in the mid 2000s, required that gasoline be blended with ethanol, a biofuel that in the United States comes almost entirely from corn. That mandate drove up demand and prices for corn, spurring farmers to plant more of it. 
Many plant corn year after year on the same land. The practice, called “continuous corn,” demands massive amounts of nitrogen fertilizer and drives especially high nitrous oxide emissions. 
At the same time, federal subsidies make it more lucrative to grow corn than to diversify. Taxpayers have covered more than $50 billion in corn insurance premiums over the past 30 years, according to federal data compiled by the Environmental Working Group.
Researchers say proven conservation steps — such as planting rows of trees, shrubs and grasses in corn fields — could sharply reduce these emissions. But the Trump administration has eliminated many of the incentives that helped farmers try such practices. 
Experts say it all raises a larger question: If America’s most widely planted crop is worsening climate change, shouldn’t we begin growing it a different way?
How corn took over America
Corn has been a staple of U.S. agriculture for centuries, first domesticated by Native Americans and later used by European immigrants as a versatile crop for food and animal feed. Its production really took off in the 2000s after federal mandates and incentives helped turn much of America’s corn crop into ethanol.
Corn’s dominance — and the emissions that come with it — didn’t happen by accident. It was built through a high-dollar lobbying campaign that continues today.
In the late 1990s, America’s corn farmers were in trouble. Prices had cratered amid a global grain glut and the Asian financial crisis. A 1999 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis said crop prices had hit “rock bottom.”
In 2001 and 2002, the federal government gave corn farmers and ethanol producers a boost — first through the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Bioenergy Program, which paid ethanol producers to increase their use of farm commodities for fuel. Then the 2002 Farm Bill created programs that continue to support ethanol and other renewable energy.
Corn growers soon after mounted an all-out campaign in Washington. Their goal: persuade Congress to require gasoline to be blended with ethanol. State and national grower groups lobbied relentlessly, pitching ethanol as a way to cut greenhouse gasses, reduce oil dependence and revive rural economies.
“We got down to a couple of votes in Congress, and the corn growers were united like never before,” recalled Jon Doggett, then the industry’s chief lobbyist, in an article published by the National Corn Growers Association. “I started receiving calls from Capitol Hill saying, ‘Would you have your growers stop calling us? We are with you.’ I had not seen anything like it before and haven’t seen anything like it since.”
Their persistence paid off. In 2005, Congress created the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which requires that a certain amount of ethanol be blended into U.S. gasoline each year. Two years later, lawmakers expanded it further. The policy transformed the market: The amount of corn used for ethanol domestically has more than tripled in the past 20 years.

When demand for corn spiked as a result of the RFS, it pushed up prices worldwide, said Tim Searchinger, a researcher at Princeton University’s School of Public and International Affairs. The result, Searchinger said, is that more land around the world got cleared to grow corn. That, in turn, resulted in more emissions. 
That lobbying brought clout. “King Corn” became a political force, courted by presidential hopefuls and protected by both parties. Since 2010, national corn and ethanol trade groups have spent more than $55 million on lobbying and millions more on political donations, according to campaign finance records analyzed by Floodlight. 
In 2024 alone, those trade groups spent twice as much on lobbying as the National Rifle Association. Major industry players — Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill and ethanol giant POET among them — have poured even more into Washington, ensuring the sector’s voice remains one of the loudest in U.S. agriculture.
Now those same groups are pushing for the next big prize: expanding higher-ethanol gasoline blends and positioning ethanol-based jet fuel as aviation’s “low-carbon” future.
Research undercuts ethanol’s clean-fuel claims
Corn and ethanol trade groups didn’t make their officials available for interviews.
But on their websites and in their literature, they have promoted corn ethanol as a climate-friendly fuel. 
The Renewable Fuels Association cites government and university research that finds burning ethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 40-50% compared with gasoline. The ethanol industry says the climate critics have it wrong — and that most of the corn used for fuel comes from better yields and smarter farming, not from plowing up new land. The amount of fertilizer required to produce a bushel of corn has dropped sharply in recent decades, they say.
“Ethanol reduces carbon emissions, removing the carbon equivalent of 12 million cars from the road each year,” according to the Renewable Fuels Association.
Growth Energy, a major ethanol trade group, said in a written statement to Floodlight that U.S. farmers and biofuel producers are “constantly finding new ways to make their operations more efficient and more environmentally beneficial,” using things like cover crops to reduce their carbon footprint.
“Biofuel producers are making investments today that will make their products net-zero or even net negative in the next two decades,” the statement said.
But some research tells a different story.
A recent Environmental Working Group report finds that the way corn is grown in much of the Midwest — with the same fields planted in corn year after year — carries a heavy climate cost.

Research in 2022 by agricultural land use expert Tyler Lark and colleagues links the Renewable Fuel Standard to expanded corn cultivation, heavier fertilizer use, worsening water pollution and increased emissions. Scientists typically convert greenhouse gasses like nitrous oxide and methane into their carbon-dioxide equivalents — or carbon intensity — so their warming impacts can be compared on the same scale.
“The carbon intensity of corn ethanol produced under the RFS is no less than gasoline and likely at least 24% higher,” the authors concluded.
Lark’s research has been disputed by scientists at Argonne National Laboratory, Purdue University and the University of Illinois, who published a formal rebuttal arguing the study relied on “questionable assumptions” and faulty modeling — a charge Lark’s team has rejected.
A 2017 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that the RFS was unlikely to meet its greenhouse gas goals because the U.S. relies predominantly on corn ethanol and produces relatively little of the cleaner, advanced biofuels made from waste. 
The problem isn’t just emissions, researchers say. Corn ethanol requires millions of acres that could instead be used for food crops or more efficient energy sources. One recent study found that solar panels can generate as much energy as corn ethanol on roughly 3% of the land. 
“It’s just a terrible use of land,” Searchinger, the Princeton researcher, said of ethanol. “And you can’t solve climate change if you’re going to make such terrible use of land.”
Most of the country’s top crop isn’t feeding people. More than 40% of U.S. corn goes to ethanol. A similar amount is used to feed livestock, and just 12% ends up as food or in other uses.
As corn production rises, so have emissions 
Globally, corn production doubled from 2000 to 2021. 
That growth has been fueled by fertilizer, which emits nitrous oxide that can linger in the atmosphere for more than a century. That eats away at the ozone layer, which blocks most of the sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiation.
Global emissions have soared alongside corn production. Between 1980 and 2020, nitrous oxide emissions from human activity climbed 40%, the Global Carbon project found. 
In the United States, nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture in 2022 were equal to roughly 262 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to the EPA’s inventory of greenhouse gas emissions. That’s equivalent to putting almost 56 million passenger cars on the road.
The biggest increases are coming straight from the Corn Belt.
Emissions of nitrous oxide — an extremely potent greenhouse gas — have soared in America’s Corn Belt in the years since nitrogen fertilizer use became widespread. (Environmental Working Group visualization of nitrous oxide data from Iowa State University researcher Chaoqun Lu and colleagues.)
Ethanol’s climate footprint isn’t the only concern. The nitrogen used to grow corn and other crops is also a key source of drinking water pollution.
According to a new report by the Alliance for the Great Lakes and Clean Wisconsin, more than 90% of nitrate contamination in Wisconsin’s groundwater is linked to agricultural sources — mostly synthetic fertilizer and manure. 
The same analysis estimates that in 2022, farmers applied more than 16 million pounds of nitrogen beyond what crops needed, sending runoff into wells, streams and other water systems.
For families like Tyler Frye’s, that hits close to home. In 2022, Frye and his wife moved into a new home in the rural village of Casco, Wisconsin, about 20 miles east of Green Bay. A free test soon afterward found their well water had nitrate levels more than twice the EPA’s safe limit. “We were pretty shocked,” he said. 
Frye installed a reverse-osmosis system in the basement and still buys bottled water for his wife, who is breastfeeding their daughter, born in July.
One likely culprit, he suspects, are the cornfields less than 200 yards from his home. 
“Crops like corn require a lot of nitrogen,” he said. “A lot of that stuff, I assume, is getting into the well water and surface water.”
When he watches manure or fertilizer being spread on nearby fields, he said, one question nags him: “Where does that go?”
What cleaner corn could look like
Reducing corn’s climate footprint is possible — but the farmers trying to do it are swimming against the policy tide.
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, backed by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, strips out the provisions of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act that had rewarded farmers for climate-friendly practices.
And in April, Trump’s USDA canceled the $3 billion Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities initiative, a grant program designed to promote farming and forestry practices to improve soil and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The agency said that the program’s administrative costs meant too little money was reaching farmers, while Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins dismissed it as part of the “green new scam.” 
University of Iowa professor Silvia Secchi said the rollback of the Climate-Smart program has already given farmers “cold feet” about adopting conservation practices. “The impact of this has been devastating,” said Secchi, a natural resources economist who teaches at the university’s School of Earth, Environment and Sustainability.
Research shows what’s possible if farmers had support. In its recent report, the Environmental Working Group found that four proven conservation practices — including planting trees, shrubs and hedgerows in corn fields — could make a measurable difference. 
Implementing those practices on just 4% of continuous corn acres across Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin would cut total greenhouse gas emissions by the equivalent of taking more than 850,000 gasoline cars off the road, EWG found.
Despite setbacks at the federal level, some farmers are already showing what a more climate-friendly Corn Belt could look like.
In northern Iowa, Wendy Johnson farms 1,200 acres of corn and soybeans with her father. On 130 of those acres, she’s trying something different: She’s planting fruit and nut trees, organic grains, shrubs and other plants that need little or no nitrogen fertilizer. 
“The more perennials we can have on the ground, the better it is for the climate,” she said. 
Across the rest of the farm, they enrich the soil by rotating crops and planting cover crops. They’ve also converted less productive parts of the fields into “prairie strips” — bands of prairie grass that store carbon and require no fertilizer. 
Under the now-cancelled Climate-Smart grant program, they were supposed to receive technical assistance and about $20,000 a year to expand those practices. The grant program was terminated before they got any of the money.
“It’s hard to take risks on your own,” Johnson said. “That’s where federal support really helps. Because agriculture is a high-risk occupation.”
The economics still favor business as usual. Johnson knows that many Midwestern corn growers feel pressure to maximize yields, keeping them hooked on corn — and nitrogen fertilizer. 
“I think a lot of farmers around here are very allergic to trees,” she joked. 
In southeast Iowa, sixth-generation farmer Levi Lyle, who mixes organic and conventional methods across 290 acres, uses a three-year rotation, extensive cover crops and a technique called roller-crimping — flattening rye each spring to create a mulch that suppresses weeds, feeds the soil and reduces fertilizer needs. 
“The roller crimping of cover crops is a huge, huge opportunity to sequester more carbon, improve soil health, save money on chemicals and still get a similar yield,” he said.
But farmers get few government incentives to take such climate-friendly steps, Lyle said. “There is a lack of seriousness about supporting farmers to implement these new practices,” he said. 
And without federal programs to offset the risk, the innovations that Lyle and Johnson are trying remain exceptions — not the norm.
Many farmers still see prairie strips or patches of trees as a waste, said Luke Gran, whose company helps Iowa farmers establish perennials.
“My eyes do not lie,” Gran said. “I have not seen extensive change to cover cropping or tillage across the broad acreage of this state that I love.”
The next corn boom?
Despite mounting research about corn’s climate costs, industry groups are pushing for policies to  boost ethanol demand. 
One big priority: Pushing a bill to require that new cars are able to run on gas with more ethanol than what’s commonly sold today.
Corn and biofuel trade groups have also been pressing Democrats and Republicans in Congress for legislation to pave the way for ethanol-based jet fuel. While use of such “sustainable” aviation fuel is still in its early stages domestically, corn and biofuel associations have made developing a market for it a top policy priority.

Secchi, the Iowa professor, says it’s easy to see why ethanol producers are trying to expand their market: The growth in electric vehicles threatens long-term gasoline sales.
Researchers warn that producing enough ethanol-based jet fuel could trigger major land-use shifts. A 2024 World Resources Institute analysis found that meeting the federal goal of 35 billion gallons of ethanol jet fuel would require about 114 million acres of corn — roughly 20% more corn acreage than the U.S. already plants for all purposes. That surge in demand, the authors concluded, would push up food prices and worsen hunger.
Secchi calls that scenario a climate and land-use “disaster.” Large-scale use of ethanol-based aviation fuel, she said, would mean clearing even more land and pouring on even more nitrogen fertilizer, driving up greenhouse gas emissions. 
“The result,” she said, “would be essentially to enshrine this dysfunctional system that we created.”

(Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A legislative panel gave South Carolina’s state-owned utility the initial nod to begin purchasing equipment for a planned new natural gas plant in the Lowcountry.
But first, they had questions about the project’s growing price tag and what that might mean for power customers.
State-owned Santee Cooper and Virginia-headquartered Dominion have agreed to partner on a 2,200-megawatt power plant on the site of a former coal plant along the Edisto River near Canadys.
The power companies now estimate the cost of that plant at $5 billion — up from a $2.5 billion told to senators last August.
That early estimate was based on historical costs to build similar units. But prices have increased dramatically since then as utility companies globally rush to build similar plants, said Santee Cooper CEO Jimmy Staton.
Here’s what SC landowners should expect from a proposed 71-mile natural gas pipeline

The sticker shock had some legislators questioning whether a gas plant was still the best choice for meeting the state’s growing power needs.
Rep. Leon Stavrinakis raised concerns over whether the same demand driving up the cost of the plant’s turbines would also make the gas needed to run them more expensive.
“If everybody is going to be drawing on that same power source, it seems logical to me that that power source is going to get more expensive,” the Charleston Democrat said.
Stavrinakis went on to say the rising cost of electricity is becoming too much for residents who need it to keep the lights on in their homes and small businesses.
“My constituents, I’m going to be honest with you, can’t afford any more rate increases,” he said. “People are hurting.”
Staton acknowledged the price of natural gas has gone up in the past year and a half as the United States has started to export more to other countries.
The U.S. is the world’s largest producer and exporter of natural gas, and gas exports have tripled in the past five years. By 2030, it will double again, according to a study by the U.S. Department of Energy published in December 2024.
Meanwhile, use of natural gas in the U.S. is expected to hit a new record this year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
However, Staton said, the cost of other fuels has been on the rise as well. He said coal prices, for example, are two to three times higher than they were four years ago.
Staton said Santee Cooper has accounted for a potential increase in natural gas prices as part of its long-term plans.
“And in every case, what we find, is this: These are still the best dispatchable resources for us to invest in,” he said of the gas-fired power plants.
Santee Cooper will start by spending $120 million for its share of equipment costs at Canadys.
How much customers ultimately will pay on their monthly power bills for the new gas plant remains to be seen. But Staton told legislators he expects any price increases to match the general rate of inflation.
The power companies still need the permission of state regulators before it can begin construction. Staton said Santee Cooper and Dominion plans to file that application on Dec. 15.
Legislators also signed off on spending related to two other natural gas-related projects: nearly $300 million for a pair of natural gas turbines on the site of an existing coal plant near Georgetown and more than $270 million for the expansion of an existing natural gas plant.
The coal plant, Winyah, came online in 1975 and Santee Cooper plans to close it down within the next decade.
There’s already gas pipelines and power lines that run to the Winyah plant, Staton said, making it an ideal location for the gas turbines and providing a potential future use for the site.
The small turbines will produce about 100 megawatts of electricity and Santee Cooper can fire them up quickly at the time of day when power usage is at its highest.
They would also work well with solar power, Santee Cooper spokeswoman Mollie Gore said, because they can be turned on on days when the sun isn’t shining.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DSC_0320-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-03 11:01:13.127380
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-03 15:15:00+00:00,CT Mirror,More industries want Trump’s help hiring immigrant labor,Tim Henderson | Stateline,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/03/immigrant-workers-industries-seeking-break/,"Restaurants, construction and landscaping businesses lost a combined 315,000 immigrant workers through August, according to a Stateline analysis.","As food prices remain high, the Trump administration has made it easier for farmers to hire foreign guest workers and to pay them less. Now, other industries with large immigrant workforces also are asking for relief as they combat labor shortages and raids.
Visas for temporary foreign workers are a quick fix with bipartisan support in Congress. And Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins’ office told Stateline that “streamlining” visas for both agricultural and other jobs is a priority for the Trump administration.
[RELATED: Trump allows more foreign ag workers, eases off ICE raids on farms]
But some experts warn that such visas can be harmful if they postpone immigration overhauls that would give immigrant workers a path to green cards and citizenship.
“Lack of permanent status is costly to migrants, employers, and the broader economy,” wrote Pia Orrenius, a labor economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, in a report published in June. Workers are “vulnerable to policy changes triggered by a change in administration, most recently the threat of mass deportations.”
In a Nov. 25 interview with Stateline, Orrenius said the crackdown on illegal immigration could be a good thing if it leads to permanent solutions.
“If you can stop undocumented immigration, then great. This is a great time to work on comprehensive immigration reform,” Orrenius said. “Where is there a scarcity of workers and how do we address those legally instead of illegally?”
Restaurants, construction and landscaping businesses have lost a combined 315,000 immigrant workers through August this year, more than any other industries, according to a Stateline analysis of Current Population Survey data provided by the University of Minnesota at ipums.org.
The construction industry needs more foreign worker visas like those already being provided for agriculture to prevent more delays in building everything from homes to highways, business owners say.
The industry needs help to “provide lawful workers while working to prepare more Americans for permanent careers in construction,” said Jaime Andress, testifying at a congressional hearing last month on behalf of the Associated General Contractors of America trade group. About 92% of contractors with open positions are having trouble finding enough skilled labor, whether it’s for construction of buildings, highways or utility infrastructure, she testified.
There are about 145,000 fewer immigrants working in restaurants, on average, through August of this year compared with the same period in 2024, the Stateline analysis found. There are about 127,000 fewer in construction and 43,000 fewer in landscaping.
One landscaping firm, which did not agree to an interview, lost $50,000 in contracts this year when workers stopped showing up because of rumored immigration raids, said Rebecca Shi, chief executive officer of the Chicago-based American Business Immigration Coalition, which advocates for employers seeking immigration changes.
“He had 75 workers and 50 of them didn’t show up one day because there were rumors ICE was going to be in the area,” Shi said. “Many of them were citizens and legal workers, but they were worried about family members and neighbors, so they didn’t show up either. It’s bad for the economy when you lose a worker, but it’s also the fear and uncertainty. We know restaurants that have lost 50% of staff and are at risk of closing because people just aren’t showing up.”
The coalition organized a “fly-in” in October to Washington, D.C., to ask members of Congress for more help to legalize immigrant workers through work permits in hospitality, agriculture, construction, elder care, health care and manufacturing.
In a letter dated Dec. 2, thousands of businesses in all 50 states asked the administration for an additional 64,716 H-2B visas, saying they rely on them for seasonal surges in hospitality, tourism, landscaping, forestry, seafood production and other industries.
And a bipartisan group of 33 U.S. senators from 22 states signed a letter Nov. 13 by Maine Independent Sen. Angus King and South Dakota Republican Sen. Mike Rounds asking for more H-2B seasonal employment visas.
“Employers’ workforce needs cannot be met with American workers alone,” the letter said.
Construction contractors say they need visas that are similar to the H-2A visas for agriculture that the Trump administration streamlined in October to make them easier and cheaper for farmers to hire temporary foreign workers.
The Associated General Contractors of America wants visas like the proposed new H-2C visas floated by Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Rep. Lloyd Smucker. Those would allow up to 85,000 less-skilled temporary workers in construction, hospitality and other fields to stay in this country up to nine years. The bill, introduced in September, has not advanced.
The association also supports a pathway to legal status for some workers already in the country, as proposed by Florida Republican U.S. Rep. María Elvira Salazar and Texas Democratic U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar. The bill, introduced in July, also has not advanced.
“Workforce shortages are the leading cause of construction project delays,” said Brian Turmail, a vice president at the association. “Nearly 1 out of 3 contractors have been impacted in one way or another by enhanced ICE enforcement activities. That number is almost certain to increase now that ICE has received significant boosts to its budget as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”
Those industries are asking for more help as the latest federal immigration raids further affect workforces in Illinois, Maryland and North Carolina, with more raids planned in Louisiana. Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data research organization at Syracuse University, reported a “massive redeployment of government military and civilian personnel to immigration enforcement” in recent months, with total detentions reaching more than 65,000, according to a Nov. 24 report. Nearly three-quarters of those arrested have no criminal convictions.
Construction, landscaping and other industries are already heavy users of H-2B visas for temporary non-agricultural foreign workers, according to government figures reviewed by Stateline.
In fiscal year 2025, which ended in September, there were about 209,000 H-2B visas, with Texas (20,051), Florida (18,515), North Carolina (8,634), Colorado (7,723) and Louisiana (7,234) getting the most. The most common occupations were building and grounds (94,152); food service (31,403); construction (16,729); farming, fishing and forestry (15,665); and personal care (12,170).
Some of the largest users of the visas last year were Core Tech Construction of New York City, a concrete coring and cutting firm (2,619 visas); ABC Professional Tree Services of Texas, which provides land clearance services (1,913); and Progressive Solutions LLC of Arkansas, which provides herbicide application to utilities (1,882).
The H-2B visa program needs to be streamlined and expanded to be useful for employers and workers, said David Bier, director of immigration studies at the libertarian CATO Institute, who has written about the visas.
Employers don’t always get the workers they want because the United States limits H-2B visas to 33,000 twice a year. Requests for the visas have already surpassed the 33,000 cap for the first half of fiscal 2026.
“The paperwork is a nightmare for employers and there are a lot of steps for workers also,” said Bier. “And there are so few visas available that your chance of getting all you need is almost nil.”

U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., is leading the bipartisan proposal with support from U.S. Reps. Eugene Vindman, D-Woodbridge, and Republican David Valadao of California. Kaine told the Mercury Tuesday that the Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act would boost access to essential tech skills for job seekers. 
More than 90% of today’s jobs require digital skills, according to a report published by the National Skills Coalition and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, but more than a third of workers lack such skills, creating a challenge for employment.
“I think the workforce is the key ingredient to getting the American economy right, and if we do, we’re going to be fine, and if we don’t, we’re going to regret it, and this bill kind of fits into that space,” said Kaine.
On July 22, 2014, the WIOA was signed into law, shaping the nation’s public workforce development program and replacing the former Workforce Investment Act of 1998.
Stakeholders, including labor unions, workforce and education associations, and local and state governments, view the WIOA reauthorization as a critical tool for modernizing the workforce system. Some factors in labor market changes include evolving employer skill needs and demographic shifts.
Stakeholders are seeking local flexibility and governance over training, partnerships, and service delivery, increased and more targeted funding, stronger alignment with employers and industry needs, equitable access for underserved populations, and strengthened education and training pathways. 
As part of the proposal, the Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act would amend WIOA to establish a new Digital Skills at Work grant program to expand digital skills training within postsecondary education, adult education and workforce development systems. 
“Virginia is a place where anyone willing to work hard should be able to land their first job, keep a job they love, or build their first company. The jobs of today require new skills that can be mastered with the right training, helping employers retain seasoned workers and attract top talent,” Vindman said in a statement. “I’m proud to introduce bipartisan, bicameral legislation that helps Virginians and people across the country build digital skills that are essential in today’s economy.” 
Targeted investments in digital skills training — such as data entry, email communication and spreadsheet processing — would help Americans seeking jobs or upskilling opportunities, as well as those with barriers to employment, learn or build digital skills.
The Act would create digital skills training programs by awarding formula funding grants to states based on a combination of factors including population, the number of working-age residents, and the number of residents with low digital literacy skills, as determined by educational attainment, earnings, and limited English proficiency.
The Act would also increase digital equity by creating competitive grants for localities and organizations, and by requiring performance accountability for states, localities and organizations that receive a grant under this bill to report their awards publicly.
“We’re not shying away from the equity issue,” Kaine said. “Increasing digital equity is one of the three purposes of this bill, and making sure that the allocation of funds looks at … individuals who traditionally have barriers to employment and historically underrepresented populations.”
Kaine said he expects the proposal to gain bipartisan support as the Senate prepares to take up reauthorizing the WIOA. He added that roughly a third of the proposal’s endorsements are from Virginia, including the Fredericksburg Chamber of Commerce, Greater Roanoke Workforce Development Board, and the Virginia Community College System.
“By including digital skills and related performance metrics as requirements for grants issued under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), this legislation would ensure that our workforce is being prepared for today’s and tomorrow’s jobs,” VCCS Chancellor David Doré said in a statement.
He added that “successful passage of this legislation will strengthen education and workforce development systems. In addition, business and industry employers will minimize turnover, and workers will be better prepared to achieve better jobs and greater economic success.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-12-03 15:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"As Mississippi’s opioid settlement council finalizes its recommendations, a member calls for committee reforms",Allen Siegler,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/03/mississippi-opioid-group-last-plan/,The council decided which applications to recommend to state lawmakers for funding during the 2026 regular legislative session.,"As the sun set over Jackson late Tuesday afternoon, the Mississippi Opioid Settlement Fund Advisory Council members wanted to end their meeting.
They had finished making the final recommendations for how the state should spend tens of million dollars paid by companies that contributed to thousands of deadly Mississippi overdoses. Moderator Caleb Pracht offered his final remarks of the nearly three hour meeting, wishing the committee safe travels home from the state capital. But one council member paused the concluding remarks to share some concerns. 
James Moore, a Hattiesburg recovery advocate and father of a son who died of an overdose, pointed out some of the ways in which the council had struggled with its role in distributing most of the hundreds of millions of lawsuit dollars the state is recouping to address the opioid epidemic.
Sitting at a desk away from most of the other members, Moore spoke about the inconsistent grading of the over 100 proposals the council received. Subcommittees, each made up of a few council members, initially reviewed and scored the applications. But the groups graded differently. The average score of the Public Health subcommittee was in the highest of five grading tiers, and the average score of applications reviewed by the Family subcommittee was in the second lowest tier.

He highlighted perceptions of conflicts of interests within the council, as many of the grants recommended for funding came from organizations with representatives on the committee.
“I don’t believe there was anything improper,” he told the other council members. “But obviously there was an appearance when we’re sitting across the table grading each others’ applications and multimillion dollar requests.” 
To address these and other issues, Moore asked the council if it would consider seeking help the next time it evaluated opioid settlement grants. Mississippi should be receiving the lawsuit money until at least 2040, and the review process is expected to happen yearly. 
He suggested to the council that outside groups, ones that have provided guidance to other states, could improve a process that many of the Mississippians who’ve been most impacted by addiction have raised concerns about since its first meeting. Moore said he had spoken to opioid settlement experts that day, and they said they would be happy to help the state. 
“It wouldn’t supplant us,” he said. “It would support us.”
For the prior two and a half hours, at what’s expected to be the council’s last meeting of the year, the members worked without that additional help. They decided which applications the committee would recommend state lawmakers fund in the 2026 regular legislative session. 
The council spent most of its time reviewing the dozens of applications the subcommittees had ranked in the highest two tiers and continued to make major adjustments to the process for distributing funds from the lawsuits. 
They significantly changed which organizations are eligible to receive opioid settlement funding. After Moore raised concerns about an applicant group that did not allow participants to use medication for opioid addiction and other psychiatric conditions, the council voted in favor of requiring that any group receiving money allows the people they serve to continue being on prescribed drugs. 
While medications like buprenorphine and methadone are considered the gold standard addiction treatments, many organizations across the country prohibit participants from using them. Wendy Bailey, the Mississippi Department of Mental Health executive director and co-vice chair of the council, said after the meeting that the council’s new rule could help change that for organizations serving Mississippians.
“We need to look to make sure there is more acceptance and understanding of it,” she said.
Andy Taggart, another council member, also successfully made a motion to remove all the applications from local first responder agencies from the list of opioid-related projects the committee will submit to the Legislature. Some of those first responder proposals did not appear to qualify as addressing addiction as defined by the lawsuit settlements.

Instead, the council chose to include them in a list of projects the Legislature could fund with opioid settlement money Attorney General and Council Chair Lynn Fitch has allowed lawmakers to use on non-addiction expenses.
A bill state lawmakers passed last spring, the one that created the council, says this portion of opioid settlement funds will be spent without any recommendations from the council. Taggart told the council members that the body should still make its suggestions.
“It strikes me that they would not be offended if we say, ‘Hey, here’s some non-abatement projects we recommended,’” he said. 
The council also tinkered with the priority and funding amounts they recommend for individual applicants. The biggest change was to adjust an application from Mississippi’s Administrative Office of Courts, a roughly $61 million request to improve the state’s drug court system — programs to divert people who use drugs away from the criminal justice system and toward treatment. 
Joseph Sclafani, a lawyer with Gov. Tate Reeves’ office, successfully proposed a motion to move the request to the highest-ranking tier and recommend that the Legislature reduce the funding to $12 million. 
The council also revived one application, a proposal from a company called Stercus Bioanalytics to create an opioid wastewater surveillance program, for recommendation. The application asked for roughly $9 million and was graded in the middle category, but the members passed Taggart’s motion to reduce the proposal to $2 million and include it in the second highest tier. 
Taggart told the council he thinks wastewater data could be an effective way for law enforcement and other state officials to figure out where there’s frequent opioid use. Recent MacArthur “Genius” grant recipient Nabarun Dasgupta, a senior scientist at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill who researches street drug supply, told Mississippi Today in November that while opioid wastewater surveillance can provide some surface-level information, it doesn’t do much to protect those most at risk of overdosing. 
“It’s big money for a small idea,” he said of Stercus’ unadjusted application.

After the meeting ended, Michelle Williams, chief of staff for Fitch, said the Attorney General’s office would look into Moore’s idea of incorporating outside help next year, in addition to other process changes. 
Just before Pracht dismissed the council members, Williams told them she thought they did a great job of making recommendations for the money on a tight timeline.

In 2025, the state had 1.3 million more lower-income renter households than available affordable units. Between 2015 and 2023, California exceeded its production goals for higher-priced housing but fell dramatically short for affordable units— missing targets by over 270,000 units for very low-income housing. During this same period, median rent increased by 37% while renter incomes rose only 7%. 
Since 1969, California has required that all local governments plan to meet the housing needs of everyone in their communities. This is called the Regional Housing Needs Assessment, and it determines how much housing is needed at each level of affordability in a certain area. Local governments must then develop a local Housing Element – which is a plan that details how they will meet these various housing needs. The cycle repeats every eight years to gauge progress towards meeting existing goals and then reevaluating to assess new needs. The state ran its fifth cycle of planning to meet housing needs between 2013 and 2020. California is currently in its sixth cycle of planning, which sets a goal of building 2.5 million new homes by 2032.

The State Weighs In
To address the current housing crisis, California is seeking to fundamentally restructure how and where housing gets built. While land use decisions have historically been made at the local level, the state has recently taken on an assertive new role. Through the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) process, all California jurisdictions are now required to plan for a certain number of new housing units, determined by state government. 
This isn’t merely advisory guidance from the state; there are real consequences for failure. Laws like SB 35 (2017) and SB 423 (2023) give the California Department of Housing and Community Development authority to penalize jurisdictions that fail to build their RHNA-determined supply. For cities and counties that do not meet their housing unit targets, the state can preempt local zoning ordinances and make certain multifamily housing eligible for automatic “by-right” approval. This means localities that don’t meet their housing goals risk losing control over what gets built in their communities.
Community Engagement: Where will housing be built?
Critics of community engagement processes who support new housing construction have legitimate reasons for concern: Participants at traditional public hearings often aren’t representative of the larger community. Instead, people who participate in local debates about housing tend to be disproportionately white, wealthier, older, and homeowners rather than renters. And given that people who oppose a proposed development are four times more likely to show up at a public meeting than people who support it, it’s no surprise that some pro-housing advocates and elected officials view community engagement as an obstacle to getting things done.
The current moment calls for new ways to bring diverse community perspectives into the housing process and foster effective dialogue between communities, developers, and government. Rather than sidelining community input in the name of progress, California can take advantage of this moment to experiment with new models for engagement that enable broad public input and ensure that the benefits of new construction are widely shared.
Read the Report: Approaches to Balancing Meaningful Community-Engagement with Increased Housing Production in California
Workforce Capacity: Who will build new homes?
In addition to navigating local political dynamics, progress towards solving California’s housing crisis faces a practical problem. California’s Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) estimates a need for 2.5 million new units over the next eight years. However, the industry struggles with labor shortages: 62% of California construction firms report difficulty filling positions.
Some argue that labor standards like prevailing wage laws (PWLs), which require workers on public projects to receive comparable compensation to private sector rates, can increase housing costs. While research does show some cost impacts, there are also documented benefits for PWLs, including increased apprenticeship enrollment, improved safety, and higher worker retention. Additionally, when workers are provided portable insurance, the increase in retention actually rises further.
Labor shortages and poor labor conditions can reinforce each other: worker retention rates are harmed by poor labor conditions, while contractors have less incentive to provide additional training when retention rates are low. There may also be ways to offset increased wage costs associated with PWLs. For example, higher labor standards can attract more skilled and productive workers.Read the Report: Building the Residential Construction Workforce in California: An Introduction to Labor and Housing Costs
The “Both/And” Path Forward
In a recent Possibility Lab survey, 71% of California voters reported difficulty accessing suitable housing at a price they can afford. Solving California’s affordable housing shortage requires holistic thinking that doesn’t pit housing production against workers or communities. Strategic investments in workforce development can simultaneously increase productivity, reduce delays from labor shortages, and improve workers’ quality of life—ultimately benefiting both subsidized and market-rate housing. Likewise, finding ways to engage communities in decision-making that allow for meaningful dialogue and reward solution sourcing, instead of enabling obstruction, can benefit neighbors and neighborhoods – as well as Californians as a whole.
By addressing both where housing gets built through effective community planning and who builds it through workforce investment, policymakers can pursue solutions that build housing capacity and workforce capacity, together.

(Photo from Indiana House Republicans)A Republican state legislator says he supports the proposed Indiana congressional redistricting even though it would place his home outside the district where he’s planning to run.
Rep. Craig Haggard said he intends to continue his campaign against U.S. Rep. Jim Baird for the 4th District nomination in 2026.
That’s despite the Republican-proposed congressional districting plan shifting Morgan County — where Haggard lives near Mooresville — from the 4th District into the 9th District now held by Republican U.S. Rep. Erin Houchin.
Haggard joked that the proposed map is “not ideal” for him but that he would keep up the campaign he announced in August against Baird, who is seeking his fifth term in 2026.
“I’ve been working with those counties,” Haggard told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. “The reason I have the endorsements I have and the support I have is, I believe, the majority of the 4th Congressional District feels like it’s not currently being served by their current congressman.”
Baird and Indiana’s six other Republican U.S. House members in August all endorsed the redistricting push initiated by President Donald Trump.
Baird responded to Haggard’s campaign plans in an email to the Capital Chronicle saying “Hoosiers expect their representative to come from the community they want to serve. I’ve always believed public service is about showing up for your neighbors, not shopping for a district that fits your political ambitions.”
U.S. House members are required to live in the state they represent but do not have to live in the district.
Haggard and other congressional candidates around the state have had their campaign plans scrambled by the redistricting possibility. The proposed new maps might not even be adopted as it is uncertain whether the state Senate will endorse the redraw.
All of Morgan County has been in the 4th District since the current congressional maps were enacted in 2021. 
Haggard said he would vote in support of the new map, even though he said it was “a little suspect” that his home county was shifted. He said he believed he could overcome any complaints where he lives.
“I was in the 4th when I started this process two years ago,” Haggard said. “I’m still right next to the 4th. I’m not some carpetbagger from another state or area that moved into this. No, I don’t think it’s an issue.”",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/54352686495_83bb39a8b5_c.jpg,,,2025-12-03 11:01:13.127380

The minimum hourly wage for workers will increase in dozens of cities, counties and states in January. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The minimum wage for workers will increase in 19 states and 49 cities and counties next month, with the wage floor reaching $15 per hour in dozens of localities, a new report found.
Though the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour has not increased since 2009, many state and local governments continue to increase minimums through legislation or scheduled increases tied to inflation. 
An annual report from the National Employment Law Project, a nonprofit advocating for workers’ rights, found that 88 jurisdictions will raise their minimum wages by the end of 2026.
In January, Nebraska’s minimum wage will increase from $13.50 to $15 per hour, while Rhode Island will see an increase from $15 to $16 per hour.
Minimum wage set to increase in 15 cities, states despite lawmaker pushback

All workers in Denver will see the minimum wage increase from $18.81 to $19.29 in January and the minimum in Flagstaff, Arizona, will increase from $17.85 to $18.35 per hour. 
The increases come as rising costs of housing, food and utilities are pinching more workers across the country, said Yannet Lathrop, senior researcher and policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project who authored the report. Those costs are particularly challenging for lower-income workers, who are most likely to be affected by minimum wage changes.
“They are really struggling right now,” she said. “These wages basically mitigate the effects of inflation, the effects of the rising cost of living, and the difficulties so many people are having paying for basics, for food, for housing, for medicine — just the basics of life.”
Lathrop said research increasingly finds that higher wages improve educational outcomes, mental and physical health.
“Things that are going to benefit not just the workers, but also the communities and society as a whole,” she said. “I think that’s an important thing to keep in mind.”
Inflation has significantly eroded the buying power of the federal minimum wage since 2009. 
Advocates say raising the wage floor helps low-wage workers cover the rising cost of essentials and boosts the economy by putting more money into the pockets of people who are likely to spend it. But many employers, especially small businesses, argue that raising the minimum wage forces them to cut workers or raise prices.
In Rhode Island, lawmakers this year proposed legislation that would raise the minimum wage $1 per year, culminating with a $20 per hour minimum in 2030. But backlash from business groups and economic uncertainty led the Democratic sponsor to successfully push for a “more measured approach” that includes hikes for the next two years rather than five, reaching a $17 hourly minimum by 2027.
That compromise didn’t persuade Republican opponents, who said even the more modest minimum wage change will force layoffs and consumer price hikes. 
Cities could dramatically cut childhood poverty with new tax credits, research finds

“The real minimum wage is $0,” said state House Minority Whip David Place, according to the Rhode Island Current. “That’s what they make when they get fired because business can’t afford to keep them.”
The minimum wage remains stagnant at $7.25 in 20 states, according to the National Employment Law Project. Those are primarily conservative-led states including Alabama, Iowa, Texas and Wyoming. 
Last year, Missouri voters approved a ballot measure ensuring paid sick leave and boosting the minimum wage to $15 per hour, with future increases tied to inflation. 
But Republican lawmakers took aim at the changes in Jefferson City this year.  
In a move Democrats called “absolute disdain” for workers, GOP lawmakers passed a bill repealing the paid sick leave provision and nixing the annual minimum wage increases tied to inflation. Missouri’s current $13.75 minimum wage will still rise to $15 next month but is no longer subject to future increases.
“Today, we are protecting the people who make Missouri work—families, job creators, and small business owners—by cutting taxes, rolling back overreach, and eliminating costly mandates,” Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe said in a July statement when he signed the bill into law.

(Photo by Jonathan Shorman/Stateline)The U.S. Department of Justice on Tuesday expanded its legal campaign to force states to turn over voter lists containing sensitive personal information, suing six more states that have refused to provide the data.
The Justice Department has now sued officials in a dozen states for the voter lists, following a first round of lawsuits filed in September. The lawsuits are aimed at mostly Democratic states that won’t turn over unredacted copies of the lists, which include driver’s license and partial Social Security numbers.
For months, the Trump administration has demanded that states provide copies of their voter lists, calling the information necessary for election integrity efforts. While some states have turned over lists that withhold sensitive personal data, most have declined to offer all the information on their lists.
DOJ files suit against six states that refused to share voter data

Democratic election officials have raised privacy concerns over how the Trump administration plans to use the data. They are especially concerned that the Justice Department will share the data with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which is building a powerful citizenship verification tool. The Trump administration previously confirmed to Stateline it plans to share the data.
The new wave of lawsuits target Delaware, Maryland, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, the Justice Department announced in a news release. The department has already sued California, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania.
“Accurate voter rolls are the cornerstone of fair and free elections, and too many states have fallen into a pattern of noncompliance with basic voter roll maintenance,” U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a news release on Tuesday. “The Department of Justice will continue filing proactive election integrity litigation until states comply with basic election safeguards.”
Rhode Island Secretary of State Gregg Amore in September offered the Justice Department a free copy of his state’s publicly available voter list. The information is typically provided upon request with a $25 fee, but he refused to provide confidential personal information absent legal action.
“This lawsuit, like those filed in other states, is a continuation of the current presidential administration’s unconstitutional attempts to interfere with elections processes across the country,” Amore said in a statement on Tuesday. “One of my most important responsibilities as the chief state election official is safeguarding the data privacy of Rhode Islanders, who entrust us with their personal information when they register to vote. I will continue to fight to protect it.”

(Photo by Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Two years ago, Kansas ranked dead last in a national assessment of mental illness and access to behavioral health care.
In 2025, that ranking rose to 18th in the nation, and state officials say the shift is a direct outcome of investment in quality care.
A $72.5 million grant recently awarded to Kansas and two other states is expected to push the state’s progress further by bolstering access to quality behavioral health care.
“This initiative represents a pivotal opportunity for Kansas to lead in behavioral health innovation,” said Laura Howard, secretary of the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services, in a Nov. 18 news release.
Kansas, Illinois and Michigan will share the $72 million over the next three years. The Washington, D.C.-based National Council for Mental Wellbeing will administer the funds, which come from the Ballmer Group, a philanthropic organization founded by former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and his wife, Connie.
The national council will use the grant to help states establish or expand Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics, which offer 24/7 crisis care, counseling, case management, outpatient services, psychiatric rehabilitation, treatment planning and mental health care for veterans.
The grant will focus on building a range of services, including crisis care, outpatient mental health and substance use services, primary care screening and monitoring, community-based mental health care for veterans, and partnerships with community organizations such as law enforcement, schools and homeless shelters.
Connie Ballmer said in a national council news release that community behavioral health clinics have been successful in addressing community behavioral health needs, especially those of kids and families.
“Access to comprehensive, high-quality care provides people with the opportunity to achieve stability,” Ballmer said.
A 2024 study of Kansas clinics found that establishing community behavioral health clinics, which expanded upon existing services, increased annual visits from about 24,000 to about 42,000. The state’s annual costs also increased, rising from $52 million to $74 million, according to data from the state aging and disabilities department. However, the study hypothesized clinics may result in $5 million in costs avoided from would-be emergency room visits and $42 million in costs avoided from inpatient stays.
Kansas has 26 clinics. The state Legislature passed a bill in 2021 to certify and fund those clinics, a move regarded as one of the most significant changes to mental health care in Kansas in decades. 
Community behavioral health clinics first opened in 2017 when a federal project established 66 clinics in eight states. More than 500 clinics now exist in 46 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. They are largely funded by Medicaid.
Cara Sloan-Ramos, a spokesperson for the Kansas department, said it’s unclear how recent federal Medicaid changes could impact the state’s community behavioral health clinics.
“The state knows that federal policy changes are coming,” Sloan-Ramos said, “but the precise financial and operational impact on Kansas CCBHCs remains undetermined.”
The 2023 assessment that ranked Kansas last among all 50 states and Washington, D.C., cited youths with substance use disorders, adults with any mental illness and adults with serious thoughts of suicide as major factors for the state’s low ranking.
The state’s future efforts will focus on behavioral health workforce shortages, rural access to care, financial longevity, quality services and expanded partnerships to better coordinate wraparound care.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/SEKMHC-2025-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-03 09:57:19.841600

After leaving a position in Gov. Andy Beshear’s administration in September, Booker announced Wednesday morning that he would run for Kentucky’s open U.S. Senate seat. In a campaign video, Booker emphasized that his platform includes supporting initiatives for Medicare, affordable housing, better wages, lowering utility bills and universal childcare. 
“What story would we write if we let ourselves dream again?” Booker says in the video. “The story I’d write is one where everyone in the commonwealth can prosper, one where government shows up for us instead of stomping on us.” 
Booker has run for the chance to represent Kentucky in the U.S. Senate twice before. In 2020, Booker lost the Democratic nomination to former Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath, who later failed to unseat longtime Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell. Booker then ran against Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul in 2022 and lost. 
McConnell announced earlier this year that he would not seek reelection to the U.S. Senate seat he’s held since 1984, paving the way for politicians on both sides of the aisle to jockey for the open seat. 
McGrath launched her 2026 campaign for the seat in October. Other Democrats in the race include racehorse trainer Dale Romans, former Secret Service agent Logan Forsythe, former CIA officer Joel Willett and Kentucky House Democratic Floor Leader Pamela Stevenson.
Republicans are also facing a crowded primary. GOP candidates in the race U.S. Rep. Andy Barr, former state Attorney General Daniel Cameron and businessman Nate Morris have campaigned for months, often facing each other at Republican and campaign events.

From CalMatters homelessness reporter Marisa Kendall:
There are still people living on streets and sidewalks throughout the state, but Californians are starting to care a little less about the issue of homelessness, according to a recent survey. 
Only 37% of Californians asked in October said they were “very concerned” about homelessness — down from 58% in 2019. Another 41% of Californians surveyed this year said they were “somewhat concerned.” That’s according to a survey of 1,707 people by the Public Policy Institute of California.
And while 20% of Californians said homelessness was the state’s top issue in 2020, just 6% said so this year. The drop was most notable in the Bay Area, where 28% of residents said they were very concerned about homelessness, compared to 63% in 2019.
Even so, most Californians still regularly see evidence of the homelessness crisis in their communities. More than half said they cross paths with an unhoused individual every day, and two in 10 said they do so every few days. 
This change in attitude comes amid several shifts in the state’s homeless policy landscape. A U.S. Supreme Court decision last year gave cities more freedom to penalize unhoused people for sleeping outside, followed by an increase in homelessness-related arrests and citations in cities across California. 
There were more than 187,000 Californians sleeping in shelters, on the street and in other places not meant for habitation, as of the last official estimate in January 2024. This year, several California counties reported a decrease in their homeless populations, suggesting the state may finally be making progress. But experts worry upcoming funding cuts for permanent housing and other services at both the state and federal level will undermine those wins.

SF sues Big Junk Food

In a first-of-its kind lawsuit, San Francisco plans to take on some of the biggest names in the food industry over the health harms linked to eating chips, cereal, packaged meals and other ultra-processed foods.
On Tuesday the city’s top attorney, David Chiu, said San Francisco is suing 10 food companies that manufacture ultra-processed foods, including Kraft Heinz Company, The Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo, General Mills, Nestle USA and Kellogg. 
Filed on behalf of the state of California in San Francisco Superior Court, the lawsuit seeks damages for the health costs local governments pay to treat residents suffering from illnesses related to eating ultra-processed foods. These foods make up about 70% of the country’s food supply, and have been linked to obesity, diabetes, cancer and other serious diseases.

Chiu, at a press conference: “Like the tobacco industry, they knew their products make people very sick but hid the truth from the public, profited from untold billions and left Americans to deal with the consequences.”

The lawsuit follows California passing a law in October phasing out ultra-processed foods from school meals. It also comes at a time when President Donald Trump’s administration — led by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and his “Make America Healthy Again” campaign — is seeking to curb Americans’ consumption of ultra-processed foods. 



Competing insurance ballot measures: Never mind

From CalMatters economy reporter Levi Sumagaysay:
Proponents of two competing ballot initiatives on insurance regulations have withdrawn their proposals from the 2026 ballot. Proposition 103, the law that governs property insurance in California, remains intact. 
In August, an independent insurance agent filed a measure to weaken Prop. 103, and in a subsequent filing added a provision that would have thrown out California’s ability to approve insurers’ rate increases. Consumer advocacy group Consumer Watchdog, whose founder wrote Prop. 103, in September filed a counter-measure that included calling for a policyholder bill of rights. 
Both parties agreed to withdraw their petitions on Tuesday, Consumer Watchdog President Jamie Court told CalMatters. But his group said “there is still a huge need for many of the other protections in the ballot measure,” and that it may try again for the 2028 ballot. 
The insurance agent, Elizabeth Hammack, confirmed to CalMatters that she withdrew her proposal, but said she did not care to explain why at this time.

This story by Cassandra Hemenway was first published in The Bridge on Dec. 1, 2025.
With the Monday announcement that Montpelier’s Acting City Manager Kelly Murphy is leaving her role by the end of the year, the urgency has picked up for the City Council to fill the vacancy left by long-time City Manager Bill Fraser, who’s 30-year tenure ended in June.
The council has plans to announce finalists for the position this week, and that list will not contain Murphy, the former city finance director and assistant city manager who stepped into the role of acting city manager this summer. Murphy has accepted a job as the education finance director with the Vermont Agency of Education, according to a Dec. 1 press release from the city.
Murphy will prepare and submit the City Manager’s Fiscal Year 2027 budget to the city council before her departure “to ensure continuity in municipal financial planning,” the release stated.
City Councilor Pelin Kohn told The Bridge that 30 people applied for the city manager role. The council chose eight of those applicants for the first round of interviews, then honed the list down to four for the second round of interviews, which, she said, was being completed on Monday.
“Any one we choose of those three finalists will be a good fit,” Kohn said, saying she felt confident about the candidates because of the in-depth process of vetting, interviewing, and discussing candidates undertaken by the full council.
The finalists will be invited to come to Montpelier to meet with the city staff, department heads, and business leaders and will be available in a public forum where residents are invited to ask their own questions, Kohn said. And, according to the release, the council will discuss the next steps for interim leadership at its Dec. 17 meeting. 
Mayor Jack McCullough said in the release that “Kelly has provided steady, thoughtful leadership during an extraordinarily challenging time for our community. We are grateful for her service and wish her the very best in this next step.”

Emily Talkington
Dr. Emily Talkington is a wildlife veterinarian specializing in primates


I’m a wildlife veterinarian specializing in monkeys, so I know there are ways to prevent the recent incident in Mississippi where eight monkeys escaped during transport from a research lab in New Orleans. 
Five of the monkeys were killed by authorities, two others were shot dead by members of the public and only one was recovered alive.  
This was not an isolated incident. Over the past two decades, there have been at least 15 publicly reported monkey escapes in transit and directly from labs. 
Earlier this year, the California National Primate Research Center at the University of California – Davis was cited by the USDA after a monkey was severely injured from a malfunctioning cage closure. 
These incidents demonstrate a pattern of incompetence that harms monkeys and illustrates the risks of infectious disease and injury for those who handle or are exposed to monkeys. They are just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the harm caused by animal experimentation. 
I’ve experienced firsthand the dangers of infectious disease transmission while working with wild, captive and rescued macaques in Southeast Asia. After I was bitten by a wild macaque in Malaysia, I was immediately administered post-exposure rabies prophylaxis. 
For those of us who capture or transport wild macaques, there is a risk of contracting infectious diseases they are known to harbor, such as herpes B virus, tuberculosis, yersinia pestis (plague), rotavirus, and leptospirosis, a blood infection.
Infectious disease research is the most common use for monkeys in taxpayer-funded U.S. labs. The research often requires forcefully infecting monkeys with dangerous pathogens and subjecting them to miserable and fatal outcomes. 
Tulane University’s National Biomedical Research Center — the New Orleans primate research facility funded by the National Institutes of Health — reports that the escaped monkeys harbored no known pathogens. But veterinary medical records and necropsy reports have not been released, which illustrates an ongoing lack of transparency in what occurs behind locked laboratory doors. 
For decades, medical research and product safety testing have subjected monkeys to life in the lab. While the animals have some superficial similarities to humans, this research is largely futile and ignores biological differences that lead to difficult and rare translation to human biology and clinical benefit.  
Some of the most common monkey species used in research include rhesus and long-tailed macaques. They live in social groups in the wild. For monkeys in labs, the isolation, transport  and restraint often lead to a reduction of their immune system’s ability to fight infections and diseases and to harmful self-directed behavior, such as self-mutilation, hair plucking, and biting the cage bars, which can impact the reliability of experiments.

In place of monkeys, there are a variety of more effective methods available to researchers. Some federally-funded monkey studies investigate human nutrition or marijuana use, research that can be and has been conducted with human volunteers. 
Researchers also are increasingly turning to human-based methods called “new approach methodologies,” which use human cells, tissues, and data to model human biology and disease more accurately than animals. Such methods as tissue chips, organoids (lab-grown cells that model organs) and artificial intelligence are advancing rapidly and can overcome species-specific barriers. 
Governments are starting to take steps to overhaul research infrastructures that favor animal use. The Netherlands recently passed a budget that includes a five-year phase-out of public funding for the largest monkey laboratory in Europe, while reallocating funds to animal-free research.
Here in the United States, both the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration have committed to moving away from animal experimentation.  
These changes signify an important shift, but if we continue to fund unnecessary and dangerous research using monkeys, the development of new treatments will slow, and the public will be at risk of deadly zoonotic diseases. 
Halting this research and refocusing funding on human-based methods will ensure that human health research actually benefits humans, and that it doesn’t come with detrimental risks to humans or animals.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/102925-Research-Monkey-Mississippi-AP-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-03 08:56:36.442191

Gavin Newsom, Santa Clara County and San Francisco are suing the Trump administration over a huge shift in homelessness policy.","In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom, Santa Clara County and San Francisco are suing the Trump administration over a huge shift in homelessness policy.  


California is fighting back after President Donald Trump’s administration instigated homeless housing cuts that local service providers said would be “devastating.”
Two recently filed lawsuits accuse the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development of illegally going over Congress’ head to make massive changes to the way federal homelessness funds are distributed. 
“HUD’s new grant rules would effectively defund permanent supportive housing and rapid rehousing programs across the nation, eliminating proven tools that help residents exit homelessness sustainably,” Santa Clara County Counsel Tony LoPresti said in a statement. “This is another instance of the Trump administration prioritizing its political agenda above the needs of our most vulnerable community members.”
Santa Clara County and San Francisco sued the Trump administration this week, in conjunction with the National Alliance to End Homelessness and the National Low Income Housing Coalition. A separate lawsuit was filed last week by Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration and a handful of other states. It marked the 47th time California sued the Trump administration in 44 weeks.
Now, homeless service providers are waiting anxiously to see how the litigation plays out and wondering if the impending legal battle will further delay the money they desperately need.
“It’s just the matter of how long it’s going to take that concerns me,” said Robert Ratner, director of Santa Cruz County’s Housing for Health, which coordinates the county’s homelessness response. “Because while we’re waiting for these issues to get resolved, we have programs that are going to run out of money to support people.”
The Department of Housing and Urban Development did not respond to a request for comment. 
In a statement last month, HUD Secretary Scott Turner said the changes are aimed at “stopping the Biden-era slush fund that fueled the homelessness crisis, shut out faith-based providers simply because of their values, and incentivized never-ending government dependency.”
At issue are changes the Trump administration made to its funding policy last month. Jurisdictions applying for a piece of about $4 billion in federal homelessness funds now can’t spend more than 30% of that money on permanent housing — a significant decrease. Los Angeles County, for example, currently spends more than 80% on permanent housing. Instead, the federal government wants localities to prioritize emergency shelter and temporary housing programs that require participants to be sober or participate in treatment. 
While shelters offer a temporary respite from the streets, permanent housing can end someone’s homelessness. For years, the federal government has prioritized funding permanent housing using the “housing first” method — a strategy that moves people into housing as quickly as possible, without requiring them to first get sober or agree to addiction treatment. Veering away from both of those principles marks a major policy shift.
Last year, California communities won more than $683 million in federal homelessness funds through what is called the Continuum of Care program. About 90% of that went to permanent housing projects, which currently house tens of thousands of Californians, according to Newsom. The new rule threatens to put those people back out onto the street, he said in a news release. 
“While we’re waiting for these issues to get resolved, we have programs that are going to run out of money to support people.”Robert Ratner, director, Housing for Health
The new policy also prohibits the use of federal funds for diversity and inclusion efforts, support of transgender clients, and use of “harm reduction” strategies that seek to reduce overdose deaths by helping people in active addiction use drugs more safely. And it gives preference for projects in cities, counties and states that ban homeless encampments. 
Both lawsuits allege that the Trump administration’s funding changes violate the Administrative Procedure Act and the Constitution by defying the rules Congress set out for distributing the funds. Congress authorized a two-year grant cycle in 2024, meaning local jurisdictions wouldn’t have to reapply for funds in 2025. The Trump administration flouted that decision when it suddenly forced jurisdictions to reapply, the lawsuits allege. 
The lawsuits also claim the administration didn’t go through proper protocol before enacting the changes to its funding strategy, which would have included giving cities and counties more time to comply with the new rules, and allowing stakeholders to comment on the changes.
In Santa Cruz County, Ratner is of two minds about the lawsuits. On one hand, he believes the abrupt way the Trump administration rolled out the funding changes was “very inappropriate.” But he worries a lengthy court battle could tie up funds his county needs to pay people’s rents. 
The National Alliance to End Homelessness sued the Trump administration over similar allegations tied to a smaller, $75 million pot of homelessness funding in September. A judge sided with the Alliance, and temporarily barred the federal government from distributing those funds. But now that money is frozen, unable to help unhoused residents as the case moves forward.
Ratner worries that could happen again in this case. Santa Cruz County is set to start hitting serious financial problems as soon as February, Ratner said. That’s when a $1.2 million supportive housing grant, which currently houses about 50 people in different apartments around the county, is set to expire. 
The Trump administration doesn’t expect to start awarding Continuum of Care money until May. It’s unclear how the lawsuits will affect that timeline. 
In the meantime, Ratner and other homeless service providers are trying to remain optimistic.
“At this point, we don’t know how long the litigation process will take, but we’re hopeful it leads to a more workable path forward,” Sacramento Steps Forward CEO Lisa Bates said in a statement. “Of course, any delay in federal funding would have real impacts on communities across the country, including ours, to operate shelters, rapid rehousing, permanent supportive housing, and essential system coordination.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/080924_SF-Sweep_MO_CM_15.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-03 08:56:36.442191

The plaintiffs say Zillow violated their rights by tricking buyers into using a Zillow homebuyer agent and pushing them to use Zillow Home Loans to finance their purchases.
The lawsuit claims when prospective buyers select the “contact agent” link on Zillow thinking they are contacting the listing agent, instead they are routed to a Zillow-affiliated buyer’s agent.
Some of the contracted Zillow agents urge buyers to pay more for homes so they can get a bigger commission, as the agent is required to give up to 40% of their cut to the company, according to the lawsuit.
The Norwalk resident purchased a home in Norwalk and did not feel she had any other options after requesting a house tour and being connected with a Zillow-contracted buyer’s agent, according to the lawsuit.
The law firm of Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro is representing the 10 leading plaintiffs.
“From the CT plaintiff’s perspective, specifically, the lawsuit alleges that she was deceived by Zillow’s website in multiple manners,” Ash Klann, with the firm, said. “The lawsuit alleges that Zillow’s website violates consumers rights by shoehorning Zillow agents into the process, to receive fees, without the consumer’s knowledge or consent.”
After the initial complaint was filed in September, a dozen former Zillow employees corroborated the lawsuit’s claims, according to the firm representing the plaintiffs.
“Twelve current and former agents and loan officers have bravely stepped forward to help our clients build a comprehensive case against Zillow, and with their added information, we believe this lawsuit has the potential to bring major changes to Zillow’s policies and practices,” Steve Berman, managing partner and co-founder of Hagens Berman, said.
The lawsuit claims Zillow’s goal is to “monetize every step of the home buying process—even if illegally—and to encourage, incentivize, and ultimately coerce agents into violating their fiduciary duties by disregarding their clients’ interests.”
Plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages for the company’s deceptive practices, according to the lawsuit. Zillow did not respond to Connecticut Public’s request for comment.
If a homebuyer purchased a house using a Zillow agent, beginning in 2019, or financed a home using Zillow Home Loans, they may qualify to join the class action lawsuit.

(Photo by Bonnie Cash / Getty Images)The United States Department of Justice announced on Tuesday it had filed lawsuits against New Mexico and five other states for failing to produce statewide voter registration lists.
The agency began asking state election officials for their voter rolls last July. As Source reported at the time, New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver’s office also received requests at that time, and told Source NM her office was “reviewing whether or not we are legally able to prevent sending the private data, which would be Social Security, all dates of birth and driver’s license numbers.”
Rocking the Vote

Last month, Toulouse Oliver signed a letter to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem expressing concern about the federal government’s request for states’ voter rolls.
The Nov. 18 letter, as Colorado Newsline originally reported, was signed by 10 Democratic secretaries of state, and raised concerns about inconsistent information from the federal agencies about how they are using and sharing voter data requested from states in recent months.
Toulouse Oliver told Source NM last month she had two main concerns about the federal government’s request for voter data rolls. First: “What is the data being used for outside of verifying citizenship? That’s a big concern, because we’re not in the business of creating citizenship lists or providing information to [Immigration Customs Enforcement] that would potentially harm people who are legally here in the United States. We’ve seen from many, many news reports, there are a number of people that ICE have detained that are either US citizens or have legal status, so to me, that’s deeply concerning.”
She also said the state had provided the federal government with “the publicly available file that anyone has access to,” which does not include Social Security Numbers and only years of birth.
Secretary of State Director of Communications Alex Curtas confirmed that information to Source NM on Wednesday morning.
In a news release Tuesday, US Attorney General Pamela Bondi called “accurate voter rolls” a “cornerstone of fair and free elections,” and said “too many states have fallen into a pattern of noncompliance with basic voter roll maintenance. The Department of Justice will continue filing proactive election integrity litigation until states comply with basic election safeguards.”
In a statement, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division said that “states that continue to defy federal voting laws interfere with our mission of ensuring that Americans have accurate voter lists as they go to the polls, that every vote counts equally, and that all voters have confidence in election results. At this Department of Justice, we will not stand for this open defiance of federal civil rights laws.”
Curtas, in a statement provided to Source, said the office had only “just received the DOJ’s complaint letter,” and could not speak to the “content of the lawsuit until we have reviewed it further. However, New Mexico’s election administration is the most secure, accurate, and voter-focused in the entire nation. Any suggestion otherwise is baseless. Our office has already provided the DOJ with publicly available voter data, but we are legally prevented from providing them with personal private voter information. New Mexico state law requires the protection of personal private voter data and Secretary Toulouse Oliver has been consistently clear on that point. Secretary Toulouse Oliver will not compromise the safety of New Mexico’s voter data. Our office will always vigorously defend New Mexico’s voters and the integrity of our election system.”

The Alabama Public Service Commission Tuesday approved a request from Alabama Power to freeze some electricity rates for two years. (Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Public Service Commission Tuesday approved a rate moratorium requested by Alabama Power.
The consent order imposes a two-year halt on increases to the fuel cost to generate electricity; the cost for operating Alabama Power’s  power-generating plants; the cost of purchasing power from other companies, the cost of complying with government regulations and rate that guarantees a specific rate of return for the company, known as Rate Stabilization Equalization (RSE).
“We know budgets are tight, and power bills are a real concern for many families and businesses,” said Moses Feagin, Alabama Power’s executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer. “This commitment gives customers more certainty and predictability around electric rates at a time when many other household and business costs are rising.”

The move came amid growing concerns over affordability around the country, particularly as electricity rates continue to rise. In Georgia, where Alabama Power’s sister company Georgia Power operates, concerns over electricity rates led voters to elect two Democrats to that state’s Public Service Commission, the first time Democrats won a statewide constitutional office in Georgia since 2006.
Alabama historically has some of the highest residential power rates in the South.
Renewable energy advocates, while pleased with the rate freeze, do not believe they go far enough to provide relief for residents who pay for electricity.
“The rate is still generally high, especially for a southeastern state,” said John Dodd, policy manager for Energy Alabama, a nonprofit that advocates for more renewable energy use in Alabama, in an interview after the meeting. “We have one of the highest power rates in the southeast right now. Rate payers are not going to get any relief. They are not going to get any rebates either.”
The process to freeze electricity rates began when Alabama Power filed a request with the Public Service Commission at the end of November to fix several of the rates that it charges customers for its operations.
“Working with Commission staff, Alabama Power has considered its forecasted and estimated cost of service across cost years 2026 and 2027, respectively, and believes it can offer other commitments to provide customers with additional rate certainty in both 2026 and 2027,” Feagin said in the filing.
In exchange, the company asked the commission to allow it to apply the money that it would have used to refund customers from the Rate RSE to the Natural Disaster Reserve fund — dedicated to restoring utility services after a natural disaster — to “forestall an increase associated with Rate NDR” because of a current negative balance in the account.
“This would wipe out that negative balance, and as we have said, take that off the table and better position the company to deal with inevitable storm damages that got us to where we are that transpired last spring over the course of the last couple of springs,” said John Garner, executive director of the Alabama Public Service Commission.
The company also requested permission to use nuclear production tax credits to help offset the cost of the rate freezes.
Without the moratorium,  electricity costs for residents would have increased at least in part to fund the purchase  of the Lindsay Hill natural gas power generating station in Billingsley. Alabama Power said the plant was needed to address a forecasted surge in electricity demand from data centers in the state over the next few years.
Alabama Power requested the PSC to allow it to increase the monthly electricity rates on customers by $3.32 starting in the middle of 2027.
The Southern Environmental Law Center, a nonprofit that advocates on behalf of the environment, represented Energy Alabama and the Greater-Birmingham Alliance to Stop Pollution at the PSC to prevent Alabama Power purchasing the plant. SELC said that the company did not consider all the available alternatives before it chose to purchase the power plant in Billingsley and that it overestimated the electricity demand of data centers.
Groups such as Energy Alabama remain critical of the process that eventually led to the rate freeze that began when Alabama Power made the request in its filing.
“What I would have wanted to see is a comprehensive plan where the power company, rate payers, and the commission come together with a public rate case hearing and talk about what is really at the center of why rates are so high,” Dodd said. “What can we do to bring down this record-breaking profit that Alabama Power rakes in every year and lower the return of equity while simultaneously protecting the Natural Disaster Reserve Fund that they were talking about in the meeting.”
Prior to the start of Tuesday’s meeting, Energy Alabama submitted a petition signed by almost 700 people requesting that the PSC reject the proposal from Alabama Power to fix some of the utility rates.
“Cost recovery is simply pushed into future years, which could increase the total amount customers pay, particularly if deferred balances accrue interest,” said Energy Alabama Executive Director Daniel Tait said in an email along with the petition.
PSC President Cynthia Almond said in an interview after the vote that the PSC followed the process it had in place now.
“This is what we have to work with,” she said. “Who is to say what the future may hold, but right now, that is where we are, and that is the process that we go through. This is the law that we have to work within.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250805_100011-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-03 08:56:36.442191

The group of 60 spoke Monday about the future of the parks with Karen Budd-Falen, the associate deputy interior secretary. They discussed how the state will help in any future government shutdowns, the timed entry reservation program at Arches National Park and the rollout of a new plan to charge higher fees from international visitors, among other issues, two state officials said.

They described the all-day session as a brainstorm, with no commitments made. Regardless of any immediate results, the discussion provided local and state leaders a direct line of communication to top brass in the Trump administration overseeing much of the nation’s public lands. More than two-thirds of Utah is federally managed. 
“Ultimately, it truly was a workshop just to get all of the partners in the room and talking about, ‘How do we improve our parks and how do we support them?’ Because they’re the lifeblood to our state,” said Natalie Randall, managing director of the Utah Office of Tourism. 
The meeting follows a June Interior Department order recognizing gateway communities near national parks as “key stakeholders” in management and planning. 
It also comes as one such community, Grand County, is pitching a plan to add more parking and other changes to accommodate more visitors at Arches National Park – changes that critics say go against the National Park Service mission of preservation. 
Those not invited to the meeting, including a Utah News Dispatch journalist, were not permitted to enter. The closed doors raised suspicion for conservation groups opposing the state’s efforts to wrest control of public lands and pushing back against arguments the parks should work to allow more visitors inside at a single time.
“It was pretty secretive as to what the purpose was going into it,” said Neal Clark with the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance. “The way that that meeting came together looks to be the state really trying to push its way into dictating management direction for parks.”

The event was designed as a “government-to-government meeting,” said Redge Johnson, director of the Public Lands Policy Coordinating Office and the host of the event. Johnson recalled telling some state lawmakers and others they couldn’t attend as he tried to keep attendance from growing too unwieldy for productive conversation and debate. 
“It’s not like we were there saying, ‘Thou shalt not,’ because that’s not what the meeting was,” Johnson said. “It was just, ‘Hey, here are some concerns, and we just have an open discussion about it.’”
He said the group debated timed entry programs, which Utah’s congressional representatives have criticized.
In August, the state’s congressional delegation urged Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to say no to reservation systems designed to limit traffic to parks, like the timed entry program in Arches National Park and a similar proposed setup for Zion National Park, arguing it corresponded with a dip in visitor spending. 
But Clark said the program ensures visitors can access the trails and sites they came for, instead of spending much of their time stopped in traffic along the way. 
“The superintendents, the management, the staff at these parks, have all thought through a lot of alternatives on how to do this,” Clark said. “And they’ve landed at these pretty sensible management decisions.”

,California,2025-12-03 13:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s new labor law could have unintended and unwanted consequences,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/12/labor-law-consequences-california/,"A new law allows a state board to intercede in labor disputes involving private employers. But is the law legal, since it usurps a federal role?","The California Legislature has a bad habit of writing new law in the moment and paying little or no attention to its potential consequences.
While legislative history contains many examples, the most spectacular occurred three decades ago when legislators and then-Gov. Pete Wilson massively overhauled how electricity is generated, distributed and priced, telling consumers it would make power more affordable and reliable.
The real world impact was just the opposite. Power became less reliable, prices skyrocketed and the state’s investor-owned utilities were pushed into insolvency.
Other examples of unintended consequences in California include launching a bullet train project without comprehensive construction or financial plans, sharply increasing public employee pensions without considering costs and doing the same with unemployment insurance benefits.
One could also add the current practice of draining emergency reserves to cover budget deficits that result from overestimating revenues and underestimating spending, leaving the state’s finances vulnerable to an inevitable economic downturn.
Then there is Assembly Bill 288, one of many measures the Legislature dominated by Democrats and Gov. Gavin Newsom have passed in recent years to thwart — or so they hope — President Donald Trump.
AB 288, sponsored by California labor unions and carried by Assemblymember Tina McKinnor, an Inglewood Democrat, expands the authority of California’s Public Employment Relations Board — which oversees union-management activities in state and local governments and school districts — to include private sector employment.
The bill aims for the Public Employee Relations Board, or PERB, to step into the role performed for many decades by the National Labor Relations Board because, McKinnor and other advocates maintain, the NLRB is frozen by a dispute over its membership.
Early this year, Trump removed Dwynne Wilcox, the NLRB’s chair, leaving the board without a quorum and unable to decide pending cases. Trump’s action is being fought in the courts.

“Well, I’ll just say that if we have no board, no quorum, no board, no justice to state workers, for state workers,” McKinnor told the state Senate Judiciary Committee just before AB 288 passed. “And so, we need to make sure that, you know, that PERB can hear these cases, because if there’s no forum for workers to resolve unfair labor practices, then where do they stand?
“What do we do for them? We can’t just leave them out in the cold because the NLRB doesn’t have a quorum. We also can have loss of union protections, like bargaining rights, organizing protections and reinstatement after retaliation. And so, we can’t have our workers unprotected, because employers will take advantage of that.”
Private employer groups opposed the measure, contending the existence of the NLRB, even though it’s stymied, preempts a state from usurping federal authority.
Generally, states can legislate on labor relations only in economic sectors not covered by federal law. That’s why, a half-century ago, California could create the public employment board and the Agricultural Labor Relations Board to oversee employment on farms and in food processing plants.
The NLRB and interests that opposed AB 288 are suing in federal court, contending that the legislation is illegal under federal law.
AB 288 represents a potentially disruptive, even dangerous, precedent. Were it to survive the legal challenge, every state would be free to create its own set of laws governing unionization of workers.
Blue states such as California could virtually mandate unionization of private sector employees, as it already has for public employees and farm workers.
Meanwhile, red states could virtually prohibit unions from organizing workers, to make the states more attractive to industry and insulated from NLRB oversight even if Democrats regain the White House.
Balkanizing labor-management relations would create chaos in the national economy. It also could potentially work to the overall disadvantage of union organizing efforts.

(Photo: Michael Lyle/Nevada Current)This story is the first in a series on the connections between housing instability and child welfare. This project was supported by the USC Annenberg Center for Health Journalism’s National Fellowship and Fund for Reporting on Child Well-Being. 
Homelessness alone is rarely the reason children are removed from their families and placed in the child welfare system throughout the state of Nevada. 
Yet in the recent instances where children have been placed in foster care because of homelessness or “inadequate housing,” state and local officials can’t provide firm details as to what made those cases exceptional. 
 Nevada, like much of the nation, has seen rising homelessness as housing costs have soared. 
Whether by compounding reasons that lead to a child being removed on the front end, or becoming a barrier that delays family reunification, and at multiple points in between, unstable housing takes a deep, and often lasting, toll on children’s well being.
The county has tried to bolster resources, including additional rental assistance and opening noncongregate shelter spaces for families to try to catch people on the front end, said Abigail Frierson, Clark County’s Deputy County Manager who currently serves as the interim director for the county’s department of Family Services. 
“We’ve had in recent years some additional resources come into play that can be accessed at the front end of cases, or even before a case is filed, to try to avoid court oversight of the child,” she said. 
Homelessness or inadequate housing is noted as the reason for removal in a little more than 10% of child welfare cases in recent years. 
Of the 2,590 families that had children removed statewide in 2024, there were 361 incidents where inadequate housing or homelessness were listed as a reason for removal, according to data from the Nevada Department of Family and Child Services (DFCS). The overwhelming majority had additional reasons attached to the removal. 
“Before a child is removed from a home, the government’s obligation is to make reasonable efforts to prevent that removal,” Nevada 8th Judicial District Court Family Division Judge David Gibson said. “Those aren’t the kinds of cases that should, except in the rarest circumstances, ever even come before a judge.” 
Child welfare services should intervene and provide the family resources before involving the court, he added.
Statewide there were 30 children removed due to inadequate housing or homelessness with no other additional reason in 2024, according to DFCS data. There have been 26 instances as of July 2025, the most recent available data.  
Three children were removed from their family’s supervision due to housing inadequacy alone in rural Nevada, while 27 children were placed in child welfare services in Clark County in 2024.
The three incidents when children were removed for inadequate housing in rural Nevada was from a single family and stemmed from “a filthy house,” said Betsey Crumrine, the Deputy Administrator with the Division of Child and Family Services.
“That house would have needed to pose a safety threat for removal to occur for that reason alone,” she said. 
The meaning of inadequate housing varies, she explained. In some instances, it’s the lack of heat or air conditioning.  It could also include unsanitary and unsafe conditions that present health risks and hazards for children. 
“It could be a dirty house which could look different for the age of the kids,” Crumrine said. “If you have toddlers crawling around the floor and you have animal feces on the floor and they are putting things in their mouths, that could be considered inadequate housing.”
The same scenario wouldn’t necessarily apply to older children or teenagers. “It’s all situational,” she said. 
The 27 families in Clark County that had children removed just for homelessness or inadequate housing last year is the highest number in 10 years of data provided by the state.
While still low compared to the number of overall child removals, the figures seemed high, Frierson said.
“I would tend to think that there would be more going on than just homelessness,” Frierson said. “The court would not be very friendly to a homelessness-only removal when the parent is functional in every other way.”


There were four instances of homelessness-only family removals in Washoe as of July this year, but ”due to the confidentiality of the families we serve, we are unable to provide specific details regarding individual cases, outcomes, or circumstances of their involvement,” Tammi Williamson, the Division Director Washoe County Human Services Agency, said in an email.

“It is uncommon for WCHSA to remove children solely on the basis of a parent’s lack of housing resources or homelessness,” she said. “Typically, there are additional contributing factors related to parental circumstances or behaviors.”
The Department of Family and Child Services provided Nevada Current data since 2016 for instances where children were removed for homelessness only or homelessness combined with an additional reason. There were 53 children placed in child welfare services  in 2016 due homelessness or inadequate housing statewide. The number of children removed from households plummeted to single digits in 2017 and remained that way through 2022. Statewide it was nine that year. In Clark County it was six.
The number slowly began to increase in 2023.
There have been efforts to get more publicly available data from child welfare agencies on things such as the breakdown on race, said Amanda Haboush-Deloye, the executive director for the Nevada Institute for Children’s Research & Policy.
The last time the state Legislature mandated an independent review of child welfare cases was in 2008, resulting in a study conducted by Nevada Institute for Children’s Research & Policy. Haboush-Deloye couldn’t recall what prompted lawmakers to authorize the review at the time, only that it provided insight into the system. 
“We were able to go in and randomly pull cases and read through all of the case notes,” Haboush-Deloye said. “That way we could determine if it seemed like there were any patterns or any issues.”
Haboush-Deloye wasn’t aware of any efforts in Nevada to analyze the child removal cases that dealt with housing to determine underlying causes. 
“I do think having external reviews on a regular basis would be helpful,” she said. 
Rapidly rising family homelessness
The bulk of the cases where children are removed from their families due to homelessness and the court is needed to intervene include additional reasons, often involving mental health issues. 
“Typically, what you’re finding is housing instability is riding on the back of substance abuse, issues of domestic violence in the home, or mental health,” Gibson said. “What you find is if resources are playing a part in a child coming under the court’s formal supervision, there are usually other more important underlying issues that are causing the homelessness.”
Of the 361 statewide cases last year when homelessness was cited in the removal, 331 cases identified additional reasons.
As of July 2025, there have been 275 children removed for homelessness or inadequate housing with 249 including additional reasons. 
These numbers coincide with a rising homelessness number at large. 
Statewide, homelessness increased by 17% in 2024, according to the U.S. Housing and Urban Development data. The Southern Nevada Point-in-time count –  a yearly snapshot of those experiencing homelessness that is considered an undercount –  found of the 7,906 experiencing homelessness, roughly 20% — more than 1,500 — were families with children. 
That’s nearly double the 794 families identified as homeless in 2023, and that was a 54% increase from 2022.   
Nevada, like most states, has long contended with an affordable housing shortage. The pandemic exacerbated that. When eviction protections expired and Covid-era relief assistance began to be scaled back, some families fell through the social safety net.  
“We have the same individuals that were evicted, struggling to find affordable rental units,” said Brenda Barnes, the social services manager for Clark County. “We have families that struggle with managing that stress. A lot of it is triggered because of everything spiking, cost of living increasing, … It’s just one thing after another that ends up becoming a negative outcome for a child at times.” 
The way a parent reacts during that time of crisis “can make all the difference on whether a referral to child protective services will be opened up or not,” she said.  
During times of intense stress, some parents might turn to self-medication to cope.
“If you can’t think of any way that you’re going to get out of this, or see any positive or light at the end of the tunnel, you’re going to get depressed … Then you start using other substances to help you feel better. Then it’s just that rolling pin that goes over and over,” Haboush-Deloye said.
The lack of stable housing might not always be the underlying incident that brings people into the child welfare system. 
But for many families who enter the system, the need to find stable housing “becomes more crucial to the family on the back end,” Gibson said. 
Once children enter the system and a court begins to monitor cases, social services establish case plans for parents to follow in order to reunify with children which include things like mental health and substance abuse treatment. 
The county isn’t able to quantify how many case plans include some sort of housing component, Frierson said. Though nonprofits who work with families that have child welfare cases say it is constantly a barrier for their clients.  
“If somebody has literally addressed every other issue in their case plan, and it’s only housing that’s holding up the reunification, most of the judges that are overseeing those cases set them for a fairly rapid set of status checks to try to turn the heat up on everybody involved, to help that family find a place,” Gibson said.
There are only limited housing resources available and whether or not housing is deemed adequate for reunification is determined case by case, Frierson said. 
Extended stay or weekly motels, often a last resort for people when no other housing is available, is typically considered stable housing, she added.  
Family Promise of Las Vegas, a nonprofit that provides shelter and support services for families and children experiencing homelessness, has run into those issues when helping families reunite. 
Before opening a 10-bed facility this year to house families at risk of homelessness, Family Promise of Las Vegas, a nonprofit that provides shelter and support services for families and children experiencing homelessness, would pay for extended stay rooms to serve the sheer volume of clients in need of help and help families reunite.  
“There was a situation where we actually tried to take a family where their housing was the last resort and the last step was to need to be reunified with the child,” said Marisa Cervantes, the executive director for the nonprofit. “We placed them in the weekly but then later found out that it did not count as housing because it was not long term,” and the child remained in protective services.
There were times when housing resources became an issue for families, and the family court judges would order welfare services to allocate those resources.
The Nevada Supreme Court ruled last year that district courts can’t order governmental social service agencies to pay for housing assistance.
According to court documents in that case, Clark County family services removed children and placed them with a paternal aunt, who lived with their paternal grandmother. Prior to becoming a foster parent, the family asked, and was granted, rental assistance from family services. 
After becoming a foster parent to the children the family asked for additional rental assistance  for $1,000, but the county’s division declined – the agency noted the family was receiving foster care subsidies. The attorney went to the district court, which ruled the county must pay. 
The county then sued.
“We conclude that the district court lacked statutory authority to order DFS to pay rental assistance to a foster parent,” the Nevada Supreme Court ruled Dec. 5, 2024. 
A judge’s hands are often tied for how much they can mandate and the courts “can’t tell an agency how to spend their number,” Gibson said.
Delayed reunification
Even for parents going through substance abuse treatment, and successfully complete it as a requirement set out by the court, housing becomes a final barrier to reunifying with their children, said Irma Magrdichian, the director of residential services at WestCare Nevada, which provides substance abuse treatment. 
The result, she said, has led to delayed reunifications because of the lack of stable housing. 
The organization has about 20 women who are reunified with children who had previously been removed to foster care while still in treatment, said Leo Magrdichian, WestCare’s vice president of operations. 
“We’re able to allow mom to participate in treatment, reunify with her children, and then begin the process of really learning how to balance motherhood or parenting and treatment,” he said. 
The organization provides a 30-bed facility at its Women and Children’s Campus where women can participate in treatment while they have their children.  
Challenges to paying for treatment and cost of living are adding more obstacles to families with child welfare cases
In previous years, Medicaid had paid for up to six months of treatment. During the time, “a lot of DFS caseworkers were okay with placing children while in residential treatment,” said Irma Magrdichian. 
The courts “considered that to be ample time for mom to gain employment and, you know, secure, more stable housing after treatment,” she added. 
More recently, the amount Medicaid paid for treatment was reduced to 90 days, just as rents began to increase and affordable housing became even more out of reach for people. 
Ninety days is not nearly enough time for a person to save enough money and secure housing, said Leo Magrdichian. 
“We’re looking at women that have had evictions or ladies that have been out of the workforce for a long time,” he said. 
Shorter treatment timeframes combined with fewer affordable housing options to make welfare services “a little bit more reluctant to place” children with mothers until they find more stable living, Irma Magrdichian said. 
Using extended stay motels often isn’t an option, as it puts women back in environments that could jeopardize sobriety, Leo Magrdichian said. 
“What do you do when you’re at risk? You stop thinking clearly, and you go back to doing some of the things that you did before,” he added. 
The organization is in the process of completing an 84-unit apartment complex for women and children to transition to after they complete treatment, which is expected to begin housing women in January.  
“Just based on need and funding, this campus will be for women or women and children only,” he said.  “We will have the opportunity in the future to expand, because the reality of it is, you need to treat the entire family at the same time if you really want to see good success.”
Residents won’t be required to pay rent, giving them an opportunity to save up for when they eventually transition to their own apartment down the road once they are ready. 
Opening the complex will complete a long time goal, and fill a growing need among women they serve,” Irma Magrdichian said.
“I can tell you right now, when it’s done, it will not be enough,” she said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0087-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-03 08:56:36.442191

The Afghan's claim for asylum is separate from the case which found Dadfar was detained unlawfully by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (photo submitted).An Afghan man who fled the Taliban has been released from a Missouri immigration detention facility following a federal judge’s ruling.
Mohammad Ali Dadfar had been held in the Greene County Jail in Springfield since early October, when he was detained and turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.
On Monday, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri, Southern Division,  agreed that Dadfar, an asylum-seeker, was arrested without a warrant and that his permission to be in the U.S. was unlawfully terminated without a hearing or written notice.
The court noted that while immigration detentions are administrative, they are still subject to due process reviews.
Officials for ICE had argued that the Missouri court did not have jurisdiction.
The court disagreed, noting that the case challenged Dadfar’s unlawful detention, but not other proceedings the government might use to remove him from the country.
“Respondents also did not provide a hearing before a neutral decisionmaker where ICE was required to justify the basis for re-detention or explain why Petitioner is a flight risk or danger to the community,” the ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Harpool said.
Harpool also forbade the Department of Homeland Security from moving Dadfar out of the Missouri court’s jurisdiction before they complied with the order to release him.
Afghan asylum seeker who fought the Taliban now held by ICE in Missouri

Dadfar was released on Monday and will be driven by a friend to reunite with his wife and young children in another state, said Rekha Sharma-Crawford, a Kansas City immigration attorney who filed the case challenging his arrest and detention.
Dadfar had been granted parole into the U.S. in 2024. His parole is effective until June 17, 2026.
The decision to grant him parole “creates a liberty interest intimately tied to freedom from imprisonment,” the ruling said.
“Freedom from imprisonment — from government custody, detention, or other forms of physical restraint — lies at the heart of the liberty that the (due process) Clause protects,” the ruling noted, citing previous court decisions.
Dadfar requested asylum after arriving at the U.S. southern border. He had traveled  through the dangerous Darien Gap jungle with his family.
The asylum claim is based on his assertion that he was among the thousands of Afghans who aided the U.S. military, battling to keep the Taliban from overtaking his native Afghanistan.
Dadfar, an over-the-road trucker, was taken into custody by Indiana State Police on Oct. 10. Police detained him during a routine stop at a weigh station. He was then handed over to ICE in Chicago before being placed in detention in Greene County, Missouri.
Dadfar is a 37-year-old father of four children, all under the age of 12.
Reached at the family’s home, Dadfar’s wife said she was elated. She’d been worried earlier in the day while awaiting word from the court.
The family lives outside of Missouri.
The case argued that the government’s actions violated a prior consent decree, ICE’s own regulations and Dadfar’s due process.
Dadfar’s case is among a spate of federal lawsuits contesting warrantless arrests by ICE and is part of continued legal attempts to hold the Trump administration accountable to the 2022 Castañon Nava federal consent decree.
Dadfar, the Missouri ruling said, had timely filed his asylum application with a Colorado immigration court. He also had a valid work permit.
The next hearing in the asylum application is February 2026.
Dadfar is represented by a Colorado immigration law firm in the asylum request.
Sharma-Crawford said Dadfar’s arrest and detention are another example of the Trump administration violating policy. She also said the case shows how even immigrants who follow the rules are threatened with removal.
“Even doing what they are supposed to do, in the way the law requires, does not keep them safe,” Sharma-Crawford said in a social media post. “That is what is happening right now in America.”

Read this story in English.
Con el aumento de la inseguridad alimentaria y los cambios en programas como el SNAP (Programa de Asistencia Nutricional Suplementaria), algunos legisladores de Connecticut están intensificando sus esfuerzos para aprobar una legislación durante la sesión de 2026 que garantizaría comidas escolares universales para los estudiantes de todo el estado, independientemente de su distrito escolar. Actualmente, los estudiantes tienen acceso a una combinación de comidas gratuitas, a precio reducido y de pago, según los ingresos familiares, y algunos distritos optan por ofrecer comidas gratuitas a todos los niños.
Esto es lo que necesita saber sobre las comidas escolares universales en Connecticut y por qué podría tratarse en la sesión legislativa del próximo año.
¿Quiénes son elegibles para recibir comidas escolares gratuitas en Connecticut?
Hay tres maneras en que funcionan las comidas escolares en las escuelas de Connecticut.
Primero, están los estudiantes que reciben comidas gratuitas, es decir, desayuno y almuerzo. Una familia de cuatro personas califica si gana menos de $41,795 antes de impuestos para el año escolar 2025-26.
También hay estudiantes cuyas familias pagan una tarifa reducida por las comidas escolares. Para una familia de cuatro, los ingresos antes de impuestos deben ser inferiores a $59,478.
Y hay estudiantes cuyas familias pagan el precio completo porque sus ingresos superan los límites para comidas gratuitas o a precio reducido. El almuerzo para estos estudiantes suele costar entre $3 y $4.50, según el distrito escolar.
Sin embargo, algunos distritos ofrecen comidas gratuitas a todos los niños. ¿Cómo funciona esto?
Según la Disposición de Elegibilidad Comunitaria (CEP), si más del 25% de la población de una escuela cumple los requisitos para recibir comidas gratuitas, la escuela puede optar por servir desayuno y almuerzo gratuitos a todos los estudiantes. La escuela puede entonces recibir un reembolso con fondos federales, a una tasa del 1.6%. Esto significa que, si el 40% de los estudiantes de la escuela cumplen los requisitos para recibir comidas gratuitas, la escuela recibirá un reembolso de 1.6 veces esa cantidad, o el 64%. La escuela deberá entonces encontrar fondos dentro de su presupuesto para las comidas del 36% restante. Algunos distritos tienen un porcentaje suficientemente alto de estudiantes que cumplen los requisitos como para no tener que aportar fondos adicionales.
También hay algunos distritos que ofrecen desayuno universal, pero no almuerzo.
¿Cuántos distritos escolares de Connecticut ofrecen comidas gratuitas a los estudiantes?
Actualmente, 63 distritos participan, pero en 12 de ellos el programa solo está disponible en algunas escuelas. Esto representa un total de 202 distritos escolares en el estado.
Mi distrito solía ofrecer comidas universales, pero ya no lo hace. ¿Por qué?
En 2023, la FDA (La Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos) modificó la disposición del CEP para que las escuelas con un 25% de estudiantes que calificaban para comidas gratuitas pudieran optar por ofrecer comidas universales. Anteriormente, el umbral estaba establecido en el 40%. Algunos distritos escolares de Connecticut que se encontraban dentro de ese rango del 25% al ​​40% decidieron optar por participar, pero posteriormente determinaron que el programa era demasiado costoso para continuar y optaron por retirarse.
¿Qué tipo de alimentos reciben los estudiantes como parte de las comidas universales en Connecticut?
No existe un menú universal que los distritos escolares deban seguir en Connecticut, por lo que cada distrito contrata a diferentes proveedores. Pero todos los almuerzos estudiantiles deben incluir cinco componentes: un lácteo, proteína, almidón, verdura y fruta.
¿Por qué legisladores y defensores quieren ofrecer comidas escolares universales en Connecticut, incluso en distritos ricos?
La inseguridad alimentaria está afectando duramente a los residentes de Connecticut. Las interrupciones en programas como el SNAP causadas por el cierre del gobierno y la exclusión total de poblaciones del programa han renovado los llamados para que el estado haga todo lo posible para garantizar que los niños reciban alimentación. La ley “One Big Beautiful Bill” excluye a ciertos grupos de los beneficios del SNAP, incluyendo a refugiados y solicitantes de asilo, así como a algunos adultos jóvenes, veteranos y personas sin hogar.
Pero incluso antes de que se implementaran estas restricciones, los legisladores de Connecticut abogaban por las comidas escolares universales por diversas razones.
Si bien algunos distritos escolares de Connecticut pueden tener un bajo porcentaje de estudiantes que califican para comidas gratuitas, legisladores y defensores afirman que universalizar estas comidas tiene varios beneficios. En primer lugar, cuando las comidas están disponibles sin costo, aumenta la participación en estos programas.
“Cambia la cultura del programa de comidas escolares”, afirmó Marlene Schwartz, directora del Centro Rudd de Políticas Alimentarias y Salud de la Universidad de Connecticut. “Deja de ser solo un programa considerado exclusivo para niños de bajos recursos, se convierte en algo que todos hacen”, reduciendo el estigma y garantizando que los niños con hambre reciban comida. Los niños con el estómago lleno, según los defensores, pueden concentrarse en su aprendizaje.
Universalizar este programa también reduciría el costo y el tiempo del papeleo asociado con la selección de comidas disponibles para cada estudiante. Esto permitiría a los directores de los programas de alimentación dedicar su tiempo y energía a brindar alimentos de la mejor calidad a sus estudiantes. Alimentar a más niños también otorgaría a los distritos más pequeños un mayor poder adquisitivo para realizar acuerdos de compra al por mayor con los proveedores.
En Connecticut, el alto costo de vida también significa que muchas familias no califican para comidas gratuitas, pero que tienen dificultades para cubrir el costo de los alimentos y se beneficiarían enormemente, según Schwartz.
“La diferencia entre lo que se puede ganar para dejar de calificar y lo que se necesita para mantener a una familia de cuatro en Connecticut es de muchos miles de dólares, y en esa diferencia hay muchas personas que necesitan ayuda y no la reciben”, dijo. Dado que las familias de bajos ingresos califican para almuerzos gratuitos, Schwartz dijo que la mayoría de la gente asume que todos los niños que necesitan comidas gratuitas las reciben. “¡No, no es así!”, dijo. “¡No es así!”.
¿Cómo financiaría Connecticut las comidas universales?
Eso está por verse, pero una de las propuestas sobre la mesa es un impuesto a las bebidas azucaradas. Schwartz, por su parte, está a favor de esta idea.
“Pensé que era la idea más brillante que había escuchado”, dijo. “Un éxito rotundo en salud pública”. Debido a que bebidas como los refrescos están asociados con consecuencias negativas para la salud, ciudades de todo Estados Unidos han utilizado estos impuestos para combatir la obesidad y la diabetes, a la vez que recaudan fondos para mejorar la calidad de vida de sus ciudadanos.
Filadelfia, por ejemplo, grava estas bebidas con 1,5 centavos por onza y ha utilizado esos fondos para financiar un programa preescolar gratuito, entre otras iniciativas.

For decades, corn has reigned over American agriculture. It sprawls across 90 million acres — about the size of Montana — and goes into everything from livestock feed and processed foods to the ethanol blended into most of the nation’s gasoline. 
This ear of corn is part of a larger climate story: Nitrogen fertilizer — which is used heavily in Corn Belt states like Wisconsin — is driving a surge in nitrous oxide emissions, a potent greenhouse gas. (Dee J. Hall / Floodlight)
But a growing body of research reveals that America’s obsession with corn has a steep price: The fertilizer used to grow it is warming the planet and contaminating water.
Corn is essential to the rural economy and to the world’s food supply, and researchers say the problem isn’t the corn itself. It’s how we grow it. 
Corn farmers rely on heavy fertilizer use to sustain today’s high yields. And when that nitrogen breaks down in the soil, it releases nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas nearly 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Producing nitrogen fertilizer also emits large amounts of carbon dioxide, adding to its climate footprint.
Agriculture accounts for more than 10% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and corn uses more than two-thirds of all nitrogen fertilizer nationwide — making it the leading driver of agricultural nitrous oxide emissions, studies show.
The corn and ethanol industries insist that rapid growth in ethanol — which now consumes more than 40% of the U.S. corn crop —  is a net environmental benefit, and they strongly dispute research suggesting otherwise.
Since 2000, U.S. corn production has surged almost 50%, further adding to the crop’s climate impact. 
Yet the environmental costs of corn rarely make headlines or factor into political debates. Much of the dynamic traces back to federal policy — and to the powerful corn and ethanol lobby that helped shape it. 

The Renewable Fuel Standard, passed in the mid 2000s, required that gasoline be blended with ethanol, a biofuel that in the United States comes almost entirely from corn. That mandate drove up demand and prices for corn, spurring farmers to plant more of it. 
Many plant corn year after year on the same land. The practice, called “continuous corn,” demands massive amounts of nitrogen fertilizer and drives especially high nitrous oxide emissions. 
At the same time, federal subsidies make it more lucrative to grow corn than to diversify. Taxpayers have covered more than $50 billion in corn insurance premiums over the past 30 years, according to federal data compiled by the Environmental Working Group.
Researchers say proven conservation steps — such as planting rows of trees, shrubs and grasses in corn fields — could sharply reduce these emissions. But the Trump administration has eliminated many of the incentives that helped farmers try such practices. 
Experts say it all raises a larger question: If America’s most widely planted crop is worsening climate change, shouldn’t we begin growing it a different way?
How corn took over America
Corn has been a staple of U.S. agriculture for centuries, first domesticated by Native Americans and later used by European immigrants as a versatile crop for food and animal feed. Its production really took off in the 2000s after federal mandates and incentives helped turn much of America’s corn crop into ethanol.
Cattle and other livestock eat more than 40% of the corn grown in the United States. A similar amount is used to make ethanol. Just 12% ends up as food for people or in other uses. (Dee J. Hall / Floodlight)
Corn’s dominance — and the emissions that come with it — didn’t happen by accident. It was built through a high-dollar lobbying campaign that continues today.
In the late 1990s, America’s corn farmers were in trouble. Prices had cratered amid a global grain glut and the Asian financial crisis. A 1999 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis said crop prices had hit “rock bottom.”
In 2001 and 2002, the federal government gave corn farmers and ethanol producers a boost — first through the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Bioenergy Program, which paid ethanol producers to increase their use of farm commodities for fuel. Then the 2002 Farm Bill created programs that continue to support ethanol and other renewable energy.
Corn growers soon after mounted an all-out campaign in Washington. Their goal: persuade Congress to require gasoline to be blended with ethanol. State and national grower groups lobbied relentlessly, pitching ethanol as a way to cut greenhouse gasses, reduce oil dependence and revive rural economies.
“We got down to a couple of votes in Congress, and the corn growers were united like never before,” recalled Jon Doggett, then the industry’s chief lobbyist, in an article published by the National Corn Growers Association. “I started receiving calls from Capitol Hill saying, ‘Would you have your growers stop calling us? We are with you.’ I had not seen anything like it before and haven’t seen anything like it since.”
Their persistence paid off. In 2005, Congress created the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which requires that a certain amount of ethanol be blended into U.S. gasoline each year. Two years later, lawmakers expanded it further. The policy transformed the market: The amount of corn used for ethanol domestically has more than tripled in the past 20 years.
When demand for corn spiked as a result of the RFS, it pushed up prices worldwide, said Tim Searchinger, a researcher at Princeton University’s School of Public and International Affairs. The result, Searchinger said, is that more land around the world got cleared to grow corn. That, in turn, resulted in more emissions. 
That lobbying brought clout. “King Corn” became a political force, courted by presidential hopefuls and protected by both parties. Since 2010, national corn and ethanol trade groups have spent more than $55 million on lobbying and millions more on political donations, according to campaign finance records analyzed by Floodlight. 
In 2024 alone, those trade groups spent twice as much on lobbying as the National Rifle Association. Major industry players — Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill and ethanol giant POET among them — have poured even more into Washington, ensuring the sector’s voice remains one of the loudest in U.S. agriculture.

Now those same groups are pushing for the next big prize: expanding higher-ethanol gasoline blends and positioning ethanol-based jet fuel as aviation’s “low-carbon” future.
Research undercuts ethanol’s clean-fuel claims
Corn and ethanol trade groups didn’t make their officials available for interviews.
But on their websites and in their literature, they have promoted corn ethanol as a climate-friendly fuel. 
The Renewable Fuels Association cites government and university research that finds burning ethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 40-50% compared with gasoline. The ethanol industry says the climate critics have it wrong — and that most of the corn used for fuel comes from better yields and smarter farming, not from plowing up new land. The amount of fertilizer required to produce a bushel of corn has dropped sharply in recent decades, they say.
“Ethanol reduces carbon emissions, removing the carbon equivalent of 12 million cars from the road each year,” according to the Renewable Fuels Association.
Growth Energy, a major ethanol trade group, said in a written statement that U.S. farmers and biofuel producers are “constantly finding new ways to make their operations more efficient and more environmentally beneficial,” using things like cover crops to reduce their carbon footprint.
But some research tells a different story.
A recent Environmental Working Group report finds that the way corn is grown in much of the Midwest — with the same fields planted in corn year after year — carries a heavy climate cost.
Research in 2022 by agricultural land use expert Tyler Lark and colleagues links the Renewable Fuel Standard to expanded corn cultivation, heavier fertilizer use, worsening water pollution and increased emissions. Scientists typically convert greenhouse gasses like nitrous oxide and methane into their carbon-dioxide equivalents — or carbon intensity — so their warming impacts can be compared on the same scale.
“The carbon intensity of corn ethanol produced under the RFS is no less than gasoline and likely at least 24% higher,” the authors concluded.
Lark’s research has been disputed by scientists at Argonne National Laboratory, Purdue University and the University of Illinois, who published a formal rebuttal arguing the study relied on “questionable assumptions” and faulty modeling — a charge Lark’s team has rejected.
A 2017 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that the RFS was unlikely to meet its greenhouse gas goals because the U.S. relies predominantly on corn ethanol and produces relatively little of the cleaner, advanced biofuels made from waste. 
The Renewable Fuel Standard, passed in the mid 2000s, requires that gasoline be blended with ethanol, which in the United States comes almost entirely from corn. That mandate drives up demand and prices for corn, spurring farmers to plant more of it. Ethanol producers say that was good for the climate, but recent research has concluded otherwise.

The problem isn’t just emissions, researchers say. Corn ethanol requires millions of acres that could instead be used for food crops or more efficient energy sources. One recent study found that solar panels can generate as much energy as corn ethanol on roughly 3% of the land. 
“It’s just a terrible use of land,” Searchinger, the Princeton researcher, said of ethanol. “And you can’t solve climate change if you’re going to make such terrible use of land.”
Most of the country’s top crop isn’t feeding people. More than 40% of U.S. corn goes to ethanol. A similar amount is used to feed livestock, and just 12% ends up as food or in other uses.
As corn production rises, so have emissions 
Globally, corn production doubled from 2000 to 2021. 
That growth has been fueled by fertilizer, which emits nitrous oxide that can linger in the atmosphere for more than a century. That eats away at the ozone layer, which blocks most of the sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiation.
Global emissions have soared alongside corn production. Between 1980 and 2020, nitrous oxide emissions from human activity climbed 40%, the Global Carbon project found. 
In the United States, nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture in 2022 were equal to roughly 262 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to the EPA’s inventory of greenhouse gas emissions. That’s equivalent to putting almost 56 million passenger cars on the road.
The biggest increases are coming straight from the Corn Belt.
Emissions of nitrous oxide — an extremely potent greenhouse gas — have soared in America’s Corn Belt in the years since nitrogen fertilizer use became widespread. (Environmental Working Group visualization of nitrous oxide data from Iowa State University researcher Chaoqun Lu and colleagues.)
Ethanol’s climate footprint isn’t the only concern. The nitrogen used to grow corn and other crops is also a key source of drinking water pollution.
According to a new report by the Alliance for the Great Lakes and Clean Wisconsin, more than 90% of nitrate contamination in Wisconsin’s groundwater is linked to agricultural sources — mostly synthetic fertilizer and manure. 
The same analysis estimates that in 2022, farmers applied more than 16 million pounds of nitrogen beyond what crops needed, sending runoff into wells, streams and other water systems.

For families like Tyler Frye’s, that hits close to home. In 2022, Frye and his wife moved into a new home in the rural village of Casco, Wisconsin, about 20 miles east of Green Bay. A free test soon afterward found their well water had nitrate levels more than twice the EPA’s safe limit. “We were pretty shocked,” he said. 
Frye installed a reverse-osmosis system in the basement and still buys bottled water for his wife, who is breastfeeding their daughter, born in July.
One likely culprit, he suspects, are the cornfields less than 200 yards from his home.
“Crops like corn require a lot of nitrogen,” he said. “A lot of that stuff, I assume, is getting into the well water and surface water.”
When he watches manure or fertilizer being spread on nearby fields, he said, one question nags him: “Where does that go?”
What cleaner corn could look like
Reducing corn’s climate footprint is possible — but the farmers trying to do it are swimming against the policy tide.
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, backed by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, strips out the provisions of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act that had rewarded farmers for climate-friendly practices.
And in April, Trump’s USDA canceled the $3 billion Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities initiative, a grant program designed to promote farming and forestry practices to improve soil and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The agency said that the program’s administrative costs meant too little money was reaching farmers, while Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins dismissed it as part of the “green new scam.” 
University of Iowa professor Silvia Secchi said the rollback of the Climate-Smart program has already given farmers “cold feet” about adopting conservation practices. “The impact of this has been devastating,” said Secchi, a natural resources economist who teaches at the university’s School of Earth, Environment and Sustainability.
Research shows what’s possible if farmers had support. In its recent report, the Environmental Working Group found that four proven conservation practices — including planting trees, shrubs and hedgerows in corn fields — could make a measurable difference. 
Iowa farmer Levi Lyle planted this corn in soil with mulch made from cover crops instead of synthetic fertilizer. This type of mulch suppresses weeds, enriches soil and reduces or eliminates the need for nitrogen fertilizer. It’s a “huge opportunity to sequester more carbon, improve soil health, save money on chemicals and still get a similar yield,” Lyle says. (Photo courtesy of Levi Lyle)
Implementing those practices on just 4% of continuous corn acres across Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin would cut total greenhouse gas emissions by the equivalent of taking more than 850,000 gasoline cars off the road, EWG found.
Despite setbacks at the federal level, some farmers are already showing what a more climate-friendly Corn Belt could look like.
In northern Iowa, Wendy Johnson farms 1,200 acres of corn and soybeans with her father. On 130 of those acres, she’s trying something different: She’s planting fruit and nut trees, organic grains, shrubs and other plants that need little or no nitrogen fertilizer.
“The more perennials we can have on the ground, the better it is for the climate,” she said.
Across the rest of the farm, they enrich the soil by rotating crops and planting cover crops. They’ve also converted less productive parts of the fields into “prairie strips” — bands of prairie grass that store carbon and require no fertilizer.
Under the now-cancelled Climate-Smart grant program, they were supposed to receive technical assistance and about $20,000 a year to expand those practices. The grant program was terminated before they got any of the money.
“It’s hard to take risks on your own,” Johnson said. “That’s where federal support really helps. Because agriculture is a high-risk occupation.”

The economics still favor business as usual. Johnson knows that many Midwestern corn growers feel pressure to maximize yields, keeping them hooked on corn — and nitrogen fertilizer. 
“I think a lot of farmers around here are very allergic to trees,” she joked. 
In southeast Iowa, sixth-generation farmer Levi Lyle, who mixes organic and conventional methods across 290 acres, uses a three-year rotation, extensive cover crops and a technique called roller-crimping — flattening rye each spring to create a mulch that suppresses weeds, feeds the soil and reduces fertilizer needs. 
“The roller crimping of cover crops is a huge, huge opportunity to sequester more carbon, improve soil health, save money on chemicals and still get a similar yield,” he said.
But farmers get few government incentives to take such climate-friendly steps, Lyle said. “There is a lack of seriousness about supporting farmers to implement these new practices,” he said. 
And without federal programs to offset the risk, the innovations that Lyle and Johnson are trying remain exceptions — not the norm.
Many farmers still see prairie strips or patches of trees as a waste, said Luke Gran, whose company helps Iowa farmers establish perennials.
“My eyes do not lie,” Gran said. “I have not seen extensive change to cover cropping or tillage across the broad acreage of this state that I love.”
The next corn boom?
Despite mounting research about corn’s climate costs, industry groups are pushing for policies to  boost ethanol demand. 
One big priority: Pushing a bill to require that new cars are able to run on gas with more ethanol than what’s commonly sold today.
Corn and biofuel trade groups have also been pressing Democrats and Republicans in Congress for legislation to pave the way for ethanol-based jet fuel. While use of such “sustainable” aviation fuel is still in its early stages domestically, corn and biofuel associations have made developing a market for it a top policy priority. 
Secchi, the Iowa professor, says it’s easy to see why ethanol producers are trying to expand their market: The growth in electric vehicles threatens long-term gasoline sales.
Researchers warn that producing enough ethanol-based jet fuel could trigger major land-use shifts. A 2024 World Resources Institute analysis found that meeting the federal goal of 35 billion gallons of ethanol jet fuel would require about 114 million acres of corn — roughly 20% more corn acreage than the U.S. already plants for all purposes. That surge in demand, the authors concluded, would push up food prices and worsen hunger.
Secchi calls that scenario a climate and land-use “disaster.” Large-scale use of ethanol-based aviation fuel, she said, would mean clearing even more land and pouring on even more nitrogen fertilizer, driving up greenhouse gas emissions. 
“The result,” she said, “would be essentially to enshrine this dysfunctional system that we created.”

The T will soon have enough equipment in place to roll out the first Green Line trolleys featuring on-board alerts about stalled vehicles or other obstacles on the tracks, more than 16 years after a fatal crash prompted federal regulators to recommend the system.  
A partial shutdown set to begin next week will allow the T to take another major step toward the “Green Line Train Protection System,” the first phase of which is now expected to be complete by next summer after a series of stops and starts. 
As one veteran official put it, the agency is “at a point where we can see the light at the end of the tunnel.” 
The technology relies on two primary features: equipment built into the cars and hundreds of “anchors” built alongside the tracks and platforms throughout the system. The anchors communicate with the on-board devices as trolleys move, allowing each vehicle to detect how close it is to others. 
In the first phase of implementation, Green Line operators will receive audible and visual alerts if the system detects a collision risk. The second phase, which is projected to be done in 2028, will add automatic speed control and braking. 
Crews will use the upcoming 15-day shutdown of the Green Line’s central trunk, primarily intended to replace the roughly 130-year-old wooden catenary wire trough, as an opportunity to finish installing anti-collision anchors underground. 
By the end of the year, T officials think they will have equipment in place for the Green Line Train Protection System from the endpoints at Union Square and Medford/Tufts through Kenmore Square, and also for the full D branch. Work to finish installation on the B, C, and E branches — the three other above-ground segments — will take place in the spring. 
The first trains using the new technology will roll out this winter, with full implementation set to be complete by the summer. 
“Each time the T introduces a trolley with the car-borne equipment between [December] and summer 2026, Green Line safety is enhanced more and more,” said MBTA spokesperson Joe Pesaturo. 
While the project moves ahead, the timeline has also been pushed back from prior public updates. 
In February, T officials said the first phase would be complete by December. A presentation MBTA general manager Phil Eng gave on November 20 slid that completion date back to mid-2026. 
Officials argue the MBTA is still ahead of schedule because the contract with equipment manufacturer Piper calls for the first phase to be done by March 2027, and that the earlier dates mentioned publicly instead represented Eng’s preference. 
“GM Eng challenged the GLTPS team and the contractor with an aggressive schedule to have Phase 1 fully implemented by the end of this year,” Pesaturo said. “While significant progress has been made, supply chain issues and design challenges made it difficult to meet the aggressive schedule.” 
The push for automated anti-collision technology on the Green Line traces back to Gov. Deval Patrick’s first term in office. 
In 2008, an operator on the Green Line’s D Branch ran through a red signal in Newton, crashing into the back of a stopped train. The operator, Ter’rese Edmonds, died and seven passengers were injured.  
The National Transportation Safety Board in 2009 said the incident could have been prevented if the MBTA, which already had anti-collision technology on most of its other rail lines, deployed a protection system on the Green Line. (That year, another Green Line crash injured dozens of passengers.) 
Little progress happened in the ensuing years. The T contracted with German firm BBR in 2019; five years later, after Eng took the helm as general manager, the agency scrapped the deal and reset the project. 
One of the recurring problems along the way has been the aged infrastructure on the Green Line, which officials say makes it difficult to slot in an off-the-shelf option for anti-collision technology. 
“The Green Line cars are not only old, but their body varies, even within the same model,” said Sam Zhou, the T’s chief engineer and assistant general manager. “What that means is it really creates design challenges for our team [and] made the integration work far more complex than it would be for a newer fleet.” 
In February, the MBTA’s board of directors approved a new $112 million contract with Piper. 
For some T employees, the fresh momentum carries special significance. 
Alicia Gomes, the MBTA’s executive director of light rail transportation, recalled starting her career at the agency as a light rail operator in 2007, one year before the fatal crash. 
The Green Line operator killed was a classmate of Gomes’s during training, and they came from similar backgrounds. Detailing her experience at a recent public meeting, Gomes said the incident left her questioning whether she wanted to continue to drive a trolley. 
“I experienced firsthand the 16-year-long wait without much movement on any sort of installation for Green Line Train Protection — lots of talk, but not much movement,” Gomes said. “Just in the last two years, with the current leadership and the administration, we have finally begun to see real, tangible progress, progress that many of us believe should have started more than 17 years ago, before the fatality.” 
“At this point,” she added, “we are finally at a point where we can see the light at the end of the tunnel.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/20231114_093105-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C664&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-03 07:57:00.434594

But it’s unclear whether the state Senate, which has given the plan a cold shoulder since it was first proposed almost two years ago, is any more favorably disposed toward it today than before.  
Boston continues to struggle with the aftereffects of the pandemic, which reshaped in-person work patterns and sent commercial property values falling as office vacancy rates rose. That has put added upward pressure on residential taxes in a housing market that continues to see home values rising.  
In letters to the city council and business leaders on Wednesday, Wu warned that residential property taxes are poised for a second double-digit year-over-year increase in a row, with officials projecting a 13 percent rise next year. For homeowners, the pressure of these continued hikes is “unsustainable,” Wu said.
The Boston City Council has three times voted to send a Wu-sponsored home rule petition to the State House that would let the city adjust its tax rates to relieve the burden on residential property owners by nudging up the tax rate paid by commercial property owners.  
But it has stalled on Beacon Hill as lawmakers say they are reluctant to burden already struggling commercial property owners with higher tax bills. A coalition of business leaders involved in shaping a more moderate version of the home rule’s language has also taken a step back. 
Commercial property owners in Boston are taxed at a higher rate than residential taxpayers, but Massachusetts communities are limited by state law to setting the commercial rate at no more than 175 percent of what the overall rate would be if all property were taxed at the same rate. 
Wu originally proposed boosting that to 200 percent and then gradually ratcheting it down over five years. But she reached a compromise last year with business leaders on a plan that would allow the commercial rate to go higher for three years, setting the maximum commercial rate at 181.5 percent for the first year, 180 percent the second year, and 178 percent the final year before returning to 175 percent in the fourth year. 
The measure also includes some additional tax relief for seniors and small businesses.  
With tax bills due to be sent out a few weeks from now, Wu said at a press briefing on Tuesday that getting the home rule passed is “an urgent matter.”  
The Legislature started its year-end break before Thanksgiving, however, and is not scheduled to return to formal sessions until January. 
Each year, the city assessing department updates the values of the city’s parcels and determines what the tax levy needs to be to support the city budget, roughly 70 percent of which is dependent on property tax revenue.   
In fall 2024, the picture looked grim for homeowners, with the Wu administration projecting that residents’ taxes could increase by 33 percent without state action allowing Boston to shift the burden. 
Business groups initially got behind the compromise proposal, which would have limited annual increases for residential property owners to 9 percent by increasing the tax burden of commercial property owners. 
Though the House signed off on the plan last year, the final expected residential property tax increase of 10.5 percent was far less than the worst-case scenario under Boston’s projections. The coalition of business leaders then got cold feet, and the home rule died without a vote in the Senate, where Sen. Nick Collins, of Boston, emerged as the measure’s most vocal opponent.   
Without naming Collins, the mayor on Tuesday noted the path to approval “was blocked by a single state senator.”  
According to the city assessing department, residential property values climbed 3 percent and commercial values dropped by 5 percent last year, which led to an actual 10.4 percent tax increase for the average single-family homeowner, or $575 year-over-year. For all residential property types – including multi-family homes and larger apartment buildings where the increased cost may get passed on to renters – Wu said, it was a 14.9 percent annual tax increase. 
This year, Boston assessing officials expect the trend to continue. Based on numbers that are “as close to final as they will be before the ultimate, final step” of Department of Revenue certification, Wu told reporters that 2025 residential valuations look like they will rise 2 percent and commercial valuations will drop by 6 percent.  
If the numbers hold, she said, the average single-family homeowner will now be facing a tax increase of 13 percent, or roughly $780, next year. By contrast, the average Class A office building will have a 4.4 percent decrease in its tax bill. 
Wu said Tuesday that she still finds the compromise number to be “too high and unsustainable year after year.” But that’s where the compromise with business leaders landed, she said, under the multi-year proposal. “Ultimately, not only were we at the 9 percent — we were beyond it,” she said of last year’s residential tax increase, “and this year, we are even further beyond it. So I continue to call for passage – immediate passage – of our home rule petition.” 
If the final certified numbers show a still-foundering commercial sector and booming residential market, Tamara Small, CEO NAIOP Massachusetts, which represents the commercial real estate industry, says it continues to be the wrong time to shift more of the tax burden on commercial owners.  
“We have been saying for quite some time that the commercial sector is very much struggling,” she told CommonWealth Beacon. “And if, as a result of this, we have seen reduced property valuations, NAIOP does not believe that the solution is to further punish a sector that is struggling by increasing its tax burden.” 
While urging quick action on the home rule, Wu did not point to any indication of a breakthrough that would have the Senate ready to get on board.  
Asked if Senate leadership has requested any stipulations to get the bill moving, and whether she has spoken recently with Collins, Wu said she or her team have reached out to members of the Boston delegation and Senate leadership but “have not received any specific requests of what needs to happen.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/20240109_200721-scaled-e1704861461383.jpg?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-03 07:57:00.434594

The company was one of three applicants with casinos in Las Vegas to win a recommendation Monday from the New York State Gaming Facility Location Board to be licensed in that state. 
The New York board’s selection report noted that Resorts World, asked to disclose disciplinary actions within the past five years, reported none brought against several Genting (Resorts World’s parent company) subsidiaries, “omitting violations resulting in fines at Resorts World Catskills, Resorts World Hudson Valley, and its current video lottery gaming facility at Aqueduct.” Resorts World, the report said, “disclosed a settled disciplinary action involving Genting Berhad – RW Las Vegas LLC without providing details.”
The New York board “views this lack of transparency as concerning and recommends that the Commission weigh this in its licensing evaluation.” 
The Nevada Current was first to report in 2023 that federal authorities from the Central District of California were investigating a variety of allegations involving Resorts World Las Vegas,  MGM Grand, and Scott Sibella, who served as president of both hotels. 
Resorts World terminated Sibella weeks after the story’s publication for violating internal policy. Sibella later pleaded guilty in federal court to failing to comply with anti-money laundering laws while president of MGM Grand. He later lost his Nevada gaming license. 
Resorts World LV agreed to a $10.5 million fine imposed by state gaming regulators for allowing illegal bookmakers Mathew Bowyer and Damien LeForbes to gamble at the casino. The two, who lost close to $24 million at Resorts World LV, were permitted to gamble despite the lack of documented sources of income required by casinos. Both pleaded guilty to money laundering and illegal bookmaking.  
Federal prosecutors have yet to file charges or impose a long-anticipated fine against Resorts World. 
Taxing matters
Resorts World is planning a $3.3 billion investment in the New York property, which is slated to have more than 2,000 rooms. 
Resorts World NY, along with Bally’s and Hard Rock, the other applicants recommended for New York gaming licenses, would pay a much higher gaming tax in the Empire State than in Nevada, where unrestricted licensees are assessed a maximum gross gaming tax of 6.75% on casinos with  monthly revenue that exceeds $134,000.  
The New York State Gaming Commission determines the tax rate each applicant would pay, according to the state’s selection process. 
“An applicant may propose a tax rate on gross gaming revenue as part of its application, so long as the tax rate is at least 25% for slot gross gaming revenue and 10% for gross gaming revenue from all other sources,” says the state website.
Resorts World, in supplemental information provided to regulators, proposed a 56% tax on slot machines and a 30% tax on table games and other sources of gambling, far more than the 6.75% tax Nevada casinos pay. The company is also offering to contribute $25 million a year to a workforce housing fund. 
The other two companies recommended by regulators, Bally’s and Hard Rock, which have casinos in Las Vegas, also proposed paying higher taxes than they are assessed in Nevada. 
Bally’s suggested a 30% tax on slot machine games and 10% on table games and other gambling, while Hard Rock Metropolitan Park proposed a 25% tax on slot machine games and 10% on table games and other sources. 
“Assuming licensing at each Applicants’ proposed tax rates and stability in the existing gaming facility landscape, incremental gaming tax revenue is projected to reach approximately $1 billion annually by 2036, totaling approximately $7 billion in incremental tax revenue from 2027 to 2036, plus $1.5 billion in licensing fees,” says the Gaming Facility Location Board’s selection report.  
Gaming tax revenues in Nevada totaled $1.1 billion in fiscal 2024.
The willingness of gaming casino companies to pay significantly higher taxes in New York raises longstanding concerns about Nevada’s lowest-in-the-nation gaming tax.
Industry advocates have long argued that limited competition in other jurisdictions, where states often establish the number of licenses that may be granted, justifies the higher tax rates. Nevada, however, has no cap on the number of gaming licenses issued by the state, rendering licensees subject to widespread competition.  
But does the argument hold water now that nearly all adults hold a virtual casino in the palm of their hand?  
Former California gambling regulator Richard Schuetz notes electronic gambling and brick-and-mortar casinos “are not the same product. Sports betting really dominates phones. And going to Caesars for three days is different from sitting in your backyard playing slots or blackjack.” 
The competition argument remains valid today, says Alan Feldman, a former MGM executive who now serves as Director of Strategic Initiatives for UNLV’s International Gaming Institute.  
States with “monopoly systems” such as tribal exclusivity, limited licenses, or even a single operator, “can impose higher tax rates, because operators can still be profitable with no competition,” he says, while competitive markets “often use lower rates to attract multiple operators.” 
Feldman cites sports betting as an example, “as states with limited licenses often charge higher rates,” such as New York’s 51% tax rate.
“As gaming is regulated on a state-by-state basis, the competitive landscape is incredibly significant in determining a tax rate that’s reasonable,” says Feldman. 
Factors to be considered, he says, include: 

states have different fiscal needs: Some states rely on casinos as economic drivers, others as revenue sources;
tourism markets differ;
labor costs vary; and,
political attitudes toward gambling differ.

“If you look at the higher tax rate states, they are all likely to have a lower level of investment in the properties they attract,” Feldman says. “New York believes it’s different and can both charge a high tax and expect significant investment.”
MGM Resorts, he adds, pulled out of the New York competition “because they don’t believe the market can sustain both. They likely have a point as the winners are all located in fairly close proximity to one another.”  
MGM owns the Empire Casino in Yonkers “and will continue to operate without needing to invest $10+ billion,” Feldman noted. 
“The fact remains that no state can match the level of economic impact as Nevada when it comes to investment, jobs or per-capita taxes generated,” he said.
The gaming tax rate is the sacred cow of Nevada tax policy. Increasing the rate is a bridge too far for almost all Nevada politicians and most business interests.
Rebecca Dutro, president of the Nevada Taxpayers Association, says she’s unaware of the organization’s position on the gaming tax.
Former State Sen. Joe Neal, a Democrat, spearheaded two ballot initiatives in the early 2000s that would have increased the gaming tax rate from 6.25% to 11.25% on casinos with monthly revenue exceeding $1 million. Neither garnered the signatures to qualify for the ballot. 
Neal also sponsored several bills to increase the tax rate, however, they were killed in committee.
A 2022 ballot initiative sponsored by the Clark County Education Association would have increased the gaming tax rate to 9.75% on monthly revenue that exceeds $250,000. While the measure garnered enough support to qualify for the ballot, the Nevada Resort Association filed a legal challenge, and a judge eventually ordered that the measure be removed from the ballot.
Former Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, who currently serves as president of the University of Nevada Reno and as chairman of the Resorts World board of directors, declined to say via his UNR office whether the willingness of Resorts World and other casinos companies to swallow a double digit tax rate in New York is an indication the gaming tax in Nevada could be tweaked to the benefit of residents and public institutions such as UNR. A spokesman directed the Current to Resorts World, which did not respond. 
Sandoval’s fellow Republican, Gov. Joe Lombardo, also did not respond.   
Washoe County Commission Chairwoman Alexis Hill, a Democrat who hopes to run against Lombardo next year, wants an overhaul of the state’s tax system, which she says needs to be modernized. A hike in the gaming tax, she says, is not off the table.
“It needs to be broad based and equitably distributed, which it is not right now,” Hill said Tuesday. “We tax poor people disproportionately more because of our very high sales tax. We need to bring all industries to this table. That’s what a governor would do if we were looking at these major reforms, and that’s what I promise as part of my campaign.”

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The board overseeing health insurance for public education employees plans to seek additional funding from the Legislature to keep premiums down, but an Alabama lawmaker says the board will need to help. 
The Public Education Employee Health Insurance Plan (PEEHIP) Board plans to ask for a $380 million increase from the state for the 2027 fiscal year, which begins next October. It got a $129 million increase for fiscal year 2026, a budget in which education employees did not get an across-the-board cost-of-living raise.  
Neah Scott, legislative counsel for PEEHIP, said at the board’s meeting Tuesday morning that there is no guarantee the Legislature will approve the additional funding.

“I think it’s going to be a little bit longer before they’ve decided how to address the PEEHIP funding problem,” Scott said. “There’s still a lot of work to be done, both in the governor’s office and her budget and on the legislative side, what they’re going to, what direction they’re going to go.”
Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, chair of the Senate Finance and Taxation Education Committee, which oversees the Education Trust Fund (ETF) budget, said in an interview Tuesday he talked with the board last week about the request. 
“They are going to have to seriously help us, for us to be able to meet our overall obligations,” Orr said.
A message seeking comment from Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, chair of the House Ways and Means Education Committee, which also oversees the ETF, was left Tuesday. 
Scott told the board to be prepared to withdraw funds from the Retiree Trust Fund. Investment revenue is the sole source of funding for the trust and withdrawals are limited to 10% of its prior-year market value. As of September, the trust held $2.6 billion, according to Diane Scott, chief financial officer for PEEHIP.
“We’ve only taken out monies twice. In 2015 we took out $92 million, in 2016 we took out $32 million,” the CFO said. “Here we are in 2026, 10 years later, and we’re looking at taking out $118.9 million.”
The ETF has far fewer burdens than the General Fund, which will see increased requests from the Department of Human Resources and the Department of Public Health due to federal cuts. 
Orr said there are multiple priorities for the ETF, which funds PEEHIP and public education in the state. The PEEHIP increase, he said, is the newest and most expensive topic, but he also wants to include pay raises for teachers and a bonus for retired public educators. 
“Inflation is clicking along, and it’s better than it was, but it’s still present, and we don’t want them to fall behind,” Orr said.
David Bronner, CEO of the Retirement System of Alabama, said the Legislature is facing a higher demand for funding than it has in years. 
“The one that always bothers me is the projections for the next couple of years is $100 to $150 million more a year. That’s an attention getter,” Bronner said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_1223-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-03 07:57:00.434594

Respecting the process requires acknowledging when we got it wrong. Anything less fails to honor the people whose land we are discussing.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rep. Troy Headrick: In response to the recent opinion piece, ‘Respect the process, honor the people’.","This commentary is by Rep. Troy Headrick, I-Burlington, sponsor of H.362, a bill relating to State recognition of Native American tribes and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
In response to the piece “Respect the process, honor the people” —



The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples is not an optional or peripheral document. It is the global consensus on how governments must engage with Indigenous peoples when decisions involve their lands, histories, or cultures. Several articles are especially relevant here.
Article 19 requires states to “consult and cooperate in good faith with the indigenous peoples concerned through their own representative institutions in order to obtain their free, prior and informed consent before adopting and implementing legislative or administrative measures that may affect them.”

READ MORE

Article 14 states that “Indigenous peoples have the right to establish and control their educational systems and institutions providing education in their own languages,” and it requires states to work with Indigenous peoples to ensure access to education in their own culture and language.Article 31 affirms the right of Indigenous peoples to “maintain, control, protect and develop their cultural heritage, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions.”
Taken together, these articles form a clear message. When a government addresses topics related to Indigenous culture, heritage, identity or history, that government must involve the actual Indigenous peoples whose heritage is being discussed. Anything short of that fails to meet the standard set by UNDRIP.
In the recent commentary titled “Respect the process, honor the people,” the author claims that Vermont’s state recognition process was inclusive and rooted in meaningful engagement. When this claim is measured against the standards in UNDRIP, it does not hold. The state of Vermont got it wrong when we developed the state recognition process.
Consultation without consent is not free, prior and informed consent. If the process did not include the Abenaki First Nations at Odanak and Wôlinak as full decision-makers, it did not meet the required standard. A legislative process that occurs within an overwhelmingly white decision-making body cannot substitute for the authority of the Indigenous nations whose history and identity are being legislated.
There is also no distinction between “Canadian Abenaki” and “Vermont Abenaki.” There is only Abenaki. The border that separates Vermont from Quebec was drawn long after the original caretakers of this land lived, traveled, governed and survived here. Their displacement into the northernmost portions of their territory happened before either Canada or the United States existed.
To use a colonial border to exclude the rightful nations from consultation today is another continuation of the same colonial pattern. Article 36 of UNDRIP confronts this practice directly by affirming the rights of Indigenous nations to work across borders that were imposed on them.
The commentary also describes the state recognition process as respectful and inclusive. That claim is impossible to reconcile with what actually happened. Decisions were made by a legislature that was almost entirely white.
The self-identified communities in Vermont that claim Abenaki identity were given institutional advantages, while the recognized Abenaki nations of Odanak and Wôlinak were not given the authority or even the meaningful inclusion required under UNDRIP. Those advantages now persist with significant conflicts of interest that determine continued indigenous status through the Vermont Commission on Native American Affairs.
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, as it is currently constructed, reinforces these processes without confronting the actual truth of the matter. We will not have honest reconciliation without reckoning with this truth. The result is a continuation of a process that appeared inclusive in form yet excluded the very nations whose voices should have carried the greatest weight. That is not inclusion.
Recognition laws and educational curricula are not neutral acts. They shape how future generations understand the history of this place and the people who have lived here for thousands of years. UNDRIP makes it clear that Indigenous nations have the right to control their own cultural heritage and historical narratives. Vermont has an obligation to meet that standard when creating legislation, developing curriculum, designing public programming, or taking any action that relies on Indigenous knowledge.
If we want to respect the process, we must begin with a process that honors Indigenous rights.  The historical and archeological record is clear and undisputed on the history of the original caretakers of the land we now call Vermont.
Respecting the process requires centering the Abenaki First Nations at Odanak and Wôlinak, respecting their authority, and aligning Vermont’s practices with the obligations set out in international law.
Respecting the process requires acknowledging when we got it wrong. Anything less fails to honor the people whose land we are discussing.

Oct. 27, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceAs tax incentives have marked Michigan open for business on data centers, an influx of proposals has drawn frustration and concern from residents across the state as landowners and local officials seek to bring these resource intensive facilities to their community. 
While proponents of these facilities – which house servers, storage devices and other pieces of online infrastructure – point to the role data centers play in the development of technologies like artificial intelligence and the potential economic boons that could come with them, environmental advocates and nearby residents are pointing to the burden the projects could put on their communities. 
Chief among the concerns with the projects making their way to the state is the large amount of energy needed to power these facilities, with an analysis from Bloomberg News finding a 267% increase in energy prices in communities located near data centers.

The facilities can also demand large amounts of water in order to cool the computer servers housed within, with some U.S. communities reporting issues accessing water after data centers began operating nearby. There are also concerns about pollution, as the water can be treated with chemicals to prevent corrosion or bacterial growth, making it unsuitable for human consumption or agricultural use.
Even for facilities that do not treat their water with chemicals, returning heated water into nearby bodies of water after it is used for cooling creates concerns for local ecosystems, Molly Kleinman, the managing director for the science, technology and public policy program at the University of Michigan’s Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy, told Michigan Advance. 
Some data centers utilize a closed-loop system, Kleinman said, which uses less water and does not return the water to the source. However, she said those facilities tend to use more energy.
Although water and energy are receiving the most attention, Kleinman said there are also concerns about light pollution and noise pollution from fans and generators at the facilities. 










Are the products that they’re running – the sort of generative AI general use kinds of tools like ChatGPT – are those serving a purpose in society? Those start to become big questions, but when you think about the trade offs, I think they’re worth asking.

Air pollution is also an issue, with some facilities running diesel generators around the clock to ensure they have enough power, Kleinman said, noting this is often a concern in communities that are already facing environmental injustices.
Breanne Green, a community organizer with Livingston County Residents for Responsible Development, which opposes the development of a data center in Howell Township, said she first started reading about data centers while researching climbing energy rates.
“That’s when I really started to understand about the more ethical implications of using AI and how much water it uses,” Green said. 
While water and energy use are prime among her concerns, Green is also wary of the financial risks that come with bringing what is billed as a $9 billion investment into their small community. 
“We don’t know what happens when the AI bubble bursts. I know what it’s like to live in a community where one corporation supplies all of the income and then they go out of business. It’s devastating for a community, and I do not want that to happen here,” said Green, who grew up just outside of Flint as the child of two General Motors employees.

How are data centers regulated
When looking at the state’s current regulations on data centers, Katie Duckworth, a senior associate attorney at the Environmental Law and Policy Center pointed to requests from Michigan’s largest energy providers on how to handle the large energy demands stemming from these facilities. 
In the case of Consumers Energy, the state’s energy regulators approved the company’s request to modify its rate structure for energy intensive facilities like data centers to ensure these large energy-load customers do not shift their costs onto other ratepayers. 
However, DTE Energy took a different approach, asking the Michigan Public Service Commission to approve contracts to supply power to an Open AI data center planned in Saline Township. 
While the Commission’s order in the Consumers Energy case prioritized protections for other customers and emphasized that other residents and businesses should not have to shoulder the costs of providing power to data centers, Duckworth emphasized that this order only applies to Consumers Energy customers.
Ahead of a public hearing on the Michigan Public Service Commission’s long-term plan for energy reliability and affordability held in late October, the chair of the commission, Dan Scripps, told reporters that consumer concerns about data centers would likely be addressed on a utility by utility basis.

Although DTE has repeatedly asserted that the Saline Township project will not raise rates for customers, its argument that Michigan law bars them from shifting costs onto other ratepayers hinges on a technicality. 
Under the laws creating the sales and use tax exemption for data centers, facilities looking to receive the tax break are barred from accepting an energy rate that would require residential customers to subsidize the cost of providing energy to the facility.
But Duckworth said the devil is in the details. 
“That’s not necessarily the same as saying that DTE is not allowed to ever serve a customer in a way that is being subsidized by their ratepayers,” Duckworth said.
While the public service commission is taking the lead on regulating energy use from data centers, Duckworth said there’s a gap at the state level when it comes to regulating the water these facilities use for cooling.
Because these decisions are made at the local level, there’s less transparency and scrutiny around how much water these facilities are consuming, Duckworth said.
“One of the things that I think would be really valuable in any legislation, would be a lot of required transparency around environmental and other impacts,” Kleinman said.
How does this impact Michigan’s energy goals?
Alongside concerns on how large-scale data centers will impact Michigan residents in the present, several environmental organizations and energy consumer advocacy groups have warned that these facilities could also pose a threat to Michigan’s goal of requiring energy providers to meet a 100% clean energy standard by 2040. 
The issue extends beyond Michigan, as energy demand from data centers within the U.S. outpaces growth from renewable energy. As a result, energy companies are keeping fossil fuel plants online longer than expected and reopening shuttered plants to ensure data centers have enough power, Kleinman said, which will continue to contribute to climate change.
During a roundtable discussing concerns with DTE’s proposed contracts for the Saline Township data center, Charlotte Jameson, the chief policy officer for the Michigan Environmental Council, explained that while the state must rely on renewable energy sources like wind and solar to meet its goals, utilities often rush to build natural gas plants when significant new energy demand is added to the grid.

While natural gas plants are included in the state’s legal definition of clean energy systems, they must utilize 90% effective carbon capture and storage technology. However, the Institute for Energy Economic and Financial Analysis has questioned the effectiveness of the technology,  and warned that it could increase carbon dioxide emissions.
Additionally, a policy brief from U of M’s Ford School created in partnership with the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition warns that data centers have derailed energy goals in other states.
There are ways to ensure that increased energy demand from data centers does not jeopardize the state’s energy goals, Duckworth said, but it will take scrutiny from the Michigan Public Service Commission.

Michael Craig, an associate professor in the University of Michigan’s School for Environment and Sustainability and the Department of Industrial and Operations Engineering, said extending the lifespan of fossil fuel plants and building new ones is ultimately a coordination, time scale and willingness problem.
“There’s no physical reason, no engineering reason, why a data center is any different than more homes being built in Michigan, right?” Craig said. “We would not be having this conversation if people were gradually moving into Michigan and increasing our demand over time. That demand is no different than the demand at the data center, really, from the state perspective, except the size of the data center demand is way larger, and it’s concentrated in one place.”
There are many options on how utilities can help meet the demand from these facilities, including renewables, Craig said. Data centers could also supply their own renewable energy generation alongside their facility, addressing the increase for demand, Craig said. 
“It takes time to build power plants, so if you don’t build them before you bring that data center online, the energy has to come from somewhere,” Craig said. “So you need a certain long term perspective, so that when you want a data center to come online, you have the energy from renewables available coming online to provide it.”

However, when it comes to meeting the state’s clean energy standard, data centers are not a fundamental game changer at the moment, Craig said.
“There was already lots of load growth that people were aware of. These data centers are another source.” Craig said. “The estimates are so wide nobody knows how much demand growth is actually going to happen from data centers as a whole.”
As more energy demand is placed on the system, more renewables will be needed, and the more clean energy buildout there is, the more difficult it could be to build more, Craig said, noting potential issues with community pushback and energy transmission. However, that doesn’t mean the state needs to scrap its policy and try something new. 
“You’re still going to have to work with communities, still deal with resistance and find solutions that work for everybody, still deal with transmission congestion, still deal with scaling up the technology,” Craig said. “All these things are going to happen one way or the other.”
How can Michigan mitigate potential harm
When looking at concerns around data centers, Kleinman noted that these facilities are not new, and that at a smaller scale, they can operate without creating major disruptions. 
Part of the new problem stems from how large these facilities can be, and how energy hungry the computers can be, Kleinman said. In turn, she believes part of the answer is to ask whether the large scale of data center projects is necessary. 
“Are the products that they’re running – the sort of generative AI general use kinds of tools like ChatGPT – are those serving a purpose in society?” Kleinman said. “Those start to become big questions, but when you think about the trade offs, I think they’re worth asking.”
Molly Kleinman, managing director for the science, technology and public policy program at the University of Michigan’s Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy. | University of Michigan Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy
As far as how these facilities can minimize their impact, Kleinman pointed to requirements for data centers to supply their own energy from renewable sources.
In order to receive the tax break in Michigan, data centers must source 90% of its expected annual energy usage from clean energy sources through either on-site generation; a long-term contract with the electric utility, energy cooperative, or municipal utility serving the geographic area where the facility is located; or participating in a voluntary green energy pricing program. 
Another piece would be ensuring the cost of supplying energy to these facilities are not placed on ratepayers, Kleinman said, pointing to the Ford School policy brief, which offers additional recommendations including mandating energy audits, performance standards, renewable energy use and public reporting requirements to ensure a sustainable model for data center growth.
Duckworth said the Environmental Law and Policy Center would also like to see the state take a more proactive approach to clean and renewable energy as data centers come online.
“With the correct incentives and planning and requirements, it’s possible for data centers to be developed in the state while minimizing the environmental impacts and not jeopardizing Michigan’s clean energy goals.” Duckworth said. “But that will just require ensuring that the data centers are paying the full cost of their power needs, and that they’re being powered by the right mix of clean and renewable energy.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6816-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-03 07:57:00.434594

Statewide, a little more than 2 million people cast ballots, a turnout of 39% of Washington’s registered voters, according to statewide figures. Five counties — Columbia, Garfield, Jefferson, San Juan and Wahkiakum — exceeded 50% participation.
In the most high-profile and expensive legislative contest, Democratic state Sen. Deb Krishnadasan beat Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier in the 26th District that spans parts of Pierce and Kitsap counties.
Nearly $4 million was spent in the race, viewed as Republicans’ best opportunity to gain a seat in the Senate, where Democrats hold a 30-19 advantage. 
A duel between two Democratic candidates in the 33rd District incited the most intrigue as Rep. Edwin Obras defeated Kevin Schilling after trailing on election night. Obras edged in front of Schilling, who is mayor of Burien, on the third day of ballot counting and wound up winning the south King County district by nearly 6%.

(Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Three years to the day after a preliminary injunction first paused parts of Indiana’s near-total abortion ban for a limited group of Hoosiers with religious objections, a Marion County court heard final arguments Tuesday over whether the law violates the state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act.
Superior Court Judge Christina Klineman presided over the summary judgement hearing on Tuesday in Indianapolis but her ruling is still at least two months away.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana represented the plaintiff class, while the Indiana Attorney General’s Office defended the state’s medical licensing board and other defendants.
The underlying lawsuit, filed in September 2022, claims that Indian’s abortion ban imposes a substantial burden on the religious practice of a particular group of plaintiffs whose faiths permit or even require abortion under circumstances broader than those allowed by the statute.
The abortion law, which was enacted in a special 2022 session, only allows for exceptions in the case of a mother’s health, rape or incest, or a fatal fetal anomaly — though each with varying time limits.
Indiana Court of Appeals affirms RFRA-based abortion ban challenge

The ACLU asked the court to convert a preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction protecting the remaining individual plaintiffs — currently two anonymous women of different faiths — and the certified class, Hoosier Jews for Choice, ensuring that the state cannot enforce the abortion ban against them in ways that conflict with their sincerely held religious beliefs.
“There is a direct conflict between the state’s law and plaintiffs’ religious beliefs,” said attorney Stevie Pactor. “The law forces them to carry pregnancies that their faith teaches could be terminated.”
The state, meanwhile, argued that the plaintiffs have not shown any concrete example of an individual attempting to obtain an abortion for religious reasons and being denied under the law.
The existing preliminary injunction — issued Dec. 2, 2022 — applies only to the plaintiff class and prevents the state from enforcing the ban against those individuals in ways that conflict with their religious beliefs. 
It does not block the abortion law statewide, however, and it also does not require providers to perform abortions.
The attorney general’s office also noted that no one has come forward during the last three years to obtain an abortion for religious purposes under the injunction, and even if they had, doctors would not have been permitted to perform one because they are not covered by the injunction.
“Despite three years of litigation, the plaintiffs have not identified a single instance under (the abortion ban) which one of them — or the thousands of class members they sai Solicitor General James Barta, representing the defendants. “They haven’t even identified the precise circumstances under which that might occur.”
‘Forced’ to act against faith
Central to the ACLU’s argument is that Indiana’s abortion statute violates RFRA by banning abortions even in cases when their clients’ sincerely held religious beliefs require them.
In written filings, ACLU lawyers stressed that the law imposes criminal penalties and medical risks on those acting according to their faith, and that the state has not demonstrated the ban is the least restrictive means of pursuing any compelling interest.
Pactor emphasized that the law imposes an “exceedingly straightforward” burden on the religious rights of the women and organizations represented in the case.

“The individual plaintiffs are unnamed women of multiple faiths whose beliefs require them to obtain abortions in situations not allowed by the virtual ban on abortions,” Pactor noted.
She said that has forced many to “change their behavior to avoid pregnancies that they will not be able to terminate, even when compelled to do so by their religious beliefs.”
Pactor emphasized, too, that both the trial court and the Indiana Court of Appeals have already recognized abortion as a protected religious exercise under RFRA.
“The state must show that the ban meets the most stringent form of legal analysis — strict scrutiny — to survive,” she said.
The state has argued a compelling interest in enforcing the ban — “protecting the unborn” — and that the ban is the last restrictive way to further that interest. But the appeals court agreed with the trial court in 2024 that the state hadn’t successfully established either.
“While the Court of Appeals certainly recognized that the government has a permissible interest in protecting prenatal life, it explicitly rejected that this interest was compelling as to the plaintiffs in this case under RFRA,” Pactor said.
“The state simply cannot, and has not, adequately explained this differential treatment,” she continued, referring to the law’s secular exceptions “that allow abortions in certain cases but deny religious exemptions.”
The ACLU has maintained that refusing religious exceptions, while allowing secular ones, is unconstitutional discrimination. 
“The state simply cannot meet its burden under strict scrutiny to justify offering some exemptions for non-religious reasons, and refusing to offer the same exemption for those whose religions require them,” Pactor told the court.
AG holds the law is ‘neutral’
But Barta argued that the abortion ban is a “neutral” law that applies equally to all Hoosiers and does not single out religious beliefs.
“RFRA does not allow individuals to opt out of neutral, generally applicable laws,” Barta said. “Nothing in the statute gives plaintiffs a religious veto over a law that applies to everyone.”

He further insisted that the state’s interest in protecting prenatal life is “no less compelling than other interests courts have found compelling, such as protecting bald eagles, ensuring the payment of taxes, or protecting other symbols of the nation.”
Barta said the exceptions baked into the abortion ban are not meant to privilege or target religious versus non-religious reasons. He additionally held that those exceptions are not “gaping holes,” either.
He referenced statewide data showing that abortions have “fallen dramatically” from about 2,300 in the first quarter of 2022 to only 28 in the first quarter of 2025.
Barta said that sharp drop demonstrates that the exceptions are narrowly tailored and not undermining the state’s overarching goal of protecting prenatal life. Thus, he argued, the existence of those exceptions does not mean the law lacks a compelling interest or is not the least restrictive means of achieving that interest.
“The plaintiffs’ response to this has been to say that the state can’t make ‘secular exceptions’ while denying religious exceptions. But that’s not what the state has done,” Barta said. “These exceptions do not say people of religious faith, or people who have no religious faith, get abortions, while the others do not. The exceptions are equally open to all.”
Judge to weigh arguments
Later in the hearing, Klineman pressed both parties on how RFRA’s substantial burden test should apply, which requires courts to determine whether the law places a meaningful constraint on religious exercise, not just a theoretical one.
“If the law forces someone to act contrary to their religious beliefs at risk of criminal prosecution, why isn’t that a substantial burden?” she asked.
Barta responded that the statute itself provides all the mechanisms for enforcement and inquiry and that the plaintiffs can’t outsource those duties to private parties, such as physicians.
The judge also questioned the ACLU on the limits of relief, asking how the court could administer exemptions “without effectively creating individualized abortion standards.”
Pactor replied that the injunction is narrowly tailored to the plaintiffs and the certified class, ensuring their religious exercise is protected without requiring courts to rewrite the statute or impose obligations on other Hoosiers.
Klineman set a Jan. 30 deadline for both sides to submit short proposed orders to her before she issues a ruling.

(Getty Images)This past June and July, my family’s electricity bill jumped by more than 30% compared to last year. I know we’re not alone. Hoosiers everywhere are seeing higher electric bills — and unless we change course, they’ll keep climbing. Cost pressures are pushing from multiple places.
For decades, Indiana saw little growth in electricity demand, and investment in utilities stagnated. The result is a grid that hasn’t kept pace with our needs. Meanwhile, severe storms are hitting more often, and hotter summers mean higher demand for cooling. Utilities will need to spend more just to maintain reliability, let alone improve it.
On top of that, new gas pipeline proposals and rapid price inflation for natural gas turbines, the machines that turn gas into electricity, are raising costs. For example, GridLab reports that the price of a new combined-cycle gas turbine has nearly doubled to $2,000 per kilowatt. That expense will land on someone’s bill.
Indiana energy secretary blasts local moratoriums, calls energy development ‘patriotic’ task

But the biggest pressure of all comes from the explosive growth of artificial intelligence and the data centers needed to run it. By 2035, AI-driven data centers are expected to add the electricity demand equivalent or greater than building a second Indianapolis, a second Fort Wayne, a second Gary, and a second Evansville combined.
Take the planned data center campus in New Carlisle for example. It alone is projected to use 2.2 gigawatts of power — almost 10% of Indiana’s entire current electricity demand. 
Lawmakers and economic-development officials see data centers as a fast track to economic growth. But in this race to attract them, we’re ignoring an essential truth: in every race, there are winners and losers.
Even Wall Street is voicing concern as many analysts are warning of a looming data center bubble. According to The Center for Public Enterprise’s Bubble or Nothing report, some major developers are building data centers using circular financing — borrowing from one another while depending on one another’s cash flows — and betting that AI profits will justify these risky financial relationships. But as we learned when the dot-com bubble, even transformational technologies aren’t always profitable and can collapse under unsustainable economics.
So let’s imagine what would happen if AI profits don’t materialize as hoped, data center companies will falter, and operators shut down. The massive, custom-built electric and water infrastructure serving them, paid for in part by ratepayers, becomes underused or abandoned. Those costs don’t disappear; they shift to households and businesses.
And the power plants built to serve these centers, especially large gas plants, could become stranded assets, leaving Hoosiers to pay for billions in infrastructure that no longer has customers. Meanwhile, communities that approved these projects would be left with empty shells of data centers designed for a single purpose and unusable for anything else.
Where to go from here
While this picture is bleak, it is also avoidable. Indiana has the opportunity to benefit from economic growth related to AI, strengthen our grid, and improve our utility cost structure. How?
First, Indiana should repeal the data-center sales-tax exemption. Adopted in 2019, it was crafted for modest data centers, not today’s behemoths. Right now, the state forgoes about $5 million each year in electricity sales tax for just one 100-megawatt facility. Scale that to 5 gigawatts of projected data-center growth, and Indiana could lose $250 million annually in revenue. Restoring this tax would cool speculative development and provide a stable new funding stream for our state.
Second, we must require large data centers to operate flexibly. Our grid is built around meeting peak demand — the most extreme hours of usage each year. If data centers run full-tilt during those peak moments, they could trigger billions in new spending on generation and transmission. But if they reduce demand during key hours, Indiana can avoid new peaks altogether.
And flexibility isn’t only for giant companies. The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission is writing new rules for distributed energy resources — everything from smart thermostats to batteries to EV chargers. These resources can shift demand, cut bills, and relieve stress on the grid. When deployed at scale, they help integrate more affordable clean energy, reduce costs for everyone, and reduce harmful environmental impacts that come with new fossil fuel generation.
Third, data-center developers must be transparent with the communities they hope to join. Local governments should require enforceable commitments before granting zoning approvals. That includes long-term power-purchase commitments that shield other ratepayers from unforeseen challenges; developer-funded infrastructure upgrades; cleaner backup-power options rather than fleets of diesel generators; and strong protections for local water resources, including avoiding groundwater withdrawals for cooling.

These expectations are reasonable, practical, and essential to safeguarding communities.
Hoosiers deserve honest conversations about the risks and rewards of data-center expansion. Utilities, local officials, and state leaders must fully understand what’s at stake — not just for economic development, but for affordability, reliability, and environmental stewardship.
Electricity prices are rising from every direction. If Indiana rushes headlong into unchecked data-center development, we risk burdening families and businesses with higher bills, strained infrastructure, and stranded assets. The tech giants sprinting to build these facilities understand that not everyone will win this race.
Indiana shouldn’t sprint blindly alongside them. Instead, we must chart our own course — one that protects ratepayers, strengthens our grid, and safeguards our natural resources.
Hoosiers value responsibility, fairness, and foresight. Now is the time to apply those values to the energy decisions that will shape Indiana for generations.

Both came from religious families. Lee’s father was a pastor and Herrington’s grandfather the founder of a church in Grenada. 
Both were hard workers. Lee was known for organizing supply drives, and Herrington operated his own moving company. He would later use the company’s box truck to transport Lee’s body to a rural dumping ground near his parent’s home. 
Both were young Black men who had just graduated from the University of Mississippi. Some of Lee’s final Instagram posts before he went missing on July 8, 2022, were of photos taken at his graduation; same for Herrington weeks before his arrest.
But there was a crucial difference between the two men, said Braylyn Johnson, a friend of Lee’s who also knew Herrington from college: Before the murder, Lee lived authentically and proudly as a gay man and Herrington did not.

“Jay Lee and Tim were identical in their education, their achievements, their family, their church life,” she said “They were a lot alike. … Jay Lee trusted Tim. He saw something in Tim. I’m not sure what it was, but he trusted him.” 
Herrington first went to trial for Lee’s murder in 2024, before detectives had located Lee’s remains. During that first trial, the state’s theory of the case was that Herrington killed Lee to preserve the secret of their sexual relationship. Lee had gone to Herrington’s apartment the night before he went missing, and they’d had a fight, prosecutors alleged. 
Only one living person knows exactly what happened in the apartment that night – Herrington. He pleaded guilty Monday to second-degree murder and tampering with evidence.

Aafram Sellers, a Jackson-area defense attorney who became counsel for Herrington after the first trial, said he had spoken with Herrington about taking responsibility and grieving the life that he, at 25 years old, might’ve otherwise had. 
Gwen Agho, a Hinds County prosecutor brought onto the case by Lafayette County District Attorney Ben Creekmore, also wanted people to know that Lee lived his life openly and Herrington did not. 
“What’s done in the darkness will always come to light,” she said. “All of this happened to cover something up and everyone found out anyway.” 
Indeed, Oxford Police Chief Jeff McCutchen said one of the Carroll County deputies who found Lee’s remains earlier this year told him that it was as if the sun shined down on a gold nameplate necklace bearing Lee’s name – the first sign they had finally found him years after he went missing. 
“They were just digging and looking and a piece led to a piece led to a piece,” he said. “They didn’t stop.”

At a press conference after the sentencing, McCutchen said his force spared no resources and didn’t stop looking for Lee until officers found him. 
“This case highlights everything special about policing, and each one of you should feel like a hero today,” he said. 
Lee’s mother Stephanie Lee cried as she thanked the Oxford Police Department and the prosecutors for their work securing justice in the case and finding her son. She said McCutchen told her this was not an ordinary case for him. 
“OPD has been faithful from day one,” she said. 
A queer, young Black man, Lee falls into a demographic of people whom, when they become victims of violence, police have long been scrutinized for disregarding. 
But McCutchen said his force treated the case as if Lee was their own missing child. He choked up while recalling the moment when, one month into the search for Lee, a detective’s wife asked if he would take a break to get dinner. 
“The detective responded, ‘If that was our kid missing, would you want that detective to take a break and be with his family, or spend every moment trying to find our child?’” McCutchen said. “To which that wife responded, ‘Don’t you come home until you find him.’”

McCutchen said the police fought for Lee’s phone records, they scoured for security camera footage across Lafayette and Grenada counties, and they worked with state and federal law enforcement to scope out Herrington’s cellphone – then searched every possible place they believed he might have dug a grave. 
“This was not just another homicide,” he said. “This case became our life.” 
But all the technology in the world did not find Lee. During Herrington’s first trial, the absence of a body proved a hiccup in the case, and was partly to blame for the hung jury, a TV news outlet reported.
Instead, detectives found Lee’s remains by chance in rural Carroll County, after a property owner whose land is used as a dumping ground reported he’d found a skull wrapped in duct tape and a blanket. 
“You cannot in a hundred years convince me otherwise that God did not have a hand in Carroll County when that property owner called the Carroll County Sheriff’s Department and said, ‘I think I have human remains,’” Creekmore said. 
For as much effort as McCutchen says his force expended, the Oxford police faced community pressure, too: From a small but mighty group of Lee’s friends who used social media to organize a movement in Oxford called Justice for Jay Lee. 
Its members have come and gone from the transient college town, but two of Lee’s close friends powering the group saw the case to its end – Johnson and Jose Reyes, who performed drag alongside Lee as a fellow member of Oxford’s LGBTQ+ community.

“We’ve watched people transition these past three years, we’ve watched queer couples meet each other in Justice for Jay Lee and get married and graduate,” Johnson said. 
Johnson and Reyes kept the town’s and the media’s attention on their friend through colorful Instagram posts displaying a count of the days Lee had been missing. Their advocacy for Lee pushed the police to acknowledge the fear his disappearance had incited in Oxford’s LGBTQ+ community. 
Reyes summed up their role in the case in two words: “Accountability and awareness.” 
The two view Justice for Jay Lee’s role now as carrying on Lee’s legacy. Before his death, Lee was preparing to begin a graduate degree in social work. His friends have been trying to establish a scholarship at the University of Mississippi in Lee’s honor, because Johnson said that higher education was important to him. 
“Jay Lee was raised with love,” she said. “He didn’t go through the world thinking that people were going to do him wrong. Jay Lee went through the world very optimistic and with a loving outlook and part of me thinks he tried to share that with Tim.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/02163004/20251202_JayLeeTrial_4509.jpg,,,2025-12-03 07:57:00.434594

Last year, voters enshrined the right to abortion in the state constitution. The GOP-dominated legislature responded six months later by voting to put a new constitutional amendment on the ballot that would reimpose an abortion ban. 
Proponents of abortion rights filed a lawsuit in July arguing that the summary of the proposed abortion ban amendment that will appear on ballots was intentionally deceptive because it failed to state the amendment would repeal the abortion rights amendment. A Cole County judge agreed, in part, and ordered Secretary of State Denny Hoskins to rewrite it. 
On his second attempt, Hoskins crafted a summary that Judge Daniel Green deemed “fair and sufficient.”

But attorneys representing Dr. Anna Fitz-James — who submitted the language for the reproductive rights initiative petition in 2023 — believe Green was too hasty in giving the language the OK, arguing the current language “fails to tell voters that a right is being eliminated and replaced with fewer rights.”
They filed an appeal of Green’s ruling, which will be argued before the Western District Court of Appeals Wednesday afternoon in Kansas City. 
The Missouri Attorney General’s Office, which is representing Hoskins, said the court doesn’t need to determine if the current ballot language is the best wording possible, “but whether it gives the voter a sufficient idea of what the proposed amendment would accomplish.”
The ballot language reads:
“Shall the Missouri Constitution be amended to:



Guarantee women’s medical care for emergencies, ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages; 
Ensure women’s safety during abortions; 
Ensure parental consent for minors; 
Repeal Article I, section 36, approved in 2024; allow abortions for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape, and incest;’
and Prohibit sex-change procedures for children?”



If approved by a majority of voters, the abortion ban amendment would be slightly less restrictive than the near-total ban implemented in June 2022. Unlike the prior ban, it would allow abortions for survivors or rape or incest up to 12 weeks gestation, though it is not clear if or how a survivor would need to prove the assault in order to receive medical care. 
All other abortions would be banned, aside from cases of medical emergencies.
Attorneys Chuck Hatfield and Tori Schafer, in briefings to the court of appeals on behalf of Fitz-James, argue the proposed amendment is a “mess” and violates a statute that prevents ballot measures from encompassing more than one subject. They are asking the higher court to remove the amendment from the ballot or re-write the summary.
The crux of the issue, they say, is that gender-affirming health care is separate from reproductive health care. Including a ban on gender-affirming care for minors, they say, “logrolls” two unrelated subjects to make the amendment more popular. Gender-affirming health care for minors is currently banned in Missouri, though a challenge to the law is before the state supreme court. 
The attorney general’s office on behalf of Hoskins said Fitz-James’ interpretation of the single subject rule is too narrow. Gender-affirming health care, they contend, includes “procedures that frequently render children sterile.” 
Fitz-James’ attorneys said assuming gender-affirming surgeries always involve reproductive organs is flawed.
“A wide variety of surgeries accomplish that purpose — from breast augmentation to hair reconstruction—that never implicate a reproductive organ,” they wrote. 
Judge approves ballot language for amendment reinstating Missouri abortion ban

Fitz-James’ attorneys argue the current wording “obscures” the fact that the proposed amendment would ban most abortions by making it sounds as if the abortion rights it keeps in place would be new, rather than rights that are already protected.  
Most voters, they argue, will have no idea what Article 1, Section 36 of the Missouri Constitution is. 
“The words ‘approved in 2024’ are similarly devoid of context or meaning,” Fitz-James’ attorneys wrote in court filings. “Approved by whom? Some random bureaucrat? The legislature? Good Housekeeping? The voter is left to wonder.”
The attorney general’s office argues Missourians should be given more credit when they show up to the polls.
“Voters are certainly intelligent enough to know that ‘random bureaucrat[s]’ and ‘Good Housekeeping’ do not approve constitutional amendments,” the attorney general’s office wrote.
Court filings briefly delved into the use of a semi-colon in the fourth bullet point, with attorneys for Fitz-James lambasting its misuse while the attorney general’s office called on grammar gurus Strunk and White to defend the punctuation. 
However the court of appeals rules, the case will almost certainly end up in hands of the Missouri Supreme Court.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051425_abortionaccess2-1024x615.jpg,,,2025-12-03 07:57:00.434594

He teaches at Kenrick-Glennon Seminary, our families are here and we’ve made a lot of friends who have welcomed us in and treated us like family.
In recent years, one of those families, along with another we befriended at a previous place of employment,  have both gone through tremendous difficulties as the prices of critical medical treatments have skyrocketed. One family has a son with Type 1 diabetes; the other has a daughter with allergy problems. Both families have had to revamp their budgets — in the first case, simply to keep their child alive, and in the second to forestall possible worst-case scenarios.
None of this is a surprise when Big Pharma has put profits ahead of people for decades. Even recent news that some weight-loss treatments may become more affordable can’t hide how expensive medicine is in America.
For example, the EpiPen that cost $100 in 2007 was over $600 in 2017, and prices continue to rise. Weight loss drug Ozempic went from roughly $675 in 2017 to almost $1,000 today — with a 50% reduction if you can pay in cash. Insulin costs have nearly tripled since the early 2000s. Even common antibiotics and asthma inhalers now come with shocking price tags.
EpiPens, insulin and many other critical drugs and medications are not optional for families. They are everyday essentials for quality of life and even to just stay alive.
Our friends whose child experiences anaphylaxis from contact with certain allergens need her to have an EpiPen 24/7. At current prices, their family budget revolves around the cost of these life-saving devices.
For the friends whose child has Type 1 diabetes, every refill of insulin means cutting corners — cheaper meals, waiting for car repairs and reducing holiday spending even if it impacts family traditions.
I understand that pharmaceutical companies need to make a profit. Research and development takes time, expertise and risk, and companies have to somehow incentivize those who make it all happen.
But the profit motive goes too far when it comes at the expense of human life.
With most things that we buy, like gas, groceries, and clothes, there are plenty of options for people with different levels of income and desires. The same isn’t true for pharmaceutical companies that provide critical and rare medications. My friends have to pay what the company decides, unless their insurance company can somehow negotiate the price down.
And it’s not as though Big Pharma behaves like a cash-strapped industry frantically trying to find the next life-saving cure. The industry is the biggest lobby in Washington and is generating hundreds of billions of dollars annually with plenty of cash for investor stock buybacks. The digital and television ads seem endless.
If Big Pharma can spend billions convincing us that we should buy its products, surely it can afford to put people ahead of profits, especially since Americans a) provide tens of billions of tax dollars to Pharma’s research and development, b) pay multiples of what other countries pay and c) are one of the only targets of Pharma ads in the world (among high-income nations, only New Zealand also allows unrestricted direct-to-consumer advertising).
Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley has proposed a bill that could make a difference, advocating for tariffs that will pressure pharmaceutical companies to finally put Americans first. He’s also introduced bipartisan legislation to rein in drug prices. Whether or not you agree with these solutions, it’s good that Missouri has a senator trying to make the system work for ordinary people.
It also shows that this issue doesn’t belong to one party or ideology. High drug prices hurt Democrats, Republicans and independents alike. They harm people who live in cities and on farms, young families and retirees and especially the sick.
Medicine should heal — not bankrupt — the people it’s meant to help. It’s time for both parties to show the same level of commitment to families as these companies show to their shareholders.

(Photo by Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)A Senate panel advanced legislation this week that would add new steps for state agencies enacting regulations and would grant immense power to individuals seeking to block the readoption of expiring rules.
The Senate’s state government committee on Monday unanimously approved a bill that would require cost-benefit analyses of all proposed regulations, a proposed move that elicited cheers from the business community and criticism from environmentalists and other critics.
“This is not a pro-business bill. It’s not an anti-environment bill. This is a good government bill. This is about broadening the process so that as much information is brought to the regulators as possible before a rule is put out there so we have the best possible result,” said Ray Cantor, deputy chief government affairs officer for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association.
The bill would create a 12-member commission staffed mostly by a governor’s cabinet members and task it with reviewing all regulations and certain executive orders issued in the state to see whether their costs outweigh their benefits.
If the panel finds a regulation or executive order would burden state businesses, workers, or local governments, the bill requires it to recommend how the policy ought to be changed or whether it should be repealed.
The commission would be required to hold its public comment process parallel and independent of the process agencies are already required to follow when proposing and enacting new regulations.
Opponents said they fear the bill, called S4373 and sponsored by Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union), does too little to require the commission to consider the benefits of some rules. They cautioned that the cost-benefit analysis might exclude economic losses averted by, for example, stricter flood rules.
“No serious economist would ever evaluate only one side of the ledger, but S4373 forces state agencies to focus on costs rather than benefits,” said Lindsey Kayman, membership chair of the New Jersey Environmental Lobby.
Other critics likened it to the Department of Government Efficiency, a federal cost-cutting program once headed by Elon Musk that made broad federal cuts but failed to produce meaningful savings.

The commission’s recommendations would be non-binding and have no force of law, meaning a governor or administrative agency could ignore them.
The Senate committee’s vote came as regulators weigh two major rules proposals that have drawn opposition from business groups.
One set to be adopted in January would place new requirements on construction in Jersey Shore areas and expand the state’s flood plains, among other things. The other would enshrine in regulation the Department of Labor’s interpretation of a test to measure whether a worker is an independent contractor or an employee entitled to benefits.
The bill advanced Monday would give immense power to a single person to blunt existing regulations that are set to expire, including people who live outside of New Jersey.
Existing law allows state agencies to extend expiring regulations for up to seven years. The bill would require agencies to take public comment on those extensions, and a single comment in opposition would force regulators to restart the rulemaking process anew. That process can take a year or more.
“What we’re going to have is a government that, instead of becoming more efficient, becomes less efficient, becomes less able to enact the mandates that have been set out by this Legislature,” said Peter Chen, a senior policy analyst at New Jersey Policy Perspective.
Chen added that another provision requiring agencies to use the “best available science” could open the door to lawsuits by litigants who disagree on what science is best.
Proponents said the bill could give new means to oppose regulations.
“Unless an impacted entity is going to challenge a rule or regulation, agencies are free to just dismiss comments, not respond, and not be robust about them,” said Nicholas Kikis, vice president of legislative and regulatory affairs at the New Jersey Apartment Association. “So, this really puts more teeth in ensuring the process is followed.”
Under existing law that the bill would not change, the governor can, with the recommendation of one of their cabinet heads, extend expiring regulations indefinitely.
Other changes would allow agencies to make substantial changes to regulations when adopting them if the changes “are a logical outgrowth” of the proposed regulation. Presently, state law requires another period of public comment for proposed regulations that see major changes.
The bill, which has no Assembly companion, would also require state agencies to annually report how quickly they process permit applications, among some other things.

(Photo by Darren Hauck/Getty Images)Two environmental groups filed a petition late last month challenging the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources’ decision to grant a permit allowing a West Band dairy farm to operate as a concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO). 
The dairy, Rob-n-Cin Farms, has been operating as a CAFO for several years without a permit. Under state law, CAFOs are required to obtain Wisconsin Pollution Discharge Elimination System (WPDES) permits, which regulate the pollution industrial activities such as factory farms are allowed to discharge into local waterways. 
CAFOs are industrial farming facilities with more than 1,000 animal units — one animal unit is equivalent to a 1,000-pound cow. Rob-n-Cin plans to expand its herd from 1,300 cows to 2,000. After expanding, the herd will produce more than 18 million gallons of manure every year which the farm plans to  spread on fields in Ozaukee and Washington counties. 
In 2023, the DNR investigated the farm for operating as an unpermitted CAFO and issued a notice of noncompliance against the farm. 
Since then, Rob-n-Cin has been going through the process to obtain a permit, drawing complaints from local residents and community groups. Those complaints include the farm’s failure to list two satellite locations where it plans to spread manure in its permit application, the lack of sanctions on the farm for operating unpermitted and the effect on local groundwater. 
Residents are worried about the farm’s effects on the Milwaukee River watershed and the Cedarburg Bog, which is protected as a state natural area and national natural landmark. 
On Nov. 26, the environmental-focused law firm Midwest Environmental Advocates filed a petition for a contested case review of the DNR’s permit approval on behalf of Milwaukee Riverkeeper and area residents. The residents include a nearby organic farm and neighbors of Rob-n-Cin. 
The petition alleges that the DNR has not proven the expansion will comply with the state’s groundwater quality standards, particularly the limits for phosphorus and nitrates. The permit includes statements that the farm will follow statewide best practices for manure spreading but the petition argues that’s not enough and the DNR should have done more to prove the groundwater will be protected.
“DNR’s issuance of a permit relying solely on standard practices that are not intended to ensure compliance with groundwater quality standards is unreasonable,” the petition states. “This is particularly true in an area of high susceptibility where many members of the public raised credible concerns of groundwater contamination and examples of excessive nitrate levels. Rob-n-Cin needed to demonstrate, and DNR needed to find, that issuance of a permit would not lead to continued or widespread groundwater contamination in excess of established standards. Simply relying on default nutrient management practices without performing analysis or investigation was unreasonable.” 
The petition also argues the DNR should require monitoring of the local groundwater after the expansion is complete, stating that state regulators can’t know if the farm is violating its standards if it isn’t tracking how the expansion affects the groundwater. 
And the petition states that the DNR did not complete a sufficient environmental review before approving the permit. 
“DNR conducted no substantive evaluation of environmental or socioeconomic impacts of the WPDES permit, including effects on groundwater, Cedar Creek, Mole Creek (a Class II trout stream), the Milwaukee River watershed, which is subject to an EPA-approved [Total Maximum Daily Load] for nutrients and sediment, or the Cedarburg Bog,” the petition states. 
In a news release, MEA attorney Adam Voskuil said the DNR’s authority requires it to prove that the expansion won’t violate state water standards and it has failed to do so. 
“State law is clear that the DNR is required to affirmatively determine — not merely assume — that Rob-n-Cin’s manure-spreading plan will not violate groundwater quality standards. Without off-site groundwater monitoring, there’s simply no way to obtain the data necessary to make that determination,” Voskuil said.
If the petition for a contested case hearing is granted, a hearing on the permit approval will be held by an administrative law judge. That decision would be appealable to the state circuit court system.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — While state leaders, the business community and political candidates intensify their focus on improving Oklahoma public education, complaints have grown among teachers that they should have a more prominent role in those policy discussions.
“I’ve been begging people for years, for years, to ask actual teachers, ‘What do you need? What do you think would make these improvements?’” longtime Oklahoma public school teacher Jami Cole said. “We know what would do it, but we’re never asked. We’re just passed over for people who have more influence and power than what we have.”
Education, particularly reading proficiency, is primed to be a top legislative issue over the coming year, with the Oklahoma State Chamber and new state Superintendent Lindel Fields already suggesting policy changes. Student literacy has emerged as a priority issue in the 2026 governor’s race, as well.
Two weeks ago, the State Chamber announced a platform of literacy-focused policies that would have struggling readers repeat a grade. Fields, who said improving reading levels is among his top priorities, floated the idea of adding days to Oklahoma’s minimum school year length, which currently sits at 181 days or 1,086 hours. 
Both ideas have generated debate and opposition from educators, particularly among the 64,000-member Oklahoma Edvocates Facebook group, which Cole administers. Educators in the group have contended the suggestion of grade repetition and a longer school year are a sign that teachers aren’t consulted often enough in education policy conversations.
Cole said she opposes both ideas and sees a different set of needs from within her second-grade classroom. She has 23 students of widely varying education levels, she said, ranging from advanced to bordering on needing special education services.
More teaching aides, tutors and reading interventionists paired with smaller class sizes and properly trained teachers “is where the focus has to be” for state policymakers, Cole said.
“There’s so much going on in my classroom right now that I just have such a hard time with someone who has never been in the realm of teaching or education saying, ‘Oh, we just need to do this,’” she said.
The State Chamber’s plan, known as “Oklahoma Competes,” proposes a greater investment in reading coaches to assist teachers and more training in the phonics-based science of reading, along with retaining struggling readers.

The chamber announced its education plan at its State of Business Forum with endorsements from business leaders and Republican lawmakers, but not educators. 
However, when developing “Oklahoma Competes,” the chamber sought input from classroom teachers, reading specialists, literacy coaches, superintendents, higher-education experts and school leaders across the state, President and CEO Chad Warmington said in a statement. 
He said the chamber’s role is “not to dictate classroom practice, but to support the people who do this work every day.” 
“Teachers are the frontline of this effort, and any meaningful policy solution has to reflect their experience and earn their buy-in,” Warmington said. 
However, teachers still “don’t feel like they’re being heard,” said Tori Luster Pennington, president of the Oklahoma City American Federation of Teachers union, which collectively bargains on behalf of teachers in Oklahoma City Public Schools.
More interest from different groups, like the chamber, in improving education is a positive thing, she said. But her union members, who see the day-to-day realities within public schools, have given a very different list of solutions.

They cited a need for more support for students’ mental and behavioral health, she said. Chronic absenteeism also remains a persistent issue.
“Since COVID, even though we’re not in that same time, there’s still so many lingering effects of kids just not being ready and just not having the support that they need,” Pennington said. “So, we really just need more support and more engagement and helping those issues and those behaviors, and we really have to start there before we can add (school) days.”
Fields said his remarks on lengthening the school year weren’t a formal proposal, but rather a “very preliminary discussion” made during a TV interview. He said he had little dialogue with educators about the idea before floating it.
But, he’s since invited teachers to complete an educator survey to share their thoughts on a longer school year and to contribute other ideas for improving academic outcomes. The survey received nearly 4,000 responses after a week, Fields wrote in a Nov. 24 letter to teachers.
Fields said he intends to follow that up with visits to schools, education groups and teacher meetings with the goal of having open communication with teachers as he leads the Oklahoma State Department of Education. 
Former state Superintendent Ryan Walters’ combative and polarizing brand of politics frayed the relationship between the agency and many educators. After Walters resigned on Sept. 30 to lead an anti-teacher-union nonprofit, Fields, a longtime CareerTech center leader, came in with a different approach, one focused on repairing those ties. 
“I want to visit with teachers, hear from teachers, hear their hearts and what’s on their minds,” he told reporters after an Oklahoma State Board of Education meeting Nov. 20.

State leaders should consult teachers or risk losing valuable feedback, said Rep. John Waldron, D-Tulsa. 
Waldron is a former public high school teacher elected to office amid a groundswell of support for public education in 2018.
“If teachers aren’t part of the discussion, you’re not going to get to hear from teachers who have seen what a third-grade retention test does to 8 year olds,” he said. “And if you talk about adding 15 days to the school year at a time when teacher burnout is at historic highs, then yeah, you’re not going to develop a policy that makes more people want to be teachers or stay teachers.”

Some households face service shutoffs, in part, due to a delay in the program caused by the federal government shutdown.
The post Feds resume low-income heating help in Wyoming days after temps plunge appeared first on WyoFile .","The Trump administration has resumed a heating assistance program for low-income households, days after much of Wyoming saw temperatures plunge into the single digits.
The Wyoming Low Income Energy Assistance Program rebooted on Monday after a 45-day pause due to the federal government shutdown. The shutdown ended Nov. 12. Nevertheless, an appropriation for the federal program wasn’t released until Friday. Wyoming received $9.6 million, according to Wyoming LIEAP, allowing assistance payments to resume immediately, officials announced.
“With the restoration of federal funding, the LIEAP team has begun notifying applicants whether they are eligible to receive benefits and, if eligible, the amount of the benefit,” Wyoming LIEAP said in a press release.
Though the program, managed by the Wyoming Department of Family Services, was forced to idle payouts in mid-October, state officials still urged people to submit applications during the pause so staff could determine eligibility and quickly resume processing disbursements. The agency received and reviewed about 4,000 applications during that time, in addition to about 1,100 before the shutdown impacted the program.

Wyoming LIEAP distributed $6.1 million to 8,236 Wyoming households last winter season, according to the agency.
The program helps pay “a portion of winter heating bills for natural gas, electricity, propane, coal, wood and other fuel types” for households earning less than 60% of the state’s median income, which was about $75,000 in 2024. Priority is given to elderly and disabled residents, and families with children under 5 years old. 
Payments on behalf of qualifying households typically begin on Nov. 1 each year, and the program continues through early spring. Delays this year, however, left some in the cold and facing utility service shutoffs for unpaid bills, according to Wyoming 211 Executive Director Ann Clement.
“We mostly hear from our callers that many are unable to make any payment arrangements to avoid shutoff,” Clement told WyoFile. People with medical issues “are being disconnected, lots of broken furnaces and no resources to assist with repair or replacement,” she said. “Things just start to pile up.”

Another energy assistance program, Energy Share of Wyoming, began accepting applications Monday. The nonprofit organization, comprised of several utility and energy companies, serves as a backup “when unusual circumstances create financial needs not met through existing energy assistance programs,” according to the group. Energy Share raised $108,000 in private and corporate donations to help 236 Wyoming households last winter. “Total distributions for energy bill and propane bill assistance totaled $75,422.58,” the group said.
This year, Energy Share shifted its qualifying threshold upward to consider higher household incomes, casting a wider net for those who might qualify.
While the average residential cost of electricity in Wyoming remains lower than the U.S. average, customers here are experiencing a national trend of rising monthly utility bills. Wyoming homes experienced a year-over-year increase of about 4% in August, according to a report by the University of Wyoming School of Energy Resources, compared to a national average increase of 6%.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)It is heartening to learn two paired Republican-led congressional committees have determined to scrutinize the merciless killing of two “stragglers” who survived the aerial attack on their small boat, suspected of running drugs, only then killed on direct orders from Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth – for no military purpose.
As virtually every person (except Hegseth?) who has served in the U.S. military knows, the killing of stragglers in combat is prohibited by the Uniform Code of Military Justice as well as the Geneva Convention – and President Trump has declared we are on a war-footing against South American drug cartels.
The Senate and House Armed Services Committees also seek to determine the legality of the 20-and-counting attacks on suspected drug-running, née fishing boats.
Montana’s junior senator, Tim Sheehy, is a member of the Senate committee. As a graduate of the Naval Academy and combat service as an elite SEAL, we can expect him to participate fully.
Now that these two committees have found the backbone to assert their Constitutional prerogative to question the Trump administration, it is time for other committees – and members of Congress – to do likewise.
They should start by deciding whether it is in America’s best interests to watch Ukraine be subsumed by Vladimir Putin’s Russia or to determine that the country is vital to U.S. interests and that the secretive Steve Witkoff-Jared Kushner-Kirill Dmitriev machinations give the dictator everything he wants. 
While Americans turned to holiday football games after their Thanksgiving  feasts, Putin showed his true intentions by pounding Ukraine civilians with dozens of missiles and hundreds of drones over 10 long hours. Mind you, civilian targets in the capital city of Kyiv, not military. Such is Putin’s war.
Pure and simple, Putin wants to re-create the empire known as the Soviet Union and bring its 15 former “republics” back into the fold after they became more-or-less independent when the USSR dissolved in 1991. Putin is an unapologetic Stalinist who is taking advantage of Trump’s hunt for a Nobel Peace Prize by playing along.
In addition to Sheehy’s leadership role on the Armed Services Committee, two of our other congressmen are in roles one would think might influence their interests and actions:

Our senior U.S. senator, Steve Daines, serves on the Foreign Relations Committee where he is chair of the Subcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation.
Ryan Zinke of Montana’s First Congressional District serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

Even with the reported U.S. financial dealings being dangled in front of Putin in Trump’s transactional, “me-oriented” diplomacy, the cost of Putin’s war is not high enough for him to be dissuaded from his ultimate goal. His KGB history and actions are testimony to his ruthlessness.
Congress has considerable Constitutional authority to question foreign policy set by the president and to influence it through the power of the purse. It is heartening to see these two Armed Services Committees exercising their responsibilities. It is up to senators and representatives to convene them, not the president.
Ukraine as a free country is vital to U.S. and European interests – indeed, to the entire free world. It’s time to stop working around the edges in a misguided effort to woo a despotic dictator to the peace table.
The similarities between Ukraine today and appeasement of Nazi Germany in 1938 are frighteningly similar. 
The U.S. knows what Ukraine needs to hold back the modern-day Red Army. Is Congress and our Montana delegation willing to participate in appeasement?

The one-time Senate hopeful is on social media blitz. But it’s unclear what office he’s actually gunning for, writes columnist Rod Miller.
The post What’s the deal with Reid Rasner? appeared first on WyoFile .","You can’t swing a dead cat in the Big Empty these days without hitting an advertisement or social media post by Reid Rasner, extolling his own virtues as the savior of all things Wyoming. The dude is forking out some serious cash to grab our attention. What’s he up to?

Opinion

Rasner’s glitzy media blitz has the distinctive aroma of a political campaign, not just a sales pitch for a stock jockey, but he hasn’t announced for any elective office. Whenever I see someone exert this much effort to gain name recognition and Cowboy State trail cred for no apparent reason, my bullshit detector kicks into overdrive. I become curious and suspicious.
Because I honestly can’t calculate why Rasner is spending all this money, I ran my rumor trapline from Pine Bluff to Evanston and from Baggs to Big Horn. Nobody could enlighten me; they’re all as mystified as I am. What’s the deal with Reid Rasner?
So, not wanting to get ahead of the lead horse, I called Rasner on Friday and left a voicemail that I have a question or two, and informed him that my deadline is Monday evening around happy hour. As of deadline, all I’ve heard is crickets from Rasner.
Without hearing from the horse’s mouth, we are left with a bit of history, what is heard on the sagebrush telegraph and what has been the public record.
Here’s a bit of political history. Rasner ran for a seat on the Las Vegas City Council in 2017. The Sin City council is widely regarded as a springboard to statewide political office in Wyoming, but alas, he collected only 74 votes in that race.
That experience prepared Rasner for the drubbing that he endured when he unsuccessfully tried to primary Sen. John Barrasso in 2024. That lesson only cost him a million bucks and change. Strike two.

Columnist Rod Miller.(Mike Vanata)

On Rasner’s Facebook page, he self-identifies as a politician, but, for the life of me, I can’t think of a significant office in Wyoming that he has a snowball’s chance in hell of winning. Rep. Harriet Hageman will likely defend her seat in Congress, and Chuck Gray will probably run for re-election as secretary of state, since neither relishes the prospect of butting heads with state Sen. Eric Barlow in a contest for governor.
And all three aforementioned names would squash Rasner like a bug if he tested their political prowess at the polls.
Here’s a thought. Rasner could run for Wyoming treasurer and, if he could somehow pull off a political miracle, he would have enough ready cash at his fingertips to buy TikTok. Rasner drew a lot of attention when he announced plans to buy the social media app, and in March said the Trump administration was “very interested” in his bid. Four months later, he announced a pause on the deal. But he’d have to beat Curt Meier at the ballot box.
It certainly appears as if Rasner is no lightweight, though. He sued former state Sen. Anthony “Romeo” Bouchard for defamation when Bouchard accused Rasner of sexual misconduct while working as a drama teacher at Casper College. Rasner said he was a student, not a teacher, and that he did not sexually abuse anyone. The judicial outcome of that soap opera is pending, and popcorn futures are up to the limit in anticipation.
So we are left to examine chicken entrails, read smoke signals and follow Rasner’s footprints in the dust as we try to figure out what is going on in his noggin.
His ads and Facebook page have the look of expensive Madison Avenue media pros, so it’s not like he’s nickel-and-diming his dream, or cobbling things together in Mom’s basement.
Rasner’s media extravaganza smacks of uber-MAGA orthodoxy, Honor Wyoming outrage, Project 2025 faux patriotism and folksy Freedom Caucus populism, but where is it pointed? If he’s not running for office, he’s spending a wagonload of cash to do nothing more than raise political consciousness in Wyoming. I am on record testifying that a “raised consciousness” and seven bucks will get you a cup of coffee at Starbucks.
As far as ego-driven, snake-oil sales pitches go, I’ve seen ‘em all. But if I’m understanding the citizens of Wyoming correctly, they’ve already had a bellyful of snake oil forced on them in recent years and are weary of the taste.
If Rasner lacks the transparency to tell his friends and neighbors why he is going through all these contortions to promote himself, he will remain nothing more than a noisy bobble-head doll trying to hijack our attention when we have other, more pressing chores.
And we’ll be left with the annoying unanswered question, “What’s the deal with Reid Rasner?”

A letter by the Idaho Sheriffs’ Association is the latest in a string of concerns over cuts by a state Medicaid contractor that stem from the state’s attempts to avoid a projected budget shortfall.
Idaho Medicaid contractor to cut critical services for people with severe mental illness

The contractor that runs Idaho Medicaid mental health benefits, Magellan of Idaho, plans to cut specialized mobile teams that treat patients with severe mental illness who have struggled in routine settings starting Monday. It isn’t immediately clear whether the cuts are already in effect. 
In a Monday letter to Gov. Brad Little and Republican leaders in the Idaho Legislature, Idaho Sheriffs’ Association President Samuel Hulse urged elected officials to recognize and address the situation. He called the state’s budget situation “self-inflicted.”
“We acknowledge the State’s budget challenges which are self-inflicted by an overly aggressive tax reduction stance of the Legislative Branch and a complicit Executive Branch continuing to reduce tax revenue creating a budget shortage,” Hulse, who also serves as Bonneville County sheriff, wrote. 
“These reductions to mental health services represent a significant public-safety concern,” he continued. “As sheriffs, our foremost duty is to protect the people of Idaho. We urge State leadership to recognize the real-world public-safety consequences of these decisions and to work with counties to ensure Idahoans in crisis — and the agencies who respond to them — are not left without support.”
The state’s projected budget deficit is coming after the Legislature and Little approved $450 million in tax cuts during the 2025 legislative session, following years of income tax cuts that have reduced the state’s revenue by $4 billion, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
Magellan and the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare could not be immediately reached for comment.

The Idaho Sheriffs’ Association echoed concerns by some mental health providers, warning that the cuts could worsen mental health crises, shifting costs onto jails, emergency medical services and local taxpayers “who will bear the operational and financial burden of managing the consequences.” 
On Monday, Magellan also announced more cuts to Idaho Medicaid mental health services that will start Jan. 1. The cuts include:

Blocking providers from billing for skills training and development groups for adults starting Jan. 1 in some cases, except for people age 17 and younger and adults who are receiving the early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment benefit. 
Requiring more frequent prior authorization for two services: adult intensive outpatient services, and adult skills-building/community-based rehabilitative services. All adults receiving the adults skill-building/community-based rehabilitative services will need prior authorization. 

Jason Coombs, founder of Brick House Recovery, a substance abuse treatment center in Boise and Idaho Falls, told the Idaho Capital Sun in a statement the cuts could limit care access in Idaho.
“These reductions across multiple levels of care raise serious concerns about our ability to adequately serve one of Idaho’s most vulnerable populations,” he said. “While I initially understood the need for greater accountability and some level of tightening within the system, the cumulative impact of these changes may unintentionally limit access to essential mental-health and substance-use treatment.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)MEMPHIS — The alert went out to volunteers at about 8 p.m. on a Friday: a woman hiding in a closet with her twin toddlers was on the phone to a community hotline unsure what to do as dozens of federal and local law enforcement officers converged outside, demanding entry.
Yuleiny Escobar, a volunteer for Vecindarios 901, which operates the hotline, hustled over to the woman’s home, located in the same heavily Latino Berclair neighborhood as her own.
A tow truck driver blocked the road leading to the house at the request of law enforcement, blared the pro-police anthem, “Bad Boys.” By the time Escobar reached the home, a Border Patrol officer and a U.S. Marshal each held a toddler in one arm as their mother was placed inside an unmarked SUV. Holes in the home’s windows marked entry points for chemical agents that had been thrown inside to force the family out, neighbors told Escobar.

Escobar pulled out her phone and began recording.
“These are scenes people need to see, as a reflection of our state and our country right now,” Escobar said.
Thousands of Memphians now rely on the videos, photos and eyewitness reports by volunteers with Vencendarios 901 — V901 for short — to chronicle the activities of the Memphis Safe Task Force, the multi-agency law enforcement force launched Sept. 15 by President Donald Trump. 
V901 was established as a rapid response network to report on Immigration and Customs Enforcement activities during the first Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration. In Trump’s second term, the all-volunteer V901 has kicked into high gear.
Seven years ago, V901 received three to five calls per day from Memphis residents reporting immigration enforcement activities to its hotline, said Hunter Demster, a longtime local activist who co-founded the effort seven years ago with Maria Oceja, a community organizer.
“Now we’re getting up to 140 calls a day,” he said. “The vast majority of calls are people scared to leave their houses or pulled over. But we’ve also pushed this number out at community events and, now, the average person sees something and calls us.”
Tracking the task force 
V901 dispatchers answer calls while volunteers drive two-hour patrol shifts to confirm reported Task Force actions before they are sent out as text blasts and social media posts. The information serves both as a warning to avoid locations with a heavy law enforcement presence and an ongoing documentation of Task Force activity. 
About 100 people a month have attended V901 volunteer training since the Task Force launched, Demster said. The group is diverse, but Demster said he has noticed more older white women and individuals motivated by their religious faith have turned out to help in recent months.

Hundreds of videos and photos posted by volunteers to the group’s Instagram and Facebook pages have captured traffic stops, forcible home entries and arrests that have taken place since September. 
V901 volunteers continue to stay in touch with families impacted by an arrest, linking them to counseling, food pantries, legal assistance and help navigating the online Immigration and Customs Enforcement locator system to track detained loved ones and add money to their inmate accounts, Demster said.
Volunteers are also trained to try to obtain car keys after traffic stops to ensure vehicles get to family members instead of being towed by private companies that typically refuse to release a car to anyone who is not the registered owner.
The day after the mother with toddlers was detained was her twins’ birthday, Demster said. V901 volunteers bought them presents. Their mother was later released with an ankle monitor and reunited with her children, he said. The woman’s 16-year-old niece, driven home from the laundromat by a family friend in a car that law enforcement pursued to the home that night, remains in ICE custody and is subject to deportation, he said.

Task Force targets Hispanic neighborhoods
On a different Friday night, just before Thanksgiving, Demster and fellow volunteer Lucii Chambless took a shift driving the streets of the Berclair neighborhood watching for signs of Task Force activity. 
A half dozen members of the Tennessee National Guard strolled up and down a sidewalk in front of a busy Kroger store on Summer Avenue, the main commercial route through the Berclair neighborhood. Guard personnel lingered in front of a van parked in an empty lot in the hip and artsy Cooper-Young neighborhood. In neither location would Guard personnel respond to questions about their assignment, referring questions to a public information officer.
The National Guard, whose presence in the city is being challenged in court by the Shelby County mayor and other elected Democrats, typically serves in a support role, Demster said. 
Task Force law enforcement actions follow a pattern that distinguishes them from other police work, Demster said.
Task Force stops typically are initiated by Memphis police, state troopers and Shelby County Sheriff deputies, while Homeland Security Investigations and ICE officers either ride along with them or follow in unmarked dark-colored vehicles. 
Task Force traffic stops that Demster has observed have included up to ten unmarked vehicles driven by federal agents identifiable by their uniforms.

Most of the stops reported by V901 volunteers appear to be aimed at drivers in two of Memphis’ biggest Hispanic neighborhoods: Hickory Hill and Berclair, he said. 
The Memphis Safe Task Force has made over 3,100 arrests, 1900 of them for nonviolent offences, and initiated more than 35,000 traffic stops since Oct. 1, according to a dashboard maintained by the city that has received community pushback for its lack of detail.
The data made public by the city and U.S. Marshal’s office, which spearheads the task force, does not include the locations of arrests or demographic data on individuals arrested. Task Force officials initially reported immigration arrest numbers but have since stopped providing that data. 
In the absence of data, Demster said V901 volunteers said they have witnessed immigration arrests as a key priority.
“They may say this isn’t strictly an ICE operation, but when you flood the two largest Hispanic communities in the city, we see it’s an ICE operation under the false pretenses of we’re here to stop violent criminals,” he said.

Climate change is one of the top threats to vulnerable species around the world, driving widespread losses of plants and animals that can’t adapt fast enough. But at the same time, rising temperatures are in some cases opening the door for certain organisms that can thrive under these changes: invasive species.
From melting sea ice to longer growing seasons, global warming is unlocking new pathways for the spread and proliferation of certain non-native plants, animals, fungi and bacteria, according to a growing body of research. These new arrivals can wreak havoc on ecosystems and agricultural land, sometimes outcompeting native species and costing the global economy more than $400 billion in damages annually—including $21 billion in the United States alone, estimates suggest.
Despite these threats, the Trump administration has poked holes in invasive species research funding and mitigation efforts across the country in recent months. Scientists say this decrease in resources could have major long-term ecological and economic consequences.

Unintended hitchhikers
The rise of long-haul transportation and trade has made the world more connected than ever before. Unfortunately, the cars, trains, planes and boats that carry us, food and products can also pick up some unintended hitchhikers along the way in the form of seeds, insects, bacteria and even birds and mammals. Whether attaching to the bottom of a boat, stowing away in a cargo plane or even getting stuck on someone’s shoe, these species often incidentally travel from their ecosystem to new places where they can spread.
That’s exactly what happened with the spotted lanternfly, an insect from China that scientists believe made its way to the U.S. on a shipment of stone in 2012. Since then, the lanternflies have spread to at least 15 states across the Eastern U.S., reaching populations of up to 150,000 some years in Pennsylvania alone, The Guardian reports.
While these polka-dotted insects may look harmless, a 2019 study estimated that spotted lanternflies can cause $324 million in damages and cause the loss of 2,800 jobs by killing trees that are crucial for apple and wine production or support birds, bats and reptiles in the region. Similar destruction has followed as other invasive animal species spread across the world, from Burmese pythons in Florida to brown rats in New Zealand.


Invasive species already present in Louisiana include air potatoes, apple snails, Asian carp, Chinese tallow trees, citrus greening, emerald ash borers, feral hogs, giant salvinia, guava root knot nematodes and Mexican rice borers.

Many non-native species in the U.S. are plants, said Bethany Bradley, an invasive species expert at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The term “non-native” is used to describe organisms that do not naturally occur in an area and are introduced by human activities, but they are only classified as “invasive” if the species causes harm to the broader ecosystem, according to the National Park Service.
The reason that many invasive plants outcompete native ones is that they are fast-growing, produce numerous seeds and can better handle shifts in temperature or soil.
Once an invasive species is well-established, “basically, you end up with this introduced plant taking over an ecosystem,” Bradley said. She co-authored research published in 2023 that found certain common invasive plant species may be able to spread more rapidly under climate change in the Northeastern U.S. Though these states are currently unsuitable for certain invasive plant growth, rising temperatures could change that.
Some invasive plant species may be what’s known as a “sleeper,” which are “right on the edge of its tolerance, and so if it warms up a little bit more, maybe you transition from an established population to one that is actively invading,” Bradley said.
Silver lining: Her research also found that 62% of currently abundant invasive species will see a decrease in habitat for large populations in the Eastern U.S. under 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit of warming. That being said, close to a third of global species overall will be at risk of extinction if temperatures rise by even 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, according to a 2024 study.
Climate-fueled invasion
Other climate impacts could also drive the spread of invasive species, such as longer growing seasons or new shipping routes opening up as sea ice melts, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. On the flip side, invasive species can also exacerbate climate impacts.
For example, the deadly wildfire that tore through Lahaina in 2023 was made worse by the highly flammable, fast-growing, nonnative grasses introduced by farmers decades ago. Invasive grasses frequently fuel fires in the Western U.S.—and are typically the first to grow back after the fire, as well.
The most critical and least expensive stage to tackle invasions is when there is a small number of the species in a particular area, according to Sara Kuebbing, a researcher at the Yale School of the Environment.
“You need someone to identify, ‘Oh no, there’s something that we think is about to take off [and] it’s ready to spread’—and that usually happens,” she told me. “What fails is the institutions and the will a lot of times to contain it at that point.”
She pointed back to the spotted lanternfly, which would have required several states to come together at the early detection phase and dedicate the resources necessary to study how best to tackle the invasion and shut it down. This did not happen, as evidenced by the many spotted lanternflies I saw fluttering through the forest on a recent trip to upstate New York.
But governments are working to better collaborate on invasive species issues. In the Midwest, the U.S.-Canadian Great Lakes Fishery Commission has been working with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to control invasive sea lamprey populations in the Great Lakes, which span the Canadian border. A single one of these toothy, eel-like critters can eat 40 pounds of fish a year, so the commission targets the lamprey by spraying pesticide while they are still in the larval stage.
My colleague Anika Jane Beamer reported in February that the program was affected when the Trump administration laid off a large swath of USFWS employees, including several who worked with the commission, and enacted a travel ban and hiring freeze that delayed the remaining staff’s ability to carry out lamprey control measures.
She checked back in earlier today with Greg McClinchey, director of policy and legislative affairs for the Great Lakes Fishery Commission. He said the team raised this issue with supportive members of Congress, got the changes reversed and have had no complications since then, but did lose about five weeks “before we got everything back on track.”
The team is not yet sure if the delay will result in more lamprey later this year.
“What we know for sure is we can’t have what happened in ’25 happen again in ’26,” McClinchey said.
Also in the Midwest, President Donald Trump signed a memorandum in May directing the administration to “expeditiously implement the most effective mechanisms, barriers and other measures” to keep invasive Asian carp out of the Great Lakes, a rare show of support for environmental projects by the administration. However, other invasive species projects have been hit hard by Trump administration actions.
Since 2012, the federally managed Northeast Climate Adaptation Science Center, hosted at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, has worked to increase collaboration on invasive species management in the region. Bradley, who works in the center, helped create a regional network that has become a primary source for mapping invasive plant movement and sharing research on the subject across the region.
She said that states recently asked the center to develop a database of current and emerging invasive plants across the Northeast, but the project largely stalled after the Department of the Interior rejected a proposal for the university to continue hosting the center when it was up for a rebid in February. The Interior Department did not respond when I asked why the administration made this decision and if it will fund the invasive species work through a different mechanism.
Because of lapsed funding, graduate student researchers have been shifted to other projects or are focusing on teaching instead of research. Bradley isn’t sure when she’ll be able to prioritize the project again and is worried that she won’t have the resources to accept students in the future.
“It means that we’re just in this … zombie mode,” Bradley said. “Basically, we’re not dead, but we’re not alive, and it’s been a weird space. We’re still in this long waiting period of hoping that Congress’ support will ultimately be enough to convince the administration that this is a program that does good things.”

(Getty Images)The Trump administration’s plan to shift homeless services funds away from permanent housing programs toward transitional housing could cause more than 850 West Virginians to lose their housing, according to estimates by a national homelessness advocacy organization.
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development last month issued a notice of funding opportunity with major changes to its plan to distribute about $3.9 billion in funding for continuums of care, the local agencies that coordinate services and funding for homeless people. 
According to the notice, no more than 30% of the funding for next year can be used for permanent housing programs. In past years, as much as about 90% of continuums of care funding has gone to permanent housing.
In West Virginia, 858 people may lose their housing because of a loss of more than $7 million in funding for programs that provide permanent housing, according to the analysis by the National Alliance to End Homelessness.
Nationally, the changes could cause 170,000 people to lose their housing, advocates say. 
HUD has for years used a housing first approach, which prioritizes getting homeless people into housing with no prerequisites for treatment or other requirements and then offering voluntary supportive services like case management or mental health and substance abuse treatment.
Now, the Trump administration will prioritize projects with onsite substance use treatment, required service participation, those with sufficient treatment bed capacity and 24/detox or inpatient access, according to the National Alliance to End Homelessness. The new guidance also prioritizes continuums of care in communities that have camping bans aimed at homeless people.
In a new release, HUD wrote that the notice “restores accountability to homelessness programs and promotes self-sufficiency among vulnerable Americans.” 
In the past four years, the agency said, roughly 90% of the continuum of care funding supported the “failing Housing First ideology,” which it said “encourages dependence on endless government handouts while neglecting to address the root causes of homelessness, including illicit drugs and mental illness.”
“Our philosophy for addressing the homelessness crisis will now define success not by dollars spent or housing units filled, but by how many people achieve long-term self-sufficiency and recovery,” HUD Secretary Scott Turner said in the release. “We are stopping the Biden-era slush fund that fueled the homelessness crisis, shut out faith-based providers simply because of their values, and incentivized never-ending government dependency. These long-overdue reforms will promote independence and ensure we are supporting means-tested approaches to carry out the President’s mandate, connect Americans with the help they need, and make our cities and towns beautiful and safe.”
Traci Strickland, executive director of the Kanawha Valley Collective, said the continuum of care that covers Kanawha, Clay, Boone and Putnam counties, estimates the changes will lead to a loss of between 90 and 100 permanent supportive housing beds in those four West Virginia counties.
“It’s not just [that it will be] requirement based, it’s also going to be time limited,” Strickland said. “So the move from [permanent supportive housing] to transitional housing is a move from a continual program that can serve people as long as they need served to transitional housing, [which] has a 24-month cap on it.”
Permanent supportive housing targets people with the most barriers to housing, she said, including mental health and physical health needs. 
“We’ve had people that to some limit, you know they’re going to be in permanent supportive housing for a really long time because their disabilities are really severe,” she said.  
Permanent supportive housing also includes rental assistance, which people often need even if they no longer need supportive services, she said. That will be true even as the administration shifts toward transitional housing programs because a disproportionate number of people in West Virginia pay more than 50% of their income for housing, she said. 
“If someone’s in a program getting rental assistance, and that rental assistance stops, how are they going to afford their housing?” she said. “And to me, that’s a more pressing, important issue, because we can try to get support services in for people as well as we can, but we don’t have funding for all these people’s rental assistance. They pay a portion of their income. The program pays the rest. There’s nothing to make that up.”
Mark Phillips, CEO of Catholic Charities of West Virginia, the lead agency for the Northern Panhandle Continuum of Care, said that continuum of care would likely have been under the 30% limit for permanent housing programs anyway, but permanent supportive housing has been identified as a need in the area. 
“There are individuals here, particularly folks who are a little bit older or who have a disability, who need permanent supportive housing, and because that’s been deprioritized in this (order), it would be really difficult for us to make an argument that we’re going to build that in this area,” Phillips said.
Lawsuits challenge HUD changes
Last week, a coalition representing 20 states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over the changes to HUD funding, which they say “will lead to predictably disastrous results.’ West Virginia did not take part in the lawsuit. 
On Monday, the National Low Income Housing Coalition, National Alliance to End Homelessness and a coalition of local governments and nonprofit organizations, also sued HUD over the changes in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island.
In a news release, Renee M. Willis, CEO and president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said the order “represents a destructive departure from decades of homelessness policy, and will put an estimated 170,000 additional households into homelessness.
“These actions will destabilize communities across the country. CoC funding must prioritize evidence-based housing practices, housing stability, and local decision-making rather than undermine them,” she said. “The harm to families and individuals who rely on these programs will be irreversible and felt for generations to come. Federal policy should fuel stability — not contradict it.”
Timeline also raises concerns 
The timeline that continuums of care have to apply for funding is also a concern for agencies. 
As of Monday, the federal government had not released the official application for the funding, Strickland noted.
“We’re 16,17 days in and we still don’t know what the application looks like,” she said. “So we still don’t know what they’re going to be asking us for. We have the guidelines, but there’s a lot of specifics and details that we don’t know yet.”
This year, the notice of funding opportunity was released Nov. 13 and the application is due Jan. 14. 
HUD had been phasing funding of transitional housing programs over the past few years. The Kanawha Valley continuum of care has not had a HUD-funded transitional housing program since 2019, she said. 
“It’s really having agencies doing a 180-degree turn or creating an entire new program in 30 days,” she said. “So that is also a concern.”
Strickland said while the housing first model has been viewed as housing without requirements and services, to her, it’s a way to house the people with the most needs and barriers.
“It used to be that housing was the reward,” she said. “So if you need psychiatric meds and you take them, then you’re going to be rewarded with housing. Housing First was the opposite. You’re going to get housing because you are a human being that needs housing, and we’re going to work with you on your mental health needs or your substance use needs, or your physical health needs, or helping you get income, helping you get employment.”
Phillips said few transitional housing programs and treatment first programs exist in the Northern Panhandle and the rest of the state. There’s not a lot of time for agencies to adjust their programs in time for this funding cycle, he said.
“Our shelter in Morgantown does function a little like transitional housing, but we only have so many beds and we’re full already,” Phillips said. “So if money gets pulled out of a funding emergency shelter or whatever and toward transitional housing, we can’t respond immediately, because we can’t just add beds overnight. So to move toward developing processes like these, takes a little bit of time, and the timeline here is less than two months.”
It would be more effective to shift the funding away from permanent supportive housing and toward transitional programs over a number of years, he said. 
“We could argue whether we think that’s effective or not, but having a few years to transition would at least leave vulnerable individuals with a little bit of time for agencies to catch up,” he said. “But we don’t have that right now, so it’s going to be difficult.”

(Photo by Preston Keres/USDA)The Alliance for the Wild Rockies, Native Ecosystems Council, and Council on Wildlife and Fish filed a federal lawsuit to protect habitat for three rare wildlife species — grizzly bears, lynx, and sage grouse — on the Continental Divide, just north of  Lemhi Pass, where Lewis and Clark first crossed the Continental Divide from present day Montana into present day Idaho.
This area provides a critical wildlife corridor connecting the greater Yellowstone ecosystem to the Northern Continental Divide and Bitterroot ecosystems in Montana and Idaho.
The challenged Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest action, called the “Selway-Saginaw” project, allows destructive logging, road-building, and burning activities across thousands of acres of public lands in this 66,884-acre or 104.5-square-mile project area in a critical wildlife corridor.
We are deeply disappointed that the government would authorize this destructive project on our public lands considering the number of court rulings that have found similar projects illegal because such projects violate a number of federal laws designed to protect threatened wildlife.
The project area is enormous. It is located about 16 miles west of Bannack, Montana, Montana’s first territorial capital, and calls for bulldozing 69.3 miles of new and rebuilt logging roads to enable logging and burning 9,138 acres or 14.28 square miles of prime wildlife habitat.
The Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest recently pulled its decision for the Greenhorn project in the Gravelly Mountains when we filed a similar complaint. But the U.S. Forest Service is forcing us to sue them again to make them follow the law.
The Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest is also violating its forest plan’s requirements prohibiting burning sagebrush within 18 kilometers of sage grouse leks. Yet the Forest Service concedes that “Burning would temporarily reduce sagebrush cover in some areas . . . ” And the Forest Service’s own maps show almost the entire project area is within 18 kilometers of dozens of sage grouse leks. The project area contains 1,590 acres of priority habitat and 1,235 acres of general habitat for sage grouse.
Grizzly bears have been documented in the Big Hole Landscape and are suspected to occur in the project area. Currently, about 41% of the project area provides secure habitat for grizzlies. The Selway-Saginaw Project will further reduce grizzly bear secure habitat by 834 acres. There is no scientific research that finds that maintaining secure habitat at less than 42% is sufficient to maintain grizzly bears. The effect of this project would be long-term, approximately 15 to 20 years keeping grizzly bears with cubs from successfully denning in the area.
At the same time the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks is trucking grizzly bears from the Northern Continental Divide ecosystem to the Yellowstone ecosystem for genetic connectivity.
Why not just follow the law, protect the grizzly corridor, and let grizzlies walk there on their own? This is an important corridor where grizzlies from Yellowstone could travel to breed with grizzlies from other isolated grizzly populations, and do it without trucks and for free.
Almost everyone wants grizzlies to recover and eventually be removed from the protection of the Endangered Species Act, but before this can happen we once again need one connected population of grizzlies in the Northern Rockies.
Yet the Forest Service is pushing ahead with this logging and burning project which the Forest Service own estimates say will cost taxpayers $555,000. Yet, at the same time, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is spending millions trying to recover grizzly bears. This makes no sense and this project as a whole makes no sense and is illegal, which is why we are suing to stop it.

Every single one of these programs were once characterized by right wing politicians as a “socialist program.”  For example, let’s remember what Ronald Reagan said about Medicare before it was enacted: a) “From [Medicare] it’s a short step to all the rest of socialism;” b) ”Medicare will usher in federal programs that will invade every area of freedom as we have known it in this country.”; and c) if Medicare is passed “we are going to spend our sunset years telling our children and our children’s children what it once was like in America when men were free.”
I’m a capitalist who spent decades as a high-level executive in corporate America, working in states like West Virginia. Yes, government on all levels is generally not efficient. However, it’s very effective in many areas. And, in some cases, it has proven to be more efficient than the private sector.
For example, Medicare overhead/marketing is 2% versus 12% for private insurance companies. In this instance, socialized health insurance is clearly more cost-effective than private insurance. We are simply being held back from Medicare for All by the health care industrial complex (insurance companies, providers, drug companies) that like things the way they are, with tens of millions of dollars in compensation to their CEOs. They say that universal coverage is unaffordable, but studies show differently. Canada and other democracies with universal health care all have per capita health expenditures a fraction of ours … with better results.
Traditional Medicare was clearly an expansion of government when enacted 50+ years ago, but it’s one that the public supports. Before Medicare, only about half of all seniors were covered by private insurance. Polls have shown that virtually no voters, even the MAGA folks, want to do away with it now.
Will Medicare for All cause our insurance system to fall apart as Trump said in his 2018 USA Today editorial? Numerous polls show support for Medicare for All, including one recently illustrating 59% in favor. That poll showed support was strong in every category of Americans — except the MAGA faithful. A Gallup poll used the words “universal coverage” and had the same result — 62% supportive. Even almost two-thirds of independents were in favor. Again, the MAGA people were the only ones opposed.
America is still free and capitalistic despite what Reagan said about Medicare prior to enactment. Likewise, the sort of rhetoric spouted by West Virginia Secretary of State Kris Warner is simply a way of scaring American voters away from expansion of domestic programs designed to help the less fortunate. Programs that wealthier people like Warner’s financial backers will pay for and therefore dislike.
I’ve used Medicare as an example, but I could use many others. Social conservatives like Warner have a bad habit of talking about the ills of “socialism.” However, I don’t hear them asking that we convert our government employees in our military into private mercenaries. And, when we have used military “contractors,” the expense to the U.S. has been much greater.
In the above Facebook post, Warner also stated, “Let’s always hold fast to our Christian conservative values that made our state the best to raise a family in the country.” Yet, the numbers tell a different story about the state and its needs for public program expansion. For example, West Virginia has the fourth highest poverty rate in the nation at 14%… and the second highest mortality rate. It also has the third highest incarceration rate and third lowest income.
Instead of preaching about Christian values, West Virginians would be better off if Warner practiced Christianity by supporting the “socialist” programs he criticizes. As the bible (Proverbs 14:31) states, “Whoever oppresses the poor shows contempt for their Maker, but whoever is kind to the needy honors God.”

A girl reads a book in a school library. (Getty Images)The Department of Public Instruction (DPI) released data on the first year of annual literacy screenings this week, finding about 36% of 4K through third-grade students fell below the 25th percentile for reading.
Wisconsin Act 20, a 2023 law that made major changes to literacy education in the state, requires school districts to provide short literacy screenings to students as a way of identifying “at-risk” students. Students who scored below the 25th percentile on the reading screener are required under the law to receive a personal reading plan and additional support. Schools must report data on the screenings to the DPI, which is required to compile a report. 
The first annual report covers screenings done in the 2024-25 school year. 
The response rate to the reporting requirement was 98% with 428 out of 437 local education agencies submitting data.
State Superintendent Jill Underly said in a statement that the rate represents a strong commitment to the state’s literacy efforts, and that the report overall provides the state with a baseline.
“These data are critical in helping schools guide instruction and intervention — not to define a student’s potential,” Underly said. “School districts have already demonstrated their strong commitment to this effort, and I am encouraged by how fully they embraced the work from day one.” 
According to the report, 36.8% of Wisconsin students in 4K through the third grade — or 97,414 students — scored below the 25th percentile on their assessment of fundamental skills on universal screening assessments. 
The report also provides information on the number of students who have started receiving interventions. 
For students in 5K through third grade, a total of 86,228 students — or 40% of the total enrollment — began receiving interventions. Students in 4k are not required to have a personal reading plan.
The implementation of the law has been drawn out over the last couple of years. According to DPI, schools have also started receiving funding from the $50 million that was initially set aside in the 2023-25 state budget to help with professional development and training requirements as well as curriculum costs, but wasn’t released until the budget approved this year due to disagreements between lawmakers and Gov. Tony Evers.
“With time and a sustained investment in strengthened classroom instruction and, as needed, additional reading support, we can move steadily toward our goal of making sure every Wisconsin child excels at reading by the end of third grade,” Underly said.
Sen. John Jagler (R-Watertown), who assisted with leading the law through the Legislature, said in the statement that the results show the depth of the issues that Wisconsin students are facing.
“This shows why this law was needed in the first place. Hopefully, education leaders will focus on getting these students the interventions they need,” Jagler said.

At the same time, wages for most workers have not kept up with growth in the economy since the 1970s. (Getty Images)Every poll tells us that affordability is the major concern facing hardworking Americans. Many are increasingly angry as they watch the cost of goods and services spike — from groceries to housing to medical care. At the same time, wages and incomes fail to keep up. 
What’s behind this cost-of-living crunch? And what will our leaders do about it?
There are two sides to affordability: how much things cost, and how many resources people have to buy them. Both are a problem.
First, many Americans rightly believe that the price of basic needs has gotten out of control. Inadequate public investment means higher out-of-pocket costs for everything from child and health care to higher education. Corporate monopolies and financial speculation in industries ranging from housing to meat production to retirement savings have made things more expensive. And now across-the-board tariffs put in place by the Trump administration are raising costs further.
At the same time, wages for most workers have not kept up with growth in the economy since the 1970s. Wage growth comes from how much power workers have to bargain with their employers. And as policies have intentionally weakened unions and other forms of worker leverage, wages have fallen behind.
Thankfully, there are actions that can be taken now at the state level to address the problem of affordability. As KyPolicy outlines in a new report, “Building a Kentucky Workers Can Afford,” there are dozens of state policies that would grow worker power and family incomes while addressing the costs of basic goods and services.
For example, the state could repeal harmful laws undermining unions (like so-called right-to-work), expand collective bargaining rights and restore prevailing wage and minimum wage laws so there are more living wage jobs. Kentucky could also offer two years of tuition-free public higher education, and fund programs that help young people enter apprenticeships for good union employment.
The state could make historic one-time and annual investments in the Affordable Housing Trust Fund to vastly expand the supply of houses and apartments. Kentucky can reinvest in public schools, helping kids succeed in life and families address child mental health and food costs while also giving teachers a real, much-needed raise. 
The legislature could also create a Resiliency Fund to make infrastructure investments that can withstand extreme weather and spiking energy costs, creating good construction jobs in the process. That effort could include employing vulnerable young adults in a Kentucky Colonel Corps where they do one year of living wage public service after high school.
And the state could support families, including by enacting a child tax credit allowance that lifts 20% of kids out of poverty; providing paid family leave, universal preschool and affordable child care; and creating more options to make health insurance affordable using the state’s purchasing and regulatory power to crack down on corporate profiteering. Kentucky could also join 20 states that help put a secure retirement in reach by creating a state-managed retirement option for employees of all businesses and expand public investment in high-quality home care as our population ages.
Many of the ideas in the report build on successes in Kentucky’s past or policies that are proven to work in other states. And we can pay for this agenda from its economic benefits and savings and by balancing the tax code so that those at the top chip in for the investments that benefit us all. The richest 5% of Kentuckians are now pocketing $3.4 billion more a year because of state and federal tax cuts over the last decade. A windfall tax on those at the top could easily fund the ideas described above.
Affordability will be the political word of the year in 2026. Will it have real actions behind it?",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/housing-market-1024x685.jpeg,,,2025-12-03 05:58:34.457305

Wes Moore, and Mayor Muriel Bowser join other officials in signing the revised Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement. (Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)“We have a shared future here, and if we don’t address that shared future in a collaborative way, every single one of us will lose,” Delaware Gov. Matt Meyer said Tuesday in Baltimore, where Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and other regional representatives enacted a new, 15-year agreement to reduce pollution, build habitats, and protect the Chesapeake Bay.
The Bay is part of a network of over 180,000 miles of streams, creeks, and rivers and is the largest estuary in the country. The states surrounding the 64,000 square mile watershed have been working for decades to clean up the water, combat climate change impacts, and make the water more accessible. The Bay is the common denominator between the localities, which have unique environmental needs but a singular objective when it comes to the Bay, the officials acknowledged.
“But regardless of what separates us, we’re all united here with a common goal: protect the Bay, protect its history,  protect the people who are alive and rely on this for livelihood,” said Maryland’s Gov. Wes Moore. “Protect the chance that for each and every one of our future generations, they can have something that they can flourish in and enjoy.”
The Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement was originally drafted in 1983 to bring the states surrounding the bay together to clean up the water and preserve critical habitats and wetlands. The last agreement was signed by Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, West Virginia, New York, Pennsylvania, the District of Columbia, and Environmental Protection Agency officials in 2014. 
The 2025 agreement focuses on four main goals and has 21 outcomes the states can strive for over the next 15 years. 
Reducing pollution remains a key focus 
Part of the agreement requires states to reduce the amount of pollutants each allows into the Bay. 
The EPA established Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) in 2010, which calculated the amount of sediment, nitrogen and phosphorus reductions needed at that time to restore the bay to a healthy level. Since then, Virginia’s progress towards the goals has been mixed, with the state having met 49% of the nitrogen reductions, 64% for phosphorus, and 100% of sediment reductions. 
The TMDL is managed by the EPA and the maximum amounts allowed in the Bay will not be changed in the new agreement. It would take federal approval to put more enforcement behind the requirements.
Models by Chesapeake Progress, a tool that helps track states’ progress towards TMDL goals,  show that while Virignia has greatly reduced its phosphorus running off into the waterway, it is still the largest polluter of the surrounding states and the third largest for nitrogen.
Virginia’s progress
Virginia’s gains in reducing sediment and other harmful chemicals in the Bay has been largely thanks to efforts through the cost share program that allows producers to apply for grants to help them implement best practices that reduce the amount of runoff from their farms.
Virginia has made strong strides in sediment reduction, oyster reef growth, blue crab abundance, and many of the 31 outcomes and ten goals laid out by the agreement in 2014. The commonwealth is behind in its goals for wetland protection, aquatic vegetation, forest buffers, and climate adaptations.
“I think we’ve settled on a very good framework that sets 2040 as the next huge milestone date and yet provides intermediate checkpoints along the way,” Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said. “Checkpoints that hold ourselves accountable so that we will indeed see the kind of progress that we’ve made in the last four years continue.”
Tweaked language concerning climate
Unlike the 2014 agreement, which included a goal for the Bay “to withstand adverse impacts from changing environmental and climate conditions”, the 2025 agreement does not state the word “climate” once. It uses language like “changing environmental conditions” to describe the goals for wetlands, habitats, and healthy landscapes. 
When asked about this shift in messaging, Chesapeake Bay Commission Chair Sara Love said climate resiliency hasn’t been removed from the ultimate goals of the agreement.
“We are taking climate change and resiliency, not as a single goal, but taking it throughout every single goal, every single outcome. It is the lens through which we look at everything,” Love said. “So rather than actually taking it out, we’re spreading it throughout the entire agreement.”
More opportunities to invest in the Bay
This version of the agreement presents a broader scope of projects and waterways that can contribute to the restoration efforts. 
Chris Moore, Virginia executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, said that the agreements’ efforts to have more direct connections between habitats, healthy landscapes, clean water and public education will help keep Virginia on track to meet the goals of the compact over the next 15 years.
“Virginia still is not investing, honestly, the resources that are peer states are when it comes to the Bay agreement, when it comes to education funding,” Moore said. ”So that’s obviously something right there that’s kind of directly out of the agreement that hopefully will come up during the General Assembly.”
With Tuesday’s singing, the governors also agreed to make recommendations for the best ways to bring the tribal nations of the Chesapeake Bay to the table for future discussions. Members of the seven federally recognized tribes in Virginia asked to be signatories on the agreement but were blocked by red tape.
The revised Bay agreement also includes new benchmarks for wetland restoration, crab, fish, and oyster population goals, and a promise to try and include more localities in the regional goals and outcomes of the agreement.
“I think this is a moment of hope and a moment of optimism for the Bay and for our respective states and the District of Columbia,” Shapiro said.

A Virginia commission on Tuesday advanced a revised plan for a legal retail market that emphasizes testing, zoning controls and small-business access. (Photo by Pixabay/Creative Commons license)Virginia lawmakers took another decisive step Tuesday toward launching a legal cannabis retail market in 2026, unveiling a revised legislative blueprint that scraps local opt-outs, tightens ownership rules and aims to favor small, independent operators over deep-pocketed national brands.
The Joint Commission on the Future of Cannabis Sales met for the final time before the General Assembly gavels in this January, capping months of hearings, stakeholder briefings and community meetings. 
After Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed last year’s bill, the commission’s revised framework attempts to salvage and overhaul earlier attempts — and to address what legislators described as persistent loopholes around consolidation, equity and uneven local control.
“Over the past few months, our commission has worked diligently to review existing law and develop a bill that will not only establish a much needed adult use retail market here in Virginia, but also reflect what Virginians want it to be,” said Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, the commission’s chair, who opened the two-hour meeting by thanking the room packed with industry players, farmers, faith leaders and public-health advocates. “And we’ve listened to you.”
Krizek made clear, however, that while the commission is aligned on many major components, the exact bill text remains under revision. 
“We are not actually unveiling the actual bill, because there’s still a lot of tweaking going on,” he said, adding that commissioners remain “100% on the same page” about the structure needed to launch retail sales by Nov. 1, 2026. 
“We’ve got some things that we still need to work on, and we’re going to continue to do so.”
 A long road from 2021 to a full retail market

Tuesday’s meeting reflected how close lawmakers now are to completing the work that began when Virginia legalized possession, home cultivation and limited personal sharing of cannabis in 2021. 
Even after that important step, lawmakers never finalized the second stage of legalization — the commercial framework — leaving Virginians able to legally possess marijuana but with no legal place to buy it. 
That gap spurred the growth of an unregulated market of vape shops, hemp-derived THC products and illicit storefronts that regulators and police say have outpaced the state’s ability to monitor them.
Lawmakers revived the effort after Youngkin rejected a previous retail legislation, pushing forward with a new commission structure and a set of goals centered on safety, equity and protecting small businesses. 
Krizek said the new draft reflects those priorities — and the need for a regulated marketplace with testing, labeling and age verification. 
“Our biggest concern has been public safety,” he said. “A regulated retail market will replace the illicit market.”
He said the legislation “builds a new market that supports hundreds of small businesses and strengthens Virginia agriculture, reduces the racial disparities created by the prohibition on marijuana, and, most importantly, protects public safety and health.”
 Local opt-outs removed — a defining policy shift

One of the most closely watched shifts is the removal of the local opt-out provision.
Local governments would no longer be able to ban cannabis retail through referenda. Krizek said the change was rooted in lessons learned from other states where patchwork rules allowed robust illicit markets to flourish in “dry” counties.
“The one big change is that we do not allow localities to opt out,” he said. “So there will not be any dry counties, like in the days of alcohol (prohibition).”
Local governments would still control zoning and could levy up to a 3.5% local cannabis tax, giving them flexibility to shape how sales operate in their jurisdictions.
The change drew immediate objections from socially conservative groups. 
“I think we’re extremely discouraged by the fact that we’re not going to have some type of local referendum,” said Todd Gathje of The Family Foundation. “(Localities) may not want this, and they should be able to let the citizens decide.” 
Gathje argued legalization would not curb illegal sales and cited national research showing illicit markets remain active.
Another major pillar of the proposal is preventing large multistate companies from dominating Virginia’s market. 
Taylor Mey, an attorney with the Division of Legislative Services, said the draft incorporates months of expert testimony and adjusts language from the previous vetoed bill.
“These proposed changes should be understood as changes to the statutory language that was in the bills last year,” Mey said, adding that stakeholder input shaped the revisions.
Under the new framework, the Cannabis Control Authority would have broad authority to review ownership deals and financial arrangements for signs of vertical integration or undue influence. 
All owners would be traced to their “ultimate beneficial” identity, transfers would require state approval, and no one could hold more than one Tier IV cultivation license. The CCA would publish a public registry of ownership and submit annual reports to the commission.
 Supporting small businesses through impact licenses

Krizek said equity and access remain central, describing a system designed to prioritize small operations over large corporate entrants. “Equity is not an afterthought though, it’s a foundation as well,” he said.
Under the proposal, microbusiness licenses are reframed as “impact licensees.” Applicants must meet at least four of seven race-neutral criteria tied to past criminalization, agricultural distress or geographic disadvantage. 
The license would allow limited cultivation, processing and direct-to-consumer sales, including delivery.
A temporary direct-to-consumer microbusiness track — capped at 100 — would allow qualifying hemp growers and processors to begin cultivating and selling cannabis earlier than full retail stores, beginning no sooner than Nov. 1, 2026. 
Krizek said the early access could help small operators establish themselves before larger retailers enter the market.
Rural leaders urged lawmakers to ensure those pathways remain inclusive. 
The Rev. William Avon Keen of Halifax County warned that production caps could sideline minority farmers, as happened historically in tobacco. 
“The limited licenses and the limitations may, in one area, cut out certain people to be in this business,” he said.
Speakers also pressed the commission to prioritize youth protections and enforcement. 
Cynthia Phillips of Danville said communities need more education about secondhand smoke and how cannabis use affects employment eligibility. “And the other one is services for those that become addicted to this product,” she said.
The Rev. Ricky Hailstock of Lynchburg urged lawmakers to address illegal vape and smoke shops that he said are selling unsafe and untested products to minors.
“I just ask the commission to consider … determining the legal limits on the amounts of the product that individuals could possess,” he added.
Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, said Virginia’s current $25 penalty for public consumption is too weak to deter smoking cannabis on sidewalks or near restaurants. 
“I think that’s much too lenient a penalty,” he said, adding that expanded inspections of vape shops could help uncover violations.
 Remaining disagreements and the road to January

Commission members signaled broad support for the overall structure but acknowledged continuing disagreements. 
“It’s kind of a mixed bag on this bill,” said Del. Buddy Fowler, R-Hanover. “There’s some things that I really like, and there’s some things there I really hate.”
Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, said the commission is still balancing “today’s political and economic realities” with the need to avoid strengthening the illicit market. “I think we have a little bit more work to do to achieve that balance,” she said. “Please keep your comments coming, we really do read every single one.”
Sen. Lashrecse Aird, D-Petersburg, the commission’s co-chair, emphasized that the draft remains fluid. 
“You will hear support for some of those recommendations, and you will hear continued opposition,” she said. “They are simply recommendations that will continue to be fluid … through the legislative process.”
Advocates raised concerns about the timeline. 
Chelsea Hicks Wise of Marijuana Justice Virginia said the Cannabis Control Authority may not be staffed in time for a Nov. 1, 2026, retail launch. “If the micros and the hemp conversions are not ready … it would only be the medical folks that are there and able to sell,” she said.
Krizek reiterated the timeline: license applications on July 1, 2026, early microbusiness operations starting in September and the full market opening Nov. 1. “This is just a step in the process,” he said. “We continue to require your feedback.”
For the first time since legalization in 2021, lawmakers now have a clear path to a regulated market — and a proposal that Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger has vowed to sign into law following thorough review.

	The Trump administration, which has promised “radical transparency,” said in an FAQ that it plans to publish the “project summary” for states that win awards. Following the lead of federal regulators, many states are withholding their complete applications, and some have refused to release any details.
“Let’s be clear,” said Alan Morgan, chief executive of the National Rural Health Association. “The hospital CEOs, the clinic administrators, the community leaders: They’re going to want to know what their states are doing.” The NRHA’s members include struggling rural hospitals and clinics, which federal lawmakers promised would benefit from the Trump administration’s Rural Health Transformation Program.
Morgan said his members are interested in what states propose, which of their ideas are approved or rejected, and their budget narratives, which detail how the money could be spent.
Improving rural health care is an “insanely complicated and difficult task,” Morgan said.
The five-year Rural Health Transformation Program was approved by Congress in a law — the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — that also drastically cuts Medicaid spending, on which rural providers heavily depend. It’s being watched closely because it’s a much-needed influx of funds — with a caveat from the Trump administration that the money be spent on transformational ideas, not just to prop up ailing rural hospitals.
The law says half of the $50 billion will be divided equally among all states with an approved application. The rest will be distributed through a points-based system. Of the second half, $12.5 billion will be allotted based on each state’s rurality. The remaining $12.5 billion will go to states that score well on initiatives and policies that, in part, mirror the Trump administration’s “Make America Healthy Again” objectives.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has repeatedly promised to open the government to the American people. His agency has a webpage devoted to “radical transparency.”
“We’re working to make this the most transparent HHS in its 70-year history,” Kennedy said in written testimony to lawmakers in September.
Lawrence Gostin, a professor of public health law at Georgetown University, said HHS is “acting in a way that utterly lacks transparency” and that the public has the right to demand “greater openness and clarity.” Without transparency, the public cannot hold HHS accountable, he said.
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services spokesperson Catherine Howden said the agency will follow the federal regulations governing competitive grant materials when releasing information about the rural health program.
Grant applications are “not released to the public during the merit review process,” Howden said, adding, “The purpose of this policy is to protect the integrity of evaluations, applicant confidentiality, and the competitive nature of the process.”
Democrats and many health care advocates are concerned politics will affect how much money states get.
“I am very concerned about retaliation,” said Rep. Nikki Budzinski (D-Ill.). Because Democrats control her state’s politics, “our application might not be as seriously considered as other states that have Republican leadership,” she added.
Illinois’ Democratic members of the U.S. House sent a letter to CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz in November asking for “full and fair consideration” of their state application. Illinois officials have not yet released their state’s proposal to KFF Health News, which has a pending public records request.
Heather Howard, a professor of the practice at Princeton University, said she is “pleasantly surprised at how transparent the states have been.”
Howard directs the university’s State Health and Value Strategies program, which is tracking the rural health fund, and praised most states for publicly posting their project summaries.
“To me, it speaks to the intense interest in this program,” Howard said. Her team, reviewing about two dozen state summaries, found themes including expansion of home-based and mobile services, increased use of technology, and workforce development initiatives like scholarships, signing bonuses, and child care assistance for high-demand positions.
“I think it’s exciting,” Howard said. “What’s great here is the experimentation we’re going to learn from.”
Telerobotics appeared in Georgia’s and Alabama’s applications, she said, including a proposal to use robotic equipment for remote ultrasounds.
Another theme that “warms my heart,” Howard said, was the effort among states to create advisory groups or committees, including in Idaho, where work groups are expected to focus on technology, workforce development, tribal collaboration, and behavioral health.
All 50 states submitted applications to federal regulators by the Nov. 5 deadline and awards will be announced by the end of the year, according to CMS.
As of late November, nearly 40 states had released their project narrative, the main part of the application, which describes proposed initiatives, according to KFF Health News tracking. More than a dozen states have also released their budget narratives.
A handful of states — Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Carolina, and Wyoming — released all parts of the application.
KFF Health News filed public records requests for states’ complete applications. Some states have refused to release any of their application materials.
Nebraska, for example, rejected a public records request, saying its application materials are “proprietary or commercial information” that “would give advantage to business competitors.”
Kentucky shared its application summary but said the remainder of the application is a “preliminary draft” not subject to release under state laws.
Erika Engle, a spokesperson for Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, said the governor “is committed to transparency” but declined to share any of the state’s proposal.
Hawaii and other states are still processing formal public records requests.
The rural health program is part of the July law projected to reduce federal Medicaid spending in rural areas by $137 billion over 10 years.
Those cuts are expected to affect rural health facilities’ bottom lines, threatening their ability to stay open. A recent Commonwealth Fund report found that rural areas continue to lack access to primary care. But the guidelines for the rural health program say states can use only 15% of their new funding to pay providers for patient care.
Between the Medicaid cuts and funding boost from the new program, “there’s real opportunity for national policy to impact rural, both in the negative and the positive potentially,” said Celli Horstman, a senior research associate at the New York-based policy think tank who co-authored the report.
Among the publicly available rural health transformation proposals, Democratic-leaning states show support, or are willing to adopt, some of the administration’s goals but will lose out on points from eschewing others.
For example, New Mexico said it would introduce legislation requiring students to take the Presidential Fitness Test and physicians to complete continuing education courses on nutrition. But it won’t prevent people from using their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits to buy “non-nutritious” foods such as soda and candy.
Many states want to invest in technology, including telehealth, cybersecurity, and remote patient monitoring equipment. Other themes include increasing access to healthy food, improving emergency services, preventing and managing chronic illnesses, and enlisting community health workers and paramedics for home visits.
Specific proposals include:

Arkansas wants to spend $5 million through its “FAITH” program — Faith-based Access, Interventions, Transportation, & Health — to enlist rural religious institutions to host education and preventive screening events. Congregations could also install walking circuits and fitness equipment.
Alaska, which historically relied on dogsled teams to bring medication to remote areas, is looking to test the use of “unmanned aerial systems” to speed up pharmacy deliveries to such communities.
Tennessee wants to increase access to healthy activities by spending money on parks, trails, and farmers markets.
Maryland wants to start mobile markets and install refrigerators and freezers to improve access to fresh, healthy food that often spoils in rural areas with few grocery stores.

State Sen. Stephen Meredith, a Republican who represents part of western Kentucky, said he still expects rural hospitals to close despite his state’s rural health transformation program.
“I think we’re treating symptoms without curing the disease,” he said after listening to a presentation on Kentucky’s proposal at a state committee meeting.
Morgan, whose organization represents rural hospitals likely to close, said the state’s ideas may sound good.
“You can craft a narrative that sounds wonderful,” he said. “But then translating the aspirational goals to a functioning program? That’s difficult.”

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)If Virginia’s election last month was more than an unleashing of anti-Trump sentiment (and it definitely was that), it was about affordability. Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger made the cost of living the focus of her campaign, frequently mentioning high energy bills. House Democrats, whose majority has been boosted by the addition of 13 new members of their party, are also expected to focus on these bread-and-butter issues. 
In Virginia, the cause of these high bills is not hard to identify: Data centers are driving up demand well beyond the available supply, and high fossil fuel prices are pinching a state that relies on natural gas for most of its electricity. Spanberger has committed to making data centers “pay their fair share,” and both she and legislators will be looking for other opportunities to lower costs.
With Democrats in charge, Spanberger targets lower energy bills — and higher costs for data centers

The bad news is that adding ever more data centers across Virginia means the upward pressure on electricity prices will continue. If the governor and legislators don’t want to kick tech companies to states with spare capacity, and if the administration of President Donald Trump continues to throttle the energy supply with its war on wind and solar, lowering energy costs in the near term likely isn’t possible. 
Even so, there is a lot that Spanberger and the General Assembly can do to protect residential consumers from these higher prices. 
Making data centers pay their fair share means more than tweaking rate structures. Several Virginia utilities have created special rate classes for large load users like data centers. The utilities will require data center operators to sign long-term contracts committing them to paying for a large percentage of the electricity and transmission they say they need, even if they don’t end up using that much or leave the Virginia market prematurely. 
These new tariffs can help protect other customers from some – though not all – of the risk involved in serving data centers, but they don’t address the “fair share” issue. The current allocation of transmission costs, with residential ratepayers picking up most of the tab for new lines that don’t benefit them, needs to change. If the SCC determines it doesn’t have authority to do that on its own, the General Assembly and Spanberger should pass legislation to make it happen. 
The harder problem is how to make residents whole for rate increases that result from data centers gobbling up all available power. The supply and demand problem has been compounded by a lot of bad decisions, with plenty of blame to go around. The federal government has driven up fossil fuel prices by allowing the export of increasing amounts of natural gas, while hindering and even blocking solar and offshore wind projects that could make up the deficit. 
Outgoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin is to blame for illegally pulling Virginia out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), removing the market incentive for Virginia utilities to increase investments in low-cost renewable energy instead of burning expensive fossil fuels. (His promotion of the false narrative that gas is “cheap” doesn’t help.)

Virginia utilities share the blame for relying too much on natural gas and high-priced electricity imported from other PJM states. And grid operator PJM is to blame for failing to approve enough new generation, including wind and solar facilities that make up the vast majority of projects waiting for approval to interconnect.
This history leaves Spanberger with a fine mess. Keeping prices in check now requires two things that can actually be accomplished during the next four years: a greater buildout of solar generation and energy storage to get more capacity on the grid; and investments in energy efficiency and rooftop solar to take pressure off the demand side.    
Solve utility solar siting with agrivoltaics. Virginia needs more energy, and solar is the only source that can be built quickly. Yet one of the knottiest problems confronting the General Assembly in the past few years has been the rise of anti-solar sentiment in rural counties. 
Landowners who want to lease their property for solar, or even to install arrays for their own use, find themselves stymied by opposition from neighbors who don’t like the look and are able to persuade county boards to deny permits. As we’ve seen, sometimes denial of a solar permit even follows approval of an energy-sucking data center.
Data centers approved, solar farms rejected: What is going on in rural Virginia?

Last year the General Assembly came close to passing a bill that would require solar developers to implement industry best practices. Passing legislation like that this year will address the legitimate concerns of localities around controlling erosion and maintaining native plant buffers. But more can be done to make solar look and function like a normal part of Virginia’s agricultural economy.
Already, solar facilities have become integrated with agriculture, as sheep and sometimes cattle take over vegetation management and farmers learn which crops do well growing between rows of solar arrays. It’s a trend that offers benefits to the land and the community alike. Farmers are struggling; solar can provide a stable income while protecting land from permanent development and putting much-needed energy on the grid. 
Businesses are ahead of public policy on this. Virginia-based Gray’s Lambscaping manages vegetation with over 800 sheep at solar farms across the state, and the company plans to grow to over 5,000 sheep by the end of this year. Meanwhile, solar panels have proven compatible with a wide range of food crops.  
Virginia should take a leading role in expanding agrivoltaics. Virginia law already recognizes the right to farm as an exception to localities’ authority over land use decisions, and this should be extended to farmers who put solar on their land, as long as they are also using the same land for traditional agricultural practices like grazing and crops. 
Install solar on new public buildings and schools. Heck, put it everywhere.  In the past ten years or so, Virginia’s commercial solar sector has blossomed while saving taxpayers money. To date, an estimated 150 Virginia schools have installed solar panels, saving schools about 25% on their energy bills. Solar on every sunny school rooftop would add up to more than 1,000 MW of carbon-free generation. Extend the effort to the roofs of all suitable public buildings across the state, and that number can go much higher. 
Dominion and APCo have long tried to squelch competition from rooftop solar, a war that looks increasingly foolish as Virginia finds itself short on energy for all customers. Earlier this year Congress drastically accelerated the phase-out of solar tax incentives, but the savings remain available for commercial and utility-scale projects for the next two years. There is no shortage of good ideas out there to be acted upon. Spanberger and legislators should take full advantage of that opportunity to install as much solar as possible. 
Battery storage at data centers does triple duty. While solar is the cheapest, cleanest, and fastest way to generate power, it needs batteries or other forms of energy storage to make it into a 24/7 resource, and storage remains relatively expensive. For tech companies, however, the calculus makes more sense.
Data centers need backup power anyway; they typically have three layers of redundancy so that they never risk losing power when the grid goes down. Today the backup power is mostly provided by massive diesel generators, sometimes three times as many as they might actually need. Most of these have no pollution controls and are therefore not supposed to run except in emergencies and for testing and maintenance. 
Some tech companies are now installing generators with selective catalytic converters that produce fewer emissions. The catch is that these can legally be used in non-emergency situations, raising the possibility that they might be used for demand-response or peak shaving. In effect, data centers would be solving the peak demand problem with one of the dirtiest forms of energy. The cumulative effect on air quality could be worrisome, and Virginia’s carbon footprint would grow at a time when the law says it should be shrinking. 
What if, instead of diesel generators, data centers installed storage as their first line of defense against power outages, leaving diesel generators to be used only in the rare case of extended grid outages? Air quality would benefit, carbon emissions would decrease, and the data centers would have the backup power they need. The tech companies would pay more upfront but could be compensated by utilities for using their storage capability for grid services and demand response, lowering their draw from the grid at peak demand times. 
All the data centers in Virginia today use 6 gigawatts of power. That much storage would exceed the targets set in the VCEA for Dominion and APCo combined.  Even limiting the requirement to two hours of storage at new data centers would bring enough storage online quickly to eliminate the expensive demand peaks that drive the high price of energy.

Require data center operators to source their own zero-carbon electricity. Most of the tech companies have sustainability commitments that they aren’t meeting, so it isn’t asking too much of them to put them in charge of this effort. Legislation to require this as a condition of accepting Virginia’s generous tax subsidies has been defeated for the past two years. The difference this year is that rising energy prices are now affecting everyone. 
Under this proposal, the zero-carbon electricity doesn’t have to come from Virginia, as long as it is available to customers here. Maybe the tech companies could even tap into their considerable influence with the Trump administration to make electricity more plentiful and affordable by reversing its war on solar and wind energy.
Why, after all, should Virginia residents sacrifice for the richest corporations in the world? If “paying their fair share” means anything, it should mean that data centers, not residents, bear the costs of making enough energy available to Virginia, and complying with our clean energy mandate.
Lower demand with energy efficiency and distributed solar. The gap between energy supply and demand does not have to be filled entirely through supply-side solutions. Lowering demand should also be part of the solution. Virginia utilities, Dominion in particular, have done a poor job of running energy efficiency programs. Looking on the bright side, though, that means plenty of opportunities remain.
House Democrats have already started work on this issue, with a focus on lowering winter heating costs for lower-income households. As reported in the Mercury last week, HB 2, from Farifax Del. Mark Sickles, requires Dominion and APCo to make their “best, reasonable efforts” to provide energy efficiency and weatherization to 30% of income-qualified customers by the end of 2031. HB 3, from  Del. Destiny Levere Bolling, D-Henrico, sets up a task force to study income-qualified energy efficiency and weatherization.  
These steps are okay for starters, and they would be juiced by the influx of money from RGGI carbon auctions (see next section), earmarked for low-income energy efficiency. But Dominion has repeatedly failed to meet the energy efficiency targets the legislature sets for it, and after all, why stop with 30% of low-income customers when all households could benefit from more comprehensive programs? Virginia can do much better.  
My last column discussed Rewiring America’s proposal to have tech companies pay for heat pumps, solar and batteries in the residential sector, saving money for households and freeing up capacity for data centers to come online sooner. An independent provider could run the program and verify the energy savings.  
(If the tech companies complain that an awful lot of the solutions I’m proposing come at their expense, it’s true. But the industry benefits from a state tax subsidy that has reached nearly a billion dollars per year, and will only grow further as the number of data centers doubles and triples. They can afford to give back.) 
Use RGGI for long-term affordability. Gov.-elect Spanberger has committed to seeing Virginia rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), the compact of northeastern states working to lower carbon emissions by 30% by 2030. RGGI works by requiring owners of carbon-emitting generating plants to buy carbon allowances at auction, penalizing carbon-intensive generation and rewarding investments in zero-carbon facilities like wind, solar and nuclear. States collect the auction proceeds, which in Virginia are dedicated to low-income energy efficiency and climate adaptation measures.
Republicans have already renewed their attacks on RGGI, calling it a tax on energy consumers. To the extent that’s true, it’s a tax mostly paid by the largest consumers (including data centers) for the benefit of low-income residents and people most vulnerable to storms and sea level rise. Moreover, all energy consumers benefit over the longer term as low-cost clean energy increasingly replaces expensive fossil fuels. 
Beef up efficiency standards in the residential building code. Most people who buy a new home assume that modern building codes incorporate the latest standards for insulation and efficient technology. In Virginia, they do not. Buyers would be dismayed to learn that their homes are costing them more on their utility bills than they saved on a purchase price supposedly made more affordable by poorer-quality insulation and appliances. Buyers are rarely consulted on these trade-offs, and few have the expertise to question a builder’s choices. Building codes are supposed to do that job.
Unfortunately, Virginia’s Board of Housing and Community Development, which writes the code, is dominated by the homebuilding industry. The industry wants to build homes as cheaply as possible to ensure the highest profit possible on the homes it sells. Even as national model code standards have become more rigorous, homebuilders have protected their own interests by keeping weak energy efficiency requirements in Virginia’s residential building code. 
In 2021, Virginia adopted legislation requiring the board to consider and adopt energy standards “at least as stringent as” the latest national model code standards when the benefits over time to residents and the public exceed the incremental costs of construction. But the board simply didn’t do it. Will this be the year legislators realize that a board dominated by the industry it regulates won’t act in the public interest without explicit directions? 
This is Virginia’s moment. Since the passage of the Virginia Clean Economy Act in 2020, renewable energy and storage have only gotten cheaper, while energy efficiency opportunities remain plentiful. Coal has solidified its place as the most expensive baseload source, and fossil gas remains stubbornly expensive compared to solar. Spanberger and the Democratic majority have an opening this year to go big on clean energy. An aggressive legislative agenda this year will demonstrate national leadership on managing the data center buildout while delivering climate, health and economic benefits to all Virginians.

(Photo by Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline)As food prices remain high, the Trump administration has made it easier for farmers to hire foreign guest workers and to pay them less. Now, other industries with large immigrant workforces also are asking for relief as they combat labor shortages and raids.
Visas for temporary foreign workers are a quick fix with bipartisan support in Congress. And Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins’ office told Stateline that “streamlining” visas for both agricultural and other jobs is a priority for the Trump administration.
But some experts warn that such visas can be harmful if they postpone immigration overhauls that would give immigrant workers a path to green cards and citizenship.
Trump allows more foreign ag workers, eases off ICE raids on farms

“Lack of permanent status is costly to migrants, employers, and the broader economy,” wrote Pia Orrenius, a labor economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, in a report published in June. Workers are “vulnerable to policy changes triggered by a change in administration, most recently the threat of mass deportations.”
In a Nov. 25 interview with Stateline, Orrenius said the crackdown on illegal immigration could be a good thing if it leads to permanent solutions.
“If you can stop undocumented immigration, then great. This is a great time to work on comprehensive immigration reform,” Orrenius said. “Where is there a scarcity of workers and how do we address those legally instead of illegally?”
Restaurants, construction and landscaping businesses have lost a combined 315,000 immigrant workers through August this year, more than any other industries, according to a Stateline analysis of Current Population Survey data provided by the University of Minnesota at ipums.org.
The construction industry needs more foreign worker visas like those already being provided for agriculture to prevent more delays in building everything from homes to highways, business owners say.
The industry needs help to “provide lawful workers while working to prepare more Americans for permanent careers in construction,” said Jaime Andress, testifying at a congressional hearing last month on behalf of the Associated General Contractors of America trade group. About 92% of contractors with open positions are having trouble finding enough skilled labor, whether it’s for construction of buildings, highways or utility infrastructure, she testified.
There are about 145,000 fewer immigrants working in restaurants, on average, through August of this year compared with the same period in 2024, the Stateline analysis found. There are about 127,000 fewer in construction and 43,000 fewer in landscaping.


One landscaping firm, which did not agree to an interview, lost $50,000 in contracts this year when workers stopped showing up because of rumored immigration raids, said Rebecca Shi, chief executive officer of the Chicago-based American Business Immigration Coalition, which advocates for employers seeking immigration changes.
“He had 75 workers and 50 of them didn’t show up one day because there were rumors ICE was going to be in the area,” Shi said. “Many of them were citizens and legal workers, but they were worried about family members and neighbors, so they didn’t show up either. It’s bad for the economy when you lose a worker, but it’s also the fear and uncertainty. We know restaurants that have lost 50% of staff and are at risk of closing because people just aren’t showing up.”
The coalition organized a “fly-in” in October to Washington, D.C., to ask members of Congress for more help to legalize immigrant workers through work permits in hospitality, agriculture, construction, elder care, health care and manufacturing.
In a letter dated Dec. 2, thousands of businesses in all 50 states asked the administration for an additional 64,716 H-2B visas, saying they rely on them for seasonal surges in hospitality, tourism, landscaping, forestry, seafood production and other industries.
And a bipartisan group of 33 U.S. senators from 22 states signed a letter Nov. 13 by Maine Independent Sen. Angus King and South Dakota Republican Sen. Mike Rounds asking for more H-2B seasonal employment visas.
“Employers’ workforce needs cannot be met with American workers alone,” the letter said.
Farmworkers sue over Trump’s low wages for foreign guest workers

Construction contractors say they need visas that are similar to the H-2A visas for agriculture that the Trump administration streamlined in October to make them easier and cheaper for farmers to hire temporary foreign workers.
The Associated General Contractors of America wants visas like the proposed new H-2C visas floated by Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Rep. Lloyd Smucker. Those would allow up to 85,000 less-skilled temporary workers in construction, hospitality and other fields to stay in this country up to nine years. The bill, introduced in September, has not advanced.
The association also supports a pathway to legal status for some workers already in the country, as proposed by Florida Republican U.S. Rep. María Elvira Salazar and Texas Democratic U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar. The bill, introduced in July, also has not advanced.
“Workforce shortages are the leading cause of construction project delays,” said Brian Turmail, a vice president at the association. “Nearly 1 out of 3 contractors have been impacted in one way or another by enhanced ICE enforcement activities. That number is almost certain to increase now that ICE has received significant boosts to its budget as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”










Workforce shortages are the leading cause of construction project delays.

Those industries are asking for more help as the latest federal immigration raids further affect workforces in Illinois, Maryland and North Carolina, with more raids planned in Louisiana. Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data research organization at Syracuse University, reported a “massive redeployment of government military and civilian personnel to immigration enforcement” in recent months, with total detentions reaching more than 65,000, according to a Nov. 24 report. Nearly three-quarters of those arrested have no criminal convictions.
Construction, landscaping and other industries are already heavy users of H-2B visas for temporary non-agricultural foreign workers, according to government figures reviewed by Stateline.
Trump migrant deportations could threaten states’ agricultural economies

In fiscal year 2025, which ended in September, there were about 209,000 H-2B visas, with Texas (20,051), Florida (18,515), North Carolina (8,634), Colorado (7,723) and Louisiana (7,234) getting the most. The most common occupations were building and grounds (94,152); food service (31,403); construction (16,729); farming, fishing and forestry (15,665); and personal care (12,170).
Some of the largest users of the visas last year were Core Tech Construction of New York City, a concrete coring and cutting firm (2,619 visas); ABC Professional Tree Services of Texas, which provides land clearance services (1,913); and Progressive Solutions LLC of Arkansas, which provides herbicide application to utilities (1,882).
The H-2B visa program needs to be streamlined and expanded to be useful for employers and workers, said David Bier, director of immigration studies at the libertarian CATO Institute, who has written about the visas.
Employers don’t always get the workers they want because the United States limits H-2B visas to 33,000 twice a year. Requests for the visas have already surpassed the 33,000 cap for the first half of fiscal 2026.
“The paperwork is a nightmare for employers and there are a lot of steps for workers also,” said Bier. “And there are so few visas available that your chance of getting all you need is almost nil.”

An oversight group for Ohio’s electric grid operator, PJM Interconnection, is asking federal officials to weigh in on the future of data centers. Monitoring Analytics, PJM’s independent market monitor, contends reliability should be PJM’s priority. But recent proposals contemplate bringing data centers online despite the possibility of periodic blackouts.
Monitoring Analytics wants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to clarify that PJM can, and should, halt data center interconnection if it doesn’t have adequate power.
Ohio background
There are more than 200 data centers in Ohio already, and American Electric Power has claimed 30 gigawatts-worth of proposed data center projects want to connect to the grid.
For context, peak load for the entire state of Ohio was 9.4 gigawatts in 2023.
To manage that demand, AEP instituted a moratorium on new data centers and lobbied state regulators for a new data center-specific tariff with minimum purchase requirements and exit fees if a facility folds.
Ohio regulators approved the pricing plan, over the objection of The Ohio Manufacturers’ Association and others.
The group is currently challenging the tariff in the Ohio Supreme Court.
The Ohio Manufacturers’ Association contends AEP didn’t have the right to declare a moratorium in the first place, and that it hasn’t backed up its claims about prospective demand.

In September, after regulators approved the tariff, AEP cut its forecasts from 30 gigawatts to 13.
A recent study funded by the Ohio Chamber Foundation indicated companies like Amazon, Google, Meta and others have committed more than $40 billion in Ohio projects over the next decade.
The chamber’s analysis suggests data centers will need 7.6 gigawatts of additional power by 2030 and quoted a study by the Ohio Business Roundtable projecting demand to grow to 15 gigawatts by 2034.
Market monitor’s complaint
As an independent market monitor, Monitoring Analytics operates as a kind of ombudsman for PJM Interconnection.
The company reviews PJM’s procedures, rules, and structure to ensure its energy market is operating competitively.
In November, Monitoring Analytics joined several other stakeholders to try to agree on new rules governing data centers.
They voted on a dozen ideas but couldn’t reach consensus.
Following the meeting, PJM spokesman Jeffrey Shields issued a statement explaining “PJM opened this conversation about the integration of large loads and greatly appreciates our stakeholders for their contributions to this effort. The stakeholder process produced many thoughtful proposals, some of which were introduced late in the process and require additional development.”
Shields stressed the vote was always advisory in nature and said the PJM board still plans to act on data centers in the next few weeks.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will have to sign off on whatever they propose.
The independent monitor left the meeting concerned that PJM and other stakeholders are working from a false premise.
“The solutions offered by PJM and most stakeholders simply assume that PJM must agree to add large loads to the system when the loads cannot be served reliably,” Monitoring Analytics’ FERC complaint states.
In short, the organization contends PJM has the authority to make data centers wait. And if PJM’s central obligation is reliability, then those data centers should wait.
Monitoring Analytics noted many of the unsuccessful proposals stakeholders considered included “mandatory curtailments” — blackouts — for new loads.
The fact that those considerations are included, the group argued, underscores the point that PJM doesn’t have adequate capacity for proposed data centers.
“The logic is simple. The question is clear,” Monitoring Analytics wrote. “If PJM has an obligation to provide reliable service to all PJM loads, is it just and reasonable for PJM to add new loads that it cannot serve reliably?”
“The answer to that question is no.” it added.
The independent monitor is asking federal regulators to issue a ruling directing PJM to add new data centers only when it has the infrastructure in place to serve those new customers as well as its existing ones.
PJM declined to comment on the independent monitor’s complaint.

Kelly Ayotte signed Senate Bill 295 into law at the State House in June. The bill expanded the voucher-like education freedom account program. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)New Hampshire’s education freedom account, or EFA, program has 10,510 students participating this year, nearly double the number last year, according to figures released by the Department of Education last month.
The state is expected to spend $51.6 million in total this school year, compared with $30.3 million last year. 
But in the months since lawmakers removed the income limits on the program — allowing wealthier families to participate — the proportion of low-income EFA students has dropped.
In the 2024-25 school year, 39% of the 5,765 students participating were from families making less than 185% of the federal poverty level. This school year, 19% of EFA recipients fall into that income category.
In the 2021-22 school year, the program’s first year, when access was capped to families making up to 300% of the federal poverty level, 54% of participants were in that lowest income bracket. 
In addition to the proportion, the actual number of lower-income participants has also dipped. 
Though the overall number of EFA recipients rose from 5,765 to 10,510, the number of students from families making up to 185% of the federal poverty level dropped from 2,261 students last school year to 2,017 students this school year.
Meanwhile, the percentage of EFA recipients who directly left a public school to take an EFA has dropped since the income limits were raised. 
Last school year, 297 out of the total 5,765 EFA recipients had left their public school the year before for an EFA — 5.1%. This year, 343 out of the 10,510 did so, or about 3.3%. Put differently, 96.7% of EFA recipients were already in a private or home school program in the year before the 2025-26 school year, the data shows. 
The numbers are based on a count of EFA students as of Oct. 1. They were reported by the department on Nov. 15. And they underscore some of the initial effects of the expansion of the EFA program — and, to supporters, evidence of the program’s popularity. 
First created in 2021, the education freedom accounts allow families to access the state’s per-pupil spending amounts it sends to public schools and use those grants toward private education and home-schooling expenses. 
Republicans, who have championed the program, say it offers a valuable path to alternate education options for families whose children are not thriving in public school. Democrats have denounced the program, arguing it siphons off state tax revenue to send funds to private schools that should be reserved for public schools. 
Wealthier EFA recipients, lower per-pupil cost
Since their creation, education freedom accounts have seen two major updates to eligibility. In 2023, Republican lawmakers increased the income cap, allowing families making up to 350% of the federal income level to participate, up from the initial 300%.
And in June 2025, Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed Senate Bill 295, removing the income limits entirely but imposing a 10,000 student annual cap for most families making more than 350% of the federal poverty level. The law allows some students to enter the program even after that cap is hit. And it includes a provision to automatically increase the cap the following year if the cap is hit in the current year. 
That expansion took effect immediately upon Ayotte’s signature. 
The removal of income limits appears to have brought some EFA program demographics in line with those in public schools. For instance, the current 19% of EFA recipients from households making up to 185% of the federal poverty level is close to the 23% of students in that same bracket across New Hampshire public schools, according to the Department of Education. 
But in other specialty areas, students appear to be preferring public schools. For instance, 19% of New Hampshire public school students qualify for some form of special education, while just 8% of current EFA recipients do so, according to the data.
And while about 5% of public school students are designated English language learners, only 0.19% of EFA recipients have identified as English language learners. 
Identifying a student as an English language learner, a special education recipient or a free and reduced-price lunch recipient is optional for families opting into EFAs, so the numbers may not be exact totals. But doing so increases the size of that family’s annual EFA grant under the state’s differentiated aid system. 
Moving to universal income eligibility has affected how much the state is spending per pupil on the EFAs. 
Last school year, the program sent an average of $5,265 per student, while this year, the average amount will be $4,911 per student, according to the Department of Education. 
As a result, though the number of students receiving EFAs increased by 82%, the total cost of the program increased 70%. 
That drop appears to have occurred largely because the state is spending a smaller proportion of its EFA budget on “differentiated aid” payments to lower-income students this year than it did last year, according to the data. With the addition of wealthier participants who don’t qualify for that aid, the state spends less on average per student. 
Last school year, the percentage of total EFA state spending devoted to the increased aid payments to students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch was 17.5%; this year it was 9.4%.
Opposing reactions
The new numbers are unlikely to shake entrenched opinions for and against EFAs in Concord.
For Republicans like Sen. Victoria Sullivan, of Manchester, the data has one clear takeaway: demand is high.
“It’s just a signal to me that we have more families in need that want to utilize the education freedom accounts, and the intention was for it to be universal, and it really should be,” she said. 
In addition to appeals to school choice, Republican lawmakers have argued the EFA program saves money for local property taxpayers because when a student leaves a public school district, the residents no longer pay the local portion of public school tuition for that student.  
In an analysis published in November, the Department of Education estimated that the program had saved $30.6 million in cumulative local taxpayer dollars from the students who have switched from public school to EFAs alone. If all EFA recipients attended public schools, local taxpayers would have cumulatively paid $266 million more, the department calculated. 
“The wildly successful Education Freedom Account Program has been transformative for thousands of students all around New Hampshire,” said Rep. Valerie McDonnell, a Salem Republican, in a statement issued when Ayotte signed the expansion bill in June. 
“On top of saving taxpayers over $266 million in its opening years, this program has operated with absolute transparency, with every single cent audited and accounted for by the Children’s Scholarship Fund,” McDonnell said.
But Democrats have countered that the departure of students from public schools does not reduce the fixed costs to run the schools, meaning taxes will likely not drop proportionally. 
They have also argued the relatively low percentage of EFA recipients who have left their public schools indicates the program is not fulfilling its mission of providing school choice to those who don’t want to attend public schools. 
“It is a tiny fraction of the number of students who are served by the public school system. And this tiny fraction of students … is costing us millions and millions and millions of dollars with no accountability,” said Sen. Debra Altschiller, a Stratham Democrat, in an interview.
Budget battles continue
The latest data from the department shows wildly different take-up rates of EFAs in specific towns. While many school districts like Manchester — which houses the largest number of EFA recipients but is also the largest school district — have seen about 9% of their students take EFAs, some towns have seen much larger percentages.
In Rindge, 28.7% of resident students are using an education freedom account. In New Ipswich, 16.3% of students are in the program. 
And while counties like Belknap, Cheshire, and Merrimack have seen a dip in the percentage of EFA enrollees in their district since 2021, others are seeing a swell. Last school year, 10% of Rockingham County students had taken an EFA; this year, the proportion is 15%. 
Amid the rapid changes, some lawmakers are pushing to expand the law further. A bill proposed by Sullivan for the 2026 session would remove the 10,000 student cap entirely. Sullivan said demand for EFAs would eventually plateau if the program were made universal, and she argued the state’s Education Trust Fund can absorb the additional cost.
“We’ve increased (public school) spending significantly, and the outcomes haven’t changed,” she said. “… So I think people are looking for more of a return on their dollar, which is why they’re supporting the EFAs.”
Democrats such as Altschiller are advancing bills to subject the EFA expenditures to greater accountability. Rep. Ellen Read of Newmarket is bringing forward legislation to allow cities or towns to opt out of allowing their residents to participate in the EFA program. 
In an interview, Read argued that rather than saving money when a public school student leaves to take an education freedom account, school districts lose money by no longer receiving the state’s portion. She said her bill had been requested by a Newmarket constituent who wanted an option to stop that potential result. 
“It only makes sense to allow the people of the town to determine whether or not they’re going to allow the costs of their education to be driven up by this voucher program, thereby increasing their own property taxes,” Read said. 
Sullivan said she expects her bill to remove the cap from the program to pass the Senate next year, but predicted a more difficult fight in the more fiscally conservative House.
“I know we’ll be up against the same arguments,” Sullivan said of the criticism from Democrats. “They didn’t work last time. Hopefully they don’t work this time, and we can truly give universal EFAs to every New Hampshire family that wants them.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ayottebills-1024x708.jpg,,,2025-12-03 05:58:34.457305
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-03 10:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,More young adults in CT finding a home in the Republican Party,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/03/ct-young-republicans/, The Connecticut Young Republicans group has been building its ranks in recent months as the party courts younger generations to get involved.,"Amber Webster was a Democrat.
Then the pandemic happened, and the 32-year-old mother from Colchester grew frustrated with how it was handled. She said she and others started questioning “a party that we were loyal to for a long time” and made the switch.
Webster isn’t the only relatively young person looking to the Republican Party for an ideological home. She was among several dozen people who attended the Connecticut Young Republicans’ first social meeting of the year in late October. 
“Our generation has seen so many struggles that our parents didn’t — the cost of homes going up, things being unaffordable and unattainable financially. So I think that’s why most of us are getting involved — just to try to change the future, keep Connecticut affordable, safe and things like that,” Webster said.
That was a popular sentiment of the group, whose membership ranges from 18 to 40 years old: the high cost of living in states like Connecticut are putting things out of reach that were commonplace for older generations.
For much of the past two years, the Connecticut Young Republicans was relatively inactive. But the group has been building its ranks in recent months. It comes as the party actively courts younger generations to get involved — and even as Connecticut turned bluer in the recent municipal elections.
Republicans aren’t quite facing the same reckoning as Democrats, with calls for generational change forcing Democratic primaries in Connecticut and beyond. But the group’s chairman, Patrick Burland, 26, sees a noticeable shift since he tried to secure a spot on a Republican Town Committee seven years ago.
“For the first time in many years, Republican Town Committees are not just tolerating younger Republicans but seeking them out,” Burland said. “The entire attitude has changed toward younger people.”

A new generation of GOP politics
On a rainy evening the day before Halloween, a restaurant in the Plantsville neighborhood of Southington filled up with a broad cross section of Republicans in the state ranging from candidates running for local offices to newcomers who had never gotten involved in politics before.
There were a lot of commonalities: concerns about safety, political rhetoric, government dependence and costs of living.
And yet how they got involved in GOP politics varied widely.
After Webster’s political evolution, she worked to get Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Connecticut’s ballot as an independent in the 2024 election. She considers herself to be a “MAHA mom,” a reference to the slogan “Make America Healthy Again.” Kennedy ultimately endorsed President Donald Trump after ending his bid and now serves as head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
Sine then, Webster got more involved in local Republican Party politics. She’s fresh off of managing Republican Steve Orosco’s campaign against New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker as well as running her own race for Colchester Board of Finance. Both Webster and Orosco lost their respective elections last month.
Others who attended the meeting are even newer to politics and Connecticut.
Ryan J. Wells is a 20-year-old intel specialist in the Marine Corps Reserve who currently resides in Naugatuck after living in North Carolina a year ago. He said he wanted to get involved after conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s fatal shooting and now wants to go into policymaking. Kirk gained a big following of young conservatives after mobilizing students on high school and college campuses.
Wells said he’s concerned with homeownership in a state struggling with a housing shortage and high prices. It’s likely to become a top issue in the 2026 governor’s race, especially after the General Assembly passed a renegotiated version of a sweeping housing bill in the special session.
Federal nutrition assistance also came up during the meeting, as the state was in the throes of figuring out whether to fund benefits with federal funding in limbo. At the event, House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, spotlighted it as an issue that both parties in the state got behind during the government shutdown. 
Wells said he didn’t want to see benefits immediately removed, but argued it’s a larger policy failure of a social services program because 10% of Connecticut’s population relies on federally funded benefits to help them afford groceries.
“That’s a travesty and we need to evaluate every single politician and we need to evaluate the history of this,” Wells said. “That is a greater systematic failure of policy.”
Maintaining momentum
Connecticut’s Young Republicans chapter expanded significantly since the new board of officers took over in recent months.
The group ramped up from three dues-paying members to 60 active members — 20 of whom signed up because of the October event. That’s on top of the associate members who have given contributions but are over the age of 40.
They have local chapters in Windham, Hartford and New Haven counties and want to help with door-knocking and phone-banking for the 2026 elections. They will soon have additional groups in Litchfield, Fairfield and New London counties.
Connecticut’s top three GOP leaders view them as one of the keys to success in a state currently dominated by Democrats. They have their eyes on next year’s highly anticipated governor’s race, which could see a younger Republican take on a 71-year-old incumbent.
“This is a really important segue into what’s going to be a very important and consequential election in 2026,” Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding of Brookfield, a young Republican himself, told the group in October. “It starts Tuesday and it moves right forward into a 2026 election cycle where it’s going to be exclusively devoted towards protecting our state … The Democratic Party has controlled this state for a generation now. Their level of arrogance has grown beyond words.”

But five days later, Connecticut Democrats had an electoral romp. They flipped control of 28 cities and towns that were once held by Republicans. After Democrats had a tough presidential cycle a year earlier, they now feel openly optimistic about 2026.
Still, the objective for Republicans remains the same. How do they rebuff the leftward pull of an already blue state as they head into a consequential election year?
One of their answers is to build up a pipeline of younger Republicans willing to engage in local politics either through grassroots organizing or running for their local town committees. It’s a long-term goal that’ll take time, with the hopes of starting to reap those rewards as early as 2026.
Connecticut Republican Party chairman Ben Proto offered a blunt directive to those in the room that night: Get involved locally and encourage their peers to vote — something he said younger generations don’t do.
“The reality of the situation is you have so much to offer us that sometimes we don’t know enough to ask for it. We can help do this, but it’s not our future. It’s your future,” Proto said. “You need to be in the present so that your future is better. Because if you wait for the future, folks, it’s going to pass you by and the Democrats are going to control it.”
Even with tough losses in the local elections, there were some bright spots: 14 of the Connecticut Young Republicans’ endorsed candidates won their municipal races.
One of those was Amybeth Laroche, who won her race for Newtown Board of Finance. She attended the Connecticut Young Republicans’ meeting and got involved after seeing a post about the group on Instagram. She said it’s incumbent on her party to do more for younger generations, especially those with young families.
Laroche said she’s heard from other mothers and parents about the difficulty of making local meetings because they are at inconvenient times that don’t work with raising young kids.
“We’re supposed to be the party of families, but we’re making it impossible, so we should be thinking that should we do more” to accommodate those with young families, Laroche said. “Whether it’s Democrat or Republican, those small things are so important to keep the future stuff moving forward, and we’re just not thinking like that.”
Republicans argue that the focus on identity politics by some in the Democratic Party has overshadowed bigger issues that are consuming younger generations.
“Those sort of identity politics … are starting to backfire, and I think that’s brought that generation I would say toward the Republican Party,” Candelora said. “What I see from my children, especially the males, they’re just kind of fed up with, not just with authority and with all the labels that they’re being told, but also with the fact that this is probably the first generation that might not be as well off as the next.”
Moving past the texting scandal
The Connecticut group was just starting back up again in earnest when a leaked texting controversy rocked the national Young Republicans organization and a few chapters in other states.
The chat was the behind-the-scenes push of an insurgent campaign looking to lead the Young Republican National Federation. The messages used racist, homophobic and other explicit language.
The months-long chat came from one wing of the group, the Restore YR campaign, led by New York State Young Republicans Chairman Peter Giunta. He was challenging the incumbent chairman, Hayden Padgett, during the elections held over the summer. In addition to New York, others involved in the chat were affiliated with chapters in Kansas, Arizona and Vermont.
Some of the texts embraced Adolf Hitler and joked that people who don’t vote for Restore YR are “going to the gas chamber.” That prompted some state affiliates involved to disband and specific members involved in the chat to lose their leadership roles and, in some cases, even their day jobs.
The Connecticut chapter was not involved in the Telegram group chat and didn’t support the slate of candidates at the center of the controversy. The state group backed the current chairman, Padgett, who ended up winning another term.
The Young Republican National Federation said the chat was “vile” and “inexcusable” and called on those members to resign from their positions. But the Connecticut chapter never addressed the revelations about the chat on its public channels and said they didn’t have their own statement beyond the one issued by the national group.
That was a different approach from the one they took after Kirk’s assassination. The young Democratic and Republican groups in Connecticut issued a joint statement denouncing the shooting and political violence.
When asked if there were concerns the chat could hurt the reputation of the Young Republicans, members of the group condemned it, but believed they would move past it and shouldn’t be a blemish on the organization as a whole.
“Those comments were highly inappropriate and very disrespectful and definitely something that should not be tolerated from either side of the aisle,” Webster said. “This chapter is fairly new, so I think the best thing that we can do is just lead with integrity and our own actions and hold ourselves and each other accountable here in Connecticut.”
National v. local politics
There have been glimmers of hope for Connecticut Republicans in recent years.
Trump improved his standing in about 150 towns in 2024, even as he lost the state by a double-digit margin for the third time. And GOP voter registration grew by almost 6% over the course of four years, and that uptick is happening in some of the biggest cities, like Hartford and New Haven.
Yet Republicans saw losses in mayoral and first selectman seats this year, including in redder pockets of the state. The reason for Democrats’ string of victories could be explained by a multitude of reasons: backlash to Trump’s first year in office, a record-long government shutdown, local issues that dwarfed the national narrative, or a strained economy.
“Obviously, there was a lot of underlying concern about the dysfunction in Washington, D.C., the chaos in Washington, D.C., and just a sense that Connecticut is a bit of a safe harbor compared to what’s going on there,” Gov. Ned Lamont said following the state’s municipal elections. “My message to the Democrats is, ‘Just don’t run against Donald Trump. You got to tell people what you are for.'”
One thing Republicans and Democrats can agree on: affordability was and will likely be the main issue driving future elections. They just disagree on the way to solve it.
Connecticut Young Republicans hope to have success at the top of the ticket next year. Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich and former New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart, who are both in their 30s, are vying for the GOP nomination in the governor’s race. Lamont is seeking a third term.
One of the takeaways of the October event was that Connecticut is not Washington, D.C., and there’s a better track record of Democrats and Republicans working together in the state. That was particularly evident after the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.
Candelora offered a less-political message as a lawmaker who has a track record of working with the state’s Democratic majority on some issues and more of a willingness to buck the head of his own party when it conflicts with Connecticut priorities.

“It is about learning how to coexist in a state that traditionally votes for Democrats. And I think it’s important for our youth to recognize that you can have Republican principles and be a Republican in Connecticut and find your space,” Candelora said.
But as Republicans gear up for the 2026 elections, they will once again be presented with the question of how closely to align with Trump in a state that has rejected him in three presidential elections. 
“I think there’s plenty of local issues to focus on, and Trump is going to do what Trump is going to do. I would say you definitely have to know your audience and take the good from Trump that you can take from him,” Webster said.
Trump has a track record of being a make-or-break endorsement in Republican primaries. When it comes to the general election, that’s where it can get tricky for Republicans in a blue state like Connecticut.
The state of the economy is likely to play a big role in who’s successful in the 2026 midterms. With high inflation coming out of the pandemic, among other reasons, voters rejected then-President Joe Biden in 2024. And if high prices and cost of living remain the dominant issue next year, that could once again shape elections and the party in power.
“I think love him or hate him, President Trump has sort of driven the Republican Party into a principled message that youth are identifying with,” Candelora said. “And I think it all depends on what happens over the next couple of years, and if the economy doesn’t turn around, that could be an opportunity for the Democrats to step in.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025_1202_SR_GOP_042-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-03 05:58:34.457305

This is just one of the recent pieces of legislation that would add more Christianity to the education system.
One of the longest battles of all time: how involved should religion be in the government? For some state lawmakers, it hasn’t been enough.
“It is inexcusable that more focus has not been shown towards these historic texts,” state Sen. Terry Johnson, R-McDermott, said.
The majority of GOP senators passed S.B. 34, which would require public schools to display “historic” texts in classrooms.
The list includes the Declaration of Independence, U.S. Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Articles of Confederation, the mottoes of both the U.S. and Ohio, the Magna Carta, the Mayflower Compact, the Northwest Ordinance, and the Ten Commandments.
“This bill will expose our students to the documents which have, in America, served as the backbone of our legal and moral traditions,” Johnson said.
Of the nine documents listed, school districts only have to choose four. But Democrats argue it’s a mandate.
“Did you notice that little piece in there — if someone gives [documents], if someone donates them, that they need to then display them?” Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood, said.
Antonio, a former educator, said it’s unconstitutional to put religious texts in public school classrooms.
“To present to those children that a document from a religious practice is above all others is inappropriate,” Antonio continued. ”
It’s not what the founders intended, it goes totally against the separation of church and state, and I think it’s an abomination.”
Retired Case Western Reserve University constitutional law professor Jonathan Entin said the legislation does raise First Amendment concerns.
“The idea has been that you wanna keep the government out of the religion business,” Entin said.
But he referenced three U.S. Supreme Court rulings from decades ago.
Decided in Stone v. Graham in 1980, justices said that Kentucky’s display of the Ten Commandments in schools violated the First Amendment’s establishment clause.
In 2005, justices extended the 1980 ban to Kentucky’s courthouses.
However, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Van Orden v. Perry in 2005, which allowed the Ten Commandments in a public space in Texas, since it wasn’t the only “historical document” displayed.
“The court said, because the Ten Commandments is part of a larger message or a larger set of items, it’s a less clearly religious message than the 10 Commandments standing alone,” Entin said.
In recent years, other states have pushed for the religious doctrine to be put in schools.
Most recently, a court ordered Texas school districts to remove the Ten Commandments from classrooms with a deadline of Monday.
However, Entin said that the makeup of the U.S. Supreme Court is different now, and Republican states may feel the justices would be more inclined to rethink these cases.
“[The Court is] more conservative and the majority seems to be more sympathetic to public displays of religious objects,” the professor said.
Another bill that recently passed the House would allow K-12 public schools and college professors to provide instruction on the “positive” impacts of religion on American history.
The GOP has titled H.B. 486 the “Charlie Kirk American Heritage Act.”
“Many of our adults don’t actually understand the roots of America and our founding principles that are rooted in Christianity, and that’s why we have our liberty, that’s why we have our freedom,” state Rep. Gary Click, R-Vickery, claimed. “I think we need to be able to be free to teach that.”
He said that the bill doesn’t allow people to proselytize — converting or attempting to convert students — but does include how Christianity positively benefited policies like the “treaty with the Native Americans” and how the Ten Commandments shaped federal law.
Antonio pushed back.
“There’s a movement in this country to make us a Christian national country, and these are the beginning steps of doing so,” Antonio said.
Ohio House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati, warned against promoting religious ideology.
“A wise friend down in Texas said something that my people, the Jewish people, know well to be true from our history, which is that ‘A government powerful enough to impose religion is powerful enough to take it away,'” Isaacsohn said.
The House has also passed H.B. 485, which would require fifth graders and older to watch “Meet Baby Olivia,” a GOP-supported fetal development animated video created by anti-abortion organization Live Action.
“Children are a gift, and we’re hoping that we can change the culture to be celebrating life instead of destroying life,” state Rep. Melanie Miller, R-Ashland, said.
The development cycle and graphics shown in the video conflict with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists’ research.
When urging passage of the bill on the House floor, Miller quoted the Bible.
Abortion rights advocates have pointed to medical inaccuracy in the video.
“They want to be able to impose their views, their religious views — let’s be clear — on everyone else,” abortion rights advocate Kellie Copeland said, adding that the video was medically inaccurate and offensive.
Each of these bills will be heard in the opposite chamber in the coming months.

As of Sept. 30, Ohio lawmakers eliminated a key legal tool used to rein in air pollution from power plants and industrial sites. Now, advocates are suing to restore that right.


For decades, environmental groups in Ohio and elsewhere have used air nuisance rules in state plans as a catchall way to enforce the federal Clean Air Act. Ohio’s version let people take legal action against companies whose emissions ​“endanger the health, safety or welfare of the public, or cause unreasonable injury or damage to property.” The rule dates back more than 50 years.


Environmental groups have used air nuisance rules to file or threaten lawsuits against coal-burning power plants, iron and steel facilities, coke plants, and other industrial operations, which emit not only planet-warming greenhouse gases but also harmful pollutants like nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and lead.


Defendants in cases brought under Ohio’s version of the rule have included Suncoke Energy, AK Steel–Middletown Works, Georgia-Pacific Corp., and Phthalchem. Consent decrees and settlements have produced orders or agreements to stop alleged nuisances, clean up waste, and expand monitoring.


But a last-minute addition to the state’s 3,156-page budget bill, House Bill 96, told the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to cut that protection out of the state’s Clean Air Act plan.


“The air nuisance rule is the tool that Ohioans have to hold polluters accountable,” said Neil Waggoner, the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign manager for the Midwest. ​“This is the state government saying … we’re going to take this away from you in the most secretive fashion possible.”


The Sierra Club is a plaintiff in the lawsuit, along with the Ohio Environmental Council, SOBE Concerned Citizens, and the Freshwater Accountability Project. The fifth plaintiff, Donna Ballinger, is a Middletown resident who lives close to iron and steel operations, which she claims cause nuisance conditions. An August report by the Environmental Integrity Project documented likely air quality problems in that area.


Experts warn that eliminating the right to file air nuisance complaints weakens Ohio’s enforcement of pollution measures at an already perilous moment for environmental regulation.


For months, the Trump administration has been rolling back federal pollution standards and making huge personnel cuts to the staff charged with enforcing the remaining rules and permits. The Ohio EPA has authority to enforce the Clean Air Act but doesn’t always pursue alleged violations.


“Both at the federal and state level, we’re seeing less enforcement,” said Miranda Leppla, who heads Case Western Reserve University’s Environmental Law Clinic and represents the Ohio Environmental Council and the Sierra Club in the lawsuit. ​“If Ohioans don’t have the ability to bring these enforcement actions on their own through the air nuisance rule, there’s a very serious concern that air quality will continue to degrade and Ohioans’ health will get worse.”


Echoing a recent law in Louisiana, HB 96 also blocks the Ohio EPA from acting on data that groups may collect through community air-monitoring efforts. Such data can fill important gaps and alert communities and enforcement officials to problems that may not be detected by EPA monitors miles away.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE


Ohio’s limits on using the data will particularly harm fence-line communities, Leppla said.

“At a time when Ohio is seeing renewed industrial building, including new facilities like data centers, as well as a greater federal push for more fossil fuels, it is more important than ever that Ohioans preserve their right to both collect air pollution data themselves and use that data to file suits against harmful air nuisances,” said Chris Tavenor, general counsel for the Ohio Environmental Council.


The complaint, filed on Oct. 24 in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, asserts that lawmakers violated the single-subject rule in the Ohio Constitution when they tacked the air pollution provisions onto the massive budget bill.


“This is fundamentally unrelated to the main purpose of the biennial budget,” Waggoner said. ​“And it was stuck in here in an intentional way so that folks would not have an opportunity to see it, talk about it, or debate its merits.”


The Sierra Club, Ohio Environmental Council, and other groups raised a similar argument two years ago after eleventh-hour changes to a bill about poultry included a new definition of natural gas as ​“green energy.” That case, also at the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, has been briefed, and parties are waiting for Judge Kimberly Cocroft to issue her ruling.


A 2019 decision in Paulding County, Ohio, rejected a challenge to the late amendment in the 2014 budget bill that tripled property-line setbacks for turbines on wind farms. That case wasn’t appealed and would not bind the court in Franklin County.


Despite the similarities, the new lawsuit is different because the ban goes beyond how state agencies operate, Leppla said. ​“The air nuisance rule was created specifically to allow Ohioans who are suffering from noxious air pollution and nuisances to protect themselves when the government does not act.”


HB 96 is not the first attempt to take away Ohioans’ right to bring air nuisance claims. In 2020, the first Trump administration’s U.S. Environmental Protection Agency removed Ohio’s air nuisance rule, Waggoner noted.


The Ohio Environmental Council, the Sierra Club, Ballinger, and another Sierra Club member mounted a successful challenge in federal court, but due to delays in agency action it wasn’t until this February that the rule became effective again.


“And now here we are with the Ohio legislature attempting to remove it again, when it had already been found to be illegal to do so,” Leppla said.


To prevent another lapse, the plaintiffs in the new lawsuit have asked Judge Julie Lynch to grant a preliminary injunction against removing the rule while the case proceeds.


As defendants, the State of Ohio and the director of Ohio EPA have 28 days to file responses after the complaint was served. What happens next will depend on those filings and the judge’s rulings on any motions.


The Ohio attorney general’s office did not respond to Canary Media’s request for comment. Ohio EPA spokesperson Bryant Somerville said the agency is reviewing the lawsuit but had no further response because the matter is in litigation.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)The U.S. Department of Education’s recent decision to reclassify social worker master and doctorate degrees as “nonprofessional” fundamentally misrepresents what we do as professionals, the complexity of our training, and the essential role we play in the behavioral health and social service systems of this country.
I feel confident saying this statement reflects not just my own concern but the voices of educators, clinicians, students, families and community members who rely on a strong, well-prepared workforce that includes other allied health fields. 
The “big, beautiful bill,” praised by some lawmakers for putting America first, reclassifies positions such as social workers, nurses, physician assistants, physical therapists, and audiologists to limit the amount individuals can borrow to obtain advanced degrees. Unpaid student loan debt is a concern for many in America. However, limiting the earning potential of those who choose to work in allied health fields is not the best solution when the workforce continues to struggle with staffing shortages. 
Social work is a profession. It is a licensed, regulated, clinically rigorous field that requires advanced graduate education, standardized training, national examinations, ongoing supervision, and strict adherence to ethical codes.
To classify MSW and DSW programs as nonprofessional is to erase the expertise required to safely assess suicidal ideation, respond to trauma, domestic violence, addiction, child abuse, and mental illness. Social workers stabilize families experiencing crisis, support aging adults navigating complex medical systems, serve veterans, and lead schools, hospitals, child welfare agencies, and justice reform initiatives.
This reclassification sends a harmful message that our field does not require specialized, intensive preparation when the health, safety and future of our communities depend on it.
In both Kansas and Missouri, where I practice, the reclassification collides directly with realities on the ground. In many counties across both states, especially rural regions, there are no licensed clinical social workers available. Families wait weeks or months for care. Hospitals board patients or turn them away because no one can provide assessments. Schools struggle to find mental health providers for students in crisis.
The Kansas Department for Children and Families and Missouri Children’s Division rely heavily on MSWs for safety assessments, permanency planning, trauma-responsive care and prevention services. A blow to the professional identity of social workers is a blow to child safety.
MSW programs in this region train first-generation students; rural students; working parents; and Black, Latino, and Indigenous students. The field of social work thrives on producing professionals with shared, lived experience because it builds bridges to reach some of our most vulnerable communities. Reclassification reduces access to professional-degree loan models, scholarships and grants, undercutting equity and representation in a field that desperately needs diverse practitioners.
MSW programs are already strained by high field-education costs. Removing our professional status may reduce opportunities for flexible tuition, practicum support, workforce development funding and enrollment at already fragile rural campuses. This significantly reduces opportunities for the next generation of social workers.
To become licensed in Kansas or Missouri, an MSW graduate must undergo 900-plus hours of supervised fieldwork, 3,000 hours of post-graduate supervised clinical practice (for an LSCSW/LCSW license), pass a national clinical licensing exam and complete continuing education hours, all while remaining compliant with the National Association of Social Workers Code of Ethics.
None of these requirements represent “general graduate study.” They represent professional preparation to protect lives, strengthen families, and respond to complex biopsychosocial needs. To label this level of preparation as nonprofessional is not only inaccurate but dangerous.
Policy decisions of this magnitude are not abstract. They touch real people, real families, and real crises. The National Suicide Hotline Designation Act of 2020 was signed into law incorporating 988 into statutes as the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline and Veterans Crisis Line phone number. Since 2022, 988 Lifeline has answered more than 13 million calls, texts, and chats from individuals experiencing crisis.
Kansas and Missouri have expanded mobile crisis models, but many counties cannot staff 24/7 mobile crisis teams. Without MSWs, crisis centers cannot dispatch clinicians trained to deescalate or safety plan crisis situations.
Domestic violence programs, reentry programs, housing stability, school mental health, maternal mental health and many other vital services are stretched beyond capacity. Many are relying on volunteers or untrained staff. While valiant in their efforts, the potential for further harm is great.
Reclassification is not an isolated policy adjustment. It will ripple through every system that relies on licensed social workers. To base the definition of a “professional degree” on a law from 1965 is to systematically reject every advancement in allied health that exists today.
Our profession cannot withstand a policy that undermines public trust, destabilizes educational programs and threatens access to critical care. Social workers are on the front lines of some of the most painful and complex challenges in our society. To diminish our professional status is to diminish the lives of the people we serve.
Kansas and Missouri — our country as a whole — cannot afford to lose more social workers. Our children, families, and communities deserve a workforce that is recognized, supported, and valued.

(Getty Images.)In 2019, when the last Chevy Cruze was built at the Lordstown Ohio Assembly plant, the Mahoning Valley community responded with a simple demand to GM: “Invest in us.” 
Last month, Ohio’s Mahoning Valley was hit once again with job cuts at the Ultium Cells battery plant; around 500 jobs lost, and 850 workers temporarily laid off.
The community spent years working to bring manufacturing jobs back to the area.
Workers and the United Auto Workers (UAW) spent additional years organizing the Ultium plant to ensure safety and living wages.
It is difficult to see the gains of these workers and this community lost again, and that basic ask from our community years ago, “invest in us” stays top of mind.
Since 1966, the Lordstown Complex employed thousands of Ohioans who showed up and worked hard, even as our jobs were threatened with offshoring and automation.
After I had the honor of being elected as President of Local UAW 1112, I did everything in my power to see a new vehicle brought to Lordstown.
We knew that plant had all the right stuff to be a herald of a revived American automotive industry, and our members were ready to get back to work.
We believed then, and continue to believe now, that our members are the backbone of our communities, our states, and our nation.
We have urged our representatives on both sides of the aisle to invest in workers and in communities like Lordstown across the country.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But for companies like Ultium, the passage of the Republican budget bill (the “One Big Beautiful Bill”) this past summer makes it clear that Congressional Republicans are willing to lay waste to these goals.
Ohio U.S. Sen. Jon Husted lauded the significant tax cuts in the bill, but failed to mention that these historic tax breaks for the ultra-rich come at steep cost for working people.
More than 410,000 workers are currently employed in manufacturing facilities like Ultium that build the next generation of clean vehicles or their components.
This includes more than 240,000 manufacturing jobs in the domestic electric vehicle (EV) supply chain alone.
Many of these jobs are supported by federal policies and regulations, including the 30D EV tax credits and the 45X subsidies.
The UAW believes that incentives like these need stronger protections for workers attached, to make sure public dollars are only used to create good union jobs.
But instead of working with us to improve the credits, Republicans used their budget bill to eliminate them altogether, throwing companies that produce EVs and their parts into uncertainty.
The Ultium plant in Ohio is not an outlier.
Significant layoffs at GM’s Factory Zero and Rivian were also announced last month, as were temporary layoffs at Ultium’s Tennessee plant.
The loss of jobs at these facilities is not only a loss for the workers, but also a loss for all of us who live and work in these communities.
These plants uphold local economies, build innovative technologies that position the United States to compete in an advancing global marketplace, and ultimately, produce safe, reliable American cars.
In the plants we organized, the UAW worked to ensure these jobs were good jobs, safe jobs, where workers were able to achieve significant union-backed wage increases and benefits to support themselves and their families.
Facilities like Ultium proved that auto workers building parts and components for clean vehicles could receive the strong union protections and benefits they deserve.
This fight is not over. Our workers will continue to advocate for a system that invests in all of us.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Maryland could have to pay upwards of $300 million in 2027 to meet new federal costs to deliver food assistance to residents, with state that have high rates of administrative errors — like Maryland — having to kick in more.
That is just one of the big-ticket expenses that states will have to take on to implement changes in HR 1, the congressional budget reconciliation bill better known as the One, Big Beautiful Bill Act, state officials told lawmakers Tuesday.
In a virtual joint meeting of the Senate Finance and the House Health and Government Operations committees, legislators were told that changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid will cost the state millions to implement.
Finance Chair Pamela Beidle (D-Anne Arundel) summed up the changes as “a lot of doom and gloom.”
“We have serious issues facing us this year,” she said.
Maryland is already implementing an increased work requirement for some SNAP recipients that began in November. Meanwhile, a majority of refugees and people granted asylum are no longer eligible for SNAP unless they also have lawful permanent resident status, known as “green card” holders.
But starting next year, states will have to take on more of the costs to administer SNAP, and those costs will likely only increase in later years. Lawmakers are already facing a significant budget deficit in the upcoming legislative session.
Trump administration threatens to yank food stamps funding from Democratic-led states

“There are very serious impacts to the state’s fiscal situation because of HR 1’s impact,” Larry Handerhan, an assistant secretary for the Maryland Department of Human Services, said in the virtual briefing.
Historically, the federal government covered all of the costs of SNAP benefits, and split the costs of administering the program with the states.
But under HR 1, states will be expected to contribute 75% of administrative costs, starting next year. For Maryland, which currently spends $115 million for its half of SNAP administrative costs, that means another $57.5 million each year, or a new state total of $172.5 million a year just to run the program.
Meanwhile, Maryland will likely have to pay some of the benefits themselves, due to a new penalty on states that have a high “payment error rate,” meaning benefits were overpaid or underpaid due to administrative mistakes, not due to fraudulent actions by recipients.
Under HR 1, states with an error rate over 6% will have to contribute some state money to fund SNAP benefits. Maryland’s error rate of 13.64% is one of the highest in the country. At that rate, the state would be expected to pay 15% of the $1.6 billion required to put money on Marylanders’ SNAP cards – or $240 million more than it pays now.
“It’s not fraud, it’s a question of bureaucracy,” said Webster Ye, chief of staff for the Human Services Department, said of the error rate. “It refers to overpayments and underpayments in which we, the Maryland state agency and the administrative staff, are the ones that make that mistake.”
Maryland’s error rate spiked in 2022 at 35.56%, which Ye attributed to a surge of use under the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with high turnover at the department that led to new staff who “weren’t adequately trained.” Before the pandemic, Maryland’s error rate was below 10%.
While it’s down from 2022m ,Maryland’s error rate is still in the top 10 among states and the District of Columbia.
The Department of Human Services is working to bring down the error rate by hiring more staff and providing additional training to administer the program, improving technical processes and working to streamline the application and renewal process.
“That’s great news,” said Del. Kathy Szeliga (R-Baltimore County), who initially asked if the error rate included benefit theft. “Obviously it would be a huge savings for the state and to taxpayers if you can bring that error rate down.
“Personally, I think it’s a good incentive for states, because the state doesn’t pay out any of this money,” Szeliga said of the penalties. “The federal government is expecting us to be good stewards of this money.”
The Trump administration wants everyone to reapply for food stamps. What does that mean?

Responding to Szeliga’s concern around benefit theft, Ye noted the state recently entered into a contract to update SNAP cards to a “chip and tap” technology, which is expected to help reduce SNAP fraud.
The meeting also went over some of the changes coming to Medicaid, many similar to the SNAP changes. Such “overlaps” include new work requirements to qualify for Medicaid as well as new restrictions on which noncitizen immigrants qualify for benefits.
Around 320,000 Medicaid recipients will also be required to prove they are eligible for coverage every six months starting in January 2027.
Perrie Briskin, deputy secretary with the Maryland Department of Health, said that eligibility provision will probably lead to the most “churn” and people will likely lose coverage if they don’t keep up with the frequent eligibility checks.
“When people have to redetermine their coverage, they often fall out of the system,” she said.
“It’s very disheartening, what we’re about to face,” Beidle said at the end of the meeting. “It’s really doom and gloom, and we’re just going to have to work together best we can do for the people of Maryland.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_oct29_cranberry_foodassistance_edit-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-03 02:57:37.247922

With him are Ronnie Beard, center, and Damir Wade. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore (D) announced Tuesday the release of $19 million in grants toward a program to not only decrease the state’s teacher shortage, but also entice more men into the teaching profession.
The money for the Grow Your Own initiative is allocated in this year’s budget through the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act that Moore signed into law this year.
The initiative focuses on expanding teacher and staff pipelines, boosting diversity in the profession and establishing apprenticeships. But Moore emphasized the first round of grants in the Grow Your Own program will focus on bringing in more men to teach in the public schools. According to the governor’s office, about 23% of the state’s teachers are men.
Compared to the federal government, which is busy “coming up with creative ways to try to dismantle public education,” Maryland is going in a different direction, Moore said. And he had a message for out-of-state educators and fired federal workers: “Come to Maryland.”
“In Maryland, we’re just choosing to move differently,” he said. “In Maryland, we’re going to work together in order to ensure that education continues to serve as not just the foundation, but the launch pad for everything we hope for in our society.”

State Superintendent Carey Wright, who Moore called “the LeBron James of education,” summarized a few education initiatives that cut teacher vacancies nearly in half from 1,619 in the 2024-25 school year to 886 in this year. One of those initiatives is a $2,000 relocation grant to attract out-of-state licensed teachers.
As for the Grow Your Own initiative, Wright said it prioritizes programs that leverage on-the-job training and mentorship and on working to recruit men into the profession.
One of those men who participated in the program, Ronnie Beard, attended Tuesday’s announcement.
Before Beard’s seven years as a high school social studies teacher in Frederick County, he said he worked 10 years as a special education paraprofessional, also called an “ESP” or education support professionals.
“My message to ESPs out there: Take advantage of the Grow Your Own program that is out here in our district,” he said. “You definitely won’t regret it, and you won’t regret your decision.”
Also on Tuesday, the governor announced a partnership between the American Institute for Reseearch and the state’s Young Men and Boys initiative within the Governor’s Office of Children.
The partnership will be come through a $6 million, three-year memorandum of understanding under which the institute will provide research, evaluation and technical assistance to the state’s work on supporting men and boys.
Hagerstown high school senior Damir Wade, 18, who seeks to become a future educator, is also part of the state’s apprenticeship program. Wade not only supports teachers in the classroom at an elementary school, but he also helps with math intervention with fourth and fifth grade students.
After the nearly 50-minute news conference, Wade said in a brief interview that he’s had fewer than five male teachers, and no Black male teachers, throughout his school life.
“It’s very rare to see,” Wade said about male teachers in the classroom. “I just want to be that person that people can look up to, and maybe they can go into education.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)TAMPA – Florida has been one of the fastest growing states in the country over the past five years. Now the newest entrant to the 2026 Republican gubernatorial race says it’s time to focus less on bringing in new people and more on improving the lives of those who already live here.
“Stop inviting the whole country and the whole world to live here,” James Fishback told a packed crowd during the Tampa Bay Young Republicans monthly meeting Monday night in Tampa, admonishing U.S. Sen. Rick Scott’s paid aerial banners that flew over New York City this past summer that read, “Hate socialism? Us too! Move to FL.”
“Sen. Scott, we are full. We are done,” Fishback said.
Fishback has been in the race for a little more than a week officially but has already drawn substantial criticism from Republican Party of Florida establishment figures who say he shouldn’t be there.
“Tallahassee’s having a full blown meltdown,” he said. “The calls I’ve gotten. The attacks that I’ve gotten. All the way to the White House. Don’t do this. Drop out.”
He wants to end the H-1B visa program
A CEO with the startup asset management firm Azoria Partners. Fishback grew up in Broward County and now resides in Madison County in North Florida. The 30-year-old political newcomer (who turns 31 on New Year’s Day) has come out as a hardline immigration critic who has vowed to “fire every H-1B” employee working at state agencies and cut contracts with companies hiring visa holders.
“America is for Americans,” he declared during his opening 20-minute speech. “The brave thing for our brothers and sisters in Haiti or Brazil or Mexico or India or China – the brave thing for them to do is stay right where they are. Make their country great. The brave thing to do is not to come here on a H-1B and take a job from one of us. “
H-1B visas allow immigrants to work temporarily in the U.S. in specialty jobs, and President Donald Trump has supported increasing the number of those visas to allow entry by high-skilled workers. But there’s been backlash from “America First” conservatives, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced in late October that he was directing the state Board of Governors to prevent state universities from hiring foreign specialty workers.
Fishback said Monday that he was going to expand on DeSantis’ move, saying, “Every single foreign worker who has stolen a job from us will be relieved of their duties from state government by the time that the sun sets on my first day in office.”
“They’re gone,” he proclaimed.
Fishback says he wishes the governor was running for a third term (DeSantis is term-limited in 2026).
But he also is pushing hard on the affordability crisis in Florida. He said it doesn’t matter if the stock market had doubled recently in light of the high costs of groceries, property tax bills, auto insurance, and energy.
“I’ve said I’m going to stop construction of any AI data center that threatens to jack up our electric bills,” he said. “It’s just common sense. The idea that we have to pay the costs, have to shoulder the burdens of what others are doing, there’s a word for that. It’s called socialism.”
Can he compete with Byron Donalds?
Fishback’s entry in the Republican race for governor comes as Byron Donalds continues to dominate in public opinion polls, boosted by the early backing of Donald Trump. The Southwest Florida U.S. representative has raised more $30 million to date, dwarfing the totals of every other candidate from either party who has entered the contest.
Fishback told the Young Republicans that they “gotta respect” the work that Donalds has done for Floridians since he was elected to serve in the state House in 2016 and Congress in 2020. At another point, he called him a “great guy” and a “great father.” They met for three hours in August, he noted.
But he insists the two “have disagreements that are irreconcilable.”
When asked by a member of the audience what he could do to “separate” himself from Donalds, Fishback became uncharacteristically reticent, saying simply, “You do it by showing up.”
Fishback was somewhat dismissive of Lt. Gov. Jay Collins, who has seemingly been on the verge of announcing his own candidacy for governor for the past several months but has yet to pull the trigger. Fishback said he was frustrated that, while still serving in the Florida Senate, Collins had sponsored legislation that would have shielded pesticide companies immunity from so-called “frivolous” lawsuits. “
“A corporate system is a business that has immunity,” he said. “That is wrong. That is un-American. I’m always going to stand up for workers. I’m never going to allow any type of immunity.”
Anti-AIPAC
As part of his “America First” platform, Fishback said, he won’t take financial contributions from any organization “affiliated with a foreign country,” emphasizing that includes the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, better known as AIPAC.
Florida GOP U.S. Rep. Randy Fine has labelled Fishback a “total weirdo” and a “neo-Nazi.” Fishback said on Monday that he disavows all forms of hatred but wasn’t going to apologize for any of his stances, nor play “this game that you’re a racist. You’re Islamophobic. You’re antisemitic. Enough. Floridians have a right to exist in their own state. I’m not bending the knee to anyone.”
Audience questions 
Things got spicier as the evening wore on.
When a woman who described herself as a “recovering liberal” and current university instructor asked how Fishback would hold public universities accountable if they had rewritten DEI initiatives into something more palatable in the existing political environment, the candidate declared that, if elected, he would direct “every single university bureaucrat” to be interviewed by a member of his team to ask them “simple questions,” such as what was their reaction was to the assassination of conservative leader Charlie Kirk.
“If they use the words ‘contextualize,’ ‘gun rights, ‘He had it coming.’ — They’re out. And then guess what? Let ’em sue,” he said. “That’s how you actually eradicate an ideology.”
Fishback has never run for public office, nor voted in a GOP primary in Florida. That lack of involvement and experience was called out by Werther Marciales, policy director for the Florida Young Republicans, who asked: “Why should we trust you?”
Fishback responded that had he known he would ever run for office, he “probably” would have voted in some primaries. “I would have done things a lot differently,” he acknowledged.
But Marciales wasn’t placated. He referenced a lawsuit filed in 2024 by Fishback’s former employer, Greenlight Capital and DME Capital Management, alleging he had misrepresented his position in the company  to gain credibility for his own Azoria Partners. In September, Fishback acknowledged sharing confidential information and agreed to pay the hedge fund’s costs to resolve the lawsuit, according to Bloomberg.
When Marciales asked Fishback why his former employer sued him, Fishback said he would be happy to speak to him in private afterwards.
“No, why don’t you answer it here? Because you’re running for governor and I think people deserve to know,” Marciales said.
That led to shouts from the opposite side of the room, with one voice accusing Marciales of being “an attack dog” and another saying, “It’s not about you, dude!” before everyone moved on.
Despite that confrontation, some audience members told the Phoenix they agreed with many of Fishback’s stances, and bemoaned the fact that Trump has already weighed in on behalf of Donalds.
“The biggest thing I like about him is his message on H1-B’s and immigration. I think that’s probably the biggest thing that got Trump elected in the last election and it’s a huge topic for Americans, mostly young Americans,” said one audience member, who declined to provide his name.
“I think the race is wide open,” he added. “It’s early. A lot of things will come out. I like that Fishback’s oppo research is already dropping. He’s saying the right things. “
“I hated that the president came out and supported Donalds so quick, well before the election took place,” said another man who asked to be identified as Tim from Tampa. “There’s a lot of people trying to attack James in saying that he shouldn’t run, and that was just a huge red flag to me. Why shouldn’t he be running? It’s an election. It’s a democracy. It shouldn’t be just that ‘Oh, just because the president endorsed somebody, hey, nobody else is allowed to run.’ “",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/0-1024x771.jpeg,,,2025-12-03 00:56:33.401022
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-03 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT needs a climate superfund, and it needs one now",Sydney Collins,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/03/connecticut-needs-a-climate-superfund-and-it-needs-one-now/,New York's Climate Superfund bill will raise $3 billion annually over 25 years without increasing energy costs to residents.  CT should have one.,"The principle behind the Climate Superfund is simple: we must make fossil fuel companies pay for the climate damage they have created, rather than leaving those costs to our neighbors and families. 
Without a Climate Superfund, Connecticut will continue to build financial burdens from climate change, including disaster relief, infrastructure repairs, and public health costs that will disproportionately impact low-income and vulnerable communities. 
Critics of the Climate Superfund often raise the concern: won’t the fee to fossil fuel companies simply be passed along to residents in the form of higher energy bills? That’s an important question to address, and one that several economists have already answered. 
As Nobel Prize–winning economist Joseph Stiglitz explained in a letter to New York’s governor, the Climate Superfund fee is based on companies’ past pollution, not their current production. That means it’s considered a fixed cost, which is something oil companies can’t simply pass on to consumers without risking their profits. In other words, this policy makes polluters pay their fair share for the damage they’ve already done without raising gas prices for the rest of us.
Additionally, the global prices of crude oil is set through supply and demand in a global market. Even large fossil fuel companies cannot raise pump prices in Connecticut without losing market competitiveness or incentivizing consumers to change behavior. 
In New York, the Climate Superfund bill will raise $3 billion annually over 25 years without increasing energy costs to residents. When similar settlements have occurred, including the federal Superfund law for toxic waste, there was no evidence of increased costs for customers.
The Climate Superfund will advance clean, affordable energy in Connecticut. Many households, especially in low-income communities, already spend a disproportionately large share of their income on utilities. A superfund can increase the state’s capacity for financial aid, such as utility assistance to alleviate energy poverty. Additionally, if funds from the climate superfund are directed towards retrofits, weatherization, and clean heating technology in low-income communities, this could help lower long-term energy costs and reduce energy burdens.
The Climate Superfund should be designed to provide stronger governance in how funds should be spent including prioritized funding for environmental justice neighborhoods and community engagement in project selection. This helps advance “energy democracy,” where communities have a voice in how funds are spent and can shape their local energy systems.
Some communities in Connecticut are disproportionately impacted by sea-level rise, flooding, heat waves, and storm damage, including those communities with older infrastructure, coastal neighborhoods, and low-income populations. A Climate Superfund recognizes these inequities and seeks to remediate historic harms by directing resources to mitigation, adaptation, and resilience projects that keep people safe and help our communities thrive. 
Opponents to the Climate Superfund believe that this is a tax that will impact consumers and businesses. However, these claims are based on the assumption that firms can freely pass these costs onto energy users. This has not been shown in existing superfund models. 
Additionally, some critics argue that this bill is not constitutional since the government cannot retroactively charge companies after the fact. However, long-standing ‘polluter pays’ principles in U.S. law have been upheld in court, including the federal superfund law (CERCLA) that has followed this model for toxic waste sites since the 1980s. Additionally, the superfund is not a ‘punishment,’ but rather a cost recovery mechanism to fix public harms from climate damages, and it is proportional based on each company’s share of historic greenhouse gas emissions. 
Connecticut is already paying for climate change through storm and flood costs, infrastructure damage, and public health impacts like asthma. These costs fall most heavily on taxpayers, especially households that already face high financial burdens. 
The Climate Superfund provides an alternative to make polluters pay, not residents. If Connecticut acts now by passing this state legislation, we can build more climate-resilient towns and cities without increasing environmental burdens to those that can least afford them. 
Join our efforts by signing our petition at act.sierraclub.org and urge our state leaders to pass a Climate Superfund.

Mike Dunleavy has approved a U.S. Defense Department request for Alaska National Guard service members to assist the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Anchorage with “administrative support,” the guard office announced Tuesday.
The Alaska National Guard said five service members will assist with “administrative and logistical” duties at the Anchorage ICE office for up to a year. 
“The Alaska National Guard members are administratively supporting the Enforcement & Removal Operations section and Homeland Security Investigations section, ensuring seamless operations at the Anchorage ICE office. Their mission includes a wide range of duties, from vehicle fleet management and safety compliance to office support and processing purchase orders,” the Guard statement said. 
The announcement included a list of clerical duties, including data entry and creating reports, answering phones, managing fleet vehicles and checking fire extinguishers. Officials said the partnership is authorized by Title 32 Section 502(f) of the U.S. Code, which enables National Guard members to perform additional duties under the direction of the President or Secretary of Defense. 
Grant Robinson, Dunleavy’s deputy press secretary, confirmed the governor approved the request.
“The Alaska National Guard members joined the guard to serve our nation. This support they are providing the Anchorage ICE office is in service of the nation,” he said by email Tuesday.
Grant did not say whether the National Guard would provide further assistance with immigration enforcement actions.
“Any future requests for administrative and logistical support will be considered on a case by case basis,” he said.
The Trump administration has continued to accelerate immigration enforcement operations, and officials have promised to “limit legal and illegal immigration,” after the shooting of two National Guard service members in Washington, D.C. last week. The Trump administration has also continued to roll back humanitarian programs for immigrants, including ending the temporary protected status of 330,000 nationals from Haiti last week.  
While ICE has been conducting mass raids, court house arrests and large-scale detentions and deportation operations across the United States, in Alaska ICE has focused enforcement efforts on specific individuals identified through the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services or having interactions with law enforcement, according to the ACLU of Alaska. 
Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage is the co-chair of the Alaska Joint Armed Services Committee and has been outspoken about his concerns about the Alaska National Guard being deployed domestically for “civil disturbance operations.” 
“I see it’s a long list of boring, banal administrative tasks that are in no way controversial or concerning in and of themselves,” he said of the National Guard announcement. “What’s concerning is that Alaska ICE is requesting additional support, and the assumption that I make is that it’s because Alaska ICE intends to be doing more detainments, and intends to be doing more field operations in which they’re going to need this administrative support behind them. So that’s my concern.”
Gray was reached by phone Tuesday leaving a meeting with U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan in Washington, D.C. Gray said he expressed his concerns at the meeting about the leadership of U.S. Department of Defense, which the Trump administration has renamed the “Department of War,” and Secretary Pete Hegseth. 
Gray said he’s also concerned about a wider chilling effect of ICE activity and increased immigration enforcement in Alaska.
“It’s going to increase fear, not only in the undocumented folks that might be in Anchorage and the rest of Alaska, but also fear in people who are here legally, and even U.S. citizens who might be mistaken for someone who might be undocumented,” he said. 
An October investigation by ProPublica found that more than 170 U.S. citizens were detained by ICE in raids and at protests, and the government does not track how many citizens are held by immigration agents. 
Dunleavy’s office did not respond to requests for comment on the concern around ICE overreaching its authority, and arresting and detaining U.S. citizens. 
“It seems that Alaska’s notorious SNAP backlog caused by a lack of workforce doing many of the tasks on this memo would be much better use of our Guard,” Gray added. “Why not deploy Guard members to feed Alaskans instead of deploying them to earn brownie points with the Trump administration?”
Cindy Woods, senior staff attorney on immigration rights with the ACLU of Alaska, said they have tracked at least 70 ICE arrests this year, as reported in the custody of the Alaska Department of Corrections. That’s an almost 500% increase from last year. 
“We have been seeing a growing ICE presence in the state and a growing trend of ICE enforcement,” she said. The ICE activity has been largely in Anchorage, she said. 
“We are very concerned about what this signals in relation to our state government’s willingness to cooperate with federal law enforcement, specifically in relation to ICE enforcement operations,” she said of the National Guard announcement. “I think it can’t be overstated the negative impact that increased enforcement has had across the country and Alaska, unfortunately, is not immune to that.”
An estimated 7.7% of the population, or more than 57,000 people, in Alaska are foreign-born, Woods pointed out, and the Trump administration’s continued restrictions on paths to legal immigration and citizenship, as well as humanitarian and refugee resettlement programs are impacting Alaskans. 
“It’s kind of an assault from both sides, and so we’re really concerned about that as well,” she said.
Woods said the ACLU is not aware of any U.S. citizens being detained by ICE in Alaska, but there is heightened scrutiny. 
“One case that we have heard of recently is of a longtime Anchorage resident who has been happily married and was going to their interview for their green card based on that marriage, and being arrested with basically accusations of marriage fraud,” she said. “And so we’re seeing folks who are in affirmative applications, who are not in any sort of civil enforcement proceedings, who are also being subject to heightened scrutiny and enforcement actions.”

Special election runoffs held Tuesday determined who will represent parts of Jackson and the Delta in two state Senate seats as well as who will serve as Hinds County Coroner.
The runoffs Tuesday were necessitated when none of the candidates received at least 50% plus one vote in special elections in November. The special elections were held to fill vacancies due to officials leaving in the middle of their terms.
In the runoff for Senate District 26, a seat representing areas of north Jackson and rural Hinds and Madison Counties, Canton municipal judge Kamesha Mumford appeared to best attorney Letitia Johnson in a race that saw more than a half-a-million dollars in campaign fundraising, WLBT reported. With about 95% of precincts reporting Tuesday night, Mumford had secured roughly 54% of the vote to Johnson’s 46% in the unofficial count Tuesday night, not including absentee ballots. The seat was left open when former longtime state senator John Horhn was elected mayor of Jackson in July.

Johnson, wife of NAACP President Derrick Johnson, had received an endorsement from Mississippi’s Democratic U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson. But it didn’t appear to draw votes from Mumford, who received endorsements from the mayors of two Jackson suburbs, Mayor Will Purdie of Clinton and Mayor Gene McGee of Ridgeland, as well as former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy.
Mumford touted her 18 years of legal experience during the campaign.
“When I get to the Capitol, my focus is going to be on measures that improve the quality of life for our residents: strong infrastructure, good roads and bridges, a solid quality education for our children, and public safety so we have safe neighborhoods,” Mumford told Mississippi Today in an interview during the campaign.
In Senate District 24, an area encompassing parts of Leflore, Panola and Tallahatchie Counties, Justin Pope on Tuesday night appeared to defeat Curressia Brown.
Pope, a corporate deputy with Progressive Health Group, reported he received 1,944 votes, or 54%, while Brown, a retired college educator, received 1,659 votes. The seat was vacated when longtime Sen. David Jordan of Greenwood retired earlier this year.

In the countywide runoff for Hinds County coroner, Jeramiah Howard appeared victorious over opponent Stephanie Meachum, head of the death division at the state Department of Health’s vital statistics office. Howard has been serving as interim Hinds County coroner since his predecessor, Sharon Grisham-Stewart, retired in 2024. With 95% of precincts reporting, he received about 58% of the unofficial vote to Meachum’s 42%. At that point in the count, voter turnout in the race hovered under 7% countywide.
Howard, who received Grisham-Stewart’s endorsement, had dominated in the November election with 41% of the vote out of six candidates after placing signs in most precincts across the county. He thanked his nearly thirty volunteers ahead of the Tuesday runoff.
“Running for office is a noble deed,” he said. “My fellow candidates ran good races and deserve credit for putting their name on the ballot and reaching people in the community.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/04160842/Voting-5.jpg,,,2025-12-02 22:57:21.274933

At 21, Ali is set to become the youngest state legislator currently serving in Georgia, stealing the title of youngest lawmaker from Democratic Rep. Bryce Berry of Atlanta.
Ali and Cole were the top two candidates in a three-way race last month to represent House District 106, which encompasses a southwestern portion of Gwinnett County. The district was previously represented by Shelly Hutchinson, a Snellville Democrat who stepped down from the state Legislature earlier this year to care for a family member. 
Ali, who works as a graphic designer and served as the former first vice chair of the Gwinnett County Democratic Party, focused his campaign on issues like lowering the cost of living, supporting public schools and protecting the rights of immigrants and LGBTQ Georgians. He received support from key figures in Georgia’s Democratic establishment, securing endorsements from Hutchinson, House Minority Caucus Whip Sam Park, a Lawrenceville Democrat, and former Georgia Governor Roy Barnes, among others.
Cole, who serves as organizing director at an energy and environmental nonprofit, centered his campaign around issues like improving health care access and housing affordability, and investing in public schools. He was endorsed by figures like state Sen. Nikki Merritt, a Grayson Democrat, and Gwinnett Solicitor General Lisamarie Bristol.
Though Cole received the most votes during the Nov. 4 special election, Ali pulled ahead during Tuesday’s runoff, receiving roughly 54% of the more than 1,700 votes cast in the low-turnout election.

Wes Moore speaks at Tuesday's meeting of the Chesapeake Executive Council at the National Aquarium. With him are Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, center, and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, right. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)Chesapeake Bay area leaders have officially committed to a new deadline for improving the health of the nation’s largest estuary: 2040.
The plan approved Tuesday by the state and federal policymakers on the Chesapeake Executive Council is a revised version of their 2014 agreement, which came with a 2025 deadline that bay states realized three years ago they were not going to meet. Tuesday’s vote at the National Aquarium in Baltimore ends months of debate over a new plan, which many environmental advocates have criticized as too slow and not ambitious enough.
The agreement includes goals on subjects from oyster restoration and wetland acreage to curtailing runoff. While the states reached some of their 2014 goals this year, they failed to reduce pollution levels by the pledged amount. Tuesday’s approval adds more time to the clock.
There has been some progress. Since 2009, pollution control practices in the various states are estimated to have reduced nitrogen runoff by 15.3%, phosphorus runoff by 21.8% and sediment runoff by 7.6%.
“We’re proud of that,” Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) said Tuesday, “and there’s more work to do.”
Despite some gains, conditions in the bay and its tributaries have not improved markedly, as states dealt with increasing development and climate change. The most recent data indicates that just over 29% of bay waters met water quality standards, compared to 26.5% in the late ’80s.
The executive council on Tuesday also gave a key Bay Program committee the go-ahead to study the inclusion of Native American tribes in the pact, as chiefs of several Virginia tribes watched from the front row. The Indigenous Conservation Council, representing Virginia’s federally recognized tribes, had asked in January to be included but were told by Bay Program officials that they needed executive council approval first. Tuesday’s vote starts a study that is to be finished by July 1, 2026.

Moore said Tuesday that the bay cleanup effort would not be complete “without making sure that our tribal lands and our tribal peoples are deeply ingrained with any future vision that we have.”
While bay leaders touted the “ambitious but achievable” 2040 goals approved Tuesday, environmental advocates argued that — although improvements were made to the agreement after an unfavorable public comment period this summer — the final outcome remained imperfect.
Kristin Reilly, director of the Choose Clean Water Coalition, which represents more than 300 environmental nonprofits in the Chesapeake watershed, was particularly disappointed in the land conservation goal and the goal for public access sites. The plan calls for 100 new sites “providing access to natural lands and waters” by 2040, compared to the previous goal of adding 300 water access sites by 2025.
“We expect fully that we’re going to hit those targets before 2040,” Reilly said. “We are ready to have those conversations about what the next target should look like.
“It’s not like: We hit this in 2030, 2035. We’re done,” she said. “Let’s set another bar before 2040.”
During the public comment period, nonprofit groups and even some bay scientists expressed consternation that some of the goals had been set too low, or even revised downward — making them easier for the bay states to achieve. And they fretted about the draft agreement’s inconsistent deadlines. Some goals were due by 2030, others by 2035 or 2040.
They expressed concern, too, that the draft document was nearly silent on pollution limits that states are legally required to achieve under the Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load, or TMDL standards, set during President Barack Obama’s (D) administration.
There were also semantic issues: The words “climate change” were replaced by vague references to “changing environmental conditions,” and the word “diversity” was scrubbed from the report.
In response, bay leaders made some changes, setting checkpoints along the way to the uniform 2040 deadline, and explicitly referencing their obligations under the Chesapeake Bay TMDL. But other things remained unchanged.

Maryland also pushed unsuccessfully this year for a 2035 deadline, instead of 2040. Maryland Natural Resources Secretary Josh Kurtz said in an interview Tuesday that other states were hesitant because of the new data coming from computer modeling in the years ahead, but Maryland believed it could have achieved many of the goals 10 years from now, not 15.
“It’s also important for the public to see that there is urgency,” Kurtz said. “I understand that it’s hard for there to be urgency when you’ve been doing something for 40 years, but I think when you are undoing a hundred-plus years of damage, it’s going to take a little bit of time.”
Maryland found support from Virginia, which voted in favor of the 2035 deadline — for all but the pollution targets.
“I was ready to accelerate this whole pace,” Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) said Tuesday. “I think we’ve settled on a very good framework, a framework that sets 2040 as the next huge milestone date, and yet provides intermediate checkpoints along the way.”
The Chesapeake Bay Foundation had also pushed for a 2035.
“The main thing is we just wanted a deadline that was near-term, you know? Something that we could really push on,” said Hilary Harp Falk, president and CEO of the foundation. “But we did get mid-term accountability, which I think is a major improvement.”
David Fotouhi, deputy administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, which is also a signatory to the bay agreement, said Tuesday that the EPA, under President Donald Trump (R) is “fully committed to restoring the Chesapeake watershed.”
After Trump’s first term, when he tried several times to eliminate funding for the EPA’s Chesapeake Bay Program office, questions swirled about what a second Trump term might bring. But Trump did not attack the bay program in his first budget proposal, though other environmental agencies involved in bay work took big budget hits, and many lost employees in Trump’s effort to shrink the federal workforce.
“We will provide funding, technical expertise and data to support our state and local partners,” Fotouhi said on Tuesday. “We will support and coordinate partnership efforts, consistent with our authorities in the Clean Water Act, in Section 117. We will encourage innovation in land and water management, and we will ensure accountability and transparency, so that taxpayers know their tax dollars are making a tangible difference.”

Tuesday’s meeting drew a nearly full slate of governors, compared to prior years when many sent designees. Besides Moore and Youngkin, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D), Delaware Gov. Matt Meyer (D) and Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) were in attendance.
Moore, who had served as chair of the executive council since late 2023, passed the gavel to Shapiro, who was also recently chosen to lead the U.S.-Canada partnership for the Great Lakes. The Chesapeake Bay Foundation said in a news release that it marked the first time in “more than two decades” that a Pennsylvania governor has led the partnership.
“It’s important for me, as a Pennsylvanian, to be part of this conversation,” Shapiro said Tuesday. “For a long time, Pennsylvania took a back seat when it came to cleaning up the bay, and now we are helping lead that discussion.”
Moore gifted Shapiro with a fishing hat, and invited him for a Chesapeake fishing trip targeting invasive blue catfish. Shapiro, in turn, presented Moore with a blue crab-themed baseball cap.
Maryland is one of the states that has either achieved, or is on track to achieve, its pollution reduction commitments; Pennsylvania, with its higher density of farms, has fallen short on nitrogen and phosphorous reduction goals. As of 2024, it had cut nitrogen pollution to 104.5 million pounds, shy of the target of 77 million, and phosphorous to 3.6 million pounds, compared to a goal of 2.8 million pounds.
Collectively, the bay states had only achieved 59% of their nitrogen goal by 2024, compared to 92% of the phosphorus goal. The states, however, did achieve their goal to reduce sediment pollution.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderSince 2023, part of a controversial Georgia election law banning food and water from being distributed to voters waiting in line has been on hold, as a lawsuit against the measure worked its way through the federal court system.
But the ban on “line warming,” as the practice is sometimes called, may be allowed to take effect for the 2026 midterm elections after a three-judge panel on the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered a lower court to reconsider its ruling in the case.
The 11th Circuit Court’s ruling, which was released Monday, vacated the 2023 ruling and remanded the case to U.S. District Judge J.P. Boulee due to a new precedent that was set by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2024.
“We find that it would be inappropriate at this juncture to address the merits of the plaintiffs’ First Amendment challenge,” the panel wrote in Monday’s ruling, instructing the district court to conduct a type of legal analysis outlined in the recent Supreme Court ruling, Moody v. NetChoice, LLC.
Senate Bill 202 passed in 2021 after President Donald Trump’s narrow defeat in Georgia. The law made several controversial changes to Georgia election law, including restricting the window of time voters have to request an absentee ballot, limiting ballot drop boxes, and implementing new voter ID requirements for absentee voting. It also contained a provision that made it a misdemeanor offense to hand out food and drinks to voters waiting in line.
The law gained national attention — and criticism — with Georgia-based businesses like Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines speaking out against the legislation, and Major League Baseball deciding to move its 2021 All-Star game out of the state. An episode of HBO Max’s “Curb Your Enthusiasm” also depicted actor Larry David getting arrested for handing out a bottle of water to a voter in line.
Proponents of the law have argued that distributing food and water violates state and federal laws meant to prevent groups from buying votes through money or other means.
But opponents said the measure was cruel and discriminatory, pointing to reports of hourslong wait times at the polls in metro Atlanta during the 2020 election. Attorneys for the plaintiffs also argued that the law restricted Georgians’ First Amendment rights to free speech.
In 2023, Boulee upheld part of the ban on distributing refreshments to voters within a 150-foot “buffer zone” outside polling places. However, he temporarily blocked a provision banning volunteers from offering food and water within a “supplemental zone,” defined as 25 feet from any voter in line at a polling place, arguing that such activities count as “expressive conduct” and are therefore protected by the First Amendment. The appeals court heard arguments in the case this past August.
Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp’s office declined to comment on the case, citing pending litigation. However, other state leaders, including Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, applauded the ruling.
“The 11th Circuit’s ruling reinforces a simple truth: Georgia has the right and the responsibility to shield voters from influence and interference at the polls,” Raffensperger said in a statement, adding “our laws safeguard every Georgian’s right to free, fair, and fast elections.”
Cory Isaacson, legal director at the ACLU of Georgia, which is representing the plaintiffs, said she was disappointed in the appeals court’s ruling, but said the organization planned to keep fighting. 
“It is important to note that the 11th Circuit didn’t reach the merits of whether or not this law is actually unconstitutional,” she said. “It instead sent it back to the district court to do a different analysis, so we remain hopeful that what’s right and lawful will prevail and that ultimately, we will see the line relief ban overturned again.”

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Gov. Bob Ferguson warned Tuesday that the budget proposal he’ll release this month will rely solely on spending cuts and not higher taxes to overcome what he says is a multi-billion dollar shortfall.
“That’s the plan,” Ferguson told reporters at the state Capitol. “I don’t plan on balancing the budget with revenue.”
“It’s a fluid situation, as you might imagine, but that is our focus right now,” Ferguson said.
The first-term Democrat also said he would not sign any increase in sales or property taxes, two tested options lawmakers could use to raise revenue quickly.
Ferguson’s comments offered the clearest insight yet on his approach to writing his first spending plan, due out in about two weeks. It puts him at odds with progressive Democrats clamoring for new taxes on wealthy residents and large corporations.
Shortly before Ferguson made his comments, state Rep. Shaun Scott, D-Seattle, held a press conference on the Capitol steps about payroll tax legislation he is sponsoring that would target larger companies with higher-paid employees.
He pointed to billions of dollars in spending reductions lawmakers made this year, as they also pushed through upward of $9 billion in new and higher taxes. Since then, estimates have shown tax collections falling below expectations.
“The question I would ask is: How many cuts is enough?” Scott said. “Revenue is the way that we solve many of the problems that are posed in front of us.”
The governor said he wasn’t familiar with Scott’s proposal.
Ferguson emphasized that the state’s looming financial decisions are tougher than the ones made in the two-year operating budget he signed in May, which dealt with a gap that the governor pegged at around $16 billion over four years. 
“We cut about $8 billion from the budget earlier this year,” the governor said. “So, as you might imagine, the ninth billion that you’re cutting is a lot more challenging to cut than the first billion.”
When asked why he was not turning to new tax revenue, given the difficult decisions he described, he said the kinds of new tax ideas Democratic lawmakers are talking about, including Scott’s bill, cannot bring in money fast enough to solve the state’s immediate budget problems.
“We have a multi-billion dollar shortfall this next year,” he said.
“That’s just a reality that the Legislature is going to have to grapple with as well,” Ferguson added. 
He vowed to veto sales or property tax increases if they reach his desk. “Those things are not going to happen,” he said.
Ferguson’s budget proposal will serve as a template for House and Senate budget writers during the 2026 legislative session that begins Jan. 12. Budget legislation approved next year will make adjustments to the two-year spending plan enacted this spring.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/washington-state-capitol-2048x1536-1-1024x768-1.jpg,,,2025-12-02 21:57:32.339354

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)In a race that drew national attention and brought leaders from both major parties to Middle Tennessee to campaign, Republican Matt Van Epps pulled out a narrow win over Democratic Rep. Aftyn Behn in the special election for Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District. 
Van Epps edged Behn by nearly 7%  in a district Democrats have lost by more than 20 percentage points over the last several election cycles. With more than 95% of the votes counted, Van Epps pulled in 51.9% of the vote while Behn earned 47.1%.
In spite of the Republican win Tuesday, the Democratic surge became a focal talking point in a district President Donald Trump won by 22% in 2024 — and became a referendum on his second administration. 
Van Epps described himself as a “MAGA warrior” in his ads and promised to back up Trump, while Behn ran on a slogan of “Feed kids, fix roads, fund hospitals,” addressing messages to working-class Tennesseans. 
Behn, elected to the Tennessee General Assembly during a 2023 special election, has sponsored legislative measures to end the state’s 4% tax on groceries and a bill that would legalize marijuana and use the tax revenue from sales for highway repairs.

She won a four-way Democratic primary in October against three better-funded candidates, including two other state lawmakers. 
Van Epps, a West Point graduate and combat veteran who worked in Gov. Bill Lee’s administration, beat 10 Republicans in his primary, benefiting from large cash infusions by outside groups and Montgomery County’s pro-military voting bloc. The county is home to the U.S. Army’s Ft. Campbell and the 101st Airborne Division. 
Triggered by the July resignation of U.S. Rep. Mark Green, a Republican, the race morphed into one of national significance after the Nov. 4 elections across the country in which Democrats won gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey and Mississippi Democrats broke a Republican supermajority legislature. 
The election of Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani as New York Mayor also played a factor in the Tennessee election, with Republicans comparing Behn negatively to him. 
Millions of dollars poured into the race, and national political figures became involved, with Trump endorsing Van Epps and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson stumping for the Republican nominee on Monday.  
Two former vice presidents — Al Gore, a native Tennessean, and Kamala Harris — weighed in on Behn’s behalf, as did U.S. Reps. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of New York and Pramila Jayapal of Washington and the chairs of both the Democratic and Republican National Committees. 
Democrats last won District 7 in 1980, before once-a-decade redistricting moved then-U.S. Rep. Ed Jones, a Democrat, into District 8. 
During the 2022 redistricting process, Green expressed concern about new maps drawing portions of Nashville/Davidson County — which historically votes Democratic — into District 7, calling them “inherently unfair.”
After Democratic candidates lost to Green in both 2018 and 2020 by more than 30%, margins narrowed following the most recent redistricting. 
The 7th District has proven to be a launching pad for representatives: Don Sundquist, who held the seat from 1983 to 1997, became Tennessee governor, while Marsha Blackburn, who held the seat from 2003 to 2018, is now a U.S. Senator and gubernatorial candidate.
