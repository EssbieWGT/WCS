Bennett/ Maine Morning Star)District policies that protect students’ privacy when it comes to gender identity might be violating federal law by depriving parents of information, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
In another directed investigation launched by the department based on reports from right-wing media about Maine districts complying with the Maine Human Rights Act, the department alleged that by developing plans to affirm students’ gender, districts may be in violation of the Family Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA).
Maine’s support of transgender athletes already faced a federal investigation through the department’s Office for Civil Rights, with the state being found in violation of Title IX for allowing trans girls to participate in sports aligning with their gender identity. 
Whether Maine decides to sue or comply with the resolution agreement proposed by OCR remains to be seen, with the Maine Attorney General’s office declining to comment. School officials from MSAD 51 and the Maine Principals Association, which were also under investigation, have already said they will not sign the agreement.
The FERPA investigation is another example of President Donald Trump’s administration targeting Maine for protecting students’ access to affirming school environments through the Maine Human Rights Act. 
In a letter to the Maine Department of Education, Frank Miller, acting director for the Student Privacy Policy Office, highlighted a 2016 memo by the Maine Human Rights Commission that explains the interpretation of the Act: “In the event that the student and their parent/legal guardian do not agree with regard to the student’s sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression, the educational institution should, whenever possible, abide by the wishes of the student with regard to their gender identity and expression while at school,” the memo states.
“The overall memorandum on its face appears to give school officials discretion that would infringe on the rights of a parent under FERPA,” Miller said in his letter. 
He also alleged that “this same rhetoric may lead to Title IX violations if applied in a school environment,” which may warrant the investigation to be referred to the OCR. 
Miller’s letter also highlights that because school counselors or school social workers are not required by Maine law to divulge information gathered during counseling, it may keep parents from “exercising their right to inspect and review education records relating to their child’s counseling with a school counselor or school social worker.”
Parents Defending Education, a far-right “parental rights” group, has been scrutinizing school districts and filing federal civil rights complaints nationwide against school districts — including Portland in 2023 —  for several years for their policies protecting students’ rights. The USDOE investigation cites the goal of Parents Defending Education President Nicole Neily “to hold school districts accountable and ensure no child is socially transitioned behind parent’s backs by teachers or administrators.”
The fight between parental rights and students’ privacy rights when it comes to gender identity at school has played out in courts for the past few years, prompted by lawsuits filed in at least six states by parents rights groups. 
Legal experts working with the school districts have argued that districts are trying to support students by having these policies in place, and are required to protect students’ privacy rights over parents’ rights to information about their children.
In Maine, one such lawsuit stemmed from parent Amber Lavigne suing her child’s school district for using affirming pronouns and a school counselor giving her child a chest binder. That lawsuit was dismissed, with Judge John Levy of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine saying that while it is understandable that a parent might want to stay informed, the district and staff did not violate Lavigne’s rights as they were following the district’s transgender students guidelines.

Dr. Fred Levin has been watching with growing alarm the national debate around federal cuts to Medicaid. He’s responsible for the medical care of about 100 older adults at the Community PACE center in rural Newaygo, Michigan. For his patients, Medicaid isn’t just a safety net — it’s a matter of life or death.
“If left to see to their own needs, a lot of them would stay in their homes and would slowly die,” he said. “They wouldn’t be able to get to their doctors’ appointments unless they had a family member to help. They wouldn’t get social care. They wouldn’t have people coming into their homes and seeing the bed bugs or the lice in their hair. They wouldn’t get their medications.”
The care at Community PACE is paid for by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities, and Medicare, the federal insurance program for people 65 and older. The center is a one-stop shop that provides medical and social services to older adults during the day, allowing them to continue living safely in their homes.

If Congress cuts funding to Medicaid, Levin expects his center would probably close. Unlike traditional nursing home care, which state Medicaid programs are required by federal law to cover, the services at PACE centers like his are an optional benefit that 33 states have opted to cover.
Around the nation, doctors, lawmakers, advocates and patients are watching anxiously as Republicans in Congress consider proposals to slash billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in proposed tax cuts. The specific nature of the funding cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states.










If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved.


– Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy, Justice in Aging


The additional financial burden could blow billion-dollar holes in state budgets, forcing state lawmakers to slash health benefits or restrict who’s eligible for them. Nearly a fifth of Americans rely on Medicaid, and the percentage is even higher in some states.
“There are a lot of people who don’t pay attention to this because they think it doesn’t affect them personally,” Levin said. “But 1 in 4 people in Michigan are on Medicaid. It’s very likely you have friends or family on Medicaid.”
Nearly all Americans over age 65 are covered by Medicare, which Republicans have pledged not to touch. Medicare doesn’t cover most nursing home or other long-term care, however. Neither does most private insurance.
But Medicaid does.
“If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved,” said Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy for Justice in Aging, an advocacy group focused on addressing poverty among older people.
“Many of us have a connection to the program or will one day,” she said.

A divided front

Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But policy experts say that reducing coverage for some Medicaid recipients, such as the working adults who got coverage under expansion programs, will have ripple effects on vulnerable groups such as children and older adults.
Republicans aren’t united in a desire to see massive cuts.
Last month, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican governor in a purple state, publicly called on Congress not to slash Medicaid funding.

Earlier this week, Washington Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier wrote a letter to Trump asking him to reconsider cuts to Medicaid and expressing her concern about the large number of military retirees and senior citizens in her district.
Caldier, a dentist who has worked with nursing home patients, told Stateline she believes the most likely cuts would be a reduction in the amount the federal government matches state spending for working adults who are covered under Medicaid expansion. That, she said, would have little impact on older adults.
“The only caveat is that I am very worried that the leadership in our state does not have a good relationship with our president,” Caldier said. Democrats control the offices of governor and both legislative chambers in Washington state. Caldier worries that if Washington lawmakers defy the president over issues such as gender-affirming care for transgender youth, the feds could retaliate by slashing their Medicaid payments to the state.
“If we got into a political match with the president, we would lose, no matter how you slice or dice it,” she said.
In Idaho, Republican state lawmakers shot down a bill that likely would have repealed Medicaid expansion, before passing one that will introduce sweeping policy changes in an effort to control costs.
Even in Congress, some Republicans are balking, publicly defending Medicaid and warning about the consequences of deep cuts. Some who have high percentages of Medicaid recipients in their districts have urged party leaders not to cut funding for the program and have vowed to vote against any budget plan that does so.
Medicaid covers 72 million Americans. A majority of American adults, including two-thirds of Republicans, say they want Congress to either maintain current Medicaid spending or increase it, according to a February 2025 poll from KFF, a health policy research group.
President Donald Trump has said in recent months that he won’t touch Medicaid. But last month, U.S. House Republicans pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that calls for about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help counterbalance the Trump administration’s desired $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.
Facing cuts that large, states would have to figure out which benefits to chop in order to keep their budgets balanced, which is a constitutional requirement in most states.
Older adults and people with disabilities already account for more than half of states’ Medicaid spending, on average. In some states, including Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Mississippi and North Dakota, those groups account for two-thirds of state Medicaid spending.
Idaho state Sen. Melissa Wintrow, a Democrat on the state Senate Health & Welfare committee, said her biggest concern is Congress reducing the federal match rate. This is the amount of money the federal government chips in to help states pay for Medicaid. How much a state receives mainly depends on how wealthy its residents are. Richer states such as California and Connecticut get less help, while poorer states get more.
In Idaho, on the poorer end of the spectrum, the feds pay about 67% of traditional Medicaid costs and 90% of Medicaid expansion costs.
“It is all a domino effect,” Wintrow said. The federal government covers about $3 billion of Idaho’s $4.2 billion Medicaid budget. “If the feds start chopping that off, it’s going to impact everything.”

Cutting care at home

All state Medicaid programs have opted to cover at least some home-based and community care, such as home health aides who assist people with bathing, toileting and other daily living activities, transportation and adult day care.
Kean and other experts worry that because federal law doesn’t require state Medicaid programs to cover home-based care, state lawmakers might sharply reduce spending on those services — or even eliminate coverage.

“When states have budget shortfalls, they start to tighten eligibility for the home-based programs,” said Kean. “We’re certain those would be the first to go if federal funding is cut for Medicaid.”
Paying for home-based services out of pocket would exhaust the median Medicare recipient’s savings in less than two years, according to KFF.
The median cost of a year of a full-time aide to help is about $62,400, far above the median income for Americans over 65, which is about $36,000. The median life savings for Medicare beneficiaries was $103,800 in 2023.
Home-based services are a popular benefit for state Medicaid programs, because most enrollees prefer to remain in their homes. And despite the expense, home care can be more cost effective than nursing homes — about $38,000 vs. nearly $54,000 per year in 2021, according to a KFF analysis.
Cutting Medicaid also could make it harder to recruit and keep a workforce of nursing home and home health employees.
Over the past two years, most states — even those led by Republicans — increased their Medicaid payment rates for those services, in an effort to combat the nationwide shortage of long-term care workers.
But federal funding cuts could jeopardize what states are able to pay those workers.
“There’s already a direct-care workforce crisis,” Kean said. “Even if eligibility isn’t directly cut or programs aren’t cut, there wouldn’t be enough workers to provide that care. At home and in nursing facilities, the quality of care will go down.”
In rural Michigan, Levin said the PACE center where he works employs about 100 people. Its closure would impact not only those workers, but also would mean his patients would be left to find transportation and other health services on their own, even if those services are still covered by Medicaid.
“Without access in rural areas, how are these individuals going to get to the bigger cities where they can get to their health care? It’s going to overwhelm other parts of the health care system,” Levin said.
“Everybody’s going to be responsible for taking care of the people who don’t have health insurance, in some indirect way or another. It’s going to affect us all.”

Nearly 20 years ago, my wife and I were lucky enough to study abroad in England. We had been awarded graduate scholarships and obtained our student visas from the British government. At the time, there was a heartbreaking genocide happening in Darfur. As concerned students invested in the moral standing of our university, we joined peaceful protests calling on Oxford to divest from companies that profited from the genocide and urged the British Parliament to intervene.
I never feared that my exercise of free speech would get me arrested and kicked out of what I took to be the second freest nation on earth, after my own. And I certainly could not have imagined a swarm of British agents abducting me on the street and deporting me without cause. Perhaps in the time of King George III but not the age of constitutions.



On Tuesday, Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish graduate student at Tufts University in Boston, was walking peacefully to the university’s Interfaith Center to break her Ramadan fast when six government agents in masks and hoodies surrounded her and took her away screaming in an unmarked SUV.
For a day or more, according to Fox News, Rumeysa’s family and lawyers had no idea where she was and were unable to contact her. No charges were filed against her. A federal district judge even ordered the government not to move her out of state. But she was moved anyway — to a detention center in Louisiana, awaiting deportation.
Rumeysa had a valid student visa, as Fox News also reported. She was awarded a prestigious Fulbright Fellowship to complete her Ph.D. at Tufts’ Department of Child Study and Human Development, where she researches children and media. No charges were filed against her and there was no warrant for her arrest; warrants are issued by judges who require the government to show cause.
The best guess for why she has been detained is that her name appeared with several others on an article in the student newspaper last year calling on Tufts University to “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide” and divest from companies with ties to Israel. The op-ed never mentioned Hamas, which the U.S. government rightly considers a terrorist organization. There is no evidence that she harbored any sympathy for, much less aided and abetted, Hamas or other organizations opposed to the United States. It seems her only “crime” was to peacefully speak out, as a concerned student, in a manner disfavored by the current administration.
Americans may freely disagree about the heartbreaking conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, which has left thousands of innocent Israelis and hundreds of thousands of innocent Palestinians dead or injured in recent years. For my part, having traveled to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, and believing in the state of Israel as a necessary response to the evils of the Holocaust (in which Jewish family members of mine were killed), I take seriously the conclusions of the International Criminal Court and Amnesty International that Israel’s war in Gaza is a “plausible” genocide.
But regardless of what we believe about Israel and Palestine, there is one thing on which Americans overwhelmingly agree: our constitutional right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment is sacred and immigrants who lawfully reside among us are not without rights of their own. As you uphold my right to call the war in Gaza genocidal, I defend your right to call Hamas an evil terrorist organization. In fact, I’ll join in that because it is also true.
Freedom of speech is as American as apple pie. It’s what has attracted many of the brightest minds from foreign lands to come here legally as students and help make America the richest, most innovative nation on earth — including Elon Musk.
Sadly, Rumeysa is not alone. She is one of hundreds of lawful immigrants so far who have been targeted for deportation by the Trump administration in recent weeks, without any pretense of due process. Their abductions on American streets by unmarked and unidentified “law enforcement” agents are being funded by our tax dollars to the tune of untold millions.
So far we have seen at least seven other students detained for showing sympathy for Palestinians; hundreds of Venezuelan migrants deported to a Salvadoran prison camp against the orders of a federal judge, and extended detentions and physical abuse of lawful migrants at the American border. These and countless other acts represent an unprecedented abuse of federal power against individuals whose lack of citizenship gives them limited legal recourse, in spite of their legal status in this country.
Given the choice, I still believe my fellow Americans would choose the Constitution over a man who would be king. It’s time we make that choice — not just for Rumeysa but for this country we love.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rumeysaozturk-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-28 13:07:49.579023

Free.,Trump asks U.S. Supreme Court to restore blocked deportation plan,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-asks-us-supreme-court-restore-blocked-deportation-plan,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration submitted an emergency appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday in an effort to resume the rapid deportations of Venezuelans accused of gang ties under a wartime law that a lower court blocked.Acting U.S. Solicitor General Sarah Harris argued in a brief to the Supreme Court that a federal judge’s temporary restraining order this month, and an appeals court ruling Wednesday upholding it, wrongly denied President Donald Trump the authority to make decisions about national security operations, including the removal of Venezuelan nationals the administration says are subject to the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.“The district court’s orders have rebuffed the President’s judgments as to how to protect the Nation against foreign terrorist organizations and risk debilitating effects for delicate foreign negotiations,” Harris wrote in her request to the court.The Alien Enemies Act had only been invoked three times, during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.The Trump administration has tried to use it in a novel way, when the nation is not officially at war. The administration designated the Tren de Aragua – a gang that originated in Venezuela – as a foreign terrorist group, and argued that any Venezuelan nationals aged 14 and older with suspected ties to the gang are subject to the proclamation.U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg placed a temporary restraining order on the Trump administration’s use of the law this month, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the order this week. The administration asked the Supreme Court to lift the order.“As long as the orders remain in force, the United States is unable to rely on the Proclamation to remove dangerous affiliates with a foreign terrorist organization—even if the United States receives indications that particular (Tren de Aragua) members are about to take destabilizing or infiltrating actions,” Harris said Friday.Extending restraining orderBoasberg’s temporary restraining order placed on the use of the Alien Enemies Act is set to expire Saturday. The American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the suit, requested that order be extended for an additional two weeks.The ACLU also plans to request Boasberg issue a preliminary injunction, which would block the administration from deportations under the act until the lawsuit is complete. A hearing is set for April 8.Boasberg has rejected the Trump administration's move to lift his restraining order, on the grounds that those subject to the Alien Enemies Act should have due process to challenge those accusations.At the D.C. Circuit this week, Department of Justice attorneys for the Trump administration argued that those subject to the proclamation do not need to be notified they are being removed under the Alien Enemies Act. The Trump administration also argued that those who fall under the Alien Enemies Act can bring a challenge of their detention under a habeas corpus claim.Defied verbal orderThe White House quietly implemented the act on March 15 and a verbal restraining order given by Boasberg that day to block it went into effect hours later.In that order, Boasberg barred the Trump administration from applying the act but three deportation plans landed in El Salvador after the order was issued. The Trump administration has argued that his verbal order was not enforceable.Boasberg also ordered that anyone subject to the Alien Enemies Act be returned to the U.S., but federal immigration agents took more than 250 men aboard the three flights to a notorious prison in El Salvador.Boasberg has vowed to determine if the Trump administration violated his restraining order in sending the deportation planes to El Salvador, but Attorney General Pam Bondi invoked the “state secrets privilege” to refuse to answer detailed questions about the flights.Friday’s emergency request is one of several immigration-related appeals the Trump administration has made to the high court, such as the request to lift several nationwide injunctions placed on the president's executive order that ends the constitutional right of birthright citizenship.",,,,2025-03-28 13:07:49.579023

Department of Corrections)COLUMBIA — Death row inmate Mikal Mahdi chose to die by firing squad, making him the second person in the state to do so since executions resumed, his attorneys said Friday.
Mahdi, 42, was sentenced to death in 2006 for shooting and killing off-duty police officer James Myers with his own rifle as part of a multi-state crime spree. The only remaining man on death row with no remaining appeals, Mahdi is scheduled to die at 6 p.m. April 11.
Brad Sigmon, executed March 7, was the first inmate in the state to die by firing squad, which legislators made an option in 2021. The three other inmates executed since September selected lethal injection.
By law, death row inmates have until two weeks before their execution date to choose whether they will die by firing squad, lethal injection or electrocution, which legislators made the default method in 2021. Mahdi chose “the lesser of three evils,” his attorney, David Weiss, said in a statement Friday.
“Mikal chose the firing squad instead of being burned and mutilated in the electric chair, or suffering a lingering death on the lethal injection gurney,” Weiss said.
SC inmate executed by firing squad, a first nationwide since 2010

Legislators added firing squad as an option after years of struggling to get the drugs used for lethal injection. Inmates challenged the method, as well as electrocution, arguing it violated the constitutional right to avoid cruel and unusual punishment.
The state Supreme Court ruled last year that firing squad and electrocution were constitutional methods of execution, allowing the process to resume after a 13-year hiatus. By that point, lethal injection was again an option, after Department of Corrections officials were able to restock their supply thanks to a law keeping everything about the drugs and the companies selling them a secret.
Inmates have challenged that secrecy law, arguing inmates have a right to know more about the drugs that would kill them. But the state Supreme Court and a federal judge have both turned down those arguments, ruling officials have disclosed everything the law requires for an inmate to make his choice.
Barring intervention from a court or the governor, Mahdi would become the fifth in the nation to be executed by firing squad, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Other than Sigmon, the remaining three took place in Utah, which last conducted a firing squad execution in 2010.
Mahdi will be strapped to a chair, facing three rectangular openings 15 feet away. Three firing squad members will shoot through those openings, using .308 Winchester bullets, which expand and fragment on impact, causing a more instantaneous death, corrections officials have said previously.
“Before Mikal committed these tragic murders, he was a child in desperate need of care and support,” Weiss said in a statement. “We will continue to fight for the child Mikal was and the man he is today. Executing Mikal on this record would ignore the many ways we failed him in favor of one final injustice.”
Mikal Mahdi
On July 14, 2004, in his hometown of Lawrenceville, Virginia, Mahdi stole a car and a gun before fleeing south. Stopping in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Mahdi shot gas station clerk Christopher Boggs point-blank in the head while Boggs was verifying his ID to buy a beer, according to court documents.
Mahdi continued on to South Carolina, where he carjacked a man in Columbia and drove to Calhoun County. He stopped at a gas station, where a clerk seemed to grow suspicious after the gas pump declined his card. Mahdi fled on foot to a nearby farmhouse, where he hid out in Myers’ workshop.
When Myers, a captain for the Orangeburg Department of Public Safety, returned home at the end of the day, Mahdi shot him nine times with one of the rifles Myers kept there, according to court documents.
Mahdi lit Myers’ body on fire and stole his police truck, which he continued driving south. Police arrested Mahdi in Satellite Beach, Florida, on July 21, 2004, a week after he stole the first car.
Mahdi pleaded guilty to the crimes in 2006, at which point Judge Clifton Newman sentenced him to death.
SC death row inmate’s attorneys ask court to halt execution over traumatic childhood

Mahdi’s attorneys have asked the state Supreme Court to halt his execution, claiming a traumatic childhood influenced his development and led him to a life of crime.
Mahdi’s original defense attorneys hardly touched on his past, which could have convinced Newman to sentence him to life in prison instead of death, Mahdi’s current attorneys argued in court filings.
As a child, Mahdi struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts, his attorneys claimed. He entered the juvenile justice system at age 14 for committing property crimes and spent most of his life in jails after that point, often in solitary confinement, his attorneys said.
Mahdi had been out of jail for about two months when he committed the crimes that landed him on death row.
“When we think of Mikal choosing his method of execution, we’re reminded of the tormented child who, at nine years old, told his teacher that he wanted to shoot himself. Or, on another occasion, to electrocute himself. Or, another time, to hang himself,” Weiss said in a statement Friday.
But Mahdi’s attorneys didn’t show anything the court hasn’t already considered and dismissed during the appeals process, the Attorney General’s Office responded in a filing this week. Mahdi’s difficult childhood and the impact it may have had on him have no legal bearing on his crime, the attorneys continued.
The state Supreme Court has not yet given a decision on the arguments.
The state’s highest court, as well as the U.S. Supreme Court, has yet to rule in favor of stopping a South Carolina inmate’s execution in the past six months. Mahdi can also appeal to Gov. Henry McMaster for clemency, which no governor has granted in the modern era.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/execution.jpg,,,2025-03-28 13:07:49.579023

Lawmakers voted 34-14 to advance Legislative Bill 415, with all Republicans and one Democratic senator voting to advance the bill in the officially nonpartisan body. 
The split vote came largely because of the folding in of LB 698, from freshman State Sen. Paul Strommen of Sidney, which opponents said would undercut the recently passed law. The amended LB 415 would not require paid sick leave to be given to 14 or 15 year olds, temporary or seasonal agricultural workers or workers in businesses with 10 or fewer employees. 
Businesses could still choose to offer such leave to these employees.

State Sen. John Fredrickson of Omaha did not vote for or against advancing the amended bill in part because he viewed the underlying LB 415, as introduced, as an important bill. He said his “present, not voting” position was a “show of good faith” that Strommen might listen to some concerns raised during debate in future rounds of debate on the bill.
Beginning Oct. 1, under the currently approved law, businesses with fewer than 20 weekly employees would allow employees a process to accrue up to five days’ worth of paid sick leave a year (40 hours), or seven days for larger businesses (56 hours). An hour of leave could be earned for every 30 hours worked.
Employees can use paid sick leave for themselves or a family member for mental or physical illness, injury or a health condition or for a medical diagnosis or preventive medical care. Paid sick time could also be used during a public health emergency that closes a business or school.
Voters adopted the paid sick leave ballot measure with nearly 75% of the vote in November, including majority support across all 49 legislative districts. The measure was heavily supported by Nebraska labor groups.
Strommen said he believed it was the Legislature’s duty to “iron out details” and make the laws “make sense for everyone, workers and businesses alike.” 
“It is incumbent upon the legislature to ensure it is workable,” he said.

The Paid Sick Leave for Nebraskans coalition said Friday that voters were clear in November about providing earned paid sick leave to all Nebraskans, regardless of age, sector, workforce status or business size.
“We are extremely disappointed by the Nebraska Legislature’s egregious disregard of the will of Nebraska voters,” the coalition said in a statement.
An initial ‘cleanup bill’
LB 415 was originally introduced by State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln as a “cleanup bill” that he worked on with the Nebraska Chambers of Commerce and advocates for paid sick leave. The campaign manager of last year’s paid sick leave measure told the Nebraska Examiner in January they were “not concerned” with the changes but would oppose any more expansive amendments.
Ballard’s bill would clarify that businesses that meet or exceed the new law would not need to change their existing leave policies, including accrual or carryover components. It would also clarify how leave can be requested and when employees could begin to accrue sick leave.
“LB 415 is a cleanup bill meant to clarify some of the concerns of members in the business community,” Ballard said of his introduced bill.
Multiple senators had spoken in favor of Ballard’s bill but withdrew their support after Strommen’s bill was attached.
‘Avoiding a few serious detriments’
While well-intentioned, Strommen said, he argued the new “mandate” — his word for what voters passed — could raise costs or lead to lost jobs or wages, or some small businesses shutting down altogether.

He said his bill recognized the will of voters while “avoiding a few serious detriments.”
“While the idea of paid sick leave is appealing, government mandates on businesses can create unintended negative consequences for employees, specifically those who work for small businesses,” he said.
Strommen’s additions would also give the Nebraska Department of Labor sole authority to enforce the act, rather than private lawsuits. 
The bill will likely need to be amended in the future to maintain at least 33 votes, the minimum amount needed to change the voter-approved measure, under the Nebraska Constitution. Strommen has filed to add back in the private lawsuits enforcement, as has State Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont. Other supporters said they wanted that change to be added back in.
Two other amendments lawmakers could consider would keep the paid sick leave requirements for minors and ag workers and the right to sue if the paid sick leave is not granted. Both would continue to exempt the smallest businesses from the new requirement, as Strommen proposed.
State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln proposed keeping the 10 or fewer employee level, while State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha has proposed lowering that to three or fewer employees, which is the cut-off for minimum wage.
‘You should resign’
Across a full week of debate, opponents sought to frame the measure as one in a string of emerging bills that they said would hurt working families and roll back or sidestep recently approved ballot measures.

In a heated exchange with Strommen, for example, Conrad asked why he would “honor election elections for your race, but not for ballot initiatives?” Strommen said he voted against the measure in November.
“If you do not trust the election results, you should resign your position,” Conrad told Strommen.
Strommen, who was visibly taken aback, scoffed and told her, “That’s fantastic.” He immediately put the question back on Conrad, asking if she was comfortable telling her constituents she opposed his changes that “had the opportunity to ensure that they [her constituents] were going to have their jobs.”
Conrad interrupted and said that wasn’t her question, nor was it the question before voters.
‘Take it or leave it’
Whether lawmakers should amend any ballot measure shortly after its passage was another theme of the debate, teeing up an expected fight next week on whether to create exceptions or cap annual increases to the state minimum wage, which passed in 2022.
State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln, the Democratic lawmaker who supported the Strommen and Ballard bills, is leading the minimum wage changes in her 2025 priority bill: LB 258. Raybould’s family created and owns B&R Stores, the parent company of Super Saver, Russ’s Market and more. The company announced this week that she will step down as vice president of the company Monday.

Raybould and State Sen. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse pointed to the Nebraska Constitution allowing lawmakers to change ballot measures with a 33-vote supermajority.
Raybould described that higher threshold as a “balance” that is necessary when voters have a “take it or leave it” option at the polls.
“To suggest that it is wrong for the Legislature to deliberate and bring thoughtful changes to legislation passed by initiative is like you’re saying it is wrong for the people to have the right to a referendum,” Raybould said.
If a ballot measure fails, supporters are prohibited under state law from advancing a similar measure at a future election for at least two years. The petition process must also be repeated.
State Sen. Tony Sorrentino of the Elkhorn area said that if lawmakers truly didn’t want to touch initiatives and consider them settled, he expected “pro choice” lawmakers to never push to expand abortion in the state.
“I’m just following up on your ideas,” Sorrentino said. “I have a feeling that probably won’t happen, but I think you have to hear both sides of the logic.”
‘Veto power over the people’
State Sens. Terrell McKinney and Wendy DeBoer, both of Omaha, argued there was no binary option and that voters had the right to vote as they wanted to.
DeBoer said if senators disagreed with voters, that’s OK, but that it is the people who get to decide what government looks like. She said lawmakers “do not have veto power over the people.”
“In every election as long as I can remember, there has been at least one result that I did not like, that I thought was foolish, that I thought was the wrong decision,” DeBoer said.
She continued: “If someone can say, ‘No, we veto what the people say,’ then we are no longer a government where the people choose.”

Hallstrom described that as a “false narrative” and said he didn’t think anyone was saying voters were wrong or misinformed.
Multiple senators said during the debate or off the floor that voters couldn’t have possibly envisioned the full implications of the law. Some senators said they believed voters were likely more focused on abortion, school choice or marijuana last fall, not paid sick leave.
No campaign was waged against the paid sick leave campaign, which Conrad said was “because they knew they couldn’t win” and that opponents wanted to “sneak into the Legislature to undermine the will of the voters.”
“They did not do so with their fingers crossed behind their backs,” Conrad said. “The election results were not notched with an asterisk saying, ‘Oh, yes, it received 70% support, but we in leadership think Nebraska voters were not smart enough to understand what they were voting for.’”
Conrad challenged those opposing the current law to run a ballot initiative themselves. Sorrentino, Conrad and McKinney are among those who brought measures this year related to recently approved ballot measures.
In Sorrentino’s case, he is seeking to revive a defeated school choice program via tax credits for scholarships, or vouchers, to private schools. Conrad and McKinney were among four senators to bring measures to clarify or change how medical cannabis should be implemented.
‘Not bottomless wishing wells’
  State Sen. Mike Moser of Columbus. Oct. 28, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. Mike Moser of Columbus said being told to offer increased minimum wage to all employees, no matter their work ethic, is one thing, while the addition of another “mandate” like paid sick leave, “again, without merit,” he said, is “not an economic benefit to the employer.”
“Business owners are not bottomless wishing wells full of money for the benefit of their employees,” Moser said.
Hallstrom said some businesses would face a “double whammy” in paying someone out sick and paying a temporary worker.
State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward noted her children have done detasseling for several weeks in the summer, and she said they didn’t need sick leave during that time.
“If they were sick, they stayed home and didn’t get paid,” she said.
Supporters of the paid sick leave law have said businesses are better off offering paid sick leave by being able to retain employees and avoiding workforce churn. They’ve also argued workers benefit from the paid time off because it gives them the flexibility to attend to their families and recover from illness without financial loss.
McKinney and other opponents repeatedly read district-by-district election margins on the issue, which ranged from 60% in ruby-red north-central Nebraska for freshman State Sen. Tanya Storer all the way up to 92% support in McKinney’s North Omaha district.

“Supporting ‘family values’ means supporting families, and that starts with letting people take care of sick kids or elderly parents without losing their income or taking care of themselves in time of sickness,” McKinney said.
State Sens. Dunixi Guereca and Margo Juarez, both of Omaha whose districts were among those with the highest support for the measure, said they trusted voters to make the right choice. Guereca said the changes seek to exclude the “very people” that some voters had in mind, such as a single mother who is a waitress or a worker in a small fabrication shop, who “just need a little help.”
Sorrentino said Strommen’s bill was an “extremely friendly amendment.” He noted the federal Family Medical Leave Act, to preserve employee’s jobs up to 12 weeks of unpaid labor, applies to businesses with 50 or more employees in a 75-mile radius.
“It was administratively and financially a huge burden on them. There’s no reason to burden 10 lives or less with this law,” he said. “I think [LB] 415 was a good law. I think as amended, it’s a better law.”

Paid sick leave campaign filings
The Paid Sick Leave for Nebraskans campaign raised a total of $3.4 million, the vast majority in 2023, and spent $3.3 million on the campaign, according to most recent filings with the Nebraska Accountability and Disclosure Commission. Nearly all funds came from organizations; $460 came from individuals.
By December 2023, the D.C.-based Sixteen Thirty Fund had donated $1.92 million. The fund is managed by Arabella Advisors, which was founded by a former administration appointee by former President Bill Clinton. It oversees a hub of other left-leaning nonprofits that have received donations from billionaire George Soros in the past. It doesn’t disclose its donors. 
The campaign has also received $350,000 from the Open Society Policy Center, a principal financial arm founded by Soros, and about $280,000 from the D.C.-based The Fairness Project.
The Fairness Project donated to various ballot measure campaigns in Nebraska’s past three statewide elections to increase Nebraska’s minimum wage, curb predatory payday lending and expand Medicaid. 
The largest local donating group to the sick leave campaign was Nebraska Appleseed — a local nonprofit focused on child welfare, immigration, health care and poverty. It gave about $555,520.

(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Denial is not just a river in Egypt.
For those who are still in it, cutting through the chaos is one way out, even though the chaos is confusing, on purpose. In Topeka or D.C., just following bills is, well, debilitating.
Near-daily executive orders are in reality executive disorders. But we can wake to this truth. It’s not conservatism — it’s corruption. On steroids. Remember the frog in first lukewarm, then boiling water? The heat is coming up, less gradually every day. Will we jump out in time? Every day reduces the chance.
Through the fog, we must fully grasp — and admit — where we are. Unfortunately, President Trump’s mindset is easy to discern.
As felon-in-chief, he continues to purge the Justice Department. In the nouveau regime, crimes are not crimes if they say they’re not. They’ll first get rid of the people who once said they were. Removing truth-tellers’ salary, pension and security detail should do it. In short, they’ll make opponents’ lives as miserable and insecure as possible.
They are not stopping there.
No more wasting money on the little people. They’re on their way to cut our Social Security and Medicaid, and perhaps Medicare. The co-president of Public Citizen, weighing in on Trump’s Social Security lies in his address to Congress, said these are “the prelude to vicious cuts.”
Rep. Ro Khanna (D-California) summed it up: “This is their core agenda. (It’s) reverse Roosevelt. They are no longer even hiding it.”
Farmers, consumers and the entire economy are terrorized with tariffs, at the whim of Trump’s on/off button. (Pick your news source.)
National Republicans’ lockstep mentality is echoed by the Kansas’ monopoly party. Kansas legislative leadership seeks to dilute the vote by deluding the people. They and their docile (or worse, complicit) gang of enabler-legislators seek to block troublesome votes by removing the three-day mail ballot grace period, shutting out thousands of votes.
They would make our Supreme Court selection by election, with justices bought by the same mega-donor dollars that installed them. This would chill rights to education and women’s reproductive freedom.
How does this get a pass from the public? By misinformation. By appealing to collective (mostly white) prejudice. And by assaulting and defunding education, especially higher ed. Universities are called universities for a reason. Designed to promote universal understanding and values in education, too often they have suffered at the whim of moneyed interests. Public financing is key to even private college funding.
Nonetheless, the Trump Administration just cut $400 million from Columbia University’s budget, drastically affecting “research and other critical functions, impacting students, faculty, staff, research, and patient care” because students took a stand for Palestine. This is a blow. More than a quarter of Columbia’s $6.6 billion in annual operating revenue comes from federal sources, according to its 2024 financial statements.
Call it what it is. Mafia thuggery and bullying, until universities knuckle under.
The Kansas Legislature monopoly party marches in lockstep with their congressional colleagues. Salina’s Republican Rep Steven Howe got off on a good foot with his appeal for Republicans to re-examine their votes for Donald Trump come the 2024 election.
However, he was shortly back on the bandwagon. Howe’s crusade and “investigation” against universities’ diversity, equity and inclusion policies put him firmly in the Trump camp and resulted in that witch-hunt becoming state law.
This year, Howe introduced a bill aimed at weakening tenure protections at Kansas universities. His action was “at the behest of Steven Lovett, general counsel at Emporia State University,” where 30 tenured or tenure-track professors were fired in 2022. ESU is “embroiled in state and federal court battles” as a result. Lovett’s seeming conflict of interest in this action was questioned, even by an ESU spokeswoman.
There is little doubt whose side Howe is on. He even moved in his House committee “to add $2.2 million to the ESU budget for legal expenses in (Lovett’s) faculty firing case.
Spreading chaos and retribution is also blatantly obvious in Trump’s complete board replacement of the Kennedy Center. He named himself board chair for the country’s premier performing arts center, now to become the Trump Center for the Conforming Arts. In that action, he decried DEI and the center’s leadership and performances. It might feature WWE wrestling next.
As Nietzsche said, “Distrust all in whom the impulse to punish is powerful.”
Once we get past denial, this bullying culture must be faced up to, to face them down. It can be as simple as no. As a legal immigrant friend of mine said yesterday, “The more no’s they get, the smaller they become.”
May it be so.

(Photo: Spencer Platt/Getty Images)For the Day Eagle Hope Project, federal money has helped volunteers deliver fresh produce and meat to families in need across the remote Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in northern Montana — while putting cash into the hands of farmers, ranchers and meat processors.
The nonprofit generally has less than $300,000 to spend per year. So the $200,000 from a U.S. Department of Agriculture local food buying program drastically raised both the quantity and quality of the food it could distribute.
“They were a major, major contributor to our food,” said Tescha Hawley, who directs the organization, which aims to improve physical, mental and spiritual health.
The USDA recently nixed more than $1 billion from two programs that helped food banks and school meal programs buy local foods, including $660 million for schoolchildren. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins recently described the programs as “nonessential.”
But the move has left hundreds of school systems and food banks reeling. They already face rising food prices and are struggling to help community members with growing food insecurity.

Created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs aimed to build more resilient supply chains of domestic food by connecting schools and food pantries with small ranches, farms and dairies. The program was initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but later expanded by the Biden administration.
The federal programs stimulated the purchase of locally grown fruits, vegetables, dairy and meats — benefiting both the smaller farmers who received fair market pay for their products and the organizations granted funds to buy high quality foods.
The noncompetitive grants sent hundreds of millions of dollars to all 50 states, the District of Columbia and 84 tribal governments, boosting business for more than 8,000 farmers and providing local food to almost as many food banks. The Trump administration is killing the programs, despite Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s campaign against processed food, which he says is “poisoning” Americans.
Without ongoing funding, Hawley said, she would have to rely on cheaper, less nutritious food.
“It’s simple, right? I can get a truck … in here with all highly processed food, no problem,” she said.
Schools are facing a similar challenge: While officials running breakfast and lunch programs would prefer to buy more local products, those are often expensive. And with underfunding, high food costs and labor struggles, school lunch programs are already stretched thin.
In Milan, Tennessee, the federal funds allowed the local school system to buy minimally processed beef from a local stockyard, and broccoli, purple hull peas, tomatoes and melons from local growers.
Vickie Dunaway, who supervises the school system’s food services, told the Tennessee Lookout the federal cuts mean “going backwards” on purchasing healthier foods.
“That will obviously have to be cut out, because our budget will not withstand being able to purchase local,” she said. “Purchasing local, minimally processed food is way more expensive than buying from a distributor.”
A ‘devastating’ cut to food banks
Late last year, USDA said the programs had already spent more than $1 billion on local foods, and announced an expansion of the two programs with an additional $1.13 billion. USDA has killed that $1.13 billion expansion; it is still reimbursing the previously committed funds.
The Trump administration, which has sought to dramatically slash the size of the federal government, told recipients earlier this month that the programs “no longer effectuate the goals of the agency.”
In a statement to Stateline, the USDA said the current administration is “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
“The COVID era is over — USDA’s approach to nutrition programs will reflect that reality moving forward,” the statement said.










The only thing we’ll be able to do is just ration what little we have — to spread it as thinly as possible over the number of households we provide food to.


– Eric Cooper, president and CEO of the San Antonio Food Bank


The nonpartisan National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, which represents the ag department leaders of all 50 states, last month lobbied the federal government to continue the local foods program with permanent funding and ease procurement regulations for school meal programs. Arkansas Secretary of Agriculture Wes Ward, president of the association, said in a statement that the local food programs aid both producers and consumers.
“Investing in local and regional food systems not only strengthens the connections between farmers and their local communities, it bolsters supply chain resiliency as well,” his statement read.
In New Mexico, the program allowed food banks to buy some 900,000 pounds of locally grown food from more than 200 farmers since 2023. Before the program was terminated, the state was expecting close to $3 million in additional funding, Source New Mexico reported.

Jill Dixon, executive director of The Food Depot in northern New Mexico, called the cuts “devastating.”
In Texas, the San Antonio Food Bank counted on USDA’s local food program to help round out the food boxes it provides to families in need. The food bank, which serves more than 100,000 people across 29 Texas counties, largely relies on donated foods from hotels, restaurants and grocery stores.
“The challenge is I might get peanut butter donated, but I don’t have the jelly, or I might have pasta donated, but I don’t have the marinara,” said Eric Cooper, president and CEO of the food bank. “This program allowed us to purchase those items that we didn’t get that then helped round out the food box, or really complement the food that was being donated to give families the ability to make meals.”
The program initially provided the food bank nearly $3 million in grant funding — about 20% of what the organization spends each year on bulk food purchases. It expected a similar amount this year, before USDA’s announcement.
Cooper said cuts come even as the need for assistance rises. Food prices have squeezed families, and mass layoffs of federal workers portend more demand for food assistance in the coming months, he said.
“And we’ll be caught in the middle. And you know, that’s an incredibly uncomfortable place to be. The only thing we’ll be able to do is just ration what little we have — to spread it as thinly as possible over the number of households we provide food to.”

A boost for school lunches
For years, school meal programs have struggled with tight margins. Not only do they have to meet strict nutritional guidelines, but schools also face lagging reimbursement from the federal government and spend millions covering the cost of students’ unpaid meal debt.
At the 1,600-student Monticello School District in Arkansas, that debt is approaching $60,000.
So $50,000 from USDA’s local food program was a significant boost to the bottom line.
“That was such a help,” said Amanda West, the district’s child nutrition director.
The southeast Arkansas district used grant money to buy locally grown ground beef. The beef went into dishes including taco salad, meatloaf and spaghetti.
West said staff and students immediately noticed a difference in taste from conventionally purchased meats. And though the local product cost more, West said it also yielded more because it was not full of additives that cause the meat to shrink when cooked.
West, who is the president of the Arkansas School Nutrition Association, noted that her state is home to the nation’s highest rates of food insecurity.

West had hoped to see the local foods program help turn that tide by bringing more stability to school meal programs and growing the state economy by boosting local farmers, ranchers and distributors.
“We’re all upset about it. I hate that we’re not receiving it because grocery prices are 30, 40% higher than what they were a few years ago, and it really hurts our budget,” she said. “It helped a lot of districts, including mine, and it would be amazing if we could get it back.”
On top of the local foods program cuts, congressional Republicans are considering billions in potential cuts to free and reduced-price school meal programs — cuts the School Nutrition Association says could potentially affect millions of American students.
The federal government partially subsidizes breakfast, lunch and after-school snack programs at rates calculated by the income level of students’ families.
The School Nutrition Association, which represents 50,000 school meal providers across the country, said the school meals are the healthiest many American children receive. But that group says federal reimbursements are far from adequate, leaving members worried about the future of their meal programs.
In a recent association survey of more than 1,390 school meal directors, more than 90% reported serious or moderate concern over the financial sustainability of their school meal programs three years from now.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)When COVID-19 first tore through our nursing homes five years ago, I’ll never forget seeing the photo Shanrika Nelson, a certified nursing assistant and union member from Philadelphia, posted online. She wanted the public to see the makeshift PPE that she and her coworkers wore every day to protect their residents and themselves the best they could: a trash bag over her body.
Led by caregivers’ hard work and advocacy, we have made progress since the pandemic to fix and transform Pennsylvania’s nursing home system. But now we are facing a new existential threat – potential – Medicaid cuts that will topple nursing homes still hanging by a thread.
A new study shows that any cuts to Medicaid could lead to double the number of Pennsylvanians without health insurance. Not only does Medicaid provide comprehensive health and long-term care to 3 million residents in our Commonwealth, it funds over 60% of our nursing homes.
I do not want to think about the future of our nursing homes without Medicaid. They likely won’t have one.
Our system is already unprepared for the number of Pennsylvanians growing older quickly. Talk to any nursing home worker: residents are arriving at facilities younger and with more demanding needs. High acuity, higher severity, and more psychiatric conditions. People are coming to our nursing homes sicker. It’s often because they did not have access to high-quality, affordable health insurance and have had undiagnosed conditions for years.
Rated one of the deadliest jobs in 2020, nursing homes saw caregivers leave for better-paying, less-dangerous, and less-stressful jobs. Those who stayed often work overtime or second jobs to pay the bills and cover their own medical debt. We fought for and won staffing ratios to ensure every resident receives quality care, but operators are still struggling to retain and recruit the skilled workforce needed.
Simply put: we do not have the beds, workers, and training needed to care for Pennsylvanians in the immediate future. And proposed Medicaid cuts are putting nursing homes in danger now.
April Chirdon, a CNA who’s worked at the same facility in Cambria County for 17 years, is especially worried about rural nursing homes like hers. Much like in other rural communities, an overwhelming majority of her residents depend on Medicaid. It covers the cost of their care, from their caregivers’ wages and benefits to the food they eat and lifesaving equipment like nebulizers and oxygen tanks. They don’t have an alternative to this care: their families cannot afford to take care of them at home, or they don’t have any family. If homes like April’s are forced to shut down, where will all of the residents go?
We need more funding, not less.
We need more accountability, reforms, and teamwork to make every nursing home a fully staffed, safe, and dignified one.
This system already relies on caregivers to buy supplies like toilet paper, shampoo, hand sanitizer, and favorite food items for residents out of their own pockets. Because the people in these homes are like family to them.
This year, 7,000 nursing home workers have committed to use the power of their union negotiations for new contracts to show the public how much our communities rely on Medicaid, ensure public funding goes to care, and work with responsible operators to defend the resources we need to elevate care for all Pennsylvanians.
Healthcare workers will never forget the pandemic and neither should we. Covid-19 showed us how important it is to listen to frontline caregivers sounding the alarm and protecting our loved ones.
We need to listen to healthcare workers who are calling on Congress to defend Medicaid. We must stand up to these brutal cuts to our communities and our most vulnerable. Medicaid is a lifeline for so many Pennsylvanians and we – legislators, providers, community members, and workers – must protect it.

State records show that in February 2005, a federal grand jury indicted Dr. Peter Boesen, an ear, nose and throat specialist from Windsor Heights, on 82 counts of health care fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud. The grand jury alleged Boesen billed multiple health insurance providers for procedures and tests that were either never performed or were not medically necessary.
After a jury convicted Boesen on all counts and Boesen appealed, the government dismissed three of the fraud charges and Boesen was sentenced to 51 months in prison on the remaining 80 counts. He was also ordered to pay $931,526 in restitution.
Boesen was released from prison in early 2011, and in August 2012, the Iowa Board of Medicine suspended his medical license for an indefinite period.
At the time, Boesen continued to claim his innocence and said the charges against him, his trial and the decision on his appeal were unfair. At a hearing before the Board of Medicine, he testified that his only regret was that his patients could no longer benefit from his care.
As part of the 2012 suspension order, the board stipulated that Boesen must complete a competency evaluation and pay a $10,000 civil penalty should the board agree to reinstatement.
Earlier this month, the board reinstated Boesen’s license subject to several requirements that prohibit Boesen from establishing a solo practice and require that his license be placed on probation for two years, during which time he will be subject to board monitoring.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/BOARD-OF-MEDICINE.jpg,,,2025-03-28 12:11:48.980649

(Rick Kern/Getty Images for National Council on Aging)Dr. Fred Levin has been watching with growing alarm the national debate around federal cuts to Medicaid. He’s responsible for the medical care of about 100 older adults at the Community PACE center in rural Newaygo, Michigan. For his patients, Medicaid isn’t just a safety net — it’s a matter of life or death.
“If left to see to their own needs, a lot of them would stay in their homes and would slowly die,” he said. “They wouldn’t be able to get to their doctors’ appointments unless they had a family member to help. They wouldn’t get social care. They wouldn’t have people coming into their homes and seeing the bed bugs or the lice in their hair. They wouldn’t get their medications.”
The care at Community PACE is paid for by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities, and Medicare, the federal insurance program for people 65 and older. The center is a one-stop shop that provides medical and social services to older adults during the day, allowing them to continue living safely in their homes.
If Congress cuts funding to Medicaid, Levin expects his center would probably close. Unlike traditional nursing home care, which state Medicaid programs are required by federal law to cover, the services at PACE centers like his are an optional benefit that 33 states have opted to cover.
Around the nation, doctors, lawmakers, advocates and patients are watching anxiously as Republicans in Congress consider proposals to slash billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in proposed tax cuts. The specific nature of the funding cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states.












If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved.


– Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy, Justice in Aging




The additional financial burden could blow billion-dollar holes in state budgets, forcing state lawmakers to slash health benefits or restrict who’s eligible for them. Nearly a fifth of Americans rely on Medicaid, and the percentage is even higher in some states.
“There are a lot of people who don’t pay attention to this because they think it doesn’t affect them personally,” Levin said. “But 1 in 4 people in Michigan are on Medicaid. It’s very likely you have friends or family on Medicaid.”
Nearly all Americans over age 65 are covered by Medicare, which Republicans have pledged not to touch. Medicare doesn’t cover most nursing home or other long-term care, however. Neither does most private insurance.
But Medicaid does.
“If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved,” said Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy for Justice in Aging, an advocacy group focused on addressing poverty among older people.
“Many of us have a connection to the program or will one day,” she said.
 A divided front

Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But policy experts say that reducing coverage for some Medicaid recipients, such as the working adults who got coverage under expansion programs, will have ripple effects on vulnerable groups such as children and older adults.
Republicans aren’t united in a desire to see massive cuts.
Last month, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican governor in a purple state, publicly called on Congress not to slash Medicaid funding.
Earlier this week, Washington Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier wrote a letter to Trump asking him to reconsider cuts to Medicaid and expressing her concern about the large number of military retirees and senior citizens in her district.
Caldier, a dentist who has worked with nursing home patients, told Stateline she believes the most likely cuts would be a reduction in the amount the federal government matches state spending for working adults who are covered under Medicaid expansion. That, she said, would have little impact on older adults.
“The only caveat is that I am very worried that the leadership in our state does not have a good relationship with our president,” Caldier said. Democrats control the offices of governor and both legislative chambers in Washington state. Caldier worries that if Washington lawmakers defy the president over issues such as gender-affirming care for transgender youth, the feds could retaliate by slashing their Medicaid payments to the state.
“If we got into a political match with the president, we would lose, no matter how you slice or dice it,” she said.
In Idaho, Republican state lawmakers shot down a bill that likely would have repealed Medicaid expansion, before passing one that will introduce sweeping policy changes in an effort to control costs.
Even in Congress, some Republicans are balking, publicly defending Medicaid and warning about the consequences of deep cuts. Some who have high percentages of Medicaid recipients in their districts have urged party leaders not to cut funding for the program and have vowed to vote against any budget plan that does so.
Medicaid covers 72 million Americans. A majority of American adults, including two-thirds of Republicans, say they want Congress to either maintain current Medicaid spending or increase it, according to a February 2025 poll from KFF, a health policy research group.
President Donald Trump has said in recent months that he won’t touch Medicaid. But last month, U.S. House Republicans pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that calls for about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help counterbalance the Trump administration’s desired $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.
Facing cuts that large, states would have to figure out which benefits to chop in order to keep their budgets balanced, which is a constitutional requirement in most states.
Older adults and people with disabilities already account for more than half of states’ Medicaid spending, on average. In some states, including Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Mississippi and North Dakota, those groups account for two-thirds of state Medicaid spending.
Idaho state Sen. Melissa Wintrow, a Democrat on the state Senate Health & Welfare committee, said her biggest concern is Congress reducing the federal match rate. This is the amount of money the federal government chips in to help states pay for Medicaid. How much a state receives mainly depends on how wealthy its residents are. Richer states such as California and Connecticut get less help, while poorer states get more.
In Idaho, on the poorer end of the spectrum, the feds pay about 67% of traditional Medicaid costs and 90% of Medicaid expansion costs.
“It is all a domino effect,” Wintrow said. The federal government covers about $3 billion of Idaho’s $4.2 billion Medicaid budget. “If the feds start chopping that off, it’s going to impact everything.”
 Cutting care at home

All state Medicaid programs have opted to cover at least some home-based and community care, such as home health aides who assist people with bathing, toileting and other daily living activities, transportation and adult day care.
Kean and other experts worry that because federal law doesn’t require state Medicaid programs to cover home-based care, state lawmakers
“When states have budget shortfalls, they start to tighten eligibility for the home-based programs,” said Kean. “We’re certain those would be the first to go if federal funding is cut for Medicaid.”
Paying for home-based services out of pocket would exhaust the median Medicare recipient’s savings in less than two years, according to KFF.
The median cost of a year of full-time aide to help is about $62,400, far above the median income for Americans over 65, which is about $36,000. The median life savings for Medicare beneficiaries was $103,800 in 2023.
Home-based services are a popular benefit for state Medicaid programs, because most enrollees prefer to remain in their homes. And despite the expense, home care can be more cost effective than nursing homes — about $38,000 vs. nearly $54,000 per year in 2021, according to a KFF analysis.
Cutting Medicaid also could make it harder to recruit and keep a workforce of nursing home and home health employees.
Over the past two years, most states — even those led by Republicans — increased their Medicaid payment rates for those services, in an effort to combat the nationwide shortage of long-term care workers.
But federal funding cuts could jeopardize what states are able to pay those workers.
“There’s already a direct-care workforce crisis,” Kean said. “Even if eligibility isn’t directly cut or programs aren’t cut, there wouldn’t be enough workers to provide that care. At home and in nursing facilities, the quality of care will go down.”
In rural Michigan, Levin said the PACE center where he works employs about 100 people. Its closure would impact not only those workers, but also would mean his patients would be left to find transportation and other health services on their own, even if those services are still covered by Medicaid.
“Without access in rural areas, how are these individuals going to get to the bigger cities where they can get to their health care? It’s going to overwhelm other parts of the health care system,” Levin said.
“Everybody’s going to be responsible for taking care of the people who don’t have health insurance, in some indirect way or another. It’s going to affect us all.”

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)There was some good news last week when a federal appeals court upheld a lower court ruling that “corner crossing” from public land to public land is not trespassing on adjoining private lands.  Thanks to that ruling, the efforts by another billionaire landowner to lock the public out of our own lands have failed – and corner crossing will now be legal in six Western states.
The issue is significant due to a horrendous policy mistake when the federal government deeded every other section of public land across the West to railroad barons between 1850 and 1872 as an incentive to lay track.  The joke was on the public since many of those deeded lands never saw permanent rail lines built. Indeed, it’s rare that one can see any railroads from most of the “checkerboard” sections.
Those lands in Montana were infamously logged mercilessly when Burlington-Northern Railroad’s subsidiary, Plum Creek Timber Company, decided to “liquidate its timber assets” in the 1980s.  Adding insult to injury, it then turned itself into a Real Estate Investment Trust in 1999 and is now subdividing and selling off those formerly forested parcels across the nation.
Other checkerboard sections were purchased by wealthy individuals or corporations, in many instances with the goal of surrounding and locking up public lands and their fish, wildlife, and recreational assets by locking out public access, including “corner crossing” from one public section to another.
That particular ploy has now fallen by the wayside after Wyoming hunters used a ladder to cross the private fence to the adjoining public land and never touched the private sections. Hence, the court’s decision that it was not trespassing.
Of course, the ruling has been applauded by public lands advocates who have increasingly placed “access” as their main goal rather than conservation of the public resources.  And therein lies the rub.  Access and conservation are simply not the same thing — especially not when those same public lands and waters are increasingly pressured.
A great recent example would be the Montana Legislature’s recent move to spend a whopping $2.7 million to study who uses Montana’s rivers, many of which are now so crowded that the once-common opportunity to enjoy a river in the quiet solitude of Nature no longer exists.
One wouldn’t have to study too long on the Yellowstone, Blackfoot, Bitterroot, Madison or Missouri Rivers to see the flotillas of outfitter and private drift boats, rafts, paddleboards, and inner tubes clogging the river.
But when politicians or agencies lack the courage to address a sticky problem, they appoint task forces, advisory councils, and do studies.  A great example would be the Upper Madison, where, after public outcry over too many outfitters on the river, task forces and studies have been ongoing for decades without resolution.
At some point, we have to weigh the impacts of use on the resource itself to determine the actual carrying capacity of our rivers and public lands to balance access with conservation.  As usual, however, the commodification of those assets by profit-driven entities continues to outweigh the impacts to the public resource.
The simple truth is that the conservation of those resources is going to require significant investment.  For instance, Montana’s list of “chronically dewatered” rivers and streams has been in existence for decades — yet, most of those rivers remain chronically dewatered.
If the Montana Legislature really wanted to do the right thing, they’d put half of that $2.7 million into buying and leasing water rights to keep those rivers flowing, the fisheries healthy, and actually conserve the resource — instead of splurging on yet another study to document the ongoing decline.

This [&#8230;]","Nuclear reactor assemblies pictured Sept. 12, 2024, in storage at V.C. Summer nuclear site near Fairfield. (Provided by S.C. Nuclear Advisory Council)South Carolina has made considerable progress in strengthening its energy and transmission infrastructure, but much more remains to be done to secure a reliable, cost-effective and independent energy future.
A critical piece of this effort lies in expanding nuclear power, which offers the unique combination of low-carbon emissions, sustainability, 24/7 reliability, and long-term affordability.
This is why I fully support an “all-of-the-above” approach to energy, including the revitalization of the unfinished reactors at the V.C. Summer Nuclear Station, and commend the South Carolina’s state and congressional lawmakers for taking decisive steps to advance nuclear energy in our state.
Efforts to expand South Carolina’s clean energy portfolio have already incentivized energy-efficient practices, expanding nuclear capabilities, and attracted private-sector investment in emerging renewable energy.
Tax credits such as the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit and the Advanced Energy Production Credit fuel business growth in the Palmetto State.
However, more work remains as our state’s energy demands are growing rapidly due to population increases and economic expansion.
State leaders and utility officials have been increasingly focused on the growth in demand for energy.
Our major utilities are already experiencing unprecedented load demand growth.
South Carolina’s population growth and accelerating economic development have caused utility planners to drastically increase their load growth forecasts, with electricity demand expected to surge over the next 15 years.
This demand growth will require an “all-of-the-above” increase in electricity generation capacity, including natural gas, renewables, and nuclear. It will also require a more streamlined approach to the planning and construction of new energy generation, regardless of the energy source.
To meet these challenges, South Carolina’s policymakers are now considering legislation that strengthens our energy sector, streamlines permitting and accelerates energy generation capacity.
Last month, the South Carolina House of Representatives passed H.3309, the South Carolina Energy Security Act, a bill prioritizing nuclear expansion as an energy source, alongside natural gas, hydrogen and renewables.
The state Senate will next debate this measure.
The Senate can develop legislation that balances reasonable permitting reforms with environmental protections, ensures appropriate regulatory oversight of the utilities while accelerating new energy generation, and prioritizes an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy that includes the expansion of nuclear energy.
Reviving the V.C. Summer nuclear project represents one of the most promising opportunities to meet South Carolina’s energy needs.
Sen. Lindsey Graham recently affirmed his support for nuclear power, stating, “We cannot give up on nuclear power … South Carolina needs as much power as we can get.”
His leadership and advocacy for small modular reactors (SMRs) highlight the potential of modern nuclear technology to supplement traditional reactors and provide scalable, efficient energy solutions for our state.
As Congress sets its legislative agenda, Graham and South Carolina’s delegation can prioritize continued support for policies that modernize the state’s energy infrastructure, revitalize manufacturing, and strengthen national security.
Sen. Tim Scott has also championed efforts to ensure nuclear energy can be deployed more efficiently.
His recently introduced Nuclear Permitting Reform bill takes a commonsense approach to cutting through the bureaucratic red tape that slows down nuclear project approvals.
By reducing unnecessary delays and modernizing regulations, this bill would pave the way for projects like V.C. Summer’s revival and the expansion of next-generation nuclear technology in South Carolina.
Beyond state efforts, federal investments are playing a crucial role in advancing energy security. The Inflation Reduction Act, passed in 2022, has provided South Carolina homes and businesses with key tax credits and incentives that help increase energy efficiency, promote solar energy, clean hydrogen and nuclear power production, and support offshore wind development.
Funding from that law has also fueled a resurgence in American manufacturing, leading to the announcement of 29 South Carolina projects promising to bring 16,500 jobs to the state.
Leveraging these resources, alongside nuclear expansion, will ensure South Carolina remains a leader in clean energy innovation.
Federal and state collaboration is crucial to ensuring South Carolina remains at the forefront of energy innovation.
The leadership shown by our congressional delegation and proactive efforts from our state Legislature put us in a strong position to secure our energy future.
However, the job is not yet done.
The state needs energy legislation that includes strong provisions for nuclear expansion and balanced permitting reform.

Tina Kotek called a “milestone” for reaching the state’s climate goals.
But that milestone can also be a millstone around the neck of the state’s transportation system as lawmakers try to figure out how to produce an estimated $1.8 billion annually for the state’s transportation needs. Sputtering revenue from the state’s 40-cents-per-gallon gas tax as Oregonians drive more fuel-efficient cars — plus rising construction costs tied to inflation — contributed to that deficit.
Electric vehicles, which have made up about 5% of the cars registered in Oregon in the past decade, aren’t subject to the gas tax. They’re subject to higher title and registration fees than gas-powered cars, but the average driver of a gas-powered car still pays more in gas taxes than electric drivers pay in other fees.
In 2015, Oregon became the first state in the nation to launch a voluntary program that allowed drivers to opt into a per-mile charge in exchange for lower DMV fees. But the OReGO program is still rarely used — fewer than 1,000 drivers participate in it — and lawmakers are now looking for ways to expand it to more drivers.
It’s a matter of fairness, according to Jim Whitty, a transportation policy expert who now works in the private sector but spent years developing the OReGO program.
“A road usage charge is necessary because it directly ties the use of roads to what we pay for them,” Whitty told the Joint Transportation Committee. “Once upon a time, Oregon’s fuel tax did this too.”
Sen. Bruce Starr, a Dundee Republican who now serves as vice chair of the committee, anticipated the need for such a charge 24 years ago, when he was in his first term in the House and chaired the transportation committee. During a 2001 hearing, he learned about and test-drove hydrogen-fueled vehicles.
“It opened my eyes to a potential problem of what happens when we don’t fill up vehicles with gasoline,” Starr said.
Starr’s eye-opening experience resulted in Oregon’s response to most problems: a task force. More than a decade later, that task force’s work led to OReGO, which lets electric vehicle owners and those driving cars that get 40 or more miles per gallon save on DMV fees by paying two cents per mile they drive. Other drivers can also sign up for the program and receive a tax credit.
Electric vehicle owners now pay $192 to title their cars, compared with title fees ranging between $101 and $116 for other passenger vehicles. Drivers of electric vehicles pay $316 to register their cars for two years, while other drivers pay between $126 and $156. Enrolling in OReGO can reduce registration fees for electric vehicles to $86.
Drivers who participate in the program sign up with one of two private companies and can use GPS-tracking devices, odometer readings or their car’s computer to track miles driven. The companies bill for those miles — and can subtract miles driven out of state — then take a cut off the top and send the remaining fee to the state.
Tim Martinez, a lobbyist for GeoToll, one of the two companies that operate the OReGO system, also drives an electric vehicle and participates in the program. He said the automatic billing system works well.
“ODOT has created a public-private program that works, and the time is now for this body to scale up the program in a fair and equitable manner,” Martinez said.

Some who have high percentages of Medicaid recipients in their districts have urged party leaders not to cut funding for the program and have vowed to vote against any budget plan that does so.
Medicaid covers 72 million Americans. A majority of American adults, including two-thirds of Republicans, say they want Congress to either maintain current Medicaid spending or increase it, according to a February 2025 poll from KFF, a health policy research group.
President Donald Trump has said in recent months that he won’t touch Medicaid. But last month, U.S. House Republicans pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that calls for about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help counterbalance the Trump administration’s desired $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.
Facing cuts that large, states would have to figure out which benefits to chop in order to keep their budgets balanced, which is a constitutional requirement in most states.
Older adults and people with disabilities already account for more than half of states’ Medicaid spending, on average. In some states, including Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Mississippi and North Dakota, those groups account for two-thirds of state Medicaid spending.
Idaho state Sen. Melissa Wintrow, a Democrat on the state Senate Health & Welfare committee, said her biggest concern is Congress reducing the federal match rate. This is the amount of money the federal government chips in to help states pay for Medicaid. How much a state receives mainly depends on how wealthy its residents are. Richer states such as California and Connecticut get less help, while poorer states get more.
In Idaho, on the poorer end of the spectrum, the feds pay about 67% of traditional Medicaid costs and 90% of Medicaid expansion costs.
“It is all a domino effect,” Wintrow said. The federal government covers about $3 billion of Idaho’s $4.2 billion Medicaid budget. “If the feds start chopping that off, it’s going to impact everything.”
Cutting care at home
All state Medicaid programs have opted to cover at least some home-based and community care, such as home health aides who assist people with bathing, toileting and other daily living activities, transportation and adult day care.
Kean and other experts worry that because federal law doesn’t require state Medicaid programs to cover home-based care, state lawmakers might sharply reduce spending on those services — or even eliminate coverage.
“When states have budget shortfalls, they start to tighten eligibility for the home-based programs,” said Kean. “We’re certain those would be the first to go if federal funding is cut for Medicaid.”
Paying for home-based services out of pocket would exhaust the median Medicare recipient’s savings in less than two years, according to KFF.
The median cost of a year of a full-time aide to help is about $62,400, far above the median income for Americans over 65, which is about $36,000. The median life savings for Medicare beneficiaries was $103,800 in 2023.
Home-based services are a popular benefit for state Medicaid programs, because most enrollees prefer to remain in their homes. And despite the expense, home care can be more cost effective than nursing homes — about $38,000 vs. nearly $54,000 per year in 2021, according to a KFF analysis.
Cutting Medicaid also could make it harder to recruit and keep a workforce of nursing home and home health employees.
Over the past two years, most states — even those led by Republicans — increased their Medicaid payment rates for those services, in an effort to combat the nationwide shortage of long-term care workers.
But federal funding cuts could jeopardize what states are able to pay those workers.
“There’s already a direct-care workforce crisis,” Kean said. “Even if eligibility isn’t directly cut or programs aren’t cut, there wouldn’t be enough workers to provide that care. At home and in nursing facilities, the quality of care will go down.”
In rural Michigan, Levin said the PACE center where he works employs about 100 people. Its closure would impact not only those workers, but also would mean his patients would be left to find transportation and other health services on their own, even if those services are still covered by Medicaid.
“Without access in rural areas, how are these individuals going to get to the bigger cities where they can get to their health care? It’s going to overwhelm other parts of the health care system,” Levin said.
“Everybody’s going to be responsible for taking care of the people who don’t have health insurance, in some indirect way or another. It’s going to affect us all.”

(Photo by Pat Sutphin/ Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho Gov. Brad Little signed into law a bill that criminalizes the public exposure of breasts.
House Bill 270 updates Idaho’s indecent exposure law, which already bans public exposure of genitals, to include female breasts, male breasts altered to look like female breasts, artificial breasts and toys or products that resemble genitals.
Breastfeeding is exempt.
The bill takes effect immediately — through an emergency clause. Little signed the bill Wednesday, according to the governor’s office legislation tracker.
Supporters say the bill will protect decency and modernize Idaho’s indecent exposure law. Opponents say it could unduly punish transgender Idahoans and males experiencing hormonal conditions that enlarge breasts.
The Republican-supermajority controlled Legislature widely passed the bill, with support from 87 Republican state lawmakers and opposition from 14 Democratic state lawmakers.
The bill was cosponsored by Rep. Jeff Cornilles, R-Nampa, and Sens. Brian Lenney, R-Nampa, and Ben Toews, R-Coeur d’Alene.
Debating the bill in the Senate this week, Lenney said the bill deals with a real problem of people exposing themselves.
“I’ve heard arguments … on this bill that said this somehow sexualizes breasts. I don’t think we need a bill to do that,” he said. “I think that’s been happening since the Garden of Eden, and it’s going to continue to happen forever.”
Idaho Senate Minority Leader Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, argued the bill violates the First Amendment by criminalizing expression that “we don’t like.”
And she said the bill would allow people to call police over dangling faux scrotums hung on truck hitches, commonly called truck nuts. 
“They’re gross, they’re offensive, and kids on the road see them. So why wouldn’t the police get a call and say, ‘That offends me, pull it off the truck?’” Wintrow said. “Because now this bill will allow it. And I talked to police and they said, ‘Indeed it would.’
Nampa City Councilmember Sebastian Griffin helped craft the bill, telling lawmakers that the bill stemmed from him seeing a topless woman at an event at Lakeview Park in Nampa, where Canyon County Pride was held. He testified a police officer he approached at the time said the person wasn’t engaging in illegal behavior.
That’s because it is not illegal for a man with breast enhancements to walk around topless, the officer said, according to Griffin.
A first violation of Idaho’s indecent exposure law is a misdemeanor crime. A second offense within five years is a felony.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)The Maine Secretary of State said she is concerned by a sweeping executive order issued earlier this week to overhaul the administration of U.S. elections, including requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote.
“I have serious concerns about the policies proposed in the Executive Order that would make it harder to vote for women, military and overseas voters and rural citizens,” said Secretary Shenna Bellows, in a statement Friday. “I am also deeply concerned about the data sharing requirements listed in the Executive Order.”
The order from President Donald Trump directs the federal Election Assistance Commission, which distributes grants to states, within 30 days to start requiring people registering to vote to provide proof of citizenship, such as a passport or state-issued identification that indicates citizenship.
The order also prohibits the counting of absentee or mail-in ballots that are received after Election Day. States set their own rules for ballot counting and many allow those that arrive after Election Day but are postmarked before.
Trump signs broad elections order requiring proof of citizenship

The order also instructs the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, along with Trump megadonor Elon Musk’s U.S. Department of Government Efficiency, to gain access to state voter rolls in order to reportedly ensure the voter lists are up to date. DOGE entities will also have access to immigration databases and states will be allowed to ask Homeland Security to verify if any noncitizen is on the state’s list of voters.
While the order mirrors the president’s rhetoric on the campaign trail about noncitizens voting in federal elections and his crackdown on immigration since returning to office, it is likely to face legal challenges from voting rights groups and Democratic state attorneys general.
“Mainers should be able to trust that their voter registration and driver’s license data will be protected by their government,” Bellows said. “Previous and ongoing actions by this administration have shown a disregard for information security and data privacy, so I will work with my colleagues in Maine and around the country to protect the rights of Maine voters and the security of our elections.”
Bellows, who announced she will run for Maine governor in 2026, also chairs a partnership of election officials from various levels of government focused on election security and cybersecurity called the Election Infrastructure — Information Sharing and Analysis Center. 
However, given that the partnership was recently defunded by Homeland Security, Bellows said it is “ironic” for Trump to assert that this executive order will protect election integrity.

Trump signs order rescinding union rights of federal workers
Citing his national security authority, President Trump signed an executive order Thursday rescinding the collective bargaining rights of a massive swath of the federal workforce in a historic attack on public unions.
The order strips workers from the right to union representation across the federal enterprise, including at the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Food and Drug Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Agriculture and the Bureau of Land Management.
While the order also includes the Department of Homeland Security, law enforcement officers including U.S. Border Patrol are exempted, as are firefighters, in a transparent gift to his political coalition.
Trump’s order cites the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which grants the president the power to terminate the union rights of workers in agencies with intelligence, counterintelligence or national security work as a primary function.
“Certain federal unions have declared war on President Trump’s agenda,” the White House said in announcing the order. “President Trump supports constructive partnerships with unions who work with him; he will not tolerate mass obstruction that jeopardizes his ability to manage agencies with vital national security missions.”
Following the order, the affected agencies filed a lawsuit against federal employee unions in Texas federal court seeking to terminate their union contracts.
The American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal union representing more than 800,000 workers, promised immediate legal action to challenge what it called a “blatant attempt at political punishment.” The union estimates it affects more than 1 million employees — about a third of whom are veterans.
“This administration’s bullying tactics represent a clear threat not just to federal employees and their unions, but to every American who values democracy and the freedoms of speech and association. Trump’s threat to unions and working people across America is clear: fall in line or else,” AFGE National President Everett Kelley said in a statement.
AFGE and other public unions have filed numerous lawsuits against Trump’s executive orders,  including the indiscriminate purge of federal probationary workers, which was reversed by a federal judge. The union also sued the Trump administration for terminating the government’s union contract covering tens of thousands of security agents and other employees at the Transportation Security Administration.
The White House said the unions representing Veterans Affairs workers have filed 70 national and local grievances over Trump’s policies since the inauguration. Those are terminated along with the labor contracts, under Trump’s executive order.
Federal workers have also relied on their union protections to speak out publicly against what they believe are harmful policies to the workforce.
The order seems to go further than Project 2025, the conservative blueprint for a second Trump term, which proposed renegotiating public union contracts to further limit their power while Congress “consider whether public-sector unions are appropriate in the first place.”
Federal employee unions already have far more limited powers than private sector unions, and are barred from negotiating over wages, benefits and hiring decisions. Unionized federal employees are also prohibited from striking.
Unionized state employees vow to fight return to office order

The unions representing nearly 40,000 Minnesota state employees vowed to fight Gov. Tim Walz’s order for most workers to return to the office 50% of the time beginning on June 1.
“Our members are so fired up,” said Megan Dayton, president of the Minnesota Association of Professional Employees. “A lot of them are saying this is the thing to strike over.”
Union leaders say many employees have organized their lives around working from home — some were hired as fully remote — and are now scrambling to find child care or buy a second car in order to make it into the office two or three times a week.
Dayton said there may not even be enough office space or parking spots available, as agencies have downsized to adjust for remote work at a considerable savings. The Department of Revenue, for example, reduced its leased office space by 35% since 2021, saving $2.45 million annually. The agency also reported greater efficiency since 2019 and higher retention and recruitment.
The order may be particularly galvanizing for state employees as they watch the Trump administration attack the federal workforce while the governor has frequently been traveling out-of-state for speaking engagements, setting up a potential presidential run.
Walz said mandatory hybrid work, with an exception for those living more than 75 miles from the office, promotes collaboration and follows the trend in both the private and public sectors of bringing workers back to the office. St. Paul city employees will be required to return to the office three days a week starting April 1, while major employers including General Mills, 3M and U.S. Bank have also required workers to return to the office.
“I think there’s a power in teams when they’re together,” Walz said at an unrelated news conference on Wednesday.
Walz also said calling workers back could help revive downtown St. Paul, which is succumbing to a vicious doom loop as visitors disappear, businesses shutter and the commercial tax base evaporates.
There is nowhere to buy groceries downtown after Lunds and Byerley’s closed its doors for good on Wednesday. Walz said he told the grocery chain’s leaders that a return to office could be on the horizon, but it wasn’t enough for them to reconsider. (That came as a shock to union leaders, who said they were blindsided by the announcement, finding out at the same time as the public.)
DFL lawmakers stood alongside union leaders at a news conference on Thursday blasting the governor’s order as an assault on workers; House legislative staff are required to work full-time in office during the Legislative session and two days a week out of session. Legislative staff are also prohibited from unionizing.
Walz said around 60% of state employees already work in-person and did so through the entire COVID-19 pandemic. He said he was confident there would be enough space to accommodate a return to the office.
Walz also rejected the suggestion that the return-to-work order could be a way to thin the state workforce in the face of a souring budget outlook. He said he was more concerned about the high attrition of employees in their first six months, which he thinks could be improved with hybrid work fostering more connection and mentorship opportunities.
A strike couldn’t happen until late in the summer — after the state’s contracts with MAPE and AFSCME expire on June 30 and the unions have participated in mediation — and such an extreme action may not win broad public sympathy given many other office workers transitioned to hybrid schedules years ago, while frontline workers — like bus drivers, nurses and servers — never worked from home.
The unions may not have much recourse. Though they said they are considering possible litigation, their contracts only entitle workers to have meetings to discuss changes to remote work and the ability to appeal those decisions. Changes to remote work aren’t subject to a formal grievance process, however.
U of M resident physicians file for union
A supermajority of the nearly 1,000 resident physicians and fellows at the University of Minnesota filed to unionize in one of the largest union drives in the state in recent years, SEIU’s Committee of Interns and Residents union announced on Monday.
The move comes on the heels of more than 200 resident physicians at Hennepin Healthcare becoming the first to file to unionize in Minnesota earlier this month as part of a surge in organizing among young doctors in their final years of training.
Resident physicians complain of unsustainable working conditions, often putting in grueling 80-hour weeks and taking home what amounts to about the city of Minneapolis’ minimum hourly wage of $15.97.
Under state law, the Minnesota Bureau of Mediation Services will certify the union without an election if the agency is able to verify a majority of the bargaining unit has signed in support of the union.
Child labor violations on the rise in Minnesota

Child labor violations have increased significantly in Minnesota — and across the country — in recent years as a tight labor market has coincided with a surge in unaccompanied migrant children.
The number of underage workers found to be employed in violation of child labor laws increased nearly fivefold in the United States and more than twofold in Minnesota from 2015 to 2023, according to a new report from the left-leaning think tank North Star Policy Action.
One-third of the minors counted in 2022 came from just one case where investigators found children employed by Packers Sanitation Services cleaning hazardous equipment during overnight shifts at the JBS plant in Worthington, the Turkey Valley Farms plant in Marshall and the Buckhead Meat plant in St. Cloud.
It’s difficult to determine if the uptick is caused simply by more enforcement, but the researchers say there’s reason to believe illegal child labor has increased with the rise of migrant children arriving from Latin America. One study cited in the report found a state’s child labor violations increase 10% for every 1% increase in unaccompanied minors.
North Star Policy Action recommends that Minnesota lawmakers bolster labor protections for children by aligning state and federal law, which they say is particularly important now given the potential for the Trump administration to roll back child labor laws. Project 2025 calls for the Department of Labor to permit teenagers to work in hazardous jobs with parental consent.
80 nursing home workers struck for two days
Around 80 nursing assistants, cooks, housekeepers and other workers at Providence Place nursing home in Minneapolis struck on Tuesday and Wednesday as they seek higher wages and staffing levels.
The two sides remain “very far apart” on raises and don’t have more negotiations planned yet, said Rasha Ahmad Sharif, executive vice president of SEIU Healthcare Minnesota & Iowa, the union representing the workers. The union is seeking 17.5% raises over three years, while the company has offered 5% over two years, Sharif said.
SEIU had also called strikes at three other facilities but reached tentative agreements last week to avert a work stoppage. Workers at The Villas at St. Louis Park will receive a 4.5% increase and will negotiate raises in the following two years of the contract.
Wages for all nursing home workers in Minnesota are set to increase to $22 per hour on average across job duties in 2026 and $23.49 per hour in 2027, contingent upon funding from the state, under rules passed by the state’s Nursing Home Workforce Standards Board. The board also voted to guarantee workers 11 paid holidays, which nursing home industry groups are currently suing to block.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/donaldtrumpfeb112025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-28 11:08:20.127987

(Wesley Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana voters have seen political mail, online advertising and even television spots about the four constitutional amendments on the ballot Saturday, but weak public financial disclosure laws make it difficult to say who is paying for those election efforts. 
Groups supporting and opposing the amendments are trying to sway voters using money from nonprofit organizations that aren’t required to disclose their donors. The tactic makes it impossible to get the full picture of who is paying for the campaigns surrounding the amendments.

Gov. Jeff Landry has been traveling the state trying to gin up support for the four constitutional changes, which would affect taxes, state budgeting, court operations, criminal sentencing and judicial elections. 

Most of the public campaigning has taken place on Amendment 2, which reworks the state’s income tax structure, and Amendment 3, which could result in more minors being sent into adult prisons. 

A review of campaign finance reports shows that at least $588,000 had been spent to pass Amendment 2. Another $509,000 has been spent on an opposition campaign to all four amendments, with a priority on defeating Amendment 3. 

Based on the campaign reports available from the Louisiana Ethics Administration, the groups spending in favor of Amendment 2 include a Landry political action committee (PAC) called Make Louisiana Great Again ($292,000); the antitax organization Americans for Prosperity ($157,000); the Louisiana Republican Legislative Delegation ($125,000); and Louisiana House Speaker Phillip DeVillier’s Foundation PAC ($14,000). 
The opposition groups who submitted campaign reports are the Vera Institute of Justice ($482,000) and Southern Poverty Law Center ($28,000), organizations that focus on lowering incarceration rates and providing alternatives to prison. 
This spending likely represents just a portion of the money that has gone into the constitutional amendment campaigns so far. 

Rules for the disclosure of spending on amendments are more relaxed than they are for traditional elections that feature political candidates. A wider range of nonprofit organizations are able to spend money on constitutional propositions without having to submit campaign finance reports to the state, according to people working on both sides of the amendment campaigns.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
For example, conservative activist and former state representative Woody Jenkins does not intend to report any of his political activity opposing Amendment 2 on campaign finance forms. 
Jenkins, who helped write the current state constitution ratified in 1974, is upset Amendment 2 would weaken protections for religious organizations’ property tax exemptions. It would remove those property tax breaks from the state constitution, thereby making them easier to eliminate. 

He has run editorials and news articles critical of Amendment 2 in his two Baton Rouge-based community newspapers. Jenkins also shares content online opposing the amendment through his political accounts, though he doesn’t think that activity rises to the level of requiring an ethics disclosure. 

“We don’t have a campaign or anything,” Jenkins said. 
Likewise, the Protect Louisiana’s Children PAC sent out a mail piece this week supporting Amendment 2 and touting the amendment’s endorsement by the Louisiana Federation of Teachers. 
Republican political consultant Jason Hebert runs the group, which helped elect Landry in 2023, and it hasn’t publicly disclosed any political spending on the amendments. 

Even when political groups submitted campaign finance reports, it’s been difficult to figure out who is paying for their election efforts. 

Landry’s Make Louisiana Great Again PAC got all $300,000 of its amendment campaign money from just one contributor: a “social welfare” nonprofit called Protect Louisiana Values set up to support Landry. 
Protect Louisiana Values is probably best known as the organization that helped bring a live tiger from Florida to the LSU football game against Alabama last fall. Its donors are secret, meaning no one knows who put up the money for the live tiger mascot — or the recent PAC push for Amendment 2. 
Shane Guidry, a wealthy oilfield services executive and Landry confidant, defended the decision to keep those donors private, even after Guidry admitted he is one of the group’s contributors. 
“It lets people support what they want to support without being ridiculed,” Landry said in a telephone interview Thursday from the Bahamas. “All of us have businesses. We all have friends on both sides of the aisle.” 
Guidry spoke on the phone while attending a blue marlin fishing tournament this week with Steve Orlando, another close friend of Landry’s who is chairman of the Make Louisiana Great Again PAC. Orlando also heads Landry’s Fiscal Responsibility Program, which is modeled after Elon Musk’s federal-slashing Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. 
Who’s paying for the amendments’ opposition campaign is also opaque.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX 

The Vera Institute only listed a handful of contributors on its campaign finance reports. The Foundation for Louisiana and The Navigation Fund, a charity founded by cryptocurrency billionaire Jared McCaleb, was expected to give $25,000 to efforts to defeat the amendments, according to the forms. But there was no accounting for where Vera got the remaining $400,000-plus it had already spent on the campaign.  
Sara Omojola, who works for the Vera Institute in Louisiana, said Thursday the organization was putting its own money into the election. Headquartered in New York City, Vera focuses on reducing the country’s prison population and took in over $260 million in annual revenue in both 2022 and 2023. It didn’t disclose donors on its most recent tax form. 

Landry sought Thursday to link Vera and other groups opposed to his constitutional amendment push to liberal billionaire George Soros, a Hungarian-born Holocaust survivor who has served as a bogeyman for Republicans for several years.
Soros’ Open Societies Foundations  gave $1.25 million in 2023 to Vera Action Inc., an affiliated group of the Vera Institute, but the donation is a relatively small sum of money compared with the nonprofit’s overall annual revenue. It’s also not clear, based on tax filings, whether any of that money would have been spent in Louisiana. 
Landry’s pro-Amendment 2 coalition has its own controversial billionaire in the mix as well. Conservative Republican Charles Koch is the founder of Americans for Prosperity, a group that has been knocking on doors, phone banking and sending out direct mail in favor of Amendment 2 over the last two months. 

A Kansas native, Koch is an anti-tax activist with libertarian leanings who often draws the ire of Democrats for spending in national politics. Americans for Prosperity is supporting Amendment 2, in part, because it would lower the maximum rate of the state income tax, said Scott Simon, the former Louisiana state representative who leads the organization’s Louisiana chapter. 

“Our efforts are all on Amendment 2,” Simon said.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/DJI_0150-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-28 11:08:20.127987

Cox explained his reasoning in a letter to legislative leaders issued with just over an hour to spare before his midnight deadline Thursday to sign or veto bills passed by the 2025 Utah Legislature.

“HB77 has been one of the most divisive bills of the session, and I am deeply disappointed that it did not land in a better place,” wrote Cox, who also explained he agreed with the intent behind the legislation. “My understanding is that there was a deal on a compromise that would have removed problematic portions of the bill while retaining others that would support political neutrality in the classroom. Sadly the sponsors did not move that deal forward.”
Supporters of HB77, sponsored by Rep. Trevor Lee, R-Layton, argued it was meant to promote “political neutrality” in government spaces. But critics argued a broad ban that extended to all government properties would invite free speech litigation while also leaving some Utahns, especially the LGBTQ+ community, feeling unwelcome and erased. 
Now slated to take effect on May 7, HB77 will ban almost all flags from being displayed on or in public buildings, except for flags explicitly allowed in a prescriptive list included in the bill, such as the U.S. flag, the state flag, military flags, Olympic flags, college or university flags, or others. Pride flags or other LGBTQ+ flags — which Utah lawmakers in recent years have repeatedly tried to bar from schools in various ways — would be prohibited.
It’s slated to make Utah the first state in the nation to enact such sweeping flag restrictions in government-owned buildings. The Idaho Legislature recently passed a similar bill, HB41, which Gov. Brad Little signed last week, but that legislation won’t take effect until July 1 and it only applies to schools. Idaho lawmakers are also advancing a separate bill to restrict government entities from displaying certain types of flags. 
Utah Legislature bans pride flags from schools, public buildings

Utah’s largest LGBTQ+ rights group, Equality Utah, had negotiated with lawmakers on the bill, which originally focused the flag ban on school classrooms. However, in a House committee last month, Lee changed the legislation to broaden the flag ban to all government property, leading Equality Utah to oppose the bill even though it was prepared to take a “neutral” position on its earlier version. 
Cox faced numerous calls to veto HB77 from advocacy groups including Equality Utah and the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah, as well as from Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall, whose city hosts the annual Utah Pride Festival. He could have vetoed the bill — but he indicated in his letter that it would likely just be overridden by the GOP-supermajority Utah Legislature. Instead, he’s urging lawmakers to work to fix it. 
“I continue to have serious concerns with this bill,” Cox said. “However, because a veto would be overridden, I have decided to allow the bill to go into law without my signature, and urge lawmakers to consider commonsense solutions that address the bill’s numerous flaws.”
Cox encouraged lawmakers to consider allowing the Utah State Board of Education to “go further in ensuring the political neutrality of our classrooms, while also considering repealing the local government piece of this legislation and allowing elected representatives to answer to their own constituents.” 
“If you are willing to pursue this kind of solution, you will have an open door in the executive branch,” Cox wrote. 
Cox’s comments on the flag ban came after the bill cast final-hour drama over Utah’s multimillion-dollar bid to entice the Sundance Film Festival to stay, with some saying it could impact Utah’s chances. 
Earlier Thursday, festival organizers announced they’d opted to move the event to Colorado to help the festival grow. By the time they’d reached their decision, Cox had not yet acted on HB77, but a veto was looking unlikely.
Sundance is leaving Utah, moving to Colorado

While Cox told reporters last week Sundance organizers had told state leaders “very clearly that political issues have nothing to do with the decision,” others, including Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall, worried that HB77 could indeed be “harmful to our effort to retain Sundance.” 
In the end, Utah lost its bid. Cox — who earlier Thursday called Sundance’s decision a “mistake” — also included a note in his letter that he’ll be calling a special session to address, among other issues, what the Legislature should instead do with the $3.5 million it had set aside as part of Utah’s bid to keep Sundance. 
“Let’s reappropriate that money to efforts in Utah to create a new festival and a world-class film economy right here in our state,” he said. 
Cox says he agrees with ‘underlying intent,’ but HB77 has flaws
Cox, in his letter, dove deeper into why he had misgivings with HB77 but said he agreed with the “underlying intent” of the bill. 
“I deeply believe that our classrooms need to be a place where everyone feels welcome — free from the politics that are fracturing our country,” Cox wrote. “Parents are rightly upset when they bring their kids to publicly funded schools and see culture-war symbols in a place that should be apolitical. In an attempt to make some kids feel more welcome, other kids feel less welcome.”
Cox also said he appreciated that the bill is “neutral on the types of flags in question,” while adding that “I find it strange that no headline reads ‘MAGA flags banned from classrooms.’”
Drama over Utah’s bid to keep Sundance heats up over LGBTQ+ flag ban bill

“I agree with the underlying intent of those legislators who supported this bill in an attempt to bring political neutrality to the classroom,” he said, though he added, “Unfortunately, this bill does not do that.” 
He said because it’s aimed at only flags, “there is little preventing countless other displays — posters, signs, drawings, furniture — from entering the classroom.” 
“To those legislators who supported this bill, I’m sure it will not fix what you are trying to fix,” Cox said. 
He noted that many schools have already enacted their own “political neutrality” policies in classrooms, and he argued “we have a better place” to make regulations: the Utah State Board of Education. While he said the board has already set expectations for political neutrality in teacher code of conduct, “I believe more needs to be done by USBE to provide direction in this regard.” 
“I have asked the Board of Education to continue their work to find ways to make our classrooms both more politically neutral and more welcoming to every student to exercise their own individual freedom of expression,” Cox said. “The idea that kids can only feel welcome in a school if a teacher puts up a rainbow flag is just wrong. Let’s do everything possible to make our classrooms one of the last remaining politically neutral places in our state.”
Cox says bill goes ‘too far’ 
The governor added that the flag ban “goes too far” by extending the ban to local governments. 
“While I think it’s wrong for city and county officials to fly divisive flags, I believe that election have consequences and the best way to stop that behavior is to elect people who believe differently,” Cox said. “All this bill does is add more fuel to the fire, and I suspect it will only ratchet up the creative use of political symbolism.”
Ultimately, Cox urged legislators to focus on solutions rather than legislation that deepens divides. 



Let us know what you think...


 


“As tired as Utahns are of politically divisive symbols, I think they are also tired of culture war bills that don’t solve the problems they intend to fix,” he said.
The governor urged lawmakers to work with the LGBTQ+ community, as they have in the past, to find common ground. 
“Utah has always had a reputation of trying to find a way to work together and solve issues between sides that have strongly-held, opposing points of view,” Cox said. “There are so many examples of the LGBTQ community and the conservative community coming together to find helpful and hopeful compromise. I hope we can retain this as our model and North Star.”
The governor also shared a message directly to LGBTQ+ Utahns, acknowledging that “recent legislation has been difficult.” 
“Politics can be a bit of a blood sport at times and I know we have had our disagreements,” he said. “I want you to know that I love and appreciate you and I am grateful that you are part of our state. I know these words may ring hollow to many of you, but please know that I mean them sincerely.”

American Indian and Alaska Native tribes are fighting for equal governance and sovereignty over their own health data. (Kris Hanning/University of Arizona)When Stephanie Russo Carroll, a citizen of the Native Village of Kluti-Kaah in Alaska, set out to earn her doctorate in tribal health 15 years ago, she focused her research on tribal cultural and health programs within six tribes.
She needed vital statistics data, such as birth and death rates, for each of them. But getting that data from the state, which houses vital statistics, was difficult — and in some cases, the data she needed was missing.
“Health outcomes data were unobtainable,” Carroll recalled. In one case, her team had to try using breastfeeding rates as a proxy to estimate birth rates. But even getting those for all six tribes was impossible.
For the next two decades, Carroll would continue to push for U.S. tribes — which are sovereign nations — to own and maintain control over their data, including health statistics.
The concept, known as data sovereignty, is important amid the harrowing health disparities seen in tribal people, rooted in forced assimilation dating back more than a century. Often, data gathered by and about tribes has been shared with state and federal agencies; but those same agencies haven’t always shared their tribal-related statistics in return.
The reasons vary, from systemic issues within the health care system to mistaken assumptions by some federal officials about what data be securely sent to tribes without risking privacy violations.
Race and place can contribute to shorter lives, research suggests

The lack of tribe-specific data has hindered tribes from fully taking care of their members and clouded their work on public health responses to disease outbreaks such as syphilis and COVID-19, on maternal and infant health outcomes, and on chronic issues such as diabetes, heart disease and substance use.
Data sovereignty is especially relevant now, as the Trump administration scrubs federal health websites of data that recognizes and tracks metrics among the country’s various racial and ethnic groups, including what little data there is on tribal members.
States govern their own health data systems. But the same isn’t true for the nation’s 574 federally recognized tribes.
Now an associate professor of public health at the University of Arizona, Carroll co-founded the U.S. Indigenous Data Sovereignty Network and directs the Collaboratory for Indigenous Data Governance. Both are groups that work to research and strengthen Indigenous data governance, accuracy and data-driven policy.
“If you don’t know who has been sick or hospitalized,” Carroll said, “how can you make sure you have the right care systems for your community?”
Withholding tribes’ data
As part of its slashing of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, the Trump administration removed numerous racial, ethnic, adolescent and maternal health datasets from the websites of several federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While some of the data has been reinstated, the swift deletions raised alarms in tribal communities.
Abigail Echo-Hawk, a member of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma and director of the Urban Indian Health Institute, said the youth behavioral risk surveys were reinstated, but were missing key race and ethnicity search features that tribes use to track mental health conditions in American Indian and Alaska Native teens.
“Now, we can’t search, disaggregate by Native youth,” she said. “That information is about our children, and it is the legal right of both now the tribal epidemiology centers and the tribes to have access to that previously gathered information.”
Despite their public health authority, tribes and tribal epidemiology centers, which support tribes with health data tracking, say federal and state health officials have long withheld or denied requests to direct access of health data related to their tribes, including coronavirus data during the pandemic.
Such data is tied to treaty rights obligations and shouldn’t be lumped together with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives currently under attack by the Trump administration, Echo-Hawk said.
“Our treaty rights are tied to having information around tribal people. So, if you’re going to uphold our treaty rights, you need to say: ‘This number of Native people are experiencing this issue,’ or ‘This number of Native people exist,’” she said.
It wasn’t until 2021 that the CDC conducted its first comprehensive life expectancy profile of American Indians and Alaska Natives; it showed that in 2019, their life expectancy was seven years lower than that of white people.
“All of the data is a story. It’s a grandmother, it’s a son, it’s a story of a community’s well-being,” Echo-Hawk said.
When tribes receive federal grants — whether for transportation, housing or education initiatives — there are grant reporting requirements.










All of data is a story. It's a grandmother, it's a son, it's a story of a community's well-being.


– Abigail Echo-Hawk, director of the Urban Indian Public Health Institute


Under those rules, tribes send raw data to federal agencies, but they often don’t get that data back, said social demographer Desi Small-Rodriguez, an assistant professor of sociology and American Indian studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, who co-founded the data sovereignty network with Carroll.
“It’s a one-way data highway coming from tribal governments — leaving tribal governments and going into the feds — and it’s not coming back,” said Small-Rodriguez. She also directs the Data Warriors Lab, working with tribes — including her own Northern Cheyenne Tribe of Montana — to develop legal mechanisms to ensure data ownership.
She said the federal government should provide funding, as part of its treaty obligations, to pay for expensive data support such as secure storage systems, high-performance computers and analytics staff.
“As part of our treaty rights, we have a right to health care and education. We have a right to clean water and air — and data form the basis for all of that,” she said.
State data agreements
In January, the Tulalip Tribes in northwest Washington state secured a data-sharing agreement with the state department of health. It gives the tribes access to the state’s disease reporting system, allowing them to extract some data directly. Tulalip plans to eventually secure access to more datasets.
It’s the first agreement of its kind in the state, said Summer Hammons, legislative policy analyst in the Treaty Rights and Governmental Affairs Department of the Tulalip Tribes, which has at least 5,000 members. Hammons grew up on the reservation.
For Indian Country, federal cuts decimate core tribal programs

She hopes it will help the tribe direct resources and funds where they’re needed — whether it’s more cancer screenings or vaccinations against diseases such as measles, as other states grapple with outbreaks of the virus.
“It allows us to collaborate and lead on outbreak investigations related to tribal members,” Hammons said. “It’s a clear outline that tribes own their data in partnership with the state, because the state’s the one that’s collecting it. But we want to tell our story, and we want to be able to work with DOH [department of health] to be mindful of our stories and to also get better access to the statistics.”
A few other states — Alaska, Arizona, Oregon and South Dakota — also have limited-scope agreements with tribes.
Gary Ferguson, Unangax (Aleut), is the director of integrative medicine at Tulalip Health Clinic. He said he hopes the data will help the tribe track health care interventions over time.
“We don’t know what’s working. We don’t know what’s not working,” he said. “We want to celebrate our wins.”
Tracking disease
In recent years, the nation has seen alarming surges in congenital syphilis, a preventable infection passed through pregnancy to newborns. Nearly 40% can be stillborn or die as a newborn. Babies can also suffer lifelong blindness or deafness. Tribal babies suffer the highest rate.
Officials at the Great Plains Tribal Epidemiology Center, which tracks tribal public health across four states, were denied syphilis data from local public health departments for years until the group leaned on the CDC for assistance.
It wasn’t until then that, finally, last year, one state — South Dakota — agreed to share American Indian and Alaska Native syphilis cases as soon as they’re reported, said Sarah Shewbrooks, the group’s lead tribal epidemiologist.
Shewbrooks hopes the access in South Dakota will pave the way for more agreements in the other Great Plains states.
‘We needed this yesterday’
During COVID-19, American Indian and Alaska Native people were more likely to be infected and compared with white people, had double the risk of in-hospital death and three times the rate of severe infection, research shows. Yet even then, data weren’t telling the whole story.
Echo-Hawk’s organization published a report card in 2021 that scored each state’s collection of Natives’ COVID-19 cases. In total, the nation averaged a D+. This year, she published a follow-up for epidemiologists on addressing the misclassification of Native people, who often are listed as “white” or “Hispanic” in health settings and death certificates. Many states also inconsistently or don’t report tribal affiliation on death certificates, which can make tribe-specific death rates elusive.
How the state, tribes and federal government are working to curb SD’s syphilis epidemic

A report in 2021 from the nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office found that some officials from the CDC and the Indian Health Services agency didn’t recognize that they were required by law to share data with tribal epidemiology centers, the centers told investigators.
In the GAO report, investigators detailed logistical barriers, including federal agencies’ reluctance to share COVID-19 data because of concerns around privacy and security in data transmission.
“This is one of the best examples of what structural racism looks like,” said Shewbrooks. “Because when you look at the infrastructure for public health systems and public health data, tribes and [tribal epidemiology centers] were never included in that infrastructure.
“COVID really put it up there as: No, we needed this yesterday.”
Shewbrooks said that as part of her work she’d go to funeral directors, who may fill out death certificates, throughout the region to educate them on proper classification of American Indian people. “I even had one say to me once, ‘I just always code them by how they look. I never ask what their race is.’”
“A lot of them didn’t know that this is data that gets really used,” she said. “Vital records data is just super important, foundational work in a lot of epidemiological work.”
There is no national standard for tribal health data, explained Cheryl Ellenwood, who is a citizen of the Nez Perce Nation and also Diné (Navajo).
Ellenwood, an assistant professor in Washington State University’s School of Politics, Philosophy and Public Affairs, experienced firsthand the data disconnect when both her parents died of COVID-19.
Four years ago this month, her mother, Annie Benally Ellenwood, an enrolled Navajo tribal member from New Mexico, died at age 71 in a hospital in Idaho. Annie Ellenwood’s death, however, wouldn’t show up in primary statistics of COVID-19 deaths in Navajo people — her tribe isn’t listed on her death certificate.
“I was very hurt by this, because my mother died because of COVID-19, and I wanted her death to count and mean something,” Ellenwood said.
“It still feels very life and death, like we are fighting to demonstrate the impact of so many things on our people,” she said.

(Photo by Jared Strong/Iowa Capital Dispatch)A St. Louis-based company with an Iowa grain dealer license has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
Iowa farmers with unpaid grain sold to Benson Hill Holdings, Inc. prior to March 20, can file a claim for indemnity, according to the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship.
Don McDowell, communications director for IDALS, said the department is not “immediately aware” of any affected farmers.
The grain indemnity fund will pay farmers 90% of their loss, up to $300,000, though claims related to Benson Hill must be mailed or personally delivered to IDALS’s Grain Warehouse Bureau by July 18.
The fund was established by the Iowa Legislature in 1986 and accrues via a per-bushel fee on purchased grain and fees on licensed warehouses and grain dealers.
According to minutes from the Iowa Grain Indemnity Fund Board, the balance of the fund as of Feb. 19 was $8.4 million.
Benson Hill filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy March 20 and has up to $11 million in debtor-in-possession financing to continue its day-to-day operations.
Christi Dixon, a spokesperson for the seed innovation company, said it is “restructuring” its finances.
“We will continue to meet our contractual commitments and support key farmers without interruption,” Dixon said in an email.
Dixon said the company maintains a seed processing facility in Bondurant and employs seven people in Iowa. Benson Hill previously owned a soy processing facility in Creston, but sold the facility in February 2024 to White River Nutrition.
McDowell said the grain license for Benson Hill included locations in Cherokee and Galva.
 Changes to the fund

In 2023, the grain indemnity fund fell below its minimum threshold, which triggered the farmer-paid fees to support the fund, after nearly 30 years without needing to fill the fund. It also triggered legislative efforts to reform the grain indemnity fund to reflect modern farming practices and pricing.
The efforts have stalled out in the past due to disagreements on including credit-sale contracts, which are currently excluded from the fund.
House legislation introduced this year, would increase the fund’s minimum from from $3 million to $8 million, and its maximum from $8 million to $16 million. It would also extend protections to farmers with credit-sale contracts, but would only reimburse these contracts at 70%.
The bill is not yet eligible for floor debate in the House and could be killed by the upcoming April 4 “funnel” deadline if it does not advance to the Senate and through committee.
The Senate version of the bill would increase the minimum and maximum to $5 million and $12 million, respectively, and would include credit-sale contracts as transactions covered by the fund.
The Senate bill is eligible for floor debate.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana (ACLU) filed a class action lawsuit on Friday challenging a Gov. Mike Braun executive order that ended the process for updating gender markers on state documents, specifically birth certificates. 
Complying with the executive action, the Vital Records Division of the Indiana Department of Health has halted the process for approving changes to gender markers that have been ordered by the courts. The plaintiff is a 15-year-old girl who was born in Indiana but now lives in Ohio and can’t get an amended birth certificate. 
“Transgender Hoosiers have a right to accurate birth certificates to live safely and authentically. Court-ordered changes to birth certificates are common for a number of reasons, and to deny trans people the right to change these important documents is discrimination,” ACLU Legal Director Ken Falk said in a statement.
  ACLU of Indiana Legal Director Ken Falk (From the ACLU of Indiana website)
Braun’s executive order mirrors a similar one from President Donald Trump, which he signed on his first day in office. 
“The Executive Order is disconnected from the reality that transgender persons and other gender-diverse persons exist in Indiana. The reality that gender identity may differ from the sex assigned at birth is a matter of science and medicine and also is recognized by courts, including the United States Supreme Court,” the lawsuit asserts. 
Adopted Hoosiers or those changing their name can get updated birth certificates, which are used to get driver’s licenses, open bank accounts, enroll in school and more. Having a document with another gender can complicate access to these services for gender diverse Hoosiers. 
“Have to present a birth certificate that identifies (the plaintiff) as ‘male’ will immediately create a risk of ‘outing’ her as transgender to all who view the birth certificate, or may result in others questioning whether her birth certificate is authentic or genuine as she has a female name and appears in all respects to be a girl and will only appear more feminine in the future,” the lawsuit said.
Previously, gender marker changes on birth certificates could occur following a court order.  
The 19-page complaint maintains that the executive order violates privacy rights and discriminates against certain classes of Hoosiers, a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
The underlying executive order directs state agencies to respect the “biological binary,” defining sex, gender, woman, man, female and male. According to the text, gender is synonymous with sex, defined as a person’s “immutable biological classification as either male or female.”
The order does not acknowledge the existence of intersex or transgender Hoosiers. 
“It is the official position of Indiana’s Executive Branch that modern gender ideology is inconsistent with this fundamental and deeply rooted legal distinction between men and women,” the order read. “Modern gender ideology attempts to replace the biological category of sex with an ever-shifting concept of self-assessed gender identity.” 
The ACLU will host a virtual press conference Friday afternoon. 
This story will be updated.

The Trump administration has eliminated more than $1 billion for local foods programs, which has left food banks and school systems scrambling (Spencer Platt/Getty Images).For the Day Eagle Hope Project, federal money has helped volunteers deliver fresh produce and meat to families in need across the remote Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in northern Montana — while putting cash into the hands of farmers, ranchers and meat processors.
The nonprofit generally has less than $300,000 to spend per year. So the $200,000 from a U.S. Department of Agriculture local food buying program drastically raised both the quantity and quality of the food it could distribute.
“They were a major, major contributor to our food,” said Tescha Hawley, who directs the organization, which aims to improve physical, mental and spiritual health.
The USDA recently nixed more than $1 billion from two programs that helped food banks and school meal programs buy local foods, including $660 million for schoolchildren. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins recently described the programs as “nonessential.”
But the move has left hundreds of school systems and food banks reeling. They already face rising food prices and are struggling to help community members with growing food insecurity.
Created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs aimed to build more resilient supply chains of domestic food by connecting schools and food pantries with small ranches, farms and dairies. The program was initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but later expanded by the Biden administration.
The federal programs stimulated the purchase of locally grown fruits, vegetables, dairy and meats — benefiting both the smaller farmers who received fair market pay for their products and the organizations granted funds to buy high quality foods.
The noncompetitive grants sent hundreds of millions of dollars to all 50 states, the District of Columbia and 84 tribal governments, boosting business for more than 8,000 farmers and providing local food to almost as many food banks. The Trump administration is killing the programs, despite Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s campaign against processed food, which he says is “poisoning” Americans.
Without ongoing funding, Hawley said, she would have to rely on cheaper, less nutritious food.
“It’s simple, right? I can get a truck … in here with all highly processed food, no problem,” she said.
Schools are facing a similar challenge: While officials running breakfast and lunch programs would prefer to buy more local products, those are often expensive. And with underfunding, high food costs and labor struggles, school lunch programs are already stretched thin.
In Milan, Tennessee, the federal funds allowed the local school system to buy minimally processed beef from a local stockyard, and broccoli, purple hull peas, tomatoes and melons from local growers.
Vickie Dunaway, who supervises the school system’s food services, told the Tennessee Lookout the federal cuts mean “going backwards” on purchasing healthier foods.
“That will obviously have to be cut out, because our budget will not withstand being able to purchase local,” she said. “Purchasing local, minimally processed food is way more expensive than buying from a distributor.”
 A ‘devastating’ cut to food banks

Late last year, USDA said the programs had already spent more than $1 billion on local foods, and announced an expansion of the two programs with an additional $1.13 billion. USDA has killed that $1.13 billion expansion; it is still reimbursing the previously committed funds.
The Trump administration, which has sought to dramatically slash the size of the federal government, told recipients earlier this month that the programs “no longer effectuate the goals of the agency.”
In a statement to Stateline, the USDA said the current administration is “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
“The COVID era is over — USDA’s approach to nutrition programs will reflect that reality moving forward,” the statement said.
The nonpartisan National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, which represents the ag department leaders of all 50 states, last month lobbied the federal government to continue the local foods program with permanent funding and ease procurement regulations for school meal programs. Arkansas Secretary of Agriculture Wes Ward, president of the association, said in a statement that the local food programs aid both producers and consumers.
“Investing in local and regional food systems not only strengthens the connections between farmers and their local communities, it bolsters supply chain resiliency as well,” his statement read.
In New Mexico, the program allowed food banks to buy some 900,000 pounds of locally grown food from more than 200 farmers since 2023. Before the program was terminated, the state was expecting close to $3 million in additional funding, Source New Mexico reported.
Jill Dixon, executive director of The Food Depot in northern New Mexico, called the cuts “devastating.”
In Texas, the San Antonio Food Bank counted on USDA’s local food program to help round out the food boxes it provides to families in need. The food bank, which serves more than 100,000 people across 29 Texas counties, largely relies on donated foods from hotels, restaurants and grocery stores.
“The challenge is I might get peanut butter donated, but I don’t have the jelly, or I might have pasta donated, but I don’t have the marinara,” said Eric Cooper, president and CEO of the food bank. “This program allowed us to purchase those items that we didn’t get that then helped round out the food box, or really complement the food that was being donated to give families the ability to make meals.”
The program initially provided the food bank nearly $3 million in grant funding — about 20% of what the organization spends each year on bulk food purchases. It expected a similar amount this year, before USDA’s announcement.
Cooper said cuts come even as the need for assistance rises. Food prices have squeezed families, and mass layoffs of federal workers portend more demand for food assistance in the coming months, he said.
“And we’ll be caught in the middle. And you know, that’s an incredibly uncomfortable place to be. The only thing we’ll be able to do is just ration what little we have — to spread it as thinly as possible over the number of households we provide food to.”
 A boost for school lunches

For years, school meal programs have struggled with tight margins. Not only do they have to meet strict nutritional guidelines, but schools also face lagging reimbursement from the federal government and spend millions covering the cost of students’ unpaid meal debt.
At the 1,600-student Monticello School District in Arkansas, that debt is approaching $60,000.
So $50,000 from USDA’s local food program was a significant boost to the bottom line.
“That was such a help,” said Amanda West, the district’s child nutrition director.
The southeast Arkansas district used grant money to buy locally grown ground beef. The beef went into dishes including taco salad, meatloaf and spaghetti.
West said staff and students immediately noticed a difference in taste from conventionally purchased meats. And though the local product cost more, West said it also yielded more because it was not full of additives that cause the meat to shrink when cooked.
West, who is the president of the Arkansas School Nutrition Association, noted that her state is home to the nation’s highest rates of food insecurity.
West had hoped to see the local foods program help turn that tide by bringing more stability to school meal programs and growing the state economy by boosting local farmers, ranchers and distributors.
“We’re all upset about it. I hate that we’re not receiving it because grocery prices are 30, 40% higher than what they were a few years ago, and it really hurts our budget,” she said. “It helped a lot of districts, including mine, and it would be amazing if we could get it back.”
On top of the local foods program cuts, congressional Republicans are considering billions in potential cuts to free and reduced-price school meal programs — cuts the School Nutrition Association says could potentially affect millions of American students.
The federal government partially subsidizes breakfast, lunch and after-school snack programs at rates calculated by the income level of students’ families.
The School Nutrition Association, which represents 50,000 school meal providers across the country, said the school meals are the healthiest many American children receive. But that group says federal reimbursements are far from adequate, leaving members worried about the future of their meal programs.
In a recent association survey of more than 1,390 school meal directors, more than 90% reported serious or moderate concern over the financial sustainability of their school meal programs three years from now.

Taylor/National Park Service)The Alaska Board of Game on Thursday approved state officials’ request to continue a controversial predator control program in Western Alaska, even though a judge ruled two weeks ago that the bear-killing program violated the state constitution.
The board granted an Alaska Department of Fish and Game petition for emergency action to carry out a third season of shooting bears and wolves to keep them from preying on the ailing Mulchatna Caribou Herd. In the past two years, the predator control program — carried out in late spring and early summer within the herd’s range — killed 175 brown bears, five black bears and 19 wolves, according to the department.
The emergency finding is warranted to help a herd that fell from a peak of about 200,000 in the late 1990s to about 13,000 now, too low to allow any hunting, board members said on the final day of a weeklong meeting in Anchorage.
“Right now, we have a herd that has shut down where a large number of people in Western Alaska can’t put caribou in their freezer right now. And it’s not going to grow if they don’t have calf survival,” said Stosh Hoffman, a board member from Bethel.
People in the region need to be able to hunt caribou because other food sources are uncertain, Hoffman said.
“We’re in tough times out here. A lot of things are changing. The salmon is in big decline. Our moose population, everyone knows it’s going to tip over real soon, like new moose populations tend to do. When they crash, they crash hard,” he said. He noted that the Alaska Federation of Natives, at its last convention, unanimously supported a resolution in favor of Mulchatna predator control.
But Nicole Schmitt, executive director of the Alaska Wildlife Alliance, said she was “shocked” at what the department and the board did.
“We just think it was a complete betrayal of the public process,” Schmitt said. Emergency regulations in the past have closed hunting, not opened or reopened predator control, she said. “This says to me if the board wants something done, they will manufacture an emergency to that end.”
The Alaska Wildlife Alliance is considering how to respond, she said. We’re looking at something that includes a legal response, as well as other options,” she said.
The Department of Fish and Game submitted the petition for emergency action last Friday, on the first day of the regularly scheduled Anchorage meeting.
While department officials say the predator removals done to date have resulted in increased calf births that help the herd, opponents say factors like habitat change rather than predation are behind the herd’s population decline.
Opponents also say that the program threatens populations of bears, including those that frequent the well-known bear-viewing areas in Katmai National Park and Preserve.
The Alaska Wildlife Alliance filed a lawsuit in 2023 that resulted in the ruling against the program.
Superior Court Judge Andrew Guidi ruled on March 14 that it was carried out in violation of public-notice and public-comment requirements and that it violated the state constitution’s sustained-yield mandate by failing to adequately evaluate impacts to bear populations.
At the Board of Game meeting, there was debate among members about whether adequate public notice and opportunities for public comment had been given this time. Some members argued for a separate meeting. But the majority, by a 5-2 vote, decided to deal with the matter Thursday, the last day of the weeklong meeting.
The vote to authorize the program’s resumption passed by a 6-1 margin. Member John Wood, who agreed with others that the matter qualified as an emergency but had expressed some concerns about proper public notice, was the lone dissenter.
Ryan Scott, director of the department’s Division of Wildlife, said the program can start imminently. To be effective, it has to be carried out in the late spring and early summer, during the calving season, he said.
The department is poised to start its third season of the Mulchatna predator control, he told Board of Game members.
“It’s not about beginning to gear up. We are full tilt. We have contracts in place, we got fuel moving,” he told the board. Though the court ruling has implications for proper processes to follow, the department is treating the matter as having some urgency, he said. “I mean, 30 days from now, we’ll probably be putting people in the field,” he said.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)A new law signed by the governor this week lifts some of the constraints on Utah’s water agent, a relatively new position tasked with negotiating with other states, or even countries, to bring more water to the Beehive State.
Now, water agent Joel Ferry — who also leads the Utah Division of Natural Resources — will be able to include the Colorado and Bear rivers in his negotiations.   
Sponsored by Rep. Casey Snider, R-Paradise, the bill frees up Ferry to work with neighboring states or entities that are currently governed by interstate compacts, like the Colorado River Compact, which divides the Colorado River drainage into an upper and lower basin and allocates water between seven states and Mexico — and the Bear River Compact, an agreement between Utah, Idaho and Wyoming that dictates how much water each state can use from the river.    
The water agent job has only been around for six months, created during the 2024 legislative session through SB211, a bill facilitating Utah’s long-term water planning. The water agent is charged with negotiating with other states and countries for ways to bring more water into Utah, while coordinating with the Utah Water Development Council, also created by SB211. 
But SB211 prohibited the water agent from entering into negotiations related to “interests governed by interstate compacts.” Essentially, water allocated by the Bear River and Colorado River compacts was off limits. 
  Rep. Casey Snider, R-Paradise, speaks in the House Chamber at the Capitol in Salt Lake City on Friday, Jan. 26, 2024. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)
Now, that language has been cut from state code, allowing the water agent to recommend any water augmentation project — defined in the bill as an infrastructure project on interstate waters that will increase water availability in Utah — to the state’s Board of Water Resources. 
In an interview during the legislative session, Snider said his bill doesn’t threaten these interstate compacts, which will still dictate how water is divided among states. 
“We still have the Colorado River Commissioner, who is the chief negotiator on that,” he said. “We’re not going to be able to do anything unless there’s agreement from another state. We just want to make sure if there is something on the table, we are not hindered because of our statutes.”
Ferry said that language clarifies what the original legislation intended. By declaring the Colorado River and Bear River compacts as off limits, he says that effectively made it so the water agent couldn’t work with Utah’s neighbors. 
“The original legislation said if there is a federal compact, the agent can’t work in those states. Well, guess what states those are — Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, California — all of our surrounding states. So you’re basically saying, ‘hey, go do this task, but you can’t work with our neighbors,’” said Ferry. “We don’t want to be hamstrung, or make it so that the state water agent can’t work with neighboring states.”

It’s unclear what exactly Ferry is working on. SB211 shields the water agent from Utah public records law, making any document that reveals a legal strategy in water negotiations, or anything else that might “harm the ability of the Utah water agent to negotiate the best terms and conditions regarding the use of water” a protected record, per the bill text. 
Negotiations over water can be tense and difficult, hence lawmakers’ reasoning for the public records exemption. “When you talk about water most people bring a shotgun and a pony shovel with them,” said Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, in 2024. 
But Adams’ explanation does little to ease the fears of government transparency groups and environmentalists, who have criticized the shadowy nature of the position. Those fears are worsened now that the water agent can include the Colorado and Bear rivers in negotiations. 
“What this bill certainly does, especially in the context of the Colorado and the Bear rivers, is open the possibility for more negotiations behind closed doors that the public won’t know about until the cake has been baked,” said Kyle Roerink, executive director of the Great Basin Water Network, a water policy and environmental nonprofit.  
Roerink said that could manifest in a number of ways — maybe it’s new development on the Bear River with Idaho, a project on the Green River with Wyoming, or an agreement with Arizona or Nevada to deplete more of the Virgin River.

“The bill clearly does not authorize a specific project. But what it does is open the door to a number of possibilities for a behind-the-scenes, cloak-and-dagger negotiation,” he said. 
Ferry, when asked about what he plans to do now that he’s free to negotiate with neighboring states, didn’t offer specifics. Things are in motion, and if he said anything publicly, he worried that would kill progress. 
“At the same time, these ideas are out there and we’re exploring,” said Ferry, who has led trips to California, Israel and Canada to explore new water infrastructure projects. 
“It’s thinking outside the box, looking at engineered solutions,” he said. “The water agent has been in existence for about six months, it’s an infant office. It’s really about learning and understanding the lay of the land, building relationships with neighboring states and looking at what opportunities other states have been implementing.” 
Desalination plants, pipelines and more: What is a water augmentation project? 
A key piece of the water agent’s job is negotiating for new water augmentation projects, defined as infrastructure or technology that increases water supply and availability — that includes rainwater storage, dams and reservoirs, recharging aquifers or building pipelines. 
Probably the best example inside the state’s borders is the Central Utah Project, a system of reservoirs, pipelines and rivers that transports water from the Colorado River basin in eastern Utah through Strawberry Reservoir to the Wasatch Front. 
Even though they live in an entirely different basin, there are residents in Utah County, for example, who have Colorado River water flowing through their taps. 
Another example is a hypothetical project that has been getting more attention recently — building a desalination plant off the coast of California in exchange for a portion of the Golden State’s Colorado River share. 
Snider said there’s nothing like that currently on the table, “but I wish there were.”
The proposed Lake Powell Pipeline, a controversial proposal to pipe water from Lake Powell to Washington County in southwestern Utah, also fits the definition of a water augmentation project. The pipeline has been on the back burner for years, with drought, a depleted Colorado River and federal red tape standing in its way. None of that is changed by HB311, said Snider. 
“That’s going to have hurdles that far exceed any of the state’s dreams,” Snider said about the Lake Powell Pipeline. “You’ve got hundreds of miles of statewide property you’ve got to cross, you have a Colorado River that’s at its lowest point ever and you have Lake Powell that’s at 30% (capacity) right now. There are things impacting that project that are just on-the-ground realities.”

(Getty Images)U.S. House members in two of Alabama’s three districts with major automotive plants Thursday criticized President Donald Trump’s plans to impose 25% tariffs on automobiles and automobile parts.
The tariffs could hit Alabama’s car plants hard. Most of Alabama’s leading imports in 2023 — including oil, engines, transmissions and ignition sets – went toward building automobiles. 
U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell, D-Selma, whose district includes the Mercedes-Benz plant in Vance, wrote on social media Thursday that she has not supported tariffs on automobile parts since Trump proposed them in his first term in 2019. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In 2019, Sewell and 160 other lawmakers sent a letter to the National Economic Council Director opposing the tariffs citing increased prices on consumers and the possibility of loss of jobs. 
“We agreed that they would raise prices, hurt consumers and manufacturers, and weaken our economy,” she wrote on Thursday. “It’s still true today.”
U.S. Rep. Shomari Figures, D-Mobile, whose district includes the Hyundai plant outside Montgomery, echoed the concern of increased prices and lost jobs in a statement Thursday.
“The reality is that the companies are not going to absorb those expenses; they’re going to pass them off to people who purchase vehicles in my district, in the state, and across the country,” he said. 
Figures also noted that the tariffs are another policy by the Trump administration that will hurt everyday Americans. 
“These tariffs are yet another example of this administration acting without considering how it will impact everyday people, and most certainly not considering how it will affect people in industries in the state of Alabama,” he said.
Messages seeking comment from U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Saks, whose district includes  a Honda plant outside Lincoln, were left Thursday morning. 
Trump signed the executive order Wednesday. The tariffs will go into effect on April 2. 
Representatives of the state’s automobile industry were much more cautious about the tariffs on Thursday.
Jennifer Safavian, CEO of Auto Drive America (ADA), said the tariffs will definitely lead to higher vehicle prices across the country in a phone interview Thursday. The organization represents five automotive manufacturers in Alabama: Honda in Lincoln, Hyundai in Montgomery, Mazda Toyota in Huntsville and two Mercedes-Benz U.S. International plants outside Tuscaloosa.
“No question, there ‘ill be higher costs because of the tariffs, which will in turn increase prices for vehicles,” Safavian said.
Safavian said the company had a consulting firm model what the tariffs will impact. Under the 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and previously announced 10% tariffs on all imported goods, Safavian said the price of vehicles would increase about 8%, or $4,000. The model was done considering the entire automotive industry, not just Alabama. 
According to ADA’s 2023 economic impact report, Alabama auto manufacturers have 19 models that are built with parts from 42 countries and territories. Statewide, Alabama auto manufacturers employ 90,000 people. Safavian said those jobs could be at risk due to a projected decrease in sales and production.
“If there’s less production, whether it’s because there’s less sales in the United States or there’s fewer sales abroad, I don’t know what that ultimately means, but that’s why it’s a concern that it certainly could threaten jobs,” she said. 
Edith Müller-Callsen, manager of corporate affairs communications for Mercedes-Benz, wrote in a statement that the company employs 163,000 jobs across its manufacturing plants and dealerships across the country. She said the company is still assessing the effect of the tariffs.
“As a global company, we rely on constructive cooperation and policies that promote mutually beneficial trade across international markets,” she said. “Mercedes-Benz supports free and fair trade that underpins prosperity, growth and innovation.”
Requests for comment from Honda and Hyundai were sent Thursday. 
Ron Davis, the president of the Alabama Automotive Manufacturers Association, said Thursday he was “not free to speak on this topic.”
Messages seeking comment from the Business Council of Alabama were left Thursday morning.

(Jack Power/MSU Creative Services)Once Gov. Greg Gianforte affixes his signature to House Bill 190, Montana will become the fourth state to adopt American Rodeo as the official state sport.
Other states have adopted official sports representing a facet of their heritage, ranging from the common – baseball in New York — to the increasingly popular — pickleball in Washington — to the less traditional — pack burro racing in Colorado, and dog mushing in Alaska.
During the last week the Montana Legislature took its final votes on HB 190 and the bill will head to the governor’s desk for a signature.
Sen. Wendy McKamey, R-Great Falls, carried the bill in the Senate and wore her paisley scarf on the floor when she spoke about the bill, because “this is more rodeo than almost anything else.”
“I don’t know that I can convey, really, how fun rodeo is here in the Senate chamber,” McKamey said.
“This is very unique in that it represents our heritage, the outdoors, and it’s an opportunity to have have a really unique statement about our state,” she added.
Some senators voiced their opposition to the bill — Sen. Daniel Emrich, R-Great Falls, said that more Montanans hunt than rodeo, and Sen. Susan Webber, D-Browning, objected to the bill not specifically including Native American components.
“I just had hoped that they would have included the Indian Relay, which is a few centuries old here as part of this bill,” Webber said. “But we do have an Indian rodeo circuit that goes along with the National Rodeo Association. I just wish they would have done a little bit more.”
The bill was supported by the Montana American Indian Caucus, as well as by the congressional delegation and all six of Montanan’s statewide elected officials.

“There’s nothing better than a good rodeo all summer long. And the fine senator in the back near Kalispell said they have it all winter long going there,” Sen. Butch Gillespie, R-Ethbridge, said. “And as far as the Indian rodeos … nothing’s better than their rodeos and and the relay races, and they happen all over the place also. So let’s not let the other western states get the drop on us here.”
The Senate passing the measure 40-9, with an amendment making the law effective immediately. The House on Wednesday concurred with the amendment with only two votes in opposition.
Five colleges in Montana, including Montana State University, have rodeo clubs or teams. MSU hosted the collegiate rodeo finals for 24 years, until they moved briefly to South Dakota in the 1990s and then to Casper, Wyoming where they are still held.
At the high school level, Montana qualified 100 contestants to the National High School Rodeo Finals from the state championships held in Kalispell last J—une.
American Rodeo now joins the pantheon of state symbols, next to the duck-billed dinosaur (state fossil), Scobey soil (state soil), bitterroot (state floral emblem), blackspotted cutthroat trout (state fish), bluebunch wheatgrass (state grass), grizzly bear (state animal), and “Montana Melody” (state ballad) among others.

(Photo: Michael Lyle/Nevada Current)As potential federal cuts to Medicaid loom, City of Las Vegas officials are asking state lawmakers to expand Medicaid to pay for medical respite care for unhoused people. 
Senate Bill 54, heard Tuesday by the Senate Health and Human Services Committee, would require the state’s Department of Health and Human Services to apply for a federal waiver and amend the state Medicaid plan to cover medical respite care for people experiencing homelessness.
The bill would also require DHHS to adopt guidelines for respite care for unhoused populations.
Though Democratic legislators have been publicly fretting that congressional Republicans will drastically cut Medicaid spending to help pay for tax cuts requested by President Donald Trump, state lawmakers on the panel Tuesday didn’t directly discuss the prospect, though there were oblique references noting the Senate Finance Committee will be tasked with approving state Medicaid spending details. 
When unhoused people are injured or dealing with an illness not deemed serious enough for a hospital stay, they are forced to heal while unsheltered. 
Sabra Newby, the deputy city manager for the City of Las Vegas, said authorizing federal reimbursements for services would “improve health outcomes, reduce unnecessary hospital stays and readmissions, and strengthen Nevada’s continuum of care for its most vulnerable residents.”
“Medical respite care offers short term, residential community-based support specifically for homeless individuals who need a safe and sanitary place to heal,” Newby said. 
The Recuperative Care Center in the Corridor of Hope, the area in downtown Las Vegas that offers homeless services, opened in 2020 during the Covid pandemic to offer some medical respite care.
The city used funding provided by the American Rescue Plan Act, signed into law by President Joe Biden in 2021, to expand and maintain the 40-bed facility. It also relies on general fund dollars to operate the facility.
The city contracts with the federally qualified Hope Christian Health Center to operate the facility within the homeless services corridor.
City officials told state lawmakers the facility has served 1,115 patients, with the majority referred by hospitals. More than half of those transition into “some sort of permanent functional housing at their discharge,” said Lindy Cooksey, a neighborhood outreach specialist with the city. 
The city plans to temporarily reduce capacity starting this summer as the center goes through construction to double capacity, which is expected to be complete by 2027. 
Once the expansion is complete, the estimated annual operating budget is expected to be $7 million.
“Covering the cost for the entirety of this program would place a significant burden on the city’s general funds,” said Arcelia Barajas, the director of Neighborhood Services with the City of Las Vegas. “Although respite care for homeless individuals is fairly new to Nevada, it is a best practice nationally and funded through various avenues with the most common being Medicaid.”
The bill, if passed, would not cover the entire budget of the center but “reduce the strain” of the city’s budget, Barajas said.   
Democratic state Sen. Fabian Doñate of Las Vegas, the committee’s chair, noted other states have obtained federal waivers for homeless respite housing, and those models hopefully would serve as a template for expediting federal approval. 
Republican state Sen. Robin Titus, whose district includes all or parts of six rural counties, asked whether the bill would only apply to services offered at the Las Vegas-based center or would apply to communities throughout the state.
Newby said theoretically it could apply throughout the state but she was “unaware of any other place that provides these services.
Local governments and health providers alike supported the legislation. 
Joanna Jacob, a lobbyist with Clark County who testified in support of the bill, said the county used covid relief dollars to convert motels into noncongregate shelter space. Two of the motels offer respite care, she said.
“There is enough need in our community that we need to build additional resources,” Jacob said. 
Cadence Matijevich, a lobbyist with Washoe County, said while the county doesn’t have a stand alone respite center, it does provide similar services to what Las Vegas offers. She said the county would also benefit if Medicaid covered costs to cover respite services.

The current academic year’s 1.61% dip in enrollment follows one year of modest 1.83% growth and two years of more significant 7% growth, which mirrored a nationwide trend of parents opting for private schools because they were better able to reopen physical classrooms and adapt to the COVID-19 restrictions.
In the six years preceding the start of the pandemic, private school enrollment only recorded one year of enrollment growth. The other five years, enrollment remained flat or dipped.
As of October, 22,442 students were enrolled in private schools in Nevada — 368 students fewer than the prior year.
﻿﻿﻿
The Nevada DOE compiles a separate report on K-12 enrollment within public schools. When data from the reports are combined, private school students make up 4.4% of students enrolled in Nevada schools. (The state does not aggregate the number of homeschooled students statewide.)
The total number of private school students remains higher than pre-pandemic. In October 2019, there were 19,325 students enrolled.
Last year, the Nevada DOE noted the modest 1.83% increase “might indicate a leveling off” of private school enrollment.
This year’s report, dated January 2025 but only recently released by the department, does not ponder potential reasons for the dip. The report also does not provide disaggregated data showing enrollment at each of the 131 private schools in the state.
The report does note that most grade levels saw a decrease in enrollment. Only fourth, eighth, seventh and ninth grade level totals increased.
When enrollment data is looked at by county, Washoe saw the biggest decline in private school enrollment — 10.7% or 339 students. One school, St. Nicholas Orthodox Academy in Reno, permanently closed its doors after the 2023-24 academic year, but it enrolled fewer than a dozen students, so its closure does not account for the drop.
The Nevada DOE, through its public information officer, said it had no data or additional information regarding the overall drop in Washoe County.
Washoe County now has 3,402 students enrolled in private schools.
In Clark County, private school enrollment dropped by 76 students, or less than half a percent of its total private school enrollment. Clark County now has 17,869 students enrolled in private schools.
Two private institutions in Las Vegas — St. Anne’s Catholic School and Spring Valley Christian School — shuttered after the 2023-24 academic year.
When it announced its closure in April 2024, St. Anne’s cited “continued diminishing enrollment and tremendous financial challenges,” according to KLAS. The school also blamed a 60% enrollment decline over a decade and the 2019 scaling back of funding to the state’s voucher program, known as Opportunity Scholarships.
St. Anne’s had been open for 70 years. One school leader told the Las Vegas Sun enrollment at the school began sliding in 2007 when Bishop Gorman High School moved from a property adjacent to St. Anne’s to its current Summerlin complex.
Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo held a press conference at St. Anne’s in 2023 to talk about his education agenda, which included massive expansion of Opportunity Scholarships. Democrats, who control both chambers of the state legislature, have drawn a hard line on the issue and have said they are not open to expanding the program, which was established a decade ago when Republicans were in charge of the Legislature and governorship.
Advocates of school voucher programs blamed Democrats for St. Anne’s closure.
 Teacher licensure

In Nevada, there are two classifications of private schools: exempt, which means the school is affiliated with a religious institution, and non-exempt, meaning it is not affiliated with a religious institution.
The majority of private schools are exempt.
Nevada requires secular schools to report the number of full- or part-time teachers and their qualifications. According to the annual report, of the 606 teachers at those private schools: 266 are licensed by the State of Nevada, 77 are licensed by another state, 21 have a master’s degree plus 1 year of experience, and 28 have a bachelor’s degree plus 3 years of experience.
Religious-affiliated schools are required to report the number of full- or part-time teachers but not their qualifications. According to the report, there are 1,371 teachers in those schools.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Schoolchildren-uniforms-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-28 08:00:06.254158

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Supporters of a bill that would force sheriff’s departments to cancel agreements with federal immigration officials said deputies could still enforce the law just as effectively, they would just not be doing so as an extension of federal authorities.
“There are counties that do not have these formal agreements that still cooperate with ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] still honor judicial warrants, still honor containers when they are presented to them,” Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s) said Thursday during testimony for her bill, House Bill 1222.
The bill would prohibit local law enforcement agencies from entering into so-called 287(g) agreements that allow ICE to delegate some federal enforcement authorities to local officers, including the authority to arrest and check a person’s immigration status through a federal database. The bill also requires those departments that have 287(g) agreements to cancel them by July 1.
Six counties — Carroll, Cecil, Frederick, Garrett, Harford and Washington — currently have 287(g) agreements with ICE. Frederick and Harford sheriffs turned up at Thursday’s Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee hearing to defend the program.
“Please allow the local counties to provide public safety as they see fit,” Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler said.
Frederick County Sheriff Chuck Jenkins said his jurisdiction has been part of the 287(g) program since 2008 and “removed 1,795 criminals,” the majority of whom he described as “dangerous” and “violent.”

Gahler noted that since his department signed a 287(g) agreement in 2014, ICE has chosen not to initiate action in 35% of cases there. He also pointed to the popularity of the agreements, citing a January poll by Annapolis-based Gonzales Research & Media that found 76% of people surveyed said they would support requiring local governments to cooperate with federal efforts to enforce immigration laws.
But opponents of the agreements say 287(g) agreements “significantly undermined any trust in law enforcement” in immigrant communities.
“287(g) agreements literally turn local law enforcement into ICE agents,” said Nicholas Katz, general counsel for the nonprofit immigrant-rights organization CASA, based in Prince George’s County.
“In this moment, Black and brown families don’t know if it’s safe to go to work, if its safe to walk their kids to school, if it’s safe to go to the hospital,” Katz said.
Under Williams’ bill, which passed the House 98-38 last week, if federal authorities identify an immigrant who’s been convicted and is being held in a local jail, the local officials would have to give ICE at least 48 hours notice before release of the imate, and would have to turn the immigrant over when federal authoritis arrived.
At Thursday’s hearing, Sen. Chris West (R-Baltimore County) said the sheriffs would continue to do their job protecting the public, but asked if not having the 287(g) program would decrease their public safety work. It would, Gahler said.
“If we lose the ability to have these agreements with ICE, we lose what comes along with it,” Gahler said. “Which is finding out whether these people are indeed in the country illegally, and recommendations from ICE in relation to national security.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Sen. William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery), chair of the committee, said he understood the perspectives from supporters and opponents of the bill. But he acknowledged “there is a distinct fear” under the administration of President Donald Trump (R), who has made an immigration crackdown a key element of his tenure. The 287(g) program began under former President Bill Clinton (D) in the 1990s.
“I guess our policy debate here is centered on the federal prerogatives and their implementation of deportation policy and the existence of 287(g) in Maryland,” Smith said.
“Is that creating such an atmosphere that people are not going to want to cooperate with law enforcement? Live life?” he asked. “Is that something that is beneficial to keeping the 287(g) program or getting rid of it?”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Frederick-County-Sheriff-Chuck-Jenkins-cropped-e1743161650612-1024x761.jpg,,,2025-03-28 08:00:06.254158

(Photo by Adam Gray/Getty Images)Lawyers for a man who is facing deportation after leading pro-Palestinian protests on Columbia University’s campus are set to appear in Newark Friday morning before a federal judge who may decide whether the man’s case should be transferred to Louisiana.
Mahmoud Khalil’s arrest by immigration agents earlier this month and his potential deportation drew swift backlash from student groups, immigration activists, and civil rights attorneys who noted that he is a lawful permanent resident. Khalil was targeted by removal from the United States because of his advocacy against the war in Gaza, they say.
Federal officials, meanwhile, allege Khalil has connections to terrorist organizations and lied on his application for a green card, claims Khalil’s legal team have denied.
Friday’s hearing is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m.
Khalil’s petition to be released was initially heard by a federal judge in Manhattan who moved the case to New Jersey last week, saying Khalil undoubtedly made that petition when he was being detained in Elizabeth (he was later moved to a Louisiana detention center, where he remains). Trump administration attorneys told the New York judge the case should be heard in the western district of Louisiana, an argument they are making again to the judge overseeing the case in New Jersey.
When Joe Biden was president, conservative groups routinely filed lawsuits targeting his administration in the western district of Louisiana as a way of virtually guaranteeing they would be heard by a conservative judge, according to Bloomberg Law. Appeals from that district are heard by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, perhaps the most conservative federal appeals court in the nation.
Khalil’s attorneys say public confidence in the judiciary would be undermined if judges allowed the case to devolve into a “perpetual game of jurisdictional ping-pong” until one side surrenders.
“That rationale applies with even more force in a case like this, involving an unprecedented exercise of executive power that, for two weeks, a detained Petitioner has been challenging as blatantly unconstitutional,” they wrote in a brief filed Monday, one of a flurry of filings both sides have made in the case since it was transferred to New Jersey last week.
Trump administration lawyers are not conceding that Khalil has the power to seek his release (known as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus). But they say the court that should decide that dispute is not New Jersey federal court, but the one in western Louisiana.
“This Court has never had habeas jurisdiction over this matter, because no proper petition has ever been filed in this Court. And it does not have habeas jurisdiction over this matter now, because it neither has jurisdiction over the proper respondent in this action, nor is this district the district of confinement,” they wrote in a brief filed last week.
On March 8, while returning home from dinner with his pregnant wife, Khalil was arrested by plainclothes U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in New York. Khalil, a Syrian native, was detained and transferred from New York to New Jersey to Texas to Louisiana. He has not been charged with any crime.

Eric Koch listens during a meeting on Thursday, March 27, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Legislation setting standards for new, big electricity users — plus, complicating coal-powered closures and benefiting nuclear reactor efforts — drew criticism from utility customer advocates Thursday. Proponents maintained the changes are critical to continued economic growth.
Jonathan Neal, a Lafayette resident, told a Senate committee that the legislation doesn’t protect customers enough. He asserted that regulators have repeatedly “failed” Hoosier customers.
“Like many ratepayers, I don’t have a lot of confidence in the (Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission) to protect the ratepayers,” he said. “… Sometimes it feels like they’re really in the pocket of the utilities and just cover the costs of utility shareholders — and consumers are too busy to complain.”
But Rep. Ed Soliday, the measure’s author, said opponents “want a zero-growth economy.”
  Rep. Ed Soliday speaks before a committee on Thursday, March 27, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
“If you don’t want a growth economy, then vote against the bill,” Soliday, R-Valparaiso, said.
His House Bill 1007 would expedite approval processes for large-load customers like data centers and set out cost recovery mechanisms for projects utilities undertake to serve those big customers. It also would require a big prospective grid addition to make “significant and meaningful financial assurances” for such projects— reimbursing at least 80% of costs and protecting other existing and future customers from the expenses.
“We think it’s fair that they accept 80% of the responsibility. Now, if they build and keep their word, then all they’re doing is buying the electricity they said they want,” Soliday. “But we’ve given about 20% latitude in here, that we think is fair.”
Multiple witnesses feared customers would still take the brunt of costs.
“I’m afraid that there’s too many ways to get around that 80-20 split for those large-load customers, that there’s no guarantee that those customers would actually be paying that,” said Robyn Skuya-Boss, leader of the Sierra Club’s Indiana chapter. “(Maybe) if they could pay those costs upfront, if they could be put into long-term obligation contracts — what if the data center operator or the customer goes bankrupt?”
Advocates for residential and existing industrial ratepayers said the expedited processes didn’t offer them or regulators enough time to review materials and assemble responses.
Citizens Action Coalition Executive Director Kerwin Olson noted that some provisions require regulators to approve a utility plan within 90 or 150 days, and afford it just seven business days or less to deem filings complete. That’s although the utility may have spent months constructing the plan, and it may take stakeholders like Olson’s organization 60 days to “to put a case together, to find funding, to find experts.”
  Indiana Industrial Energy Consumers representative Joseph Rompala testifies in committee on Thursday, March 27, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
“If the commission doesn’t hit that 90-day timeline or that 150-day timeline, guess what? It’s approved (automatically),” Olson continued. “… Why have regulated monopolies when effectively we’ll have unregulated monopolies?
Indiana Industrial Energy Consumers representative Joseph Rompala said that’s a “quick turnaround.” Rompala also litigates on behalf of industrial customers before the IURC.
He said transmission, distribution and storage improvement charges — seven-year plans utilities can bring for those improvements — have a 210-day “clock.”
“While I understand the need for speed to market and … to meet customer demand, we are talking about at least comparably sized investments,” Rompala added. “… Certainly, more time is beneficial.”
But, he said any IURC order — including approval, cost-recovery and any trackers — could be appealed to a higher court.
Koch and Soliday emphasized that they developed the deadlines in collaboration with regulators.
“They said they could do it,” Soliday told the committee.
Scrutinizing transitions from coal
House Bill 1007 also gets tough with utilities planning to close — or convert to natural gas — any coal-fired plants of at least 125 megawatts. Current law — adopted during the 2024 legislative session — mandates utilities that are not generating at least 85% of peak demand to report three-year projections to the IURC.
  Indiana Energy Association leader Danielle McGrath testifies in committee on Thursday, March 27, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
The legislation would instead require all utilities to annually report the amount of resource generating capacity they plan to take offline. If, after an investigation, the IURC doesn’t think a utility can provide reliable service, it would have to block the utility’s plan or order it to either acquire or build capacity.
“That makes the process very empirical. You … can’t just shut them down willy-nilly,” Soliday said.
Indiana Energy Association President Danielle McGrath said the requirements would complement utilities’ existing integrated resource plans, several other required reports and IURC-hosted reliability forums.
“That’s why, in providing this additional information, we stand by our analysis, and we’ll demonstrate how that planned retirement is going to be able to meet the requirements set forth in this bill,” she told lawmakers.
Going nuclear
Other provisions are intended to boost small modular nuclear reactor (SMR) development as electricity demand rises, including a 20% sales tax credit for SMR manufacturers.
Soliday said one such company — which he’d seen represented in the audience — has Indiana “high on the list” for an SMR.
“That factory will be at least 500 jobs, over $100,000 and I’d like to see them here. So, hence the incentive,” he told the committee.
Rolls Royce, which has a major manufacturing footprint in Indiana, is exploring construction of an SMR with a capacity of up to 470 megawatts.
But numerous witnesses complained SMR technology is “experimental” and “unproven.”
The United States hosts no operational SMRs. Across the globe, only China and Russia have functional ones. Some want Indiana to lead, but nuclear development is pricey.
A large part of the legislation would let public utilities ask regulators for permission to spend money on SMRs — and start recovering costs from customers — before getting certificates of public convenience and necessity. The language is identical to Koch’s Senate Enrolled Act 424.
Included are expenditures for design; engineering; environmental analyses and permitting; federal approvals, licensing and permitting; equipment purchases and more. A utility could recover 80% of approved costs under the resulting rate schedule within three years at most. It would defer the remaining 20% for recovery as part of its next general rate case.
Indiana proposal to boost nuclear development, recover costs from customers clears committee

Soliday said the “pay-as-you-go” approach would let utilities take out the debt more cheaply — or avoid bonding at all. He added, “It’s in our favor as consumers to keep that bond rate low or zero.”
Overspending would have to meet additional criteria to get passed onto customers. So would expenditures on canceled or abandoned projects — and a utility wouldn’t earn returns for such failed undertakings unless regulators also find the decision was “prudently made for good cause,” that profit is “appropriate … to avoid harm” to the utility and its customers; and that costs will be offset or reimbursed through other, listed means.
“To have reliability, you can’t have utilities going bankrupt,” Soliday said.
House Bill 1007 advanced on an 8-3 vote. It’s heading to the Senate’s Tax and Fiscal Policy Committee.
“I’m glad that it’s going to be recommitted … because what we really need to be focused on is the fiscal impact,” said Sen. Andrea Hunley, D-Indianapolis.
Debate, she added, isn’t about nuclear’s merits because Indiana legalized SMRs years ago.
“What this bill is talking about is the funding structure for how we’re going to fund small modular reactors. And that’s what I have an issue with — is that we’re doing it on the backs of ratepayers, that we’re doing it in a way that is not fiscally responsible,” Hunley said.

In the small-town schools and rural hospitals. On county roads and at the family reunion. 
We’ve watched our neighbors presume to speak for us, and our elected representatives pretend we don’t exist. And we’re tired of it. 
That’s how we ended up on a bridge across 35W on a recent Friday. Some of us raised pride flags to the wind, some hung the American flag upside down, others held signs for Ukraine or against DOGE. But all of us want a future where we welcome the stranger and are our brothers’ keeper, and a government that works for the people. 
The GOP dismisses us as “paid actors” and “outside agitators.” But that’s baloney and they know it. We are neighbors like:

Mary Kay Brautigan, Pine City: We need affordable, accessible health care, but the GOP is taking a sledge hammer to rural hospitals. They can’t survive without Medicaid and neither can our nursing homes or assisted living facilities. We Boomers need more care, not less. 
Kim Brubaken, Mora: I got into this because of Roe v. Wade, but now I see that’s just a small piece, part of a plan to get rid of the whole middle class and the rights and institutions we rely on. It’s women’s rights now, but then it will be the right to vote and decimating the middle class so that the rich get richer and just leave crumbs for us. 
Cathy Clune, Pine City: Social Security and veterans benefits — those are the easy answers to what we’re fighting for. I’m not retired yet, but I’ll rely on Social Security when I do, and I’ve been paying in since I was 15. That’s my money, fair and square. But what keeps me up at night is watching them strip our Constitution away. Our rights to free speech and to gather and protest are all threatened. When it comes down to it, it’s about losing our country. And I see how close we are.
Nancy Mach, Pine City: I grew up with compromise. They’re totally forgotten now, and that’s sad. So much good government came out of both. 
Kristen Kromer Waxberg, Rush City: I’m a Stage 4 cancer patient. My disability income covers my insurance and prescriptions with only a little left over. With DOGE stopping the funding that Congress directed, there is little hope of new treatments, but lots of threats to our already scarce resources. But what keeps me in the fight is my 24-year-old daughter. I don’t want her to die in a waiting room, bleeding out from an ectopic pregnancy. She does not deserve to have her liberty snatched away from her.

And there are more of us than you think. 
The chaos and hatred of President Trump’s first term pushed us toward each other. In that first term, we would look at the people who taught us to be good Christians and to always set an extra place at the table, and wonder: Where did they go? When we started finding each other in 2020, it was a glimmer of hope. 
Until then, we’d kept silent because we thought we were alone — tiny blue dots on a big red map. But as soon as we started speaking up even a little bit, over and over people thanked us and said, “me too.”  
When one house on a dead-end road put up a sign that says, “We believe in science…,” other supportive signs sprouted up on that road. When one courageous person spoke, it gave others permission.
Every time we can, we invite folks to join us. We engage with Trumpers who aren’t full-on MAGA. You can tell who they are because you know they’re conservative, but they don’t have the hats and flags. Instead, they look at you like “I’m sorry,” but you can tell from their eyes that they feel too far in. 
So we respond with facts. When they fault DEI, we run through the letters. They agree that diversity, equity and inclusion are all good things. So we tell them: “Great, you’re not against DEI.” 
When they say they’re not worried about Medicaid because they’re on Medical Assistance, we let them know it’s the same thing. And we invite them to join us, no matter what they believed before.
In 2016, we’d never even considered having to stand on a bridge or a corner. In 2020, we stood with signs on corners, but were scared of the oversized trucks that would spray us with exhaust, and wouldn’t stand up in our own small towns. 
That recent Friday, though, was different. 
This time, none of us were afraid.

(Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The heat is on Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales. Questionable spending and missteps have, in recent weeks, captured the attention of lawmakers in charge of his budget for the next two years.
Things are adding up, and Republicans known for fiscal conservatism are taking note.
Morales’ office said Thursday he “stands by all the financial decisions the office has made.”
To be clear, some of the information isn’t novel — but seems to have gained new life recently. For instance, the Indianapolis Star broke the news in Feb. 2023 that Morales hired his brother-in-law for a position with a six-figure salary. It isn’t illegal under nepotism laws because in-laws aren’t covered. But optics are another thing altogether.
And in Oct. 2023, the Capital Chronicle first revealed Morales’ liberal use of “spot bonuses.” Indiana executive branch agencies adhere to guidance from the State Personnel Department when it comes to the bonuses, which dictates that awards range from $100 to $1,000 to recognize outstanding performance “on the spot.”
Secretary of State Morales doles out $308K+ in spot bonuses

That year, the Secretary of State’s office doled out 80 bonuses to 68 employees — out of a staff of roughly 75. They ranged from $500 to $12,000, for an average of $4,540 per employee. Nearly a dozen employees received two bonuses from Morales within the 10 months scanned by the Capital Chronicle, and one got two in one month. Morales’ brother-in-law received a total $12,500 from two bonuses.
Morales said the bonuses were needed due to promises made before his tenure for salary adjustments.
Rep. Ed DeLaney seized on these things when questioning Morales during a House Ways and Means budget hearing on Jan. 15. The video has made the rounds on social media.
The Indianapolis Democrat also focused on another Capital Chronicle story about no-bid technology contracts in which the winners then gave campaign contributions to Morales. No-bid contracts are not illegal.
Morales indicated he thought DeLaney’s questions were inappropriate for the setting, replying that “we don’t mix political and official business.”
Sen. Fady Qaddoura, another Indianapolis Democrat, continued the questions in Senate Appropriations on March 18. Only this time, Morales didn’t show up – sending his deputy instead. Lawmakers were told Morales was on economic development trip, according to State Affairs Indiana.
Qaddoura noted it was the second time Morales had missed a meeting before the panel, and that every other elected statewide official showed up.
“It’s not the job of the secretary of state to be traveling for economic development,” he said.

Morales was still on the trip Tuesday when he missed a prayer breakfast for which his office was a sponsor. But he sent his staff to take photos of his table for social media.
Well, it turns out he was in India. That’s according to a post on X from the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce, and a press release issued by Morales on Thursday.
Republicans also took Morales’ office to task.
Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, started with questions on bonuses, leading to a promise that no new bonuses are planned.
Sen. Chris Garten, R-Charlestown, then pointed to paper maps that Morales’ office printed with his name in large, bolded letters.
Staff said less than $15,000 was spent on the maps, which were distributed at the Indiana State Fair and to county offices.
Garten said maps should be printed by the Indiana Department of Transportation.
“I have no idea why we’ve spent any amount of taxpayer money on a road map that nobody knows is a road map because, quite frankly, to me, it looks like a campaign sign,” Garten said. “The biggest thing on here is a name.”
He went on to say Morales’ budget should be decreased by whatever amount was spent on the maps, and dinged the office for overaggressive compliance fines.
That’s not Morales’ only promotional spending, though.
The office previously spent $35,00 to send glossy spiral-bound election security guides to hundreds of election administrators, lawmakers, law enforcement officers and others across the state. They were accompanied by a lanyard and card saying “Blow the Whistle on Election Interference” with Morales’ name. Federal election funds were used.
Morales’ office sent a statement to me on Thursday saying, “The Secretary of State’s Office is committed to its outreach efforts through the distribution of informational materials like papers, pamphlets, and brochures. Featuring the elected official’s name on the materials fosters trust and accountability, much like the annual mail sent by members of the Indiana General Assembly to their constituents.”
It added that the office returned $400, 000 to the General Fund at the end of fiscal year 2024. The office is currently on track to return a similar amount to the state at the end of the current fiscal year.
“It’s not unusual for questions to arise in legislative committee hearings that require research and follow up. We appreciate thoughtful questions from legislators about any aspect of our budget and operations and respond as promptly as possible,” the statement said.
It remains to be seen whether another Republican will step up to challenge Morales in 2026. He was chosen at a party nominating convention over sitting Secretary of State Holli Sullivan in 2022. GOP delegates voted against Sullivan, who then-Gov. Eric Holcomb had appointed into the role — as a revolt against him and his pandemic-era policies.
I wonder if they are now regretting that decision.

A Senate-approved bill on parental rights is still pending in the House, setting up a situation where the two related sets of issues are on track to be handled with separate pieces of legislation.
The Senate Early Learning and K-12 Education Committee passed the amended version of House Bill 1296 on a party-line vote.
Sen. Claire Wilson, D-Auburn, put forward the amendment that removed the language about parental rights, and said it was part of a strategy to keep the bills moving forward to address some of the issues involved before the session ends on April 27. 
“It’s keeping all doors open and all windows open so we can make sure something ends on the other side,” Wilson said.
Rep. Monica Stonier, D-Vancouver, sponsor of the House bill, said that she would have rather not seen this language removed from the bill, but that the end goal is still the same: to have policies covering students’ rights and parental rights. 
“There’s nothing in my mind that doesn’t allow for students’ rights to exist concurrently with parental rights, I don’t see any conflict there,” Stonier said. 
Examples of students’ rights included in HB 1296 include the right to learn in a safe, supportive learning environment, free from harassment, intimidation, or bullying; to receive copies of all school policies and procedures related to students; and to access academic courses and instructional materials with historically and scientifically accurate information.
Wilson’s rewrite also added language from another bill she sponsored, Senate Bill 5179, which is about reporting complaints to the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction when certain policies are not followed by schools. 
The parental and students’ rights legislation now under discussion is tied to a citizen initiative lawmakers approved last year.
That measure, Initiative 2081, called for public school materials, such as textbooks, curriculum and a child’s medical records, to be easily available for review by parents. It also sought to clear the way for parents to opt their child out of assignments and other activities involving questions about the student’s sexual experiences or their family’s religious beliefs.
Democrats said when Initiative 2081 was approved, they would likely need to clean up some of the language to align with other state and federal laws. 
But Republicans argue that Democrats are now trying to roll back rights granted to parents in the initiative. Mixed into the debate are arguments over gender and transgender issues in schools.
“This bill continues the war against parents’ rights and puts girls at risk at schools,” said Sen. Jim McCune, R-Graham. 
Senate Bill 5181, the Senate bill on parental rights, is scheduled for a possible committee vote on March 31 in the House Education Committee.

Minnesota is at a critical moment. The state’s commitment to supporting people with disabilities is at a crossroads. 
Gov. Tim Walz’s proposed budget includes an array of cuts to disability waiver services, notably to the inflationary adjustment for service providers. 
This threatens to undo years of progress.  
These cuts — from an 11% adjustment increase in 2026 to just 2% — are not mere numbers on a spreadsheet. They represent a threat to the quality and accessibility of disability services across Minnesota and serve as a blow to an already reeling workforce that provides these life-saving services. The impacts of these budget targets may be greater than the governor is anticipating. 
Of chief importance are the impacts these cuts will have on the workforce that underpins disability services. These professionals, who are primarily women and people of color, are paid low wages as it stands, especially as inflation impacts every Minnesotan’s purchasing power. Reducing the inflationary adjustment to 2% every two years ensures their pay will fall further behind increasing costs. As a result, this field’s vacant positions will become increasingly uncompetitive to new workers and existing workers will leave in search of better pay. 
We frequently hear from direct care workers: “I love this work, but I can’t afford to keep doing it.” Now, under the governor’s proposed budget, that refrain will only grow louder. Low pay and rising costs will drive workers away, increasing turnover and further straining already limited resources. 
While we hear the governor’s optimism that these budgetary adjustments will not impede the quality of care, or the number of people served, in no other industry could one expect such a large cut to not affect the work. To ask an industry that already stretches its resources to its limits to absorb this cut will result in serious consequences for those receiving care.
The ripple effects of these cuts will not stop with workers. Those receiving services and their families will bear the brunt of this proposal. Strained support networks created from these cuts will leave families with fewer resources to care for their loved ones, forcing them to shoulder an even greater responsibility. Potential facility closures will mean that those receiving care may not have the opportunity to live near their loved ones, to live in the place they desire, or to receive the care that best meets their needs.  
The governor and the Legislature must grapple with challenging questions this session about how to meet Minnesota’s needs within the realities of the state’s budget. It’s imperative these decisions prioritize the dignity and well-being of Minnesota’s many people who live with a disability and the workers who support them.
My final message is this: Legislators, I encourage you to see the faces behind the numbers. Disability services are people in our community, friends, and family members. I know you care deeply about equity and progress. I know you see an indispensable workforce for what it is. These values are at stake in this budget cycle, and we need you to balance it with the same compassion that we have come to expect from Minnesota. 
We are a state that has long prided itself on being a leader in giving everyone a fair shot at living a fulfilled life. It’s time for us to invest in those values. 
A reevaluation is needed, one with the outstanding legal and moral obligations to care for people living with disabilities.

A case report the Examiner received from the Brown County Sheriff’s Office shows Vogel had  a history of racist and threatening behavior.
After Laureano died in late August at Green Bay Correctional Institution (GBCI), Vogel was charged with homicide with hate crime and repeat offender penalties, the Examiner reported. 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Micah Laureano’s mother, Phyllis Laureano, has sued Secretary Jared Hoy and GBCI warden Christopher Stevens of the Wisconsin Department of Corrections. The federal civil rights lawsuit alleges “defendants’ willful and deliberate indifference to Mr. Laureano’s safety” resulted in the murder. 
The sheriff’s office said the suspect and victim had occupied the same cell for only hours before the incident. The statement said the medical examiner’s findings confirmed Laureano died of strangulation/suffocation by manner of homicide. 
Beth Hardtke, communications director for the Wisconsin Department of Corrections, said both individuals involved in the incident were in temporary lockup status. 
Before Laureano’s death, Vogel, 25, had been found guilty of attempted first-degree intentional homicide, the Examiner reported in late August. Laureano, 19, had been found guilty of taking and driving a vehicle without consent and as party to a crime for substantial battery intending bodily harm, robbery with use of force and first-degree recklessly endangering safety.
Conduct reports
A narrative in a Brown County Sheriff’s Office case report described information from a few conduct reports Vogel received. The Examiner received the report last year through an open records request.
Sergeant Justin Raska reviewed conduct reports for Laureano and Vogel, according to the case report. He found nothing relevant in Laureano’s reports but wrote about three of Vogel’s infractions. 
The first report Raska described was dated March 5, 2024, and was completed by a staff member at the Racine Youthful Offender Correctional Facility (RYOCF). The staff had received inmate complaint forms filed by Vogel that “contained obscene, profane, abusive and threatening language,” some of which was written in German, according to the description of the incident. 
The complaints included swastika symbols. According to the report, Vogel’s writing included the words “you all need and deserve Death!” and “White Power (WLM).” He voiced support for Adolf Hitler and the Aryan Brotherhood, a white supremacist gang.
A second conduct report was dated March 6, 2024, according to Raska. A lieutenant received interview request forms from Vogel, which were written to several staff members at RYOCF and made “numerous disrespectful racial remarks.” 
The request forms included “several inappropriate remarks and symbols,” such as SS Bolts and “das Endlosung.” This referenced Hitler’s “Final Solution” of mass murder of Jewish people, according to the report. 
The third conduct report described by Raska was completed by a sergeant at GBCI and dated August 27, 2024, the day of Laureano’s death.
Incarcerated people were removed from a cell so that maintenance could fix a clogged sink, according to the report. Unit staff discovered the wooden bulletin board was broken, and the sergeant heard from unit staff that Vogel admitted to breaking the board because he was bored.
The bulletin board had jagged edges and it was unsafe to house incarcerated people in the cell, according to the report. This might have led to Vogel being housed in a different cell, with Laureano.
Laureano and Vogel’s cell was in a “segregated Treatment Center area,” according to a narrative in the case report by Raska.
Raska said he was told “the Treatment Center block” serves as a “step unit” to bridge the gap between restricted housing and general population housing. Restricted housing includes disciplinary separation — which occurs when an incarcerated person commits a violation. 
Raska said the treatment center serves as an alternative to single cell segregation in the restricted housing unit. He said incarcerated people could be housed in the treatment center due to clinical observation or because of a pending investigation. 
Lawsuit alleges ‘deliberate indifference’

Laureano’s lawsuit contains three Eighth Amendment counts. It alleges deliberate indifference to Laureano’s safety, failure to protect Laureano and failure to train subordinates. The lawsuit does not mention Vogel’s conduct reports or the racist statements mentioned in them.
The lawsuit alleges that the defendants didn’t consider and/or willfully ignored Vogel’s “substantial history of violent assault, mental health issues, and multi-decade length of sentence when assessing his compatibility with Mr. Laureano,” who was serving a lesser sentence of three years.
It also alleges that defendants failed to “adequately train, monitor and supervise GBCI staff” to make sure administrative requirements and protocols were being followed during housing decisions. 
Phyllis Laureano is represented by attorney Lonnie Story, who said he has spoken to incarcerated people who might be deposed prior to a trial. 
“It was very apparent to the inmates, as well as what — from what they communicate to me about staff, it would be kind of hard to deny by anyone… to say there was no knowledge of Mr. Vogel being a racist, and expressing other very negative opinions and ideas outside of just the race factor,” Story said, adding that this applied to sexual orientation.  
On Sept. 10, the Examiner made an open records request to the DOC, requesting reports regarding incidents involving Vogel and/or Laureano. The request’s status is “in progress” in the DOC’s open records request portal. 
Beth Hardtke, the communications director for the DOC, said it’s the DOC’s practice not to comment on cases where there is ongoing litigation.

House Bill 937 would force schools to create speech codes based on a widely criticized definition of antisemitism. Bill supporters talk about Jewish safety, but their real goal is to shield Israel from criticism as it commits unconscionable atrocities against Palestinian people.
If adopted, Missouri educational institutions would be required to add the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s controversial definition of the term into codes of conduct as a basis for investigating suspected acts of antisemitism. Alarmingly, this includes so-called “contemporary examples” of antisemitism, most involving criticism of Israel.
Under this bill, the discussion of Palestinians’ experiences, academic findings critical of Israel’s government or even quotes from Israelis that condemn their nation’s actions could all be considered “prohibited conduct as it relates specifically to antisemitism.” They could lead to student suspensions and loss of scholarships, faculty denial of tenure or firing, loss of research funding or defunding student organizations — all while doing nothing to make Jewish communities safer, as the bill claims to do.
Israeli officials and their supporters want to silence opposition and keep the U.S. public ignorant to what the International Court of Justice is investigating as genocide against the Palestinian people. Israeli military forces have killed more than 50,000 Palestinians since October 2023, according to the Gaza health ministry. That’s most certainly a vast undercount.
This is why Amnesty International says that Israel is committing genocide and why the International Criminal Court in November issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Foreign Minister Yoav Gallant.
If passed, the bill will stifle basic academic freedom on the subject of Israel and Palestine – exacerbating an already alarming trend. After adopting the IHRA definition, Florida began tracking and banning course syllabuses that were particularly critical of Israel. At the University of Minnesota, a Holocaust historian’s job offer was rescinded over his criticism of Israel. At New York University, Jewish professors were barred from campus for protesting the Israeli government’s violence in Gaza.
Among other criteria, the bill would ban calling the Israel a “racist endeavor” and comparing any actions of Israel to Nazi Germany.
In a recent article in Haaretz, one of Israel’s most respected newspapers, an Israeli soldier said about his experience in Gaza: ‘I felt like, like, like a Nazi … it looked exactly like we were actually the Nazis and they were the Jews.” Under the IHRA definition of antisemitism, quoting that soldier could be considered a punishable offense.
This kind of speech code is applied to no other country. If you want to, you can call the existence of the People’s Republic of China or Canada or Iran or even the United States a “racist endeavor.” You can compare these countries’ behavior to Nazis. With the passage of House Bill 937, only Israel would be protected from this type of criticism.
Like millions of people raised Jewish in America, I grew up believing that Israel was a model democracy, opposed and hated for no reason except irrational hatred towards Jews.
Then I traveled throughout Israel, Gaza and the West Bank. I witnessed a political system run by Israel that reminded me of the histories I learned in school about the Jim Crow south. I saw the segregated roads, the segregated communities, the segregated access to water, land and resources.
Palestinians and Jews, separate and unequal.
I that knew it was wrong; I saw that what I had been taught were lies and I knew I had to do something to oppose this injustice perpetuated in my name.
Even though supporters sell House Bill 937 in the name of protecting Jews on campus, Jews critical of Israel would also face sanction from its passage. This is one of the reasons many Missouri Jews, including myself, testified against the bill.
The real purpose of the bill is to make students and faculty constantly second guess themselves whenever they speak or write about Israel, wondering if they will be punished and if their words will fall outside of the boundaries put in place by the government.
This bill was sponsored by a Republican legislator and passed out of committee with Republican support. For years conservatives have railed against speech codes on campuses, when the codes were designed to prevent the sharing of potentially racist, misogynistic or homophobic ideas. They labeled as coddled snowflakes those who ask to be shielded from thoughts and ideas that might make them uncomfortable.
This bill makes a mockery of their professed concerns. Those who support it cite the discomfort of some Jewish supporters of Israel as an excuse to censor students and faculty, in order to protect a foreign state from criticism.
In recent days the Israeli military has killed hundreds of Palestinian children in Gaza who were trying to survive in tents and the rubble of their bombed-out homes. People are correctly speaking out about Israel’s atrocities.
Israel and its supporters know they are losing the argument with more and more Americans, so they are working to make it harder to speak up. We can’t allow them to abridge our First Amendment rights.

In partnership with the Western States Center, a nonpartisan organization, Idaho business owners created a guide called “Safeguarding Arts & Culture Spaces: A Pro-Democracy Guide for Idaho Venues.” The guide is available on the Western States Center’s website, and it provides guidance to business owners interested in hosting events that may attract controversy about how to prevent harassment and respond to threats. 
As public spaces in Idaho face increasing intimidation and harassment, the guide is a timely way to discuss the power of arts and culture spaces, Western States Center Executive Director Amy Herzfeld-Copple told the Idaho Capital Sun. In recent months, Idaho has received national attention over incidents related to free speech and inclusivity, such as when a North Idaho woman in February was forcibly removed from a local town hall and when earlier this month a West Ada teacher was asked to remove an “everybody is welcome” sign. 
Lawmakers have also tried to limit access to pride events, such as through House Bill 230, which would restrict youth from attending events with “indecent sexual exhibitions,” such as public drag shows at pride events. Despite these challenges, Andrea Marcoccio, the owner of Matchwood Brewing in Sandpoint and coauthor of the guide, said venue spaces can still serve as safe and inclusive spaces. 
“We have an expansive patio that is always full and bustling when the weather is nice, and it tends to attract community requests and needs for gathering, including the Sandpoint Pride Festival, Oktoberfest and SantaCon,” she said. “We do a lot of really great gatherings, some of them intentional about inclusivity, and some of them about just getting people out of their homes and off their phones to get together and have fun.”

Marcoccio said the guide will help business owners who perhaps have tried to hold an event but received pushback, and it will offer a network of other business owners who have held similar events. 
 Idaho business owners to discuss strategies to ensure safety, inclusivity in events

Along with Marcoccio, the guide was developed by Idaho venue owners from Bonners Ferry, Coeur d’Alene and Boise. 
This includes leadership from Treefort Music Festival, which is hosting a panel discussion about the guide for venue owners. 
“Our music venues and cultural spaces are the heart of our communities,” Eric Gilbert, the CEO of Duck Club Entertainment and director of Treefort Music Fest said. “This initiative is about ensuring that Idaho remains safe and welcoming for all.”
Those involved in the project will discuss strategies during a panel at Treefort Music Festival at 11 a.m. Saturday at Boise Centre East, room 420A. 
Earlier this week, Marcoccio said a young person thanked her for hosting inclusive events. That individual was born and raised in Sandpoint, and they recently moved back to town after seeing welcoming events.
“There’s always good that comes out from hosting those events,” Marcoccio said.

Late last year, the hospitals  released their report on the health needs of Dane County.
Federal law requires nonprofit health care providers to file such a  document every three years. The December report covered reproductive care, chronic illness, mental health and substance abuse, along with special sections about health concerns for children and youth as well as the elderly.
But in 63 pages, the report included no discussion of how the cost of care and medical debt have burdened people without money and hampered their access to the health care system.

For Bobby Peterson, that was a glaring omission — and on Thursday, Peterson and ABC for Health, the firm he founded and directs, filed a complaint with the IRS, charging the report doesn’t live up to the federal law’s requirement for a Community Health Heeds Assessment (CHNA).
ABC for Health focuses on health care access along with helping people overcome or avoid medical debt.
The organization’s complaint argues that failing to address that issue in the Dane County health needs document violates the collective responsibility of UW Health and the other three nonprofit hospital systems that produced it.
“Their insistence to exclude medical debt from consideration during the CHNA betrays many principles and requirements of non-profit hospitals,” the complaint states. “We maintain that UW Health’s intentional indifference towards the medical debt epidemic stems from a value for their own revenue at the expense of their community. That value is at odds with UW Health’s duty towards its community.”
Sara Benzel, media relations manager for UW Health, defended the report Thursday as well as the hospital system’s handling of medical debt.
“UW Health stands behind the priorities identified in the community health needs assessment process,” Benzel told the Wisconsin Examiner in an email message.
“Regarding the UW Health Financial Assistance Policy, we are proud of the work we do every day to make this support accessible, and the work we have done to simplify the process and lower barriers to accessing financial support.”
She said the hospital system’s financial assistance program is posted online in English and Spanish.
“The application has been simplified over the years using an equity lens, requires minimal supporting documents, and goes up to 600% of the federal poverty level, well above others in the state,” Benzel said.
Medical debt critic
ABC for Health has been a longstanding critic of hospitals’ handling of medical debt and has published several reports finding fault with how hospital systems address the problem of patients unable to pay their health care bills.
While hospitals have programs for financial help when a patient has no insurance and can’t afford to pay out of pocket, ABC has argued those programs are too often needlessly complex. The organization also contends that hospitals’ financial counselors don’t take actions that could circumvent a problem — such as helping patients enroll in Medicaid if they qualify.
The requirement for a Community Health Heeds Assessment is a little-noticed provision in the 2010 Affordable Care Act — the legislation nicknamed Obamacare that has helped drive down the numbers of uninsured Americans since its passage 15 years ago. Nonprofit health care systems must  produce a CHNA report for their communities every three years.
“The IRS is regulating this because they are looking at their tax-exempt status,” Peterson said Thursday. “And to be a tax-exempt organization, to be able to step away from all the property tax requirements that many of us face, they have a responsibility then to give back.”
He sees a hospital’s approach to medical debt as a direct measure of how they give back.
“They have a community benefit that they need to provide, and part of that benefit is making sure that they’re providing enough charity care and services to the vulnerable in a community,” Peterson said.
The 2025-2027 CHNA report, like several previous editions, was the work of Healthy Dane Collaborative, a coalition of the county’s four hospital systems: Unity Point-Meriter, SSM Health-St. Mary’s Hospital, Stoughton Health and UW Health. The report’s drafters conducted a survey, collected and analyzed data, met with a variety of community organizations and held focus groups
The final report included discussions of health care disparities by race, income and gender. It called attention to the health care needs of the LGBTQ and immigrant communities, including undocumented migrants.
Early on, the text of the report emphasized concern for health equity — “ensuring fair distribution of health resources, outcomes, and opportunities across different communities.”
Seeking a voice
At an ABC for Health symposium Thursday on Medicaid and health care access, Peterson said the report’s priorities were “good things” and were all important.
“But what we wanted to see was access to health care coverage,” Peterson said, along with a discussion about improving financial assistance policies and better coordination among providers. “It wasn’t there. That’s not part of what they wanted to give out to the community.”
Peterson said ABC started reaching out more than a year and a half ago to offer input for the CHNA report.
“We wanted to make sure that the people that are in the planning process understand what the access to health care coverage needs are, what the barriers in the financial assistance process are, and how can we make it better. What can we do to improve that process?” Peterson said.
“We thought this is a real opportunity for us to make sure that all these issues that we see every day can be put up in this Community Health Needs Assessment process,” he added. “We wanted our voice and the voice of our clients to be heard.”
The IRS complaint includes email messages ABC Health sent various people about the assessment process starting in mid-2023.
In a message Aug. 13, 2024, Peterson told Adrian Jones, UW Health Director of Community Health Improvement, “ABC remains eager to engage in Dane County’s 2024 CHNA process.”
The message asked for updates on the CHNA “process and timeline” and mentioned that ABC for Health was “preparing a report with recommendations to provide input, from the perspective of our clients, to inform Dane County’s CHNA process.”
In her Aug. 14 reply, Jones invited Peterson to “share your report with us.” She wrote that “we have also held our own community input sessions and survey and have analyzed a lot of quantitative and qualitative data.”
Peterson followed up with an email Aug. 16 that included a half-dozen questions about the data being collected, when and where community meetings had been conducted, whether more community meetings were planned and the timeline for completing the assessment document.
“ABC for Health is eager to continue engagement with the Dane County CHNA process,” Peterson wrote. “Please keep us posted about future community input sessions and meetings.”
Correspondence ends
There was no further response, and “the Dane County hospitals quietly released the CHNA report in late 2024, without ABC’s input that we maintain failed to take into account the perspective of the many communities we represent,” the complaint to the IRS states.
“Unsurprisingly, this report ignored access to health care coverage issues. The report lacks any recommendations to improve financial assistance policies, practices, and processes to equitably serve populations negatively affected by health disparities. It fails to address the impact of medical debt on Dane County patients,” the complaint states.
“It lacks broad community input and instead reflects a hospital-driven marketing piece that ignores and sidesteps Affordable Care Act requirements. ABC was largely shunned despite our multiple efforts over the past 2 years to provide client-based input.”
ABC for Health released its report shortly after Peterson learned that the CNHA report was published. Its critique was unsparing.
“Dane County hospitals must do more to justify extensive tax breaks and better serve patients impacted by health disparities,” the report states. “In 2023, Dane County hospitals spent an average of only 0.7% of their gross patient revenues on charity care. The national average is 2.3%.”
ABC for Health bases its calculations for Dane County charity care on Wisconsin Hospital Association data, and the national average on a 2022 Wall Street Journal report.
Peterson sent a letter reiterating ABC for Health’s concerns and the organization’s complaint about its lack of input in the CNHA report to UW Health’s CEO, Alan Kaplan, in January. He said there was no response.
ABC for Health also invited Kaplan and other hospital leaders to the ABC for Health event Thursday. The invitations were ignored or declined, Peterson said.

“One of the hardest parts about being stillbirth parents is that you feel this love for your child, but nobody can see that because they’re not here,” Jessica Brady Reader, a Kensington resident, said after a hearing Thursday on Senate Bill 414.
“And so from a symbolic standpoint, this bill is very important, I think, for giving families that satisfaction — that their child counted,” she said.
The bill, sponsored by Sen. Jeff Waldstreicher (D-Montgomery), would create a one-time $1,000 tax credit for families of a stillborn child to help offset the unexpected medical and funeral costs that families endure.
Those financial burdens add to the costs invested in preparing their home for the arrival of their newborn – a day that, for those families, did not come.
“Giving birth to a stillborn baby is one of the most traumatic things a mother can go through. And of course it impacts the entire family as well,” Waldstreicher told the Ways and Means Committee Thursday.

SB414 received unanimous support in the Senate earlier this month. With a fiscal note of some $360,000 annually — a drop in the state’s $67 billion budget bucket — Waldstreicher hopes the House will move the legislation as well.
“That trauma is compounded by financial impacts,” he testified. “In preparing for a live birth, they prepare the nursery — buy the crib, buy a car seat, stock up on clothing and diapers. And of course, the financial costs don’t end there. Suddenly, there are funeral costs – the service, the casket and the burial plot.”
That’s what Reader experienced in 2021. She was nearly 38-weeks pregnant when she lost her daughter, Francesca.
“Nothing could prepare us for the devastation of coming home from the hospital without our baby, or that year of firsts as we grieved our precious daughter,” she told the committee. “We needed to make arrangements in a matter of days, while I was postpartum and recovering from birth.
“A thousand dollars of unexpected expenses is crushing. So when Tax Day came, and it felt like nothing about Francesca counted, I felt yet another low point,” she said.
Lauren Petit, who lives just outside Annapolis, shared a similar story in her testimony. She and her husband were “bombarded with information and forced to make rapid, heartbreaking decisions” about funeral arrangements after losing their daughter when Petit was 20-weeks pregnant in 2020.
“We had to decide what to do with Ava’s remains,” she said. “Could we afford a funeral? Would we want one? Would we need grief counseling? These were unimaginable choices for grieving parents to make in such a short time. Fortunately, may husband and I had the resources … but not every family is as fortunate.”
Petit has testified for the legislation before. In 2022, she came before the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee with then-Sen. Sarah Elfreth (D-Anne Arundel), who was sponsoring the bill at the time. Petit relayed the same story then, with the pain of her stillbirth just two years old.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXIt was the same year the General Assembly was considering what would ultimately become a ballot question to add reproductive rights to the Maryland Constitution. Waldstreicher believes that the political climate then may have contributed to why the stillbirth tax credit bill stalled in 2022.
“That year was a complicated year, because we were dealing with unrelated issues that could accidentally be conflated with this bill,” he said. “And I think some people conflated issues — perhaps some people wanted to conflate issues — but we don’t have that issue this year.
“I think this bill is now standing on its own and people understand, from both the Republican and Democratic perspectives, that it should move forward,” Waldstreicher said.
If it becomes law, Petit and Reader hope the measure inspires more attention, funding and research into the issue of stillbirth in the state.
According to 2021 data from the Star Legacy Foundation, about half of stillborn cases in Maryland do not cite a cause of death. That was the case for Reader, who said “it’s deeply painful for the parents who want to understand why there was this loss.”
“And it’s quite frustrating because we could and should … dedicate more research into the prevention side, which includes doing research as to what causes stillbirth, what are some of the co-occurring conditions that can arise, and how can we treat those better.” she said.
“This tax credit is … an important moment to recognize that there is so much work that still needs to be done about stillbirth,” Reader said. “It is so important that this issue is receiving attention through our legislation.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DSC02217-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-28 06:59:05.775198

But the federal government is not as simple as those Republican presidents or their latest hatchetmen claim.  Truth is it’s much more like a web intricately interwoven with state and local governments.  So when you start whacking the strands, the entire structure becomes unstable, ceases to function, and might well collapse — quite the opposite of the “make government more efficient” or “get government out of the way” lines government-hating politicians love to spew.
When the St. Mary’s Milk River pipeline catastrophically failed last year, leaving Montana’s entire Hi-Line facing a growing season with no irrigation water, those farmers and ranchers surely weren’t howling to “getting government out of the way.”  Simply put, the irrigators who use that water to make their living can not and will not come up with the $80 million or more the repairs will cost. 
So who did they turn to, and who actually has the ability to provide the considerable funding necessary to repair the blowout?  Yep, the federal government.  And of course the same goes for natural disasters and infrastructure failures nationwide.  When you’re standing in the rubble of your flooded, blown apart, or burned down home, somehow hating the federal government isn’t the first thing that likely comes to mind.
Out of the entire nation, Montana is number two in the recipient of federal funds as part of the state budget — a whopping 43 percent of the state’s total government expenditures.  Back in February this column raised the very real question of how the Legislature is going to meet Montana’s constitutional mandate to produce a balanced budget if the amount of federal funds the state will receive cannot be guaranteed.
That question has not been answered as the Legislature heads into its last month in session.  The general expectation is that there will likely be a series of special legislative sessions called to somehow deal with the federal funds that have been cut.  Our all-Republican Congressional delegation doesn’t seem to have any answers on how this is all going to shake out either…not that anyone would know since they’re mighty gun shy of town halls these days.   
Fact is: Special legislative sessions are no way to run a state.  Why?  Because much like our benighted Congressional delegation, special sessions basically leave the public out of the discussion.  They are generally very short, a couple days or a week — and they move quickly. So by the time the public might even get an idea of what’s going on it’s too late to voice our opinion to those who are supposed to be representing “we, the people.” 
The government haters might hail the tens of thousands of federal employees, 2,000 of which are in Montana, that have been or expected to be cut.  But if you’ve tried to contact a federal government agency for something you want or need since the hatchet job began, you might have a different opinion.  Please hold…for eternity.
“You don’t miss the water ’til the well runs dry” seems a particularly apt warning these days as more federal taps go dry every week.  The good news?  People are increasingly fighting back as the vast interconnected web of federal, state, and local government continues to unravel — and the personal impacts increase.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Online-Service-Not-Available-1024x247.jpg,,,2025-03-28 06:59:05.775198

Wes Moore said the fiscal 2026 budget needs to give a tax break to middle-class taxpayers, but he sidestepped questions on whether the plan currently steaming through the legislature provides meaningful relief.","Gov. Wes Moore (D).  (File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore said the fiscal 2026 budget needs to give a tax break to middle-class taxpayers, but he sidestepped questions on whether the plan currently steaming through the legislature provides meaningful relief.
Lawmakers have just over a week to finalize a $67 billion spending plan that includes $2 billion in cuts and $1 billion in new taxes. The plan includes meager – on average — income tax cuts for most individuals while raising taxes in a range of other areas.
“While we are working through all the final details, I’m very clear about what I want the conclusion to be, right?” Moore told a gathering of reporters Friday. “The conclusion is the middle class needs to get a tax cut, that we’ve got to give more breathing room to middle class, more than this currently, across the board. We’ve got to make sure that the middle class are getting more financial support, right?”
Lawmakers are racing against the clock to finish the budget by April 7, the last day of the 2025 session.
The House on Wednesday passed its version of the budget, and the Senate is expected to begin debate Monday, with an eye toward finalizing its work by midweek. That will allow lawmakers to go to a conference committee to work out their differences and have a final budget by April 7.
During the conference committee meeting, lawmakers are expecting a second supplemental budget from Moore that includes nearly $100 million in additional cuts the legislature asked the governor to make.
When asked to reconcile the $1 billion in new taxes in the House and Senate versions of the budget with his “North Star” priority of bringing  economic relief to the middle class, Moore focused on income tax relief.
Democratic majority muscles spending, tax plan through preliminary vote

“And so, when I hear things like, you know, who are we fighting for? The answer is pretty clear,” Moore said. “We’re fighting for middle-class families, and we’re fighting to make sure the middle-class families and working families can get a little extra financial breathing room.”
Moore repeatedly pointed to his tax plan — which was watered down by the General Assembly.
The plan, as it stands, will provide a meager tax cut to some middle-class taxpayers. An estimated 94% of taxpayers would pay less or see no change in their state income taxes under the plan while so-called high earners, those earning $500,000 or more, would pay more after being shuffled into two newly created tax brackets.
The House plan also eliminated Moore’s proposed corporate tax cut. The governor proposed lowering the rate from 8.25% to 7.99% in two years, contingent on the adoption of combined corporate income tax reporting. The House adopted combined reporting, but nixed the rate reduction.
“I think it’s necessary, and I think that it actually coincides with so many of the other things that we are doing to make Maryland more economically competitive,” Moore said in a separate meeting Friday with broadcast reporters. Audio from that meeting was shared with Maryland Matters by Fox45.
Republicans said the income tax cut is not significant and is ultimately gobbled up by other tax and fee increases in the budget.
For those who get a tax break, the average amount would run between $50 and $60, about one-third of what was in Moore’s January budget proposal.
But the budget also contains a number of tax increases including a tax on IT and data services that will hit consumers and businesses alike. Other new taxes include a 6% sales tax on vending machine purchases, a tax on rental cars, an increase in the sales tax on car sales and faster implementation of higher vehicle registration fees passed in 2024.
“We think it’s still a net more than it is a net less for taxpayers,” said Senate Minority Leader Sen. Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore). “He’s only looking at one side of the ledger and saying we reduced personal income tax rates here, rather than acknowledging that they’ve raised taxes and fees on the other side.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Senate Budget and Taxation Chair Sen. Guy Guzzone (D-Howard) cast doubt on any late attempts to increase the size of a tax cut in the final days of the session, however.
“The budget is very tight,” he said.
Moore is also taking heat from some quarters over the services sales tax. The $500 million that will be raised by the data and IT services tax is part of an effort to offset part of a $3 billion deficit in the coming fiscal year.
Moore did not propose the tax, and had hinted at a veto if it affected businesses only. But a deal announced last week with Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) and House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) said the tax would be levied on both businesses and consumers.
Del. Mark Fisher (R-St. Mary’s) Wednesday had a message for businesses.
“Don’t move into Maryland, and if you have a small business or a medium-sized business, get out of Maryland now,” Fisher said during House debate on the budget. “The Democrat Party sees you as an ATM machine, and they will never stop until such time as they have the perfect socialist government that will then collapse upon itself, because there is no revenue left.”
Moore, in his meeting with broadcast reporters Friday, called the comments “embarrassing and disappointing,” and called on Fisher to apologize to Marylanders and residents of Calvert County.
“This is what people hate about politics, that you’re willing to root against your hometown for political purposes, for click bait,” Moore told the broadcast reporters.
“I just think it’s embarrassing for him, and frankly, if he doesn’t believe in the state, if he doesn’t believe in his constituents, if he doesn’t believe in the democratic process and in having open debates, then I don’t know why you are in a seat … because the Marylanders I know, they believe in Maryland. They root for Maryland, and they want to support Maryland,” he said.
When asked for comment Thursday, Fisher shared a link to a video he posted on social media.
“Why do people want to leave, Wes Moore?” Fisher asked in the video. “They want to leave because all they see is it being harder and harder to live in Maryland.”

Concerns are not coming strictly from Republicans.
Del. Brian M. Crosby (D-St. Mary’s) is not only the vice chair of the House Economic Matters Committee, he’s also a military veteran and a small business owner involved in defense industry IT contracts.
He checks a number of boxes when it comes to Moore’s priorities and North Star values, including being a veteran and a small-business owner in the technology industry.
Last week, Crosby moved much of his physical business out of Maryland. He plans to reincorporate in Georgia, where he has a warehouse, to avoid the tech tax in the budget, which he said would bankrupt his business.
Moore, when asked about the move, insisted Crosby’s business remains “a Maryland business.”
“We’re making historic investments in the business community, and also in industries like the one that Brian is a part of,” Moore told print and radio reporters. “So, I know that we have worked with the business community. We have worked with individual Marylanders, and we know this is a deeply responsible budget that we’ve landed on, and one that we think that the people of the state will appreciate.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DSC_0377-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-03-28 06:59:05.775198

(Chris Vinn for Louisiana Illuminator)LAKE CHARLES — Sheriff’s deputies accompanied Federal Emergency Management Agency workers to Terra Hillman’s fenced-in property Jan. 29. They were there to remove the camper she’s lived in since Hurricane Laura plowed through her home in August 2020.
Hillman’s is one of three households in Calcasieu Parish who still need temporary shelter as they struggle to rebuild after the historic 2020 hurricane season. Their personal stories reveal gaps that remain in the disaster recovery process, even as the area sees a boom in multifamily housing construction.
FEMA set a Feb. 28 deadline to remove the remaining trailers from Calcasieu Parish, though the agency did not respond to questions about why it went to Hillman’s property a month early.
When FEMA arrived at her property, Hillman entered her damaged house and would not speak with officials except to request they leave. About an hour later, they left without taking the temporary trailer. 
Damage to Hillman’s home has made it difficult for her to repair. Her insurance company initially paid to repair her roof but denied the rest of her damage claims, including home leveling costs, which she said came to more than $300,000. But after her insurance company filed for bankruptcy, Hillman received no additional reimbursements. Court records show she’s suing the Louisiana Insurance Guaranty Association to recoup her losses. 
“I’ve tried to re-tarp it [the roof] a few times myself because nobody else would do it because it’s dangerous …” Hillman said. “The weather around here just makes a joke of the tarps and stuff, and so the water just pours in half the house.”

Reached last week, Hillman said she was still living in her trailer while repairs to her home continue. A freak winter ice storm in February 2021 damaged her plumbing, adding to the fixes needed.
Hillman applied for help from Restore Louisiana, the program providing federal grants for homeowners affected by natural disasters in 2020-21. She was initially awarded $19,000 but appealed the award amount. She has since been approved for $325,000 to cover the full demolition and rebuild. However, she said the process has been slow.
Restore Louisiana program’s deadline for issuing grant award agreements was Nov. 1, 2024.
The Louisiana Office of Community Development, which oversees the program, has closed over 13,000 grant agreements, obligating more than $1.06 billion, spokesman Marvin McGraw told the Illuminator. 
“Of the 20,803 submitted applications, 99.9% of grant award determinations have been completed, with only 12 homeowners awaiting a final award decision,” McGraw said.
The program expects to finalize any outstanding awards by March 31, he added.
“At this stage, all homeowners have been notified of their program status, and any remaining delays are likely due to missing documentation or unmet program requirements,” McGraw said.

Financial hardships hinder recovery
Before it was removed from her property, Diana Betters lived in a FEMA trailer in south Lake Charles, outside of city limits. She shared it with six other family members since her manufactured home sustained storm damage in 2020 that included busted pipes and a mold infestation visible around holes in the roof, walls and floors.
“I don’t know how much mold has built up. We’ve been buying the mold stuff and spraying and scrubbing,” Betters said.
Despite efforts to secure more permanent housing after the storms, she faced credit checks and financial hurdles, including a $650 sewer repair.
Betters said she was awarded $75,000 from Restore Louisiana. 
“I went and looked at the double-wide homes, and they want $149,000,” Betters said. “What I’m gonna do with it? Well, it’s a down payment, then the rest gonna fall on me. I already have a mortgage” for the damaged home.
Betters said she turned down housing options in nearby Sulphur and Iowa because she didn’t want her 11-year-old granddaughter to change schools. She considered two apartments near McNeese State University but didn’t qualify for a lease because of her low credit score.
According to documents Hillman and Betters received from FEMA and shared with the Illuminator, their trailer rents increased in January, with residents subjected to additional penalties should they continue to live in them beyond February. 
Hillman said her $50 monthly rent increased to $200 in January, but she was unsure of what fees she would owe for continuing to live in her trailer past Feb. 28. Betters said her rent rose from $359 to more than $700 in 2024.
Despite the Feb. 28 deadline, FEMA representatives showed up at Betters’ property Jan. 30 and ordered her family to vacate the trailer. As the family packed their belongings, contract workers started removing the trailer skirting to prepare it for removal. But just as they had at Hillman’s home, FEMA workers left the property without the trailer when reporters with the Illuminator and KPLC-TV arrived. 
Betters told the Illuminator FEMA officials returned without warning the next day to remove the trailer. She and her family are now back to living in their hurricane-damaged home while they save for something new.
“We’re bunched up in here like sardines,” Betters said, explaining that she’s using some rooms in her damaged home for storage space.
FEMA would not answer specific questions about Betters or Hillman but said in an email that its Direct Housing Mission program ended Feb. 28. When a move-out is completed, FEMA said its campers are “not typically removed from the property on the same day.

Nearly 20 years of disputes
Sulphur resident Ronnie Hossain has lived in FEMA trailers since 2005, when Hurricane Rita leveled the southwest corner of Louisiana. He has been involved in a lengthy dispute with local officials over rebuilding his storm-damaged home, and FEMA put his trailer on its removal list with the two others left over from the 2020 storms. 
Hossain said his FEMA  trailer was scheduled for repossession for 9 a.m. Jan. 31. However, no one from FEMA arrived when the time came. He attributes the no-show to reporters who were present during previous removal attempts earlier that week.
Hossain claims FEMA wrongly accused him of violations in an attempt to force him out of his temporary housing and that local officials have been unhelpful, further complicating efforts to rebuild his home. He also said that FEMA cited him for failing to meet with a caseworker, but he alleges no caseworker has ever visited his property.
Hossain said he had been paying rent for the FEMA trailer, which recently increased from $225 to $475 per month. Now, he claims, FEMA is demanding $1,600 in rent, an amount he says is unreasonable.
Sulphur Mayor Mike Danahay said Hossain has been entangled in zoning and permitting issues since Hurricane Rita. He has violated city ordinances by having multiple structures on a lot zoned for one single-family dwelling, according to the mayor. 
Hossain said the trailer he had been living in since Rita was damaged during Hurricane Laura in 2020. FEMA replaced it, and he removed the original one from his property six months ago. 
Hossain has yet to move into his house, and Danahay says he has repeatedly failed to meet deadlines for completing construction. The mayor said Hossain had electrical and plumbing work done without the necessary permits, which has prevented city inspectors from ensuring the home meets safety standards. Despite years of attempted cooperation, officials eventually had to start enforcing ordinances, Danahay said.
The mayor maintains the city’s goal is compliance, not punishment. 
“I think we’ve been more than patient with this gentleman to get his house in order so he can move back in,” Danahay stated. “All we are asking him to do is complete the house and do it right to ensure safety.”
Hossein told the Illuminator he has permits to work on the house. 
Hossain was locked out of his FEMA trailer Feb. 23, and it was removed from the property March 3, he said. Additionally, he claims FEMA sent a notice to the Internal Revenue Service to garnish more than $1,600 from his monthly income. 
He said has been in contact with Restore recently to renegotiate the terms of his grant to continue rebuilding his house.



Multifamily construction boom replacing damaged housing stock  
Hurricanes Laura and Delta took dead aim at southwest Louisiana and damaged approximately 44,000 homes, according to a 2020 study. About half of the Calcasieu Parish housing stock was impacted.
More than 750 damaged homes in Lake Charles have either been repaired or rebuilt since 2020, city spokeswoman Katie Harrington said. Additionally,  more than 900 new multi-family units have come online or are in the process of being developed. 
Woodring Apartments in downtown Lake Charles just marked its grand opening and offers affordable rates for qualifying tenants. Construction is well underway at the 72-unit Calcasieu Heights and Capstone at the Oaks, with 120 apartments. Both properties are intended for senior housing.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The effort to plug a “hole” left behind from Nebraska’s 2024 special session on property taxes — a “missing year” of tax relief — will likely not move forward this year.
State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering, the sponsor of Legislative Bill 81, confirmed the status of his bill this week. If passed, LB 81 seeks to extend the previous refundable income tax credit for school property taxes paid the previous year for one more year. 
That program ended with the passage of a bill during the special session that ended in August.
‘A missing year’: No income tax credits for Nebraskans to offset school property taxes paid in 2024

LB 81’s goal is to capture relief for the roughly 85% of Nebraska taxpayers who pay property taxes in arrears, such as property taxes assessed in December 2023 but paid throughout 2024.
Hardin said State Sen. Brad von Gillern of the Elkhorn area, chair of the Revenue Committee, has opted to keep LB 81 in committee and not “exec” on it, the step toward voting whether to advance the bill.
“Unfortunately there’s nothing we can do if they won’t exec on it and send it out,” Hardin said this week. “If they don’t exec on it this year and leave it there, this will continue to be something we’ll pick at into the next half of the biennium.”
Delay keeps bill ‘alive’
If the committee were to vote, von Gillern explained, the state’s projected $457 million budget shortfall for the next two years, prior to any legislative action, means LB 81 “would certainly fail.” He and the former chair of the Revenue Committee, former State Sen. Lou Ann Linehan, have said property tax relief is still coming each fiscal year, just at a different time.
  State Sen. Brad von Gillern of the Elkhorn area. Aug. 8, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Von Gillern added that should the state’s fiscal position improve by next year, and Hardin’s bill remains in committee for now, “the bill stays alive.”
“We have an opportunity to potentially move it forward at that time,” von Gillern said. “The best thing we can do right now is leave it in committee.”
Summer special session
LB 81 was spearheaded and later drafted by former State Sen. Steve Erdman of Bayard before he was term-limited in January. Just weeks after the summer special session, as first reported by the Nebraska Examiner, he found what he blasted as a “plain and simple retroactive property tax increase.”
When lawmakers voted 40-3 in August to approve LB 34, they revamped the previous tax credit program created in 2020 to apply automatically to taxpayer statements. 
In December, that meant many Nebraskans who did not know or were previously unable to request the tax credits received relief for the first time, which lawmakers and the governor lauded as a major success of the 17-day session of many twists and turns over multiple months.
In doing so, lawmakers eliminated the tax credit for any taxes paid in 2024. About 15% of taxpayers who paid 2023 assessed property taxes by the end of that year were able to get relief when they filed their 2024 tax returns.
The Nebraska Department of Revenue estimated LB 81 would initially cost $4.5 million for technical changes and to hire nearly 100 temporary staff to handle amended returns and answer taxpayer questions about the change.
The new credits that would be distributed under LB 81 would be over a three-year period because most taxpayers would need to file amended returns, the department said, estimated as follows:

$102 million in credits during the current fiscal year (ending June 30).
$503 million in credits during the next fiscal year (July 1, 2025, to June 30, 2026).
$32 million in credits during the third fiscal year (July 1, 2026, to June 30, 2027).

“Given this will likely be a slow process, the majority of the refunds will take place during FY 25-26,” the fiscal note states.
‘We made a mistake’
With a chuckle, Hardin said he was one of the ones to miss out on the tax credit. Among taxpayers who did pay early: Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen.
  State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering. July 31, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Hardin, Erdman and their supporters say the tax relief is owed to all taxpayers.
“What is fascinating to me is that at no point have I really had anybody who has ever said, ‘No, you’re not owed that money.’ It’s just, ‘We can’t afford it,’” Hardin said.
LB 81 did not receive a “priority” designation this year, meaning even if advanced from the Revenue Committee, it would head to the back of the line, behind more than 100 other proposals, as well as the budget, unless it hitched a ride on one of those items.
Asked whether taxpayers should expect any changes before the April 15 tax filing deadline, Hardin said bluntly: “No.”
Hardin could opt to try to “pull” the bill from committee, which would require 25 votes, or 30 votes if the Revenue Committee in response voted to “indefinitely postpone” or kill the bill. Hardin is not planning to file a pull motion at this time but does hope to have some productive conversations in the future.
He said advancing the bill would be the most transparent approach for taxpayers who want an answer.
“We made a mistake, and we need to own that mistake,” Hardin said. “We need to come up with that money for those people that we passed over, and that would be the right thing to do.”

A Lebanon man whose son died of an overdose at Trousdale Turner prison is accusing the state’s private-prison operator of “chronic and intentional understaffing” that could have contributed to the death. 
“There are not enough guards to run a safe and secure prison. Instead, it’s become a haven for gangs, dealing drugs, and these drugs are killing inmates,” said Tim Leeper in testimony before the House State and Local Government Committee Wednesday.
Leeper told the panel the state should take over Tennessee’s four privately-run prisons and remove CoreCivic because it’s putting profits ahead of prisoners.
The committee followed by unanimously endorsing House Bill 1144 by Republican Rep. Clark Boyd of Lebanon, which would require the inmate population at each CoreCivic-run prison to be reduced 10% if the death rate there is twice as high as the rate at a comparable state-run prison.
Tennessee levied $44.78 million in penalties against private prison operator in three years

State Comptroller audits show Trousdale Turner had a 146% employee turnover rate in 2023, making it more difficult to check on prisoners and avert murders and drug overdoses. Trousdale Turner, which is under a civil rights investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice, has a vacancy rate of 33.7%, compared with 26% at state-run prisons, officials said earlier this year.
Still, the state is seeking a $6.8 million contract increase for the private prison operator despite penalizing the company $44.78 million since 2022 for contractual shortfalls, $15 million in the last half year. 
CoreCivic doesn’t pay those penalties but simply forgoes state payments. And Boyd told the Lookout he doesn’t believe the penalties are stiff enough to make CoreCivic, a publicly-traded company, change course. 
The Department of Correction consistently defends the prison company, calling it a valuable state “partner” and commending it for trying to bolster staff. The state is having its own problems keeping officers. 
Leeper hired a private investigator to look into the cause of son’s death after the young man succumbed to a fentanyl overdose two years at age 25 while serving time for arson Trousdale Turner.
“The more I looked into how it happened the more frustrated I became, because these deaths were extremely preventable,” Leeper said to the Lookout. 
The young man suffered a stab wound the first day he was transferred to Trousdale Turner in May 2023 and died just six months later, his father said, adding his son suffered from anxiety because of constant fear he would be knifed again. A correction officer even told him he needed a shank or “butcher” to protect himself, Leeper said.
The elder Leeper called the state’s prison system the “catch-all” for people with mental illness, childhood trauma and substance abuse, a place where society “warehouses people away from us because it makes us feel safe.”
CoreCivic spokesman Ryan Gustin responded to the criticism with an email statement saying prisoner safety, health and well-being is “top priority” and that each facility has emergency response teams to handle medical care. All deaths are reported immediately to the state for investigation.
“All of our Tennessee facilities are subject to multiple layers of oversight by TDOC and independent third parties like the American Correctional Association. TDOC employs full-time, on-site contract monitors at each of our facilities who work to ensure our full compliance with prescribed policies and procedures,” Gustin said.

Yet even with President Donald Trump pardoning crimes and cutting civil rights investigations, the probe into CoreCivic’s Trousdale Turner continues.
Republican Sen. Mark Pody of Lebanon, who is sponsoring the bill’s Senate version, said Thursday he wants to renew the legislature’s correction oversight board, which was removed six years ago by former House Speaker Glen Casada.
Pody said statistics show more deaths occur in CoreCivic prisons than in the rest of the state’s prisons.
“If it can’t get under control, I think we need to do something legislatively so we don’t put people at risk in the prisons,” Pody said.
For a start, Pody said he wants more timely and accurate information so lawmakers can make better decisions. But any bill resurrecting prison oversight will have to wait until next year. 
Lawmakers are shutting down committees and trying to adjourn by mid-April so they can skedaddle before the kickback corruption trial for Casada and former staffer Cade Cothren begins. About 20 members have been subpoenaed to testify, and the trial is becoming the elephant in the room. 
Their priorities are set, but other than the Boyd-Pody bill, they don’t appear to involve reining in CoreCivic.
Let ’em out?
A week after the Senate Judiciary Committee killed a bill supported by the Tennessee Innocence Project, the measure is coming back to life.
Senate Bill 256, sponsored by Republican Sen. Todd Gardenhire of Chattanooga, would set a procedure for inmates to seek post-conviction relief based on new evidence that wasn’t available at the time of their conviction.
It’s slated to be heard – again – in committee next week. House Bill 601, sponsored by Democratic Rep. Bob Freeman of Nashville, is to be heard Wednesday by the House Judiciary Committee.
The rebirth came after Chairman Gardenhire and other committee members signed a letter this week showing their support for revival. 
  Sen. Paul Rose (Photo: John Partipilo)
Republican Sen. Paul Rose’s support was critical after he voted against the measure initially. The Covington Republican said he was persuaded to change his stance after seeing an amendment that sends applications for post-conviction relief through district attorneys.
“This is something that needs to be fixed. We really wanted it, so we worked with the Innocence Project, the district attorneys and got to a really good place,” Rose told the Lookout.
Considering most of the legislature’s criminal justice bills lock people up for good, this is a reversal of sorts. Maybe they don’t have tin man’s disease after all. Nah, what am I thinking?
Remembering Roy Herron
In a shocking turn of events, the Senate Energy, Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee endorsed a Democrat’s bill, one that would require personal liability insurance for watercraft such as jet skis.
Sen. Heidi Campbell of Nashville pushed the measure through the committee when the late Roy Herron’s wife, Nancy, testified about the need to insure personal watercraft because of the risks involved with riding them. A minimum age for driving them had been removed from the bill.

Herron, a West Tennessee lawmaker for more than a quarter-century then a lobbyist, died from a jet ski accident on Kentucky Lake. He was enjoying a family outing with family in July 2023 when an 11-year-old boy plowed into his jet ski at a high rate of speed. Herron died a week later at Vanderbilt hospital.
His son’s friend, Kala McDonald, was seriously injured as well and continues to receive treatment despite returning to medical school, according to Mrs. Herron.
“This financial responsibility provision may seem to some people like a small thing. But it would have meant so much to Kala,” she said, adding insurance costs only about $100.
Mrs. Herron implored the committee to take action, and shockingly, they did. Are we starting to see a new theme here? Maybe not.
“Get off of my cloud”
A heated exchange between Memphis Democratic Rep. Justin Pearson and Sevierville Republican Rep. Andrew Farmer forced the House Criminal Justice Subcommittee into recess Wednesday. Pearson, who has been absent from the hill following the death of his brother by gun suicide in December, brought a bill that would repeal permitless carry in Tennessee, calling on the legislature to act on gun violence instead of offering “some empty thoughts and prayers.”
Farmer replied it was unfair for Pearson to “lecture (the committee) on hard work and convictions” when “every member in this committee has been here this year … but you have not.” 
An incensed Pearson shouted back that hard work means passing better laws and fighting “for a state where everybody is able to live more freely from the pain of gun violence that me and my family are experiencing.” He said if Farmer “can’t take that,” he should “learn to shut up.”
Farmer responded that he also has a family and makes sacrifices every year to participate in the legislature. “It’s very common in your party when you disagree with a comment — and I was not disrespectful to you — that you resort to yelling,” Farmer said.

The two lawmakers were separated by their colleagues during the recess.
Pearson issued a statement later saying he has been working on constituent service while dealing with family tragedy.
Hallway talk, though, is that Republicans could be considering a way to punish Pearson for the incident, in part because he approached Farmer in the committee room and had to be restrained. 
Conflict between Farmer and Pearson dates back to 2023 when the Sevierville attorney helped lead expulsion hearings against Pearson, Rep. Justin Jones and Rep. Gloria Johnson. It wasn’t pretty as House Republicans expelled Pearson and Jones for leading a gun-control rally on the floor but narrowly voted to keep Johnson.
Memphis and Metro Nashville councils returned Pearson and Jones to the House the following week, and international publicity enabled them to raise nearly $1 million each.
The expulsion left House Republican leaders with more than egg on their faces, and kicking Pearson out again would only come back to haunt them. The problem is this week’s blow-up could have been avoided, plain and simple.
Switching horses
The House version of Republican Sen. Brent Taylor’s bill to investigate and potentially impeach Shelby County District Attorney Steve Mulroy was taken off notice this week, for a supposed technicality.
The Tennessee Journal, though, is reporting that Taylor’s bill has devolved into creation of a disciplinary board to review that actions of district attorneys and court officers.
Asked where the matter stands this week, Taylor promised big doings. But this appears to be an attempt to study the matter rather than go directly after Mulroy, a Democrat, which means the impeachment or expulsion is dead.
Taylor kept running into opposition from Senate leaders who didn’t want to micromanage district attorneys, and others say there wasn’t much to the matter, except Taylor’s dislike for Mulroy.
Nothing like a good tempest in a teapot.
What chemtrails?
Lawmakers outlawed chemtrails last year, those pesky white plumes emitted from jets, which is why we need more skyhawks to survey the heavens. But that wasn’t enough.
Protectors of the atmosphere and everything we breathe wanted to stiffen penalties for entities that spread those lines across the sky. 
The House went along with Republican Rep. Monty Fritts’ bill, passing it with ease this session. But the Senate said, “not so fast, my friends.”
Republican Sen. Janice Bowling this week argued that Congress is continuing to fund geo-engineering weather modification efforts while so-called experts claim that aerosol injections into the atmosphere can help stop the “climate crisis” by reducing the intensity of sunlight hitting the Earth.
But alas, the Senate energy and ag committee killed the last chance for Tennesseans to “breathe deep the gathering gloom.”
And after all he’s done
The House voted 73-21 Thursday morning to honor the “estimable” Tennessee Coordinator of Elections Mark Goins for his efforts over the years to run elections – some say into the ground, considering the state ranks near the bottom in election participation.
The resolution prepared by Republican Rep. Tim Rudd of Murfreesboro said Goins worked with the General Assembly to enact laws ensuring “fair, secure, and free elections,” including requiring photo IDs, voting machine vendor ethics regulations and anti-election hacking.
If only he’d been in charge of elections in every state five years ago, we could have avoided the “stop the steal” campaign and the Jan. 6 insurrection.
While Republicans voted overwhelmingly in favor of recognizing Goins – even though it’s not a great practice to congratulate someone until they retire or die – Democrats weren’t as amiable.
Democratic Rep. Bo Mitchell of Nashville told the House chamber, if Goins had been a local school district, he would have been taken over and turned into a charter school.
Look the other way
The Cordell Hull Building is packed these days with folks from across the state coming to lobby lawmakers or, it seems, to hang out and ride the elevators. 
One soul, though, apparently decided he’d had enough of the legislature’s shenanigans outside the building and took it upon himself to urinate on the sacred Cordell.
People on the Hill are accustomed to people raising a ruckus or sitting quietly holding 8-by-11 signs, but one wise guy said, “This isn’t peaceful protest but pee-ful protest.”

The code changes would update Arapahoe County’s regulations to comply with state laws that were passed during the 2024 legislative session. Those regulations include creating new zoning districts for multifamily and mixed-use developments, removing minimum parking requirements, allowing for overnight shelter and transitional housing units for people experiencing homelessness, and revising manufactured home requirements. 
Governments across the Denver metro area have been considering how to comply with the new state laws for over a year. If adopted, Arapahoe County would be one of the largest government entities supporting the new state laws, which have sharply divided communities across the Front Range. 
“These proposed code changes will hopefully help us meet the new requirements from the state,” Kat Hammer, senior planner with Arapahoe Public Works and Development, said during the study session.

County commissioners also discussed creating a two-tiered set of incentives for new affordable housing development. Under the proposed guidelines, developments where at least 50% of the units are designated as affordable could be allowed to build buildings up to 75 feet in height, have their planning and engineering fees reduced, and go through an expedited land use review process. Developments that reserve at least 10% of their units as affordable would be eligible for more limited height and density benefits.
Arapahoe County has been studying how to make its land use codes more amenable to affordable housing developments since December 2023. However, balancing the county’s need for more housing with feedback from the community has proved difficult. 
County staff noted multiple concerns about the code changes. For instance, there were concerns about how the proposed changes would impact the progress of current developments, affect infrastructure and roadways, and whether the affordable homes would be marketable once they are completed. Staff also shared concerns about the county’s ability to monitor and enforce the affordable housing requirements and whether developments where 50% of the units are designated as affordable should be allowed to bypass neighborhood meeting requirements. 
The board decided to include the neighborhood meeting requirement in the proposed changes, but the discussion illustrated the concerns that lawmakers in other cities have raised about speeding up the development of affordable housing. 










We have a shortage of single-family homes, which is why people are leaving the state ... People don’t want to live in apartments from birth to death. I saw this stuff in Russia and it was built under Lenin.


– Westminster City Council member Kristine Ireland


Commissioner Rhonda Fields, a former Democratic state lawmaker, expressed reservations about allowing certain developments to bypass neighborhood meetings. 
“If something was moving into my neighborhood, I would want to know,” Fields said. “I would want to lend voice before the project, because once the project is approved, my opportunities to shape it are less.” 
Commissioner Jessica Campbell said she supports including neighborhood feedback about new developments, although she noted that public hearing requirements can increase the cost of development by delaying the project’s approval, thereby causing developers to pay more carrying costs. Sometimes, the discussions also veer into economic discrimination, Campbell said. 
“Part of why I think this deserves a different treatment is because when we are talking about affordability … the comments we hear are not just about density,” Campbell said. “They are literally ‘we don’t want those people here.’ And so we, as a government, are facilitating a conversation and are allowing economic discrimination to take place.”
Metro area housing shortage
The affordable housing debate in the Denver area has become bifurcated into what kind of housing should be built and which cities should bear the brunt of the new development. 
According to a 2024 Housing Needs Assessment from the Denver Regional Council of Governments, the metro area needs to add 216,000 housing units by 2032 to meet demand. The greatest need is for units that are affordable for people earning up to 60% of the area’s median income, or around $78,000 for a family of four. Arapahoe County needs to add around 2,270 units to meet demand by 2032 as well. 
State lawmakers have tried to promote more affordable housing development through legislation. For example, state lawmakers have passed bills encouraging local governments to allow accessory dwelling units, giving local governments the right of first refusal for certain types of land to build more affordable housing on, and increasing transit-oriented development.
Voters also approved Proposition 123 in 2022, which requires participating governments to build 3% more affordable housing annually for three years. 
In February, CPR reported that lawmakers in cities across the Front Range have pushed back against state laws that require cities to relax development codes and add more affordable housing. Some have gone as far as to say they won’t follow the new laws at all. 
During a regular City Council meeting on Feb. 3, Westminster Mayor Nancy McNally said the new state laws amount to state overreach. City Council member Kristine Ireland also expressed concerns about the city building more apartments. 
“We have a shortage of single-family homes, which is why people are leaving the state,” Ireland said. “People don’t want to live in apartments from birth to death. I saw this stuff in Russia and it was built under Lenin.” 
McNally and other council members directed city staff not to comply with the laws. 
“The issue is local control,” McNally said. “Are you going to let the state tell you what to do, no matter what any citizen says because they’re not going to your citizens? Or do we control it? That’s it for me.” 
On March 4, several residents of Lafayette spoke against the state housing laws during the city’s biweekly City Council meeting. Multiple residents said they supported the city joining a lawsuit against the state over the new laws. 
Afterward, council members agreed to meet in a closed-door session to discuss their legal options for ignoring the state housing laws. Lafayette Mayor Pro Tem Brian Wong said the state bills seem to be chipping away at the city’s home rule authority as well. 
“I’ve heard through my conversations with DRCOG that several communities are looking at litigation,” Wong, referring to the Denver Regional Council of Governments, said.

Family access to shelters is also not always reliable, according to the audit report that was published and sent to legislative leaders last week.
“Providers we surveyed indicated that the City and Unity need to improve communication, including better availability and responsiveness to providers, clarity regarding policies and procedures, and more timely reimbursements,” Legislative Auditor Mike Waguespack wrote in the report. “In addition, information about available resources is difficult to find and may be out of date.”
The audit period stretched from January 2019 to June 2024. Over that stretch, the city and Unity of Greater New Orleans, a nonprofit organization that coordinates homeless initiatives, spent $216.3 million on homelessness initiatives. Most of the money came from federal funds, and over half of it went to permanent housing programs for people with disabilities.
During the review period, 275 people in homeless encampments were provided housing, the audit said. From January 2019 to January 2024, the number of unhoused individuals  in New Orleans increased 22.4% from 1,188 to 1,454. However, unsheltered homeless decreased 18.5% from 594 to 484 during the same timespan.
The audit report included 19 recommendations total for the Louisiana Housing Corp., Unity and the city agencies that address homelessness in New Orleans. The respective entities agreed with nearly all of them.
The New Orleans Office of Homeless and Services disagreed with the auditor’s suggestion that it develop official policies for removing homeless encampments. In October, city officials took issue with Gov. Jeff Landry’s directive to have Louisiana State Police clear out a large tent community near downtown ahead of Taylor Swift’s concerts at the Superdome.
Waguespack wrote that several factors drive homelessness in New Orleans, including a lack of affordable housing and a need for employment opportunities that provide a living wage.

Maybe not to “Scott A.” as Musk called him, the Green Bay voter to whom Musk gave $1 million as part of his campaign to reward Wisconsinites who sign a petition against “activist judges,” while at the same time handing over their personal data to Musk. Scott A.’s haul is one-fifth the size of Musk’s $20 million investment in campaign ads and door-knocking to support his preferred candidate, Brad Schimel. 
And Musk’s $20 million spending spree accounts for about one-fifth of the total, record-breaking $100 million that makes the April 1 contest the most expensive judicial race in U.S. history.
The race is a test of many things: Whether Musk, serving as unelected and unpopular co-president to Donald Trump, is a political asset or a liability; whether the new liberal majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court will endure; whether the highest bidder is destined to win state court races even as the ad war becomes a blitzkrieg; whether three months into the Trump administration, amid mass firings, the dismantling of federal agencies and voter unease about the destruction of their health care and retirement security, Wisconsin might be the place where things begin to turn around. 
The money pouring into the Supreme Court race is obscene and a bad sign for the health of democracy regardless of next week’s outcome. But the sickness didn’t flare up overnight. It has been getting steadily worse for almost two decades.
Schimel makes the claim that he is running to restore the Court’s “impartiality,” motivated by his disgust at how “political” the Court’s new liberal majority has become. In truth, the politicization of the Court goes back almost two decades and Schimel, a highly partisan Republican, is an unlikely candidate to take us back to pre-partisan times. On the other side, Susan Crawford is backed by the Democrats and big out of state donors including George Soros. In a recent debate she conceded that the public has an interest in ethics rules that would require judges to recuse themselves from cases involving their donors, but the current rules don’t require that. Neither candidate has promised to recuse from such cases.
The turning point that led us to the current moment came in 2008. That was the year disgraced former Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman defeated incumbent Justice Louis Butler in a dirty campaign that broke all previous spending records. The race cost $6 million — at the time, an astounding sum.
Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, Gableman’s biggest-spending supporter, paid for ads calling Butler “Loophole Louie” and accusing him of being soft on crime. Gableman himself ran a disgusting ad that placed Butler’s face next to the mugshot of a convicted rapist. Both men were Black. The ad misleadingly claimed that Butler “found a loophole” and let the man out of prison “to molest another child.” In fact, Butler was not the judge in the case. As a public defender assigned to defend his client, he lost in court and his client was imprisoned, then later reoffended after he was released, having served his full sentence. 
Gableman went on to help destroy ethics rules on the Court, refusing to recuse himself from cases involving WMC, which had spent more than $2 million to help elect him. He played a key role in passing the current ethics rule allowing justices to decide for themselves whether to recuse in cases involving their big-money campaign contributors. 
Gableman embarrassed supporters, including Dodge County District Attorney Steven Bauer, who publicly withdrew his support during the campaign because of the attack ad. Tellingly, after he left the Court, Gableman disappeared, never landing a job at a law firm or in public service. His brief return to the limelight, as Assembly Speaker Robin Vos’s chief investigator of nonexistent voter fraud, featured Gableman threatening to jail the mayors of Democratic cities and wasting more than a million taxpayer dollars on a farcical investigation that ended when Vos fired him.  
But the damage done by Gableman and the people who poured money into electing him endures.
The 2025 Supreme Court race, which is on track to double the cost of the last record-breaking election in 2023, is 15 times as costly as Gableman’s expensive and shamefully politicized campaign. 
Ads featuring scary crime stories are still a major feature of Supreme Court races, sponsored by people who know and don’t care that tough-on-crime issues aren’t coming before the Court. Instead, the ads are paid for by ideological groups, political parties and corporations interested in favorable treatment — like Musk, who has a current lawsuit in Wisconsin seeking to overturn a state law blocking him from opening Tesla dealerships here.
Back in 1873, Wisconsin Supreme Court Chief Justice Edward Ryan worried about the rise of the robber barons, their accumulation of vast personal wealth and with it political power. Speaking at the University of Wisconsin Law School, he posed the question:  “Which shall rule — wealth or man; which shall lead — money or intellect; who shall fill public stations — educated and patriotic free men, or the feudal serfs of corporate capital?”
We are well on our way to becoming a nation of feudal serfs to Elon Musk. The liquidation of government agencies and institutions that serve the public interest are a giant step in that direction. The Wisconsin Supreme Court election will take us further down that road, or move us in the opposite direction. But until we do something about the arms race in campaign spending, Ryan’s vision of government by “educated and patriotic free men (and women)” will be increasingly out of reach.

State lawmakers opted to “front-load” the tax credits for property taxes paid to K-12 schools in August, beginning with tax statements that went out in December, lowering property tax obligations. But Nebraskans seeking similar relief on property taxes paid last year to community colleges — before the state largely took over funding them — still need to take the extra step of requesting a refund via their tax returns by April 15. 
This includes the last round of general fund community college property taxes, as well as capital improvements or bonds assessed in December 2023 that most taxpayers paid throughout 2024. 
Under current law, the income tax credits for property taxes paid to community colleges are set to be available each year, but must be filed for one year after payment.
The state replaced the majority of local community colleges’ property tax authority with state dollars, effective this fiscal year, which zeroed out the general fund property tax-funded part of the colleges’ general funds in December but left a narrow levy authority to the six colleges.
This fiscal year, the state picked up more than $253 million, an amount that grows each year for each college.
Community colleges requested $289 million in property taxes in 2023, and the replacement state revenue helped drop that amount to $69.4 million in 2024. College boards retain a 2-cent tax rate per $100 of taxable property valuations for paying off bonds or establishing a capital improvement and bond-sinking fund, which all six colleges requested.
The 2023 agreement also automatically locked in community colleges for annual increases in replacement state dollars. State lawmakers must give community colleges an increase in that bucket of funds by 3.5% or in “reimbursable educational units” for each community college. If not, community college boards could raise property taxes to make up the difference.
The preliminary state budget proposals from both Gov. Jim Pillen and the Appropriations Committee fulfill those funding obligations.
Nebraska taxpayers can use this online tool through the Nebraska Department of Revenue to determine the eligible community college refund they are entitled to before filing tax returns this year. Credits are rounded to the nearest whole dollar.

North Carolina is among the states considering legislation designed to regulate health insurers’ prior authorization and claims reviews. (Chris Carlson/The Associated Press)Health insurance companies are under increasing scrutiny for allegedly using artificial intelligence bots and algorithms to swiftly deny patients routine or lifesaving care — without a human actually reviewing their claims.
The high-profile killing late last year of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has focused even more attention on so-called prior authorization, the process by which patients and doctors must ask health insurers to approve medical procedures or drugs before proceeding. There had been protests and outrage over the company’s practices for months before Thompson’s death, and UnitedHealthcare has been accused in a class-action lawsuit of using AI to wrongfully deny claims.
As more patients and doctors voice their frustrations, states are responding with legislation designed to regulate prior authorization and claims reviews. So far this year, lawmakers in more than a dozen states are considering measures that would, for example, limit the use of AI in reviewing claims; exclude certain prescription medications from prior authorization rules; ensure that emergency mental health care is not delayed for more than 48 hours; and require that insurers’ review boards include licensed physicians, dentists or pharmacists with clinical experience.


North Dakota bill
The North Dakota Legislature is is considering Senate Bill 2280 that relates to insurance prior authorization. The House Industry, Business and Labor Committee is expected to discuss the bill on Monday, March 31.


Insurers have long required doctors to obtain their approval before they’ll pay for certain drugs, treatments and procedures. They argue it is necessary to rein in health care costs and limit unnecessary services. But many doctors and patients say the practice has gotten out of hand, causing delays and denials of care that are harming and even killing people.
In a survey last year by the American Medical Association, 93% of doctors said that insurers’ prior authorization practices delayed “necessary care” for their patients. Twenty-nine percent said such delays had led to a “serious adverse event,” such as hospitalization, permanent injury or death.
In 2023, insurers selling plans on the marketplaces created under the Affordable Care Act denied a combined average of 20% of all claims. Of the 73 million in-network claims they denied, only 1% were appealed, according to KFF, a health policy research group.
The federal role
Under the Biden administration, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice took a firmer hand against health care corporations alleged to be engaging in behavior resulting in limited and more expensive care for patients. The administration also approved rules requiring that beginning in 2026, Medicare and Medicaid plans create a streamlined electronic process for reviewing claims, making decisions more quickly and providing specific reasons for denying care.
But it’s difficult to hold insurers accountable, according to Timothy McBride, a health policy analyst and co-director of a program at the Institute for Public Health at Washington University in St. Louis.
“Each part of the health care industry — hospitals, pharmaceuticals, insurers — they all have a lot of concentrated power,” McBride said in a phone interview. “And unless somebody actually takes it on directly, it’s going to stay that way. I think the Biden administration tried to take it on, but didn’t make a lot of progress.”
It’s unclear whether the Trump administration and Congress will reverse course. During his confirmation hearing on March 14, Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, defended the use of artificial intelligence in reviewing claims.
“AI can be used for good or for evil, and it to a large extent depends on who’s using it and for what purpose,” Oz told members of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee. “I think AI could play a vital role in accelerating preauthorization.”
In the past, Trump has supported measures to help patients, such as increasing hospital price transparency and lowering prescription drug prices, McBride noted. But “Republicans and conservatives generally are anti-regulation,” he said. “My gut feeling would be that they back off on the Biden push on this.”
States have limited power to act on their own. They have authority only over state-regulated health plans, which include Medicaid, plans for state workers and policies residents purchase from the ACA marketplaces. About 90 million people are covered that way. State laws do not apply to the 156 million workers, retirees and dependents who get their coverage through employer-sponsored health plans, which are regulated through a federal law known as ERISA.
Furthermore, health insurance companies are large and have deep pockets, allowing them to easily absorb state fines.
But Kaye Pestaina, the director of the program on patient and consumer protection at KFF, said states have an important role to play.
“Much of the focus around prior authorization at the federal level has kind of originated from state protections, so I imagine there will be continual activity by state legislatures to come at the problem,” Pestaina told Stateline.
What states are doing
Pestaina said states are trying a number of solutions. For example, states such as Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania have given their insurance regulators more authority to directly access claims denial information, in order to overturn decisions or potentially enforce state rules. And these efforts have largely had bipartisan support.
In Pennsylvania, Republican state Sen. Kristin Phillips-Hill pushed through bipartisan legislation in 2022 to streamline prior authorization practices for state-regulated health plans after hearing numerous complaints from patients and doctors.
The legislation created an Independent External Review organization that allows Pennsylvanians to submit an online form to request a review if their insurer denies a service or treatment. If the review organization decides the service should be covered, the insurer must do so. Before then, patients could turn only to a federal review process, which may have been more challenging to navigate and taken more time.
“Our reforms created clear rules, clear timelines for the prior authorization process, and it removed ambiguity or uncertainty from the system that at times, insurers could exploit and providers could be confused over,” Phillips-Hill told Stateline. “Prior to that reform, if you had a denial from your insurer, you had very little recourse.”
The program began in January 2024, and in its first year the Pennsylvania Insurance Department overturned half of 517 denials, which amounted to claims from 259 people.
Jonathan Greer, president and CEO of the Insurance Federation of Pennsylvania, said his trade group worked with lawmakers to come to an agreement on how to change the prior authorization process in a way that worked for insurers and patient advocates. Greer says he thinks Pennsylvania could be a model for other states.
“Prior authorization, I think unfairly, has been characterized as a reason to say ‘no’ by insurers,” Greer said. “The purpose of prior authorization is to make sure that you know the care that you get is consistent with the care that you need.”
In North Carolina, Republican state Rep. Timothy Reeder is hopeful that his prior authorization bill will make it across the finish line this year. Reeder’s bill would set tight deadlines on insurers’ claim decisions and require companies to have licensed practitioners on their claim review boards. Insurers would also have to publicize a list of services they require authorization for.
“I’m not saying that we need to get rid of it completely,” Reeder told Stateline. “There is a role for some oversight to make sure that things are covered. But right now, I think the system is out of balance.”
But some state laws have proven to be less effective than advertised.
In 2021, Texas enacted a first-of-its-kind law creating a “gold card” standard, under which physicians whose care recommendations are approved by insurers at least 90% of the time are exempt from the prior authorization process. But as of the end of 2023, only 3% of Texas physicians had earned gold card status, according to the Texas Medical Association.
That’s why the group is pushing legislation that would require insurers to report which preauthorization exemptions they granted and denied and how many claims went to independent review. Dr. Zeke Silva of the Texas Medical Association’s legislative council said it would be “in the same spirit” as what Pennsylvania has done.
“Our focus with the [Texas Medical Association] is our physicians being able to provide the best care possible. And we want that to be free of burden,” Silva told Stateline. “We want to minimize third parties coming in and inappropriately denying care that our physicians and our patients think is in their best interest.”

Jeff Landry’s recent moves to undo the layers of separation between himself and the body that oversees flood protection for most of the New Orleans area. They’re apparently at the [&#8230;],"Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry gives his address in the House Chamber on opening day of the regular legislative session, Monday, March 11, 2024, at the Louisiana State Capitol in Baton Rouge. (John Ballance/The Advocate, Pool)It has all the makings of history repeating itself — and in the worst way imaginable. 
You’re hard pressed to find anyone who’s endorsed Gov. Jeff Landry’s recent moves to undo the layers of separation between himself and the body that oversees flood protection for most of the New Orleans area.
They’re apparently at the behest of Shane Guidry, a prominent business owner in the offshore energy supply sector and generous donor to Landry’s campaigns over the years. The governor has made Guidry, who describes the governor as his best friend, an unofficial adviser within his administration.
Guidry’s influence has become apparent within the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority-East. The New Orleans-area levee boards on both sides of the Mississippi River were overhauled and rebranded after Hurricane Katrina once local and state leaders saw the need to remove political influence from resiliency infrastructure decisions. Their new structure placed an emphasis on subject matter expertise on flood protection rather than the political connections that had been in place for decades.
The first instance of Guidry dabbling in inner workings of the Flood Protection Authority-East came when executive director Kelli Chandler resigned in January. She clashed with Guidry over the role of the levee board’s 60-person police force, The Times-Picayune reported.

While Chandler saw protection of the authorities flood protection assets in Jefferson, Orleans and St. Bernard parishes as the department’s top priority, Guidry wanted more emphasis placed on law enforcement in New Orleans’ levee-adjacent neighborhoods. Officers should be doing more than “watching grass grow,” he said. 
Thanks to approval from the GOP-dominated Louisiana Legislature, the governor now has authority to directly appoint the leaders of dozens of state boards and commissions that previously went through a formal vetting and state Senate approval process. For the Flood Protection Authority-East, Landry tapped Metairie civil engineer Roy Carubba to replace Chandler, who had no background related to flood protection. 
Carubba’s firm has worked in the past for Guidry, according to reports. 
All signs point to Guidry continuing to exercise control over the levee board, and he says flood protection will continue to be its priority. 
But so far this month, four members resigned from the levee board, most of them citing Guidry’s reversal of reforms made after Katrina, according to WVUE-TV Fox 8. Three of them, Roy Arrigo, Thomas Fierke and William Settoon addressed their resignation letter to Guidry, although he has no official status with the Landry administration or designated powers over the authority. 
“Contrary to board appointed President Caruba’s (sic) often expressed opinions of the FPA, we have observed the morale, readiness and focus on flood protection have been diminished during his tenure,” the letter reads.      
The fourth board member, Derek Rabb, has not explained his departure.
When The Times-Picayune reached Carubba for comment, he said he first had to clear the interview with Guidry. Once cleared to speak, the engineer’s comments about his de facto boss were glowing, with Carubba describing Guidry as “a brilliant business person.”
Guidry explained to the newspaper why he’s provided guidance to the governor. 
“Look at Elon Musk, right? There’s a reason why he’s doing something free for Trump — because he knows he can help him. And Trump wants that,” Guidry said. “There’s a reason why I do what I do free for Jeff because he knows I have nothing to gain.”  
One local good government group has concerns over Landry and Guidry wading into flood infrastructure management. In a statement, the New Orleans-based Bureau of Government Research (BGR) challenged claims from the administration that the Flood Protection Authority, both its East and West offshoots, has been mismanaged.  
“The governor’s advisers have alleged that the New Orleans area’s vital flood protection infrastructure hasn’t been kept in working order and that funding dedicated for this purpose has been wasted,” the BGR statement reads. “While blaming the leadership of the authorities tasked with managing the $14.5 billion levee system, they have not provided any details or evidence of the problems.” 
BGR called on the governor to provide “thorough explanations, not accusations” before his administration puts forward any legislation to change the post-Katrina makeup of the flood protection authorities. The bureau was among supporters of the coalition of civic and business groups, along with elected leaders, who pushed for the new framework that received voter approval in the form of a state constitutional amendment. 
“Chief among the coalition’s aims was ensuring that the authorities’ boards of commissioners were selected for their expertise in flood protection-related and other relevant fields – not their political connections or views,” BGR wrote.
It’s been almost 20 years since the federally built levee system protecting New Orleans failed at multiple points, covering some 80% of the city with stormwater that destroyed homes and businesses that had otherwise survived Katrina. Two decades is not nearly long enough to erase the trauma from the minds of those who went through the storm and chose to rebuild.
It’s this still-fragile mindset that Landry and Guidry have stirred with their approach to the Flood Protection Authority. The exit of four board members, just weeks ahead of the 2025 hurricane season, has been disconcerting for many who have yet to have their trust in government restored.
This behind-the-scenes approach from the governor and his best bud does nothing to quell anxiety levels that increase every June 1. Greater transparency and a renewed adherence to post-Katrina flood protection principles from Landry and Guidry would go a long way toward engendering confidence in their decision-making.
While leaders might come and go, what the levees protect is not as easily replaced.

(Photo: John Partipilo)A representative from the legal firm that fought for deregulation of American wetlands at the U.S. Supreme Court spoke Wednesday in support of a Tennessee bill that would roll back protections for up to 80% of the state’s isolated wetlands.
Tennessee lawmakers are considering a bill that would significantly reduce requirements for development on wetlands, swampy lands that support diverse ecosystems, soak up floodwaters and recharge groundwater.
The state’s current regulations predate the federal Clean Water Act, which imposed the first federal protections for wetlands in the 1970s, requiring developers to compensate for destroying wetlands by preserving or restoring them elsewhere.
But the erosion of federal regulations in the last two years has given states more power to decide how they will define and protect wetlands.
The Supreme Court’s 2023 ruling in Sackett v. EPA stripped federal protection from “isolated” wetlands that lack surface connection to water bodies deemed waters of the United States. And the EPA recently announced its intent to scale back federal wetlands regulation to reduce permitting costs for landowners and businesses, according to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who was appointed in January by President Donald Trump.
The Pacific Legal Foundation represented plaintiffs Chantell and Mike Sackett in the case that constricted the scope of the Clean Water Act to only wetlands with continuous surface connections to waters of the U.S. 
Environmentalists: Second attempt at wetlands bill would leave 80% vulnerable to development

Kileen Lindgren, a legal policy manager at the nonprofit constitutional litigation firm, told Tennessee lawmakers Wednesday that the bill they are considering is about “property rights and regulatory accountability.”
“When governments restrict … use, they’re devaluing property and violating owners’ rights under the Fifth Amendment,” she testified before the House Agriculture and Natural Resources Subcommittee.
Lindgren was the sole supporter to speak to the subcommittee, though a representative for the Tennessee Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Home Builders of Tennessee testified in favor of the bill at a previous Senate committee meeting. Six representatives from environmental groups and the mitigation banking industry urged lawmakers to reconsider the bill, warning it would largely remove incentives for developers to design around wetlands rather than destroying them.
Lindgren said she preferred the bill’s first iteration, which would have stripped all state regulation back to the level of the Sackett decision. The bill’s current version preserves the ability to impose mitigation requirements for high-quality isolated wetlands and moderate- and low-quality isolated wetlands larger than two acres.
“This bill as introduced recognized that to regulate land for having water on it amounted to the government devaluing that land, and when the government devaluates land, it takes away property rights and should justly compensate owners pursuant to the Fifth Amendment’s promise that individuals will not be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law, nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation,” Lindgren said.
She said the amended bill is only a “first step toward protecting private property rights.”
“As amended, the bill assumes the state has the authority to limit use of private property, and if the state wants to regulate isolated wetlands, it should justly compensate owners, recognizing that the people who are the state of Tennessee must bear the burden of this type of government interference,” Lindgren said.
Memphis Republican Rep. Kevin Vaughan, the bill’s House sponsor, brushed off scientists’ warnings that deregulation spurs increased flooding and decreased water quality as hyperbole and speculation. Vaughan said his main issue is the current rules seem to rely on a person’s intended use for the land, not solely the action of disrupting a wetland — agricultural uses are exempt from mitigation requirements.
Developers, seeking to gain from building boom tied to Ford plant, push for weaker wetland rules

“All this comes down to humans determining where (wetlands) are, and it’s a game … deregulation needs to come, but it needs to be simplified through plainer regulation so people will know what’s expected of them when they encounter it,” Vaughan said.
Nashville Democratic Rep. Justin Jones questioned Lindgren’s motive for testifying.
“The thing that I’m seeing with this is that this is not about property rights or conservation,” Jones said. “This is about everyday Tennesseans versus the power of special interest lobbyists on this hill. Every email we received from all across the state — and I literally … printed every single email and went through each one — was against this bill.”

Several studies have come out that have blasted West Virginia’s K-12 schools, as well as our national education situation. One comprehensive report ranked West Virginia very poorly versus national standards in math, reading, writing and science. Only four states scored worse regarding grade level 4 academic achievements in 2024. Twenty-eight percent of West Virginia students did not even achieve basic proficiency levels.
Going back to pre-pandemic times, overall scores were much the same with only three states scoring lower than West Virginia.
However, as a direct result of the COVID pandemic, West Virginia’s fourth grade reading score fell by 8% between 2019 and 2024. That put it in the worst one-third of states, those experiencing the biggest drops in reading scores.
A dozen other states fared even worse, with Maine dropping nearly 12% in just five years. In fact, only two states had improved reading scores-Alabama (2%) and Louisiana (6%) between 2019 and 2024.
We must not simply blame our teachers. Many of my relatives are underpaid public school teachers, some in low performing schools. These highly motivated educators work long hours, making much less than they could make in the private sector. They are in this occupation because they are dedicated to improving the lives of the children that they teach. They are motivated to help school children succeed academically and build a better life. 
However, the situation with West Virginia’s K-12 schools is highly troublesome, regardless of one’s politics. The bad news is that this is a long-term issue which cannot be turned around overnight. In this age of cellphones and the internet, our school kids are having difficult behavioral problems which lead to poor academic achievement. 
The good news is that there are proven methods for turning the situation around and improving the state’s K-12 schools. We must focus on improving the social and emotional side of the problem by making our children feel better about themselves and their academic environment.
In this electronic age, students have difficulty knowing what is real and what is imaginary. They hear and see so much that they are in sensory overload. As a first step, our schools must teach students how to empathize with others — the key to humanity. 
If a fellow student is having problems, proactively help him or her rather than laughing derisively, pointing fingers and then recording the debasing incident on your cellphone to immediately post to TikTok. Our children must understand right from wrong, and want to do what is right, both for them and others.
Respectful Ways, a digital, trauma-informed, social emotional learning (SEL) program, recommends beginning with four strategies for students:

Monotask — Focusing on one task at a time.
Design your environment — Eliminating distractions wherever possible.
Clarify tasks — Breaking them into specific steps.
Recover quickly — Accepting slips, resetting, and moving forward.

Yes, our nation is going through trying times. Many of our basic institutions are under attack. All the more reason for us to establish programs within our K-12 school systems which will teach emotional and social education techniques. 
We must help our students to succeed and gain control of their lives through providing them with the tools to swim against the strong tides that will otherwise overwhelm them. By doing so, we will provide them with the tools to tackle the academic side of the picture.

Housed on MSU’s East Lansing campus, the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, or FRIB, has received more than $1.5 billion from the DOE-SC, the university said in a news release, leading to discoveries in nuclear physics and furthering research in medicine, national security, materials science and industry. It officially began operations in 2022.

With this new investment construction of a High-Transmission Beam Line, or HTBL, will commence with the expectation it will be completed in April 2030. The HTBL will aid in the High Rigidity Spectrometer project, which aims to allow scientists to examine neutron-rich isotopes normally only created when stars collide or explode.
The new beam line is crucial to future experiments at FRIB, the facility’s Laboratory Director Thomas Glasmacher said in a news release Wednesday.
“HTBL will greatly expand FRIB’s scientific reach, enabling groundbreaking discoveries in nuclear physics,” Glasmacher said. “HTBL is made possible by the continued support of the federal government and the American public, whose investment in basic research infrastructure is vital to advancing knowledge for American competitiveness. We are deeply grateful for their commitment to scientific excellence and the future of discovery science.”
FRIB employs 565 employees, 153 graduate students, and 134 undergraduate students, according to the university.
As one of 71 American research universities in the Association of American Universities, with research efforts in nuclear physics, food systems, environmental science and more, MSU has committed to reach $1 billion in annual research expenditures by 2030. The university’s Strategic Plan outlines the financial commitment as a dedication for the “common good” to produce research to address issues in society across sectors.

Then Senate President Robert Stivers publicly lamented — right there in the sacred well of the Senate — that reporters might not write the stories he, personally, would most like to see. “They want to write about division,” Stivers said of the press. “They want to write about dissension. … Every day, I want to look at the people who write the stories, who speak the language, who go on the TVs and the radio to talk about all the positives that this body leans on, not the negatives that they want to sell advertising and get advertising dollars for.” 
Listening to his speech, it was hard not to hear echoes of President Trump who regularly calls the press “enemy of the people” when they report straight news (which is their job) in lieu of flattering puff pieces.
The elimination of DEI — because who needs other voices, equal opportunities or inclusiveness? — was the driving force this year in Frankfort. 
When a Black woman approached committee chair James Tipton following adjournment of an anti-DEI hearing — on video you can hear her say, “I study race. I teach students about critical race theory. Like, how am I supposed to explain that?” — Tipton called for state troopers to remove her.
Not to be outdone in the shut up-department, Rep. John Blanton championed House Bill 399 to make loudly interfering with legislative proceedings a crime, a bill that allows lawmakers, in addition to law enforcement, direct authority to decide who should be arrested. 
  Columnist Teri Carter silently comments on the new crime of interfering with a legislative proceeding.
Democrats in the minority argued House Bill 399 could stifle the voices of citizens who want to make their opposition to legislation known in Frankfort, but their arguments fell on deaf ears. HB 399 was easily passed. 
So much for free speech.
In a Senate committee during the final full week to discuss House Bill 495 — cancelling Gov. Andy Beshear’s restrictions on conversion therapy and prohibiting Medicaid from paying for some forms of gender-affirming care — committee chair Stephen Meredith got all up in a lather as he repeatedly interrupted and shouted down Fairness Campaign executive director Chris Hartman. And when Hartman said softly, as he finished testifying, “I am disappointed, Mr. Chairman,” Meredith’s flip, snarky response was, “Wouldn’t be the first time, thank you.” 
Everyone in the committee room sat quietly, in shock I think, obeying the rules of decorum with mouths agape at the blatant disrespect they’d just witnessed from Meredith. And yet what we all know is this: a woman or a Black person would not get away with such behavior in a thousand years, and they would certainly not be chairing a committee with manners like that.  
But so it goes.
During a heated Senate debate over House Bill 4, Democrats tried to show their Republican counterparts how prohibiting DEI programs would harm college students who are members of minority groups, but Republicans did not care to listen. They were on a mission to get the bill (which failed to cross the finish line last year) to the governor’s desk so they would have time to override his expected veto.
In the final hours of the HB 4 debate, Minority Floor Leader Gerald Neal, who is Black, argued that historically not everyone has had the same “level of playing field” before discussing slavery in America, which was followed by Reconstruction in the South, Jim Crow laws and legal segregation. What then ensued was a dustup between Neal, a man known as the soft-spoken gentleman of the Senate, and Floor Leader Max Wise, who is white, even as HB 4 would pass with ease.
And in that final, busiest full week of this session, House Speaker David Osborne found time to pen a 600-plus word response to the Kentucky Lantern (which does not publish pieces by elected officials) to one of my columns, titled “‘Pattern of commentary driven by ideology rather than facts,’ Speaker responds to false and misleading commentary.”
Ah well. To paraphrase the oft-repeated words of beloved writer Anne Lamott: If this supermajority wanted folks to write more warmly about them, they should have behaved better.
I did correct a detail in the column that the speaker pointed out and that I had gotten wrong. I apologize for the error. Contrary to the speaker’s assertions, I care about the facts; I want to know and write the truth. What I won’t do is shut up. 
I am a woman with a voice that refuses to be stifled.
I refuse to kowtow to those who would silence dissent.
I will continue to bear witness and tell my fellow citizens exactly what I witness in an arrogant Frankfort supermajority that bristles when everyone doesn’t stand up and applaud.
If their ideas are so good, should they not welcome robust discussion? 
It seems this GOP supermajority of mostly older white men would rather all of us pesky women and minority groups just shut up and go away and let them have their good ol’ boy fun. 
The inability of our Republican supermajority to hear, or even acknowledge, that other life experiences and views exist is what I witnessed throughout the 2025 Kentucky General Assembly. 
It was not democratic. 
It was racist, sexist, embarrassing and unprofessional.
It was shameful.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/240227Lantern007-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-28 05:57:58.013651

When Stephanie Russo Carroll, a citizen of the Native Village of Kluti-Kaah in Alaska, set out to earn her doctorate in tribal health 15 years ago, she focused her research on tribal cultural and health programs within six tribes.
She needed vital statistics data, such as birth and death rates, for each of them. But getting that data from the state, which houses vital statistics, was difficult — and in some cases, the data she needed was missing.
“Health outcomes data were unobtainable,” Carroll recalled. In one case, her team had to try using breastfeeding rates as a proxy to estimate birth rates. But even getting those for all six tribes was impossible.
For the next two decades, Carroll would continue to push for U.S. tribes — which are sovereign nations — to own and maintain control over their data, including health statistics.
The concept, known as data sovereignty, is important amid the harrowing health disparities seen in tribal people, rooted in forced assimilation dating back more than a century. Often, data gathered by and about tribes has been shared with state and federal agencies; but those same agencies haven’t always shared their tribal-related statistics in return.
The reasons vary, from systemic issues within the health care system to mistaken assumptions by some federal officials about what data be securely sent to tribes without risking privacy violations.
The lack of tribe-specific data has hindered tribes from fully taking care of their members and clouded their work on public health responses to disease outbreaks such as syphilis and COVID-19, on maternal and infant health outcomes, and on chronic issues such as diabetes, heart disease and substance use.
Data sovereignty is especially relevant now, as the Trump administration scrubs federal health websites of data that recognizes and tracks metrics among the country’s various racial and ethnic groups, including what little data there is on tribal members.
States govern their own health data systems. But the same isn’t true for the nation’s 574 federally recognized tribes.
Now an associate professor of public health at the University of Arizona, Carroll co-founded the U.S. Indigenous Data Sovereignty Network and directs the Collaboratory for Indigenous Data Governance. Both are groups that work to research and strengthen Indigenous data governance, accuracy and data-driven policy.
“If you don’t know who has been sick or hospitalized,” Carroll said, “how can you make sure you have the right care systems for your community?”
 Withholding tribes’ data

As part of its slashing of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, the Trump administration removed numerous racial, ethnic, adolescent and maternal health datasets from the websites of several federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While some of the data has been reinstated, the swift deletions raised alarms in tribal communities.
Abigail Echo-Hawk, a member of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma and director of the Urban Indian Health Institute, said the youth behavioral risk surveys were reinstated, but were missing key race and ethnicity search features that tribes use to track mental health conditions in American Indian and Alaska Native teens.
“Now, we can’t search, disaggregate by Native youth,” she said. “That information is about our children, and it is the legal right of both now the tribal epidemiology centers and the tribes to have access to that previously gathered information.”

Despite their public health authority, tribes and tribal epidemiology centers, which support tribes with health data tracking, say federal and state health officials have long withheld or denied requests to direct access of health data related to their tribes, including coronavirus data during the pandemic.
Such data is tied to treaty rights obligations and shouldn’t be lumped together with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives currently under attack by the Trump administration, Echo-Hawk said.
“Our treaty rights are tied to having information around tribal people. So, if you’re going to uphold our treaty rights, you need to say: ‘This number of Native people are experiencing this issue,’ or ‘This number of Native people exist,’” she said.
It wasn’t until 2021 that the CDC conducted its first comprehensive life expectancy profile of American Indians and Alaska Natives; it showed that in 2019, their life expectancy was seven years lower than that of white people.
“All of the data is a story. It’s a grandmother, it’s a son, it’s a story of a community’s well-being,” Echo-Hawk said.
When tribes receive federal grants — whether for transportation, housing or education initiatives — there are grant reporting requirements.













All of data is a story. It's a grandmother, it's a son, it's a story of a community's well-being.


– Abigail Echo-Hawk, director of the Urban Indian Public Health Institute





Under those rules, tribes send raw data to federal agencies, but they often don’t get that data back, said social demographer Desi Small-Rodriguez, an assistant professor of sociology and American Indian studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, who co-founded the data sovereignty network with Carroll.
“It’s a one-way data highway coming from tribal governments — leaving tribal governments and going into the feds — and it’s not coming back,” said Small-Rodriguez. She also directs the Data Warriors Lab, working with tribes — including her own Northern Cheyenne Tribe of Montana — to develop legal mechanisms to ensure data ownership.
She said the federal government should provide funding, as part of its treaty obligations, to pay for expensive data support such as secure storage systems, high-performance computers and analytics staff.
“As part of our treaty rights, we have a right to health care and education. We have a right to clean water and air — and data form the basis for all of that,” she said.
 State data agreements

In January, the Tulalip Tribes in northwest Washington state secured a data-sharing agreement with the state department of health. It gives the tribes access to the state’s disease reporting system, allowing them to extract some data directly. Tulalip plans to eventually secure access to more datasets.
It’s the first agreement of its kind in the state, said Summer Hammons, legislative policy analyst in the Treaty Rights and Governmental Affairs Department of the Tulalip Tribes, which has at least 5,000 members. Hammons grew up on the reservation.
She hopes it will help the tribe direct resources and funds where they’re needed — whether it’s more cancer screenings or vaccinations against diseases such as measles, as other states grapple with outbreaks of the virus.
“It allows us to collaborate and lead on outbreak investigations related to tribal members,” Hammons said. “It’s a clear outline that tribes own their data in partnership with the state, because the state’s the one that’s collecting it. But we want to tell our story, and we want to be able to work with DOH [department of health] to be mindful of our stories and to also get better access to the statistics.”
A few other states — Alaska, Arizona, Oregon and South Dakota — also have limited-scope agreements with tribes.
Gary Ferguson, Unangax (Aleut), is the director of integrative medicine at Tulalip Health Clinic. He said he hopes the data will help the tribe track health care interventions over time.
“We don’t know what’s working. We don’t know what’s not working,” he said. “We want to celebrate our wins.”
 Tracking disease

In recent years, the nation has seen alarming surges in congenital syphilis, a preventable infection passed through pregnancy to newborns. Nearly 40% can be stillborn or die as a newborn. Babies can also suffer lifelong blindness or deafness. Tribal babies suffer the highest rate.
Officials at the Great Plains Tribal Epidemiology Center, which tracks tribal public health across four states, were denied syphilis data from local public health departments for years until the group leaned on the CDC for assistance.
It wasn’t until then that, finally, last year, one state — South Dakota — agreed to share American Indian and Alaska Native syphilis cases as soon as they’re reported, said Sarah Shewbrooks, the group’s lead tribal epidemiologist. Shewbrooks hopes the new South Dakota access will pave the way for more agreements in the other Great Plains states.
Shewbrooks hopes the access in South Dakota will pave the way for more agreements in the other Great Plains states.
 ‘We needed this yesterday’

During COVID-19, American Indian and Alaska Native people were more likely to be infected and compared with white people, had double the risk of in-hospital death and three times the rate of severe infection, research shows. Yet even then, data weren’t telling the whole story.
Echo-Hawk’s organization published a report card in 2021 that scored each state’s collection of Natives’ COVID-19 cases. In total, the nation averaged a D+. This year, she published a follow-up for epidemiologists on addressing the misclassification of Native people, who often are listed as “white” or “Hispanic” in health settings and death certificates. Many states also inconsistently or don’t report tribal affiliation on death certificates, which can make tribe-specific death rates elusive.
A report in 2021 from the nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office found that some officials from the CDC and the Indian Health Services agency didn’t recognize that they were required by law to share data with tribal epidemiology centers, the centers told investigators.
In the GAO report, investigators detailed logistical barriers, including federal agencies’ reluctance to share COVID-19 data because of concerns around privacy and security in data transmission.
“This is one of the best examples of what structural racism looks like,” said Shewbrooks. “Because when you look at the infrastructure for public health systems and public health data, tribes and [tribal epidemiology centers] were never included in that infrastructure.
“COVID really put it up there as: No, we needed this yesterday.”
Shewbrooks said that as part of her work she’d go to funeral directors, who may fill out death certificates, throughout the region to educate them on proper classification of American Indian people. “I even had one say to me once, ‘I just always code them by how they look. I never ask what their race is.’”
“A lot of them didn’t know that this is data that gets really used,” she said. “Vital records data is just super important, foundational work in a lot of epidemiological work.”

There is no national standard for tribal health data, explained Cheryl Ellenwood, who is a citizen of the Nez Perce Nation and also Diné (Navajo).
Ellenwood, an assistant professor in Washington State University’s School of Politics, Philosophy and Public Affairs, experienced firsthand the data disconnect when both her parents died of COVID-19.
Four years ago this month, her mother, Annie Benally Ellenwood, an enrolled Navajo tribal member from New Mexico, died at age 71 in a hospital in Idaho. Annie Ellenwood’s death, however, wouldn’t show up in primary statistics of COVID-19 deaths in Navajo people — her tribe isn’t listed on her death certificate.
“I was very hurt by this, because my mother died because of COVID-19, and I wanted her death to count and mean something,” Ellenwood said.
“It still feels very life and death, like we are fighting to demonstrate the impact of so many things on our people,” she said.

You can feel it walking in neighborhoods, shopping in grocery stores, talking with friends. We are far away from Washington, D.C., geographically, but the upheaval there and at an ostentatious country club in south Florida is seeping into the hearts and minds of those who live here.
People may be going about their day-to-day lives, but they are also on edge. They can’t help wondering what the vans holding the ICE agents look like. Hearing sirens, whether they are close by or in the distance, brings worries about what may be happening to individuals they may be close to or someone they have had a brief, friendly encounter with at a restaurant, at their children’s school, or at a sporting event.
It is not only the threat to those who could face deportation. There are many federal employees in Colorado. They do important work, whether it is weather forecasting, agricultural research, or simply helping those eligible for federal benefits. A lot of them have lost their jobs and those still working are walking on egg shells, wondering when their position might be eliminated. Meanwhile, everyone is losing access to the research they do and services they provide.

There is also the disbelief that so much of what we have come to expect as normal — friendly relations with other nations who share our values, opposition to authoritarian dictators, rejection of corruption and bribery in our elected officials — has been turned on its head. How do you comfort the family of a member of the armed forces who supposedly died defending democracy when democracy itself appears to be dying?
It all brings on feelings of anger and disgust, but also helplessness. What can you do? It is easy to send a message to your senators and representative in the U.S. House, but they are either sympathetic and powerless or dismissive of your concerns.
Capacity crowds turn out in Colorado for Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez

The helplessness needed an outlet.
And that is what the rally held by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders last week in Denver provided. Of course, the real goal of their visit to Colorado was to go to Rep. Gabe Evans’ district and goad him for his unwillingness to hear from his constituents who oppose the Trump/Musk regime’s actions. The turnout to the event in Greeley set the stage for the challenge coming to Evans in 2026.
But the rally in Denver was different. Walking amongst the crowd, there was a sense that the people there were finally exhaling after holding their breath for the past two months. Everyone was looking around, coming to the realization they were not the only ones frightened and dismayed by what is happening to the nation where they reside. There was comfort in the size of the turnout, comfort in knowing there is a willingness to challenge the darkness of the Trump administration.
It really did not matter what Rep. Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders said when they spoke. The power of their message was not in their words. The power of their message was in the response to their invitation to gather together on a Friday afternoon in downtown Denver. They could not promise a quick or easy fix to the situation in which the United States finds itself as a result of the 2024 presidential election. But they did show there is a large contingent of those who live in the Denver area ready to turn out and make noise in order to bring back hope for a just and caring society.
There will continue to be bad news for Coloradans over the coming weeks and months. Regular payments to Social Security beneficiaries could be threatened. Clean air and clean water will be under attack. Assistance for families needing help to make ends meet or to care for aging parents may be drastically reduced.
The rallies in Greeley and at Civic Center Park will not change that grim prognosis by themselves. But for those who were there, as well as those who could not go but share the feelings of the crowds in attendance, the knowledge there is a desire by many to oppose our current descent into authoritarianism can lift spirits — and spur action.

(Photo courtesy of Eric Klotz)Eric Klotz, a combat-disabled U.S. Navy veteran with nearly two decades of service in special operations, was sitting at his home in Hardy, a quiet community near Smith Mountain Lake, when the phone rang. On the other end was Eric Mosley, a fellow veteran and Democratic organizer, asking Klotz if he would once again serve — this time by running for the 39th House of Delegates District.
A longtime Republican who switched parties when Donald Trump first assumed office in 2016, Klotz, 53, had watched the political landscape shift dramatically during the first few months of Trump’s second presidency. The erosion of the country’s foundational principles, especially after his years of military service, troubled him deeply.
“I did a lot of deployments overseas, and I have experience living in countries controlled by authoritarian governments. I witnessed the suppression of individual rights and liberties, something we used to believe was protected by the U.S. Constitution,” Klotz said in a phone interview. “I can’t stand idly by while that birthright is under attack here at home. I took an oath to defend the Constitution, and it’s not just for some, it’s for all.”
On Wednesday, Klotz filed the paperwork to run as a Democrat in a historically conservative seat, currently represented by Del. Will Davis, R-Franklin. Despite the district’s strong Republican leanings, Klotz’s military background and willingness to cross party lines to fight for the principles he believes in have made him a unique contender.
Klotz is among a growing number of veterans stepping up to run for office — as Democrats — in traditionally conservative districts. They hope that their stories and experience in military service will resonate with moderate Republicans and independents, especially amid growing concerns over Trump’s military leadership decisions, including recent firings of military leadership and the controversial national security leaks surrounding classified war plans.
“This is a very strong military area,” Klotz said of the 39th District. “People here take pride in their service, and that’s something I respect deeply. My military background allows me to relate to a lot of people, and it bridges across party lines.”
The push to field more candidates in conservative districts, particularly those with military backgrounds, is part of a broader strategy by several grassroots organizers to increase voter turnout in hopes of flipping key districts. At the same time, Democrats aim to bolster support for former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a retired CIA officer who is expected to be the party’s gubernatorial nominee, and her bid to claim the governor’s office this November.
One of these organizers is Mosley, a retired naval aviator and Republican-turned-Democrat from Bedford County, who earlier this month received a call from Dr. Fergie Reid of the 90 for 90 Voter Registration Project, about finding a veteran willing to run in District 39. Without hesitation,  Mosley thought of Klotz.
“I’ve seen an attack on democracy from Republicans, and that’s what pushed me to get involved. Eric Klotz is a proven leader with the courage to stand up for what’s right, regardless of fear,” Mosely said. “I believe veterans like Eric, who have devoted their lives to defending the Constitution, can speak to Republicans who may be disillusioned with the direction the current administration is taking.”
 At least eight House Democrats are veterans 

And while Klotz is focusing on District 39, he is not alone in his mission. Veterans are running for other conservative-leaning districts across the state. 
In District 67, Mario Haggerty, a former U.S. Navy officer and veteran of overseas service in Europe and Japan, is one of two Democrats seeking the party’s nomination. Haggerty, who now manages defense projects and works with the Missile Defense Agency, is hoping to bring his expertise and perspective to the General Assembly.
Stacey Carroll, a National Guard non-commissioned officer with 19 years of service, is running in District 64. She will be facing Del. Paul Milde, R-Stafford, in November. Shane Boswell, a former Navy chief petty officer, is challenging Republican Del. Delores Oates, R-Warren, in District 31, which includes parts of Clarke, Frederick, and Warren Counties. 
Meanwhile, in District 75, a once conservative district south of Richmond, U.S. Army combat veteran Steven Miller-Pitts is vying for the seat held by Republican Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield. Additionally, U.S. Marine Corps veteran Jasmine Lipscomb is once again seeking the Democratic nomination in District 49, which includes Danville and parts of Halifax and Pittsylvania counties, hoping to build on her previous campaign.
At least eight Democratic veterans are already serving in the House of Delegates, including Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, a Navy vet who has served on the USS John Hancock, Del. Jackie Glass, D-Norfolk, also a Navy veteran, and Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, a West Point graduate with combat experience in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Others include Del. Michael Feggans, D-Virginia Beach, Del. Marty Martinez, D-Loudoun, Del. David Reid, D-Loudoun, Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, and Del. Josh Thomas, D-Prince William. 
Helmer, who serves as the House Democrats campaigns chair, on Thursday took on a new role as co-chair of The Next Mission, a national recruitment committee for veterans. This effort, part of the New Politics organization, aims to support candidates from military service backgrounds and is backed by $20 million in funding. Helmer sees this initiative as critical, especially given the current state of the nation’s political landscape.
“This is a national phenomenon, not just a Virginia phenomenon,” Helmer said in a phone interview. “This effort comes at an unprecedented time of risk to our democracy. To have those who’ve sworn an oath to uphold and defend the constitution step forward to serve again in a new way is essential right now.”
Helmer emphasized that veterans, having fought to protect democratic ideals, are uniquely positioned to lead during these turbulent times. 
“Time and again, those who have stood up for democracy, served side by side with those willing to put their lives on the line for it, and sworn an oath to defend our constitution, are stunned by what we are seeing today. And many of them have stepped forward to serve again.”
 Trump policies leave many veterans “terrified”

Herb Rubenstein, chairman of the Lex-Rock-BV Democratic Committee, a coalition of party committees from Lexington, Rockingham County, and Buena Vista, said efforts are underway to recruit veterans for political office at all levels, from Congress to local positions.
“We’re not just reacting; we’re rejecting the people who are bombastic and dangerous,” Rubenstein said, referencing current Republican leaders in Congress, including seven Navy SEALs. 
He voiced concerns over the Trump administration’s handling of national security. 
“Many veterans are terrified. This guy (Trump) is selling us out to adversaries, using unsecure encrypted systems to communicate, and he’s been doing it for a long time. The military has a lot at stake. We need adults in the room for political governance — especially when it comes to the civilian leadership of our military. Former military personnel represent those adults, and they bring a high level of integrity.”
Rubenstein pointed to the significant financial backing of VoteVets, a Democratic group supporting veterans in politics, which recently donated $500,000 to Spanberger’s gubernatorial campaign — the largest donation in the group’s 20-year history, according to the New York Times. 
Rubenstein sees Spanberger as the type of candidate capable of leading the Democratic Party back to power in Virginia.
“We’ve got to activate our veterans, not just have them run for state office,” Rubenstein emphasized. “We need them on city councils, planning commissions, and economic development boards. That’s the evolution of this effort, and seeing veterans run in House districts is the result of years of hard work, particularly in the wake of a really destructive president.”
Reid, of the 90 for 90 Voter Registration Project, noted that the push to recruit military veterans as Democratic candidates in conservative districts is part of a broader strategy to increase Democratic turnout, not just flip seats. He emphasized the importance of offering voters a real choice, especially in areas traditionally dominated by Republicans.
“Given what’s going on in the national political world, it’s important for every Virginian to have a choice on the ballot,” Reid said. “Whether they want to vote for the Republican or the Democrat, that’s on them, but they should have the option to vote for either, especially when the party in control of the country right now is messing up so badly. There should be the option to send a message to the other party.”
Reid noted that in “super-Republican” districts, where Democrats often face significant challenges, some “remarkable” candidates are ready to take on the challenge. 
“It’s really interesting who will step up in these districts, where people have a really good reason to be fearful to run if they’re a Democrat. So who do we see stepping up in these districts? We see women stepping up. We see Black people stepping up, and we see military people stepping up.”
Reid believes these candidates can play a critical role in not just flipping seats but also in bolstering Democratic chances up and down the ballot.
But David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, remains cautious about the potential impact of veterans running as Democratic candidates in deeply Republican districts, such as the 39th. 
“I am hesitant to say that anything will help Democrats in a district like that, where more than two-thirds of the voters are Republicans,” Richards said. However, he acknowledged the strategic significance of candidates like Klotz, the special operations veteran.
Richards pointed to the success Democrats had with Eugene Vindman, a U.S. Army veteran, in the 7th Congressional District, though he noted that Vindman’s national profile made his candidacy an exceptional case. 
“If we start to see more moderate, former military folks run, that could spell trouble for Republicans in Virginia,” Richards explained. He added that with Trump losing the state by less than 6%, Virginia’s political landscape is still competitive, particularly in local races.
While District 39 may seem like an unlikely battleground, Klotz is gearing up for a different kind of fight.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Kevin Nance)For 236 years the United States has benefited from a government built on effective checks and balances among its three branches. 
Now our system is under attack by the head of one branch, who wants to discredit another branch, the judiciary. That branch is not designed for the political and public-relations combat that President Trump relishes, because it speaks slowly and deliberately, through rulings the other branches are supposed to respect. Trump and his minions show little respect, so we should be hearing more objections from the third branch, Congress — not just about Trump’s assault on the rule of law, but his abrupt changes in foreign policy and the chainsaw approach that he and the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, are taking to the executive branch.
We’ve heard little from Republicans who control Congress, because most fear Trump and Musk will fund challenges to them in the primaries of 2026. They also fear abuse that could rain down on them from Trumpist information sources, the sort of abuse that can incite violence; there’s been a surge in physical threats to members of Congress. Clearly, Republicans fear that if they confront Trump, he will end their political careers with his money and the hold he has on Republican voters.
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska (Official photo)
Says who? GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. When a reporter there asked her March 18 if she had been sufficiently outspoken about Trump and Musk, though she’s been one of the most outspoken Republicans, she said some important things, even about her Republican colleagues:
“I get criticized for what I say, and then get asked, ‘How come nobody else is saying anything?’ Well, figure it out. They’re looking at how many things are being thrown at me, and it’s like, ‘Maybe I just better duck and cover. That’s why you’ve got everybody just like, zip-lip, not saying a word because they’re afraid they’re going to be taken down, they’re going to be primaried, they’re going to be given names in the media. You know what? We cannot be cowed into not speaking up.”
Leading into that, she said, “I’m not going to compromise my integrity by hiding my words when I feel they need to be spoken. I’m gonna take the criticism that comes, and it may be that Elon Musk has decided he may take the next billion dollars he makes off of Starlink and put it directly against Lisa Murkowski. … But I’m not giving up one minute, one opportunity, to stand up for Alaskans. But I’ve got to figure out how to do that, and I need Alaskans’ help to tell me what they are feeling, so that I can help deal with that.”
So speaks a servant leader, who wants to hear from voters. That’s not the approach of most congressional Republicans, whose House leaders have advised them not to have in-person, town-hall meetings that could put them on the defensive. On March 22, an ad hoc, bipartisan group in Lexington organized a town hall and invited 6th District Rep. Andy Barr. He didn’t show, and claimed without proof that it was organized and attended by paid activists, the line House leaders are using. Organizers denied that, and the crowd of 900-plus seemed to be a true grassroots uprising.
One speaker was “lifelong Republican” Edwin Gibson, 70, who recalled serving along the Iron Curtain: “Congressman Barr, you are complicit in the betrayal of our democracy.” He told me that he was referring to Barr’s “support of this rogue president and this rogue president supporting the war criminal Putin and how offensive it is to me and every other soldier.”

Barr seems to consider such events dangerous because he wants to run for U.S. senator and is desperate for the endorsement of Trump — who backed the only declared Republican candidate, Daniel Cameron, for governor in 2023 — or at least wants to keep Cameron or wealthy newcomer Nate Morris from getting the president’s backing. So, he does “tele-townhalls,” a form of conference calls (you sign up on his website), and appears before friendly audiences like the Lexington Chamber of Commerce.
A less likely Senate candidate is 4th District Rep. Thomas Massie, who exhibits no fear of Trump. After he was the only Republican to vote against the latest bill to keep the government open, Trump said “He should be primaried, and I will lead the charge against him.” Massie appealed for contributions, saying “Telling the truth can get you in hot water,” and reported a few days later that he raised $261,000 in three days, a record for him.
Massie’s strength comes from his constituents and the online supporters he has cultivated. Trump’s comes from his cultish followers and the big money allowed by the campaign-finance system that Sen. Mitch McConnell wanted. I wonder what he thinks about it now.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DSC_0605-1_DxO-1024x819.jpg,,,2025-03-28 05:57:58.013651

Travelers will likely get some help navigating their journey with technology developed by Virginia native Gladys West, who was key in creating the Global Positioning System (GPS). While sharing insights from her groundbreaking career, like many Virginia school kids, West, like many Virginia school kids, also had spring break top of mind. She said her favorite place in the state to visit with her late husband Ira West was Williamsburg.
“It has history to discover, outlets for shopping, good food and a quiet atmosphere,” 94-year-old West said in an interview. 
Born in Sutherland in Dinwiddie County, West is a pioneering mathematician who made valuable contributions to several technological advances that helped transform the way humans navigate the world and understand its dimensions. The state honored her with a resolution passed by the Virginia General Assembly in 2018. 
Beginning in 1956, West began to carve out her most notable work at the Naval Proving Ground, now called Naval Support Facility Dahlgren in King George County.
The second African American woman hired at Dahlgren and one of only four African American employees at the time, she was known for her skill in calculating complex mathematical equations and computer programming.

West excelled working on satellite geodesy, which is used to make measurements of the Earth, and other satellite measurements that contributed to the accuracy of GPS. The technology is now used in cars and on devices globally.
She also received commendation as the project manager for the radar altimetry data processing project of Seasat, the first satellite designed for remote sensing of the Earth’s oceans.
West retired with 42 years of service.
One of her earliest motivations to be successful was simple: keeping tidy. When West was young, she had to help out on her family’s farm even if it meant getting dirty, which she despised.
“I aspired to do something outside of farm work and I knew that having a good education would be the key,” West said. “That motivated me to do well in school so that I could get a scholarship and go to college. I had a great support system and many mentors along the way who kept me motivated.”
She graduated from Virginia State University with a bachelor’s degree in mathematics, and earned her masters of public administration from the University of Oklahoma and a doctorate in public administration from Virginia Tech. Between her studies, West also taught in Sussex County. Today, she continues to be recognized for her work. She published her memoir “It Began with A Dream” in 2020.
 Spring break travel outlook

Motoring around Virginia during spring break should be a relief to drivers, compared to a year ago.
According to AAA, the state average for a gallon of gas has dropped from last year’s $3.45 to $2.96. The national average is $3.15 as of Thursday.
Clean car drivers are subject to paying an average of 34 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity in Virginia and nationwide.
Juliana Thomas, a spokeswoman for Virginia Tourism Corporation, home of Virginia Is For Lovers, said “Virginia absolutely shines in the springtime.” Thomas touted several areas as great spring break destinations including Alexandria, named one of the Top Spring Travel Destinations by NBC, and Williamsburg, home to Busch Gardens — one of two theme parks in the commonwealth.
“From vibrant cities to charming historic towns, breathtaking outdoor escapes, and family-friendly coastal getaways, the commonwealth offers a diverse array of getaway options, with something that will appeal to every traveler,” Thomas said.
West said it’s always refreshing to hear how her work is now being used outside of the government and said she is still amazed by the technological advancements navigation has made since the GPS Project began in 1973.
“It never gets too old,” West said. “I am just so pleased that I was able to make a contribution. When I was working, I never imagined that the GPS would be used in the civilian world. I love seeing all the ways that it can be used and I probably have no idea how vastly used it is.”

Crosby (D-St. Mary's) said a tech tax will hurt businesses such as his that do federal contracting. Last week, on the same day a budget agreement that included the tax was announced, Crosby moved his business to Virginia. (Photo Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Del. Brian M. Crosby (D-St Mary’s) is vice chair of the House Economic Matters Committee — a panel that handles many business issues — as well as the owner of a small business that is a subcontractor on Defense IT contracts.
Until last week, that business was based in Maryland.
But Crosby was already in the process of moving his business to Virginia last week when the governor and legislative leaders announced a budget deal that includes a 3% tax on IT, among other services, a tax that critics say poses an existential threat to businesses such as Crosby’s that contract with federal agencies.
“I listened to the announcement in the truck,” he said, describing the move that came on the same day as the budget announcement.
“I’ve raised these issues,” Crosby said. “I don’t know what to say. I think people are still convinced that you’re getting 50 cents of $1 or something.”
Instead, he said the tax would mean businesses such as his would lose money on every transaction.
“All I can say is you’re not taking 50 cents on $1,” Crosby said. “You’re taking $1.50 from $1.”

Crosby told his story Tuesday, minutes after his Democratic colleagues muscled through a two-bill spending plan on a preliminary vote. That plan includes the tax on data and IT services that is expected to raise nearly $500 million annually, part of the $1 billion in new revenues — and $2.5 billion in spending cuts — needed to close a $3 billion gap in the fiscal 2026 budget.
Crosby noted the irony of the situation. Gov. Wes Moore (D) and other legislators say they want to grow private industry and attract IT jobs to the area. One of the largest components of that industry are the numerous defense facilities in the state — Patuxent River, Fort Meade, Fort Detrick and others.
“On one hand, we’re saying we’re the IT-cyber corridor,” said Crosby. “On the other hand, the industry, which I’m a part of, is saying if you’re in the DoD [Department of Defense] segment, which is the state’s number one industry, you can’t make it on that (tax).
“The commercial companies, they can pass it off,” he said. “It’s not the same for the DoD guys, especially the smaller guys, it’s not as easy.”
Smaller companies such as Crosby’s often work as subcontractors to large prime contractors that are based out of state and, thus, not subject to the proposed tax, that is soon to head to the Senate. Subcontractors based in Maryland are not exempt.
Crosby’s five-year old company — he asked that it not be named — has been growing. He has a warehouse location in Georgia, where he plans to register his company while keeping a small presence in Maryland and a new office in Virginia Beach.
The new out-of-state company will deliver on its contracts as before to its larger prime, typically exempt, contractor partners that will deliver services to the federal facilities in Maryland.
“We know the numbers,” Crosby said when asked about how the change would affect companies that do the same type of contracting. “All I can say is that within a year, we’d file for bankruptcy.”
So Crosby acted fast. The House and Senate have an agreement on the tax. Delaying a move would mean needing more trucks, as materials needed for third-quarter projects are soon to arrive. There’s also the matter of bidding on future contracts.
Delaying a move was too risky, Crosby said.
Crosby may not be alone in his move should the tax pass as expected. The state Cybersecurity Association Inc. estimated that about 800 businesses similar to Crosby’s could be affected by a services tax. The Maryland Chamber of Commerce estimates more than 15,000 businesses, which employ an estimated 100,000 people, would be subject to the new tax.
During Tuesday’s floor debate in the House, Republicans tried to strip out the IT services tax — one of more than a dozen failed amendments offered during a sometimes testy four-hour debate.
Del. Todd Morgan (R-Calvert and St. Mary’s) stood feet away from Crosby as he described the choice faced by his Democratic colleague.
“Now I’m going to bring this home, ladies and gentlemen, to this room, to our colleagues, to one of my friends on the other side of the aisle,” Morgan said. “That individual is moving his business to Virginia.
“I’ll say this again, one of the colleagues in this room, who’s our friend on the other side of the aisle, is moving his business to Virginia as we speak,” he said. “So I just want that to sink in when we look at how big this picture is.”

(Rick Kern/Getty Images for National Council on Aging)Dr. Fred Levin has been watching with growing alarm the national debate around federal cuts to Medicaid. He’s responsible for the medical care of about 100 older adults at the Community PACE center in rural Newaygo, Michigan. For his patients, Medicaid isn’t just a safety net — it’s a matter of life or death.
“If left to see to their own needs, a lot of them would stay in their homes and would slowly die,” he said. “They wouldn’t be able to get to their doctors’ appointments unless they had a family member to help. They wouldn’t get social care. They wouldn’t have people coming into their homes and seeing the bed bugs or the lice in their hair. They wouldn’t get their medications.”
The care at Community PACE is paid for by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities, and Medicare, the federal insurance program for people 65 and older. The center is a one-stop shop that provides medical and social services to older adults during the day, allowing them to continue living safely in their homes.
If Congress cuts funding to Medicaid, Levin expects his center would probably close. Unlike traditional nursing home care, which state Medicaid programs are required by federal law to cover, the services at PACE centers like his are an optional benefit that 33 states have opted to cover.
Around the nation, doctors, lawmakers, advocates and patients are watching anxiously as Republicans in Congress consider proposals to slash billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in proposed tax cuts. The specific nature of the funding cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states.










If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved.


– Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy, Justice in Aging


The additional financial burden could blow billion-dollar holes in state budgets, forcing state lawmakers to slash health benefits or restrict who’s eligible for them. Nearly a fifth of Americans rely on Medicaid, and the percentage is even higher in some states.
“There are a lot of people who don’t pay attention to this because they think it doesn’t affect them personally,” Levin said. “But 1 in 4 people in Michigan are on Medicaid. It’s very likely you have friends or family on Medicaid.”
Nearly all Americans over age 65 are covered by Medicare, which Republicans have pledged not to touch. Medicare doesn’t cover most nursing home or other long-term care, however. Neither does most private insurance.
But Medicaid does.
“If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved,” said Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy for Justice in Aging, an advocacy group focused on addressing poverty among older people.
“Many of us have a connection to the program or will one day,” she said.
A divided front
Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But policy experts say that reducing coverage for some Medicaid recipients, such as the working adults who got coverage under expansion programs, will have ripple effects on vulnerable groups such as children and older adults.
Republicans aren’t united in a desire to see massive cuts.
Last month, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican governor in a purple state, publicly called on Congress not to slash Medicaid funding.
Health insurance for millions could vanish as states put Medicaid expansion on chopping block

Earlier this week, Washington Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier wrote a letter to Trump asking him to reconsider cuts to Medicaid and expressing her concern about the large number of military retirees and senior citizens in her district.
Caldier, a dentist who has worked with nursing home patients, told Stateline she believes the most likely cuts would be a reduction in the amount the federal government matches state spending for working adults who are covered under Medicaid expansion. That, she said, would have little impact on older adults.
“The only caveat is that I am very worried that the leadership in our state does not have a good relationship with our president,” Caldier said. Democrats control the offices of governor and both legislative chambers in Washington state. Caldier worries that if Washington lawmakers defy the president over issues such as gender-affirming care for transgender youth, the feds could retaliate by slashing their Medicaid payments to the state.
“If we got into a political match with the president, we would lose, no matter how you slice or dice it,” she said.
In Idaho, Republican state lawmakers shot down a bill that likely would have repealed Medicaid expansion, before passing one that will introduce sweeping policy changes in an effort to control costs.
Even in Congress, some Republicans are balking, publicly defending Medicaid and warning about the consequences of deep cuts. Some who have high percentages of Medicaid recipients in their districts have urged party leaders not to cut funding for the program and have vowed to vote against any budget plan that does so.
Medicaid covers 72 million Americans. A majority of American adults, including two-thirds of Republicans, say they want Congress to either maintain current Medicaid spending or increase it, according to a February 2025 poll from KFF, a health policy research group.
President Donald Trump has said in recent months that he won’t touch Medicaid. But last month, U.S. House Republicans pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that calls for about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help counterbalance the Trump administration’s desired $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.
Facing cuts that large, states would have to figure out which benefits to chop in order to keep their budgets balanced, which is a constitutional requirement in most states.
Older adults and people with disabilities already account for more than half of states’ Medicaid spending, on average. In some states, including Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Mississippi and North Dakota, those groups account for two-thirds of state Medicaid spending.
Idaho state Sen. Melissa Wintrow, a Democrat on the state Senate Health & Welfare committee, said her biggest concern is Congress reducing the federal match rate. This is the amount of money the federal government chips in to help states pay for Medicaid. How much a state receives mainly depends on how wealthy its residents are. Richer states such as California and Connecticut get less help, while poorer states get more.
In Idaho, on the poorer end of the spectrum, the feds pay about 67% of traditional Medicaid costs and 90% of Medicaid expansion costs.
“It is all a domino effect,” Wintrow said. The federal government covers about $3 billion of Idaho’s $4.2 billion Medicaid budget. “If the feds start chopping that off, it’s going to impact everything.”
Cutting care at home
All state Medicaid programs have opted to cover at least some home-based and community care, such as home health aides who assist people with bathing, toileting and other daily living activities, transportation and adult day care.
Kean and other experts worry that because federal law doesn’t require state Medicaid programs to cover home-based care, state lawmakers might sharply reduce spending on those services — or even eliminate coverage.
‘Are nursing homes our only option?’ These centers offer older adults an alternative.

“When states have budget shortfalls, they start to tighten eligibility for the home-based programs,” said Kean. “We’re certain those would be the first to go if federal funding is cut for Medicaid.”
Paying for home-based services out of pocket would exhaust the median Medicare recipient’s savings in less than two years, according to KFF.
The median cost of a year of full-time aide to help is about $62,400, far above the median income for Americans over 65, which is about $36,000. The median life savings for Medicare beneficiaries was $103,800 in 2023.
Home-based services are a popular benefit for state Medicaid programs, because most enrollees prefer to remain in their homes. And despite the expense, home care can be more cost effective than nursing homes — about $38,000 vs. nearly $54,000 per year in 2021, according to a KFF analysis.
Cutting Medicaid also could make it harder to recruit and keep a workforce of nursing home and home health employees.
Over the past two years, most states — even those led by Republicans — increased their Medicaid payment rates for those services, in an effort to combat the nationwide shortage of long-term care workers.
But federal funding cuts could jeopardize what states are able to pay those workers.
“There’s already a direct-care workforce crisis,” Kean said. “Even if eligibility isn’t directly cut or programs aren’t cut, there wouldn’t be enough workers to provide that care. At home and in nursing facilities, the quality of care will go down.”
In rural Michigan, Levin said the PACE center where he works employs about 100 people. Its closure would impact not only those workers, but also would mean his patients would be left to find transportation and other health services on their own, even if those services are still covered by Medicaid.
“Without access in rural areas, how are these individuals going to get to the bigger cities where they can get to their health care? It’s going to overwhelm other parts of the health care system,” Levin said.
“Everybody’s going to be responsible for taking care of the people who don’t have health insurance, in some indirect way or another. It’s going to affect us all.”

Fodera sobbed on phone calls with her parents. Between the fellowship application and scientific review process, she had spent a year of her life securing the funding, which helped pay for her study of the biomechanics of uterine fibroids — tissue growths that can cause severe pain, bleeding and even infertility. Uterine fibroids, an underresearched condition, impact up to 77 percent of women as they age.
“I’m afraid of what it means for women’s health,” Fodera said. “I’m just one puzzle piece in the larger scheme of what is happening. So me alone, canceling my funding will have a small impact — but canceling the funding of many will have a much larger impact. It will stall research that has been stalled for decades already. For me, that’s sad and an injustice.”
Fodera’s work was a casualty of new federal funding cuts at Columbia University, one of several schools targeted by the Trump administration. The administration is also reducing the workforce at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the agency that oversees public health research, while trying to slash NIH funding to universities.
Researchers say threats to federal research funding and President Donald Trump’s promise to eliminate any policy promoting “diversity, equity and inclusion” are threatening a decades-long effort to improve how the nation studies the health of women and queer people, or improve treatments for the medical conditions that affect them. Agency employees have been warned not to approve grants that include words such as  “women,” “trans” or “diversity.”
That could mean halting efforts to improve the nation’s understanding of conditions that predominantly affect women, including endometriosis, menopause, infectious diseases contracted in pregnancy and pregnancy-related death. It could also stall research meant to treat conditions such as asthma, heart disease, depression and substance abuse disorders, which have different health implications for women versus men, and also have outsized impacts on LGBTQ+ people and people of color — often underresearched patients.
“I want every generation to be healthier than the last, and I’m worried we may have some real setbacks,” said Dr. Sonja Rasmussen, a professor and clinician at Johns Hopkins University who studies the consequences of pregnancy-related infections and the causes of birth defects.










If we no longer include women or females in our research, we’re obviously going to go back to not having answers that are going to be applicable to both sexes. And I think that’s a big step backward.


– Jill Becker, University of Michigan neuroscientist



The United States already lagged in promoting scientific inquiry that considered how sex and gender can influence health — and has a recent history of focusing research on White men. Less than 50 years ago, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) actively discouraged researchers from including women who could become pregnant in clinical trials for new medical products, leaving it often unclear if U.S.-based therapeutics were safe for them. It wasn’t until 1993 that clinical trials were legally required to include women and “individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds.”
Around that same time, the federal government launched offices within the NIH, the Department of Health and Human Services and the FDA that focused on women’s health and research. Since then, efforts to consider gender in medical research have progressed, if unevenly. A report last fall from the National Academies of Science Engineering and Medicine found that in the past decade, the level of federal funding devoted to women’s health had actually declined relative to the rest of the NIH’s budget.
The report, requested by Congress, also found that researchers still struggled to understand the implications of common conditions such as endometriosis and uterine fibroids, the long-term implications of pregnancy, or gender gaps in mental health conditions — all areas where Black women in particular experience worse health outcomes or face heightened barriers to appropriate treatment. Investments had stalled in looking at how sex and gender interact with race or class in influencing people’s health outcomes.
The report ultimately called for an additional $15.8 billion over the next five years to address the gaps. Now, efforts to cut federal research funding and limit its acknowledgment of gender could thwart forward momentum.
“If we are banning this study of these issues, or deciding we’re not going to invest in that work, it freezes progress,” said Alina Salganicoff, a lead author on the report and vice president for women’s health at KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research organization.
Already, researchers whose work touches on sex or gender are anticipating losses in federal funding, which they fear could imperil their work moving forward. Some have already had their grants terminated. Many specified that they were not speaking as representatives of their employers.
Whitney Wharton, a cognitive neuroscientist at Emory University, learned on February 28 that she would no longer receive federal funding for her multi-year study looking at effective caregiving models for LGBTQ+ seniors at risk of developing Alzheimer’s. Research suggests that queer adults may be at greater risk of age-related cognitive decline, but they are far less likely to be the subject of research.
Wharton is one of numerous scientists across the country whose work was terminated because it included trans people, per letters those researchers received from the NIH. “Research programs based on gender identity are often unscientific, have little identifiable return on investment, and do nothing to enhance the health of many Americans,” the letter said.
Though Wharton’s work focused on queer adults, it proposed caregiving models that could apply to other people often without family support structures who are at heightened risk for Alzheimer’s as they age.
“The sexual and gender minority community is more likely to age alone in place. We’re less likely to be married or have children,” Wharton said. “These additional roadblocks are not only unnecessary but they are unnecessarily cruel to a community that’s already facing a lot of hardship.”
One of Wharton’s collaborators on the study is Jace Flatt, an associate professor of health and behavioral sciences at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who also received separate notice from the NIH that their research beyond the study had been terminated. Flatt studies LGBTQ+ people and their risk for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, as well as thinking about their needs for care.
Flatt said NIH funding for three of their studies have been canceled in recent weeks, as well as a Department of Defense-funded grant looking at veterans’ health that included LGBTQ+ people. The defense letter stated the research did not align with Trump’s executive order that recognizes only two sexes, male and female.
Flatt estimates about $4.5 million in federal funding was cut from their research, requiring some staff layoffs.
“I made a personal commitment to do this work. Now I’m being told, ‘Your research doesn’t benefit all Americans, and it’s unscientific,’ and basically that I’m promoting inaccurate research and findings. The tone comes across as like it’s harmful to society,” they said. “I’m a public health practitioner. I’m about improving the health and quality of life of all people.”
Jill Becker, a neuroscientist at the University of Michigan, uses rodent studies to better understand how sex differences can affect people’s responses to drug addiction and treatment. Her work has helped suggest that some forms of support and treatment can be more effective for male rats and others for female ones — a divide she hopes to interrogate to help develop appropriate treatments for people who are in recovery for substance use disorder, and, in particular, better treatment for cisgender men.
Becker’s studies were singled out in a Senate hearing by Rand Paul, a Republican, who characterized it as the type of wasteful research that shouldn’t continue. Because she looks at sex differences, she anticipates that when her NIH funding finishes at the end of the year, the agency will no longer support her — a development that could eventually force her lab and others doing similar work to shut down entirely.
“If we no longer include women or females in our research, we’re obviously going to go back to not having answers that are going to be applicable to both sexes,” she said. “And I think that’s a big step backward.”
The NIH did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In interviews with The 19th, academics broadly described a sense of widespread uncertainty. Beyond federal funding, many are unsure if they will still be able to use the government-operated databases they have relied on to conduct comprehensive research. Others said the NIH representatives they typically work with have left the organization. Virtually all said their younger colleagues are reconsidering whether to continue health research, or whether a different career path could offer more stability.
But the Trump administration has remained steadfast. In his recent joint address to Congress, Trump praised efforts to cut “appalling waste,” singling out “$8 million to make mice transgender” — a framing that misrepresented studies involving asthma and breast cancer.
The government’s rhetoric is now deterring some scholars from certain areas of study, even when they recognize a public health benefit. One North Carolina-based psychologist who studies perinatal mental health and hormone therapy for menopausal people said her team had considered expanding their research to look at that treatment’s mental health implications for trans people.
“It’s important, and I don’t have any way of doing that work at the moment,” said the psychologist, who asked that her name be withheld from publication because she fears publicly criticizing the NIH could jeopardize research funding. “There is potential for that line of research in the future, but not in this funding environment.”
The concerns spread beyond those who receive government funding. Katy Kozhimannil, a public health professor at the University of Minnesota, doesn’t receive NIH support for her research on pregnancy-related health and access to obstetrics care in rural areas. Her work has looked at perinatal health care for Native Americans, including examining intimate partner violence as a risk factor for pregnancy-related death. The findings, she hopes, could be used to help develop policy addressing the fact that Native American and Alaska Native people are more likely to die during pregnancy than White people.
But future studies may not be possible, she fears, because of an interruption in data collection to PRAMS, a comprehensive federal database with detailed information about Americans’ pregnancy-related health outcomes. Within the first weeks of the new administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reportedly told state health departments to stop collecting data to maintain the system, while saying that it will be brought back online once it is in compliance with the new government diversity policies.
Kozhimannil and other scholars in her field are worried about what that means — and whether PRAMS will continue to publish information showing outcomes by race or geography. Those would be tremendous omissions: A vast body of data shows that in the United States, Black and American Indian women are at elevated risk of dying because of pregnancy. People in rural areas face greater barriers to reproductive health care than those in urban ones. Without the information PRAMS is known for, Kozhimannil said, it will be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to conduct research that could address those divides.
It’s not clear if or when that information will be available, she added. One of her doctoral students requested access to PRAMS data in January and has still not heard back on whether it will be made available to her — a delay that is “not normal,” Kozhimannil said.
“It’s hard to imagine getting toward a future where fewer moms die giving birth in this country, because the tools we had to imagine that are not available,” she said. “I’m a creative person and I’ve been doing this a while, and I care a lot about it. But it’s pushing the boundaries of my creativity and my innovation as a researcher when some of the basic tools are not there.”
Paul Prince, a spokesperson for the CDC, acknowledged “some schedule adjustments” to PRAMS to comply with Trump’s executive orders, but claimed it does not affect the program’s continuation. He added: “PRAMS was not shut down.”
“PRAMS remains operational and continues its mission — identifying issues impacting high-risk mothers and infants, tracking health trends, and measuring progress toward improving maternal and infant health,” he said in an email.

It’s unclear the scope of long-term ramifications to health research, but Kathryn “Katie” Schubert is tracking it closely. She is the president and CEO of the Society for Women’s Health Research, an organization that has advocated on decades of congressional policy. In 2005, the group released a report that found just 3 percent of grants awarded by NIH took sex differences into consideration.
In February, her organization and other groups sent a letter to the administration highlighting the need to continue prioritizing women’s health research.
“We have gotten to the point where we know what the problems are. We know where we would like to try to solve for — so how are we going to find these solutions, and what’s the action plan?” she told The 19th.
In the past, Trump has shown a willingness to address women’s health inequity in at least in some arenas. A 2016 law, signed by former President Barack Obama, established a committee on how to better incorporate pregnant and lactating people into clinical trials. Trump continued that work under his first administration.
Still, when pharmaceutical companies began developing vaccines against COVID-19 in 2020, they at first did not include pregnant or breastfeeding people in clinical trials, despite federal policy encouraging them to do so and data showing that pregnant people were at higher risk of complications from the virus. Those same vaccine trials also initially excluded people who were HIV positive — a policy with particular ramifications for trans people, who are living with HIV at a higher rate than cisgender people — and only changed their policy after public outcry.
Trump returned to power on the heels of a renowned federal focus on women’s health research and gender equity. In 2023, President Joe Biden announced the first-ever White House Initiative on Women’s Health Research to address chronic underfunding.
During his final State of the Union address, Biden called on Congress to invest $12 billion in new funding for women’s health research. He followed that with an executive order directing federal agencies to expand and improve related research efforts.
In December, former First Lady Jill Biden led a conference at the White House where she highlighted nearly $1 billion in funding committed over the past year toward women’s health research. She told a room that included researchers: “Today isn’t the finish line; it’s the starting point. We — all of us — we have built the momentum. Now it’s up to us to make it unstoppable.”
The Trump administration rescinded the council that oversaw the research initiative. The press office for the Trump administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Schubert said prioritizing women’s health has bipartisan support, and she remains hopeful of its popularity across both sides of the aisle. She also recognizes it could mean a new era of investment sources.
“We’ll continue as an organization, of course, with our partners, to work to fulfill our mission and to advocate for that federal investment and to make sure that the workforce is there and make that policy change. We’ll do that under the best of times and the worst of times,” she said. “But I think when we think about sort of the broader community — we’ve seen other philanthropic organizations come in and say, ‘OK, we’re ready to partner and really make this investment on the private side.’”
Women’s health research has more visibility than ever, and not just because some high-profile celebrities and media personalities are investing time and money toward addressing it. Social media algorithms are also increasingly targeting messaging around women’s health and wellness. Economists estimate that investing $350 million in research that focuses on women could yield $14 billion in economic returns.
“Yes, we are in a very difficult time when it comes to the federal budget,” Schubert said. “Even in spite of that, there will be opportunities to see this issue continue to rise to the top.”
The speed and scope of those opportunities may not extend to researchers like Flatt in Nevada. They plan to appeal their NIH funding cuts, but they don’t feel optimistic — in part because the letters state that no modifications of their projects will change the agency’s decision.
Flatt noted that in recent weeks, some people have suggested that they exclude transgender people from their studies. Flatt said excluding people of all genders is not pro-science.
“I refuse to do that,” they said. “The administration is saying that it needs to be for all Americans. They are Americans.”
Fodera, the Columbia doctoral student, will continue her research on uterine fibroids for now, due partly to timing and luck: The fellowship had already paid out her stipend for the semester, and her adviser pooled some money together from another source.
But the future of her fellowship is in question, and such research opportunities are closing elsewhere. Fodera is expected to graduate in a few months, and plans to continue in academia with the goal of becoming a professor. She’s looking for a postdoctoral position, and is now considering opportunities outside of the United States.
“This is really going to hurt science overall,” she said. “There is going to be a brain drain from the U.S.”

And until Tuesday, the meetings inside had been regular and unremarkable. Each month, the local chapter of the League of Women Voters has hosted a listening session with the town’s political representatives, and each month, residents have shuffled in to hear the latest updates from the State House and Executive Council.

Then, on March 20, both of Peterborough’s Democratic representatives voted to support a bill that would roll back certain anti-discrimination protections for transgender people in the state, surprising many. House Bill 148 allows businesses and government agencies to separate bathrooms, locker rooms, prisons, and other facilities based on biological sex at birth, undoing portions of a gender identity rights bill passed in 2018. The Democrats, Jonah Wheeler and Peter Leishman, had bucked their party to support the bill and drew an emotional response; half of the Democratic caucus walked out of the House chamber during a speech by Wheeler defending his vote.
On March 25, the Peterborough library room was overflowing.
Throngs of residents packed into seats and spilled out into the adjoining hallway, taking turns at the microphone to chastise Wheeler. A smaller group, consisting largely of advocates visiting from out of state, appeared supportive of Wheeler. Reporters lined the room and onlookers held up phones, recording each interaction. Wheeler attended the meeting and fielded questions; Leishman did not show up. 
Many said they felt hurt and betrayed by Wheeler’s vote. Some applauded it. And others used the opportunity to ask Wheeler to which side he belonged. 
“I am a Democrat,” Wheeler said, his voice raised. 
The question highlighted a growing national rift for Democrats. In a year in which President Donald Trump and Republican state lawmakers have taken actions against laws and policies allowing access to gender-affirming care and other gender identity protections, some Democrats are breaking away to speak against those protections, and urging their party to do the same. Others in the party, including most gathered in the Peterborough library, have denounced those Democrats and accused them of selling away commitments to LGBTQ+ people to win over certain voters.
Wheeler received the brunt of that backlash Tuesday, including from the Peterborough Democratic town committee, whose members wrote Wheeler and Leishman an official letter expressing “deep concern and disapproval” in their votes.
“You are the only two Democrats in support of this bill that undermines our party’s fundamental commitment to equal rights and protections for all citizens,” said Dan Gross, a member of the executive committee, reading the letter to Wheeler. “While we respect your rights to vote your conscience, our conscience calls us to publicly voice our opposition.” 
Wheeler says he voted in favor of the bill to protect spaces for cisgender women, and said that their right to a space to themselves — without transgender women — should be respected. The bill would not require that businesses, organizations, or government entities separate bathrooms or locker rooms based on biological sex, but it would give them the option to do so.
“I did represent my constituents, because there were women in this town who told me that they don’t feel safe in their spaces anymore,” he said. “Despite what this crowd might say, I’m supposed to just label all those women as transphobic? These are Democratic women who have been called a Republican.” 
On Thursday, Wheeler also voted in favor of House Bill 377, which would bar doctors from administering puberty blockers or hormone therapy to anyone in the state under 18. He was joined by Democratic Rep. Dale Girard of Claremont; Leishman voted no. 
Wheeler argued Democrats’ stance on some of the gender identity legislation has been intractable, and has hurt the party’s standing with cisgender women. 
His stance comes as California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Massachusetts U.S. Rep. Seth Moulton, both Democrats, have attracted attention for speaking out against the participation of transgender girls on girls’ sports teams. Moulton has argued that Democrats’ focus on transgender rights in the context of sports teams has cost the party votes. 
During Tuesday’s meeting, Wheeler also sought to highlight his more mainstream Democratic legislative priorities, including his support for a moratorium on new landfills in the state, a bill banning glue traps, and another bill regulating leachate, sometimes referred to as “trash juice.”
But many participants said they were focused on Wheeler’s vote on the rollback of gender identity protections. And they said they felt he had ignored their previous attempts to speak to him. 
One transgender woman, who identified herself as Jane, said she had grown up with Wheeler. “While you were running, I urged you as a friend to do everything in your power to push back against the anti-trans rhetoric and stop laws like these from passing,” she said. “And you promised me that you would fight for us.” 
“…You gave me hope, and then you stabbed me in the back,” she said.
Another woman, who called herself Elizabeth, asked a basic question. “I think you know your constituents,” she said. “I believe that you do. Why did you vote in a manner that would upset us?”
Wheeler said he had also heard from women who feared attacks by transgender women in bathrooms and wanted the bill to pass.  
“I voted for this legislation knowing, yes, that it would be controversial, and that’s why I gave my speech. Because I wanted to try to explain to my constituents why … after extensive listening to both sides, I would (vote the way) I did.” 
But where Wheeler called for a change in direction for the Democratic Party, another Democratic official present, District 2 Executive Councilor Karen Liot Hill, argued the party has a duty to continue supporting transgender rights and to oppose the Republican bills.
“One of the real challenges right now is that this discussion about women’s spaces and women’s safety in bathrooms is distracting from the real dangers that women face,” Liot Hill said. “As someone who has experienced domestic violence as both a child and as an adult, I can tell you firsthand that it was not in public bathrooms that I was unsafe. It was in my family. It was in my home.” 
Members of an out-of-state advocacy group called the LGBT Courage Coalition — who were in the state to testify and support legislation banning gender-affirming care for minors — showed up in support of Wheeler, applauding some of his statements and using the microphone to voice their own thoughts. 
“One of the reasons people come to shout at him is so others will see it and feel afraid to say anything,” one member of the coalition, Cori Cohn, who is transgender and from Indiana, said in an interview after the meeting. 
Peterborough is a Democratic stronghold: Democrat Kamala Harris won the vote for presidency with 69 percent of the vote in 2024; in the same election, Democrat Joyce Craig won 63 percent of the vote for New Hampshire governor. 
But it remained an open question whether Wheeler would face consequences from his constituents for his votes on bills affecting trans people. Wheeler is not new to the controversy: In 2024, he gave a similar speech on the House floor in support of House Bill 619, a bill to ban certain gender transition surgeries for minors. At the time, he was one of 12 Democrats who joined Republicans in supporting the bill; the bill has since become law.
While that speech and vote received criticism, Wheeler was reelected months later, nearly tying Leishman with 39% of the vote in November.
Still, Wheeler himself says his vote this month has inspired the most blowback yet. And he said he isn’t sure whether his standing in the House Democratic caucus would improve. Many fellow representatives appeared visibly angry with him as they walked out of the chamber March 20.
Outside of the Peterborough library, some advocates were in tears after the meeting. One attendee, Carter Hammond, said he has known Wheeler and believes Wheeler is using the transgender rights issue to distinguish himself with an eye to future political gain. 
“He sort of stumbled on a golden egg with this,” Hammond said. 
For his part, Wheeler says he doesn’t know if he is going to run for reelection in 2026, he said to reporters Tuesday. But at one point during the town hall, he appeared defiant.
“Vote me out,” he told residents at the town hall. “Do whatever you want to me. But let’s move past these divisive conversations and try to have a real conversation.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_3426-2-1024x554.jpg,,,2025-03-28 05:57:58.013651

It’s the fifth such report the group has published. ACLU Chief Lobbyist Gary Daniels said over that ten year stretch more than 500 measures expanding incarceration have been filed and 76 of those have become law.
“I started with the ACLU of Ohio back in 1995,” he said. “Our prisons were overcrowded then. Here we are 30 years later, and they remain above capacity.”
According to the report, Ohio’s prisons were built to house roughly 37,000 people, but as of December 2024, there were 45,490 people behind bars, or more than 120% of capacity.
What ‘pipeline’ bills look like
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Lawmakers filed nearly 80 proposals in the last General Assembly that create a new criminal offense, enhance the punishment for an existing one, or expand the scope of who can be charged. The ACLU classifies these as pipeline bills.
Of those, the governor signed 14 into law. Daniels explained those measures operate on two tracks — the micro and the macro. But both contribute to mass incarceration.
On the macro side, he pointed to House Bill 230, which after failing last session has returned as House Bill 88. The bill increases drug trafficking penalties with a specific emphasis on fentanyl.
“It’s not a popular bill to oppose,” Daniels acknowledged. “We get that.”
“The legislators are absolutely right and correct to be concerned about and searching for solutions and a way out of this,” he argued. But increasing penalties in 27 areas while adding more mandatory minimums isn’t the right approach with an already overburdened prison system.
At the same time that lawmakers advance wide-ranging sentencing changes they also regularly file narrower knee-jerk-reaction bills.
“Certain issues make the headlines and boom, all of a sudden, you’ve got legislation to address it,” Daniels described.
“In Ohio this most recent legislative session,” Daniels continued, “it was catalytic converter thefts and increasing the penalties for that. It was increasing penalties for retail thefts, assaults on sports officials and referees.”
Scope and stakes
The share of bills filed each session that would increase incarceration is relatively small. In the most recent General Assembly, the 79 pipeline bills represented just 7.5% of the total. The 14 signed into law account for only 1.3%.
But with the added dimension of time, Daniels argued, those proposals pile up, and they have a meaningful impact on prison populations.
When lawmakers see a problem, they often respond by increasing punishments. But understanding how their limited provision on catalytic converters fits into a broader program of mass incarceration isn’t always obvious.
“Term limits are certainly a factor here,” Daniels said.
“They learn this over time,” he explained. “And sometimes you get people who are well positioned to make an impact and really start fundamentally getting this issue, and then they’re right back out of office.”
The consequences of that steady accumulation, Daniels said, show up in the state capital budget.
“You have counties and cities that have been lining up, quite literally at the Statehouse to get new and additional funding to both build new jails and to renovate existing jails,” he explained.
In the last capital budget, lawmakers earmarked $50 million for local jails and more than $250 million for improvements to state prisons.
The ACLU report also highlights some positive moves from lawmakers. One example was legislation reducing the use of driver’s license suspensions as a form of punishment. Another directs state corrections officials to help those preparing for reentry to get documents, like a Social Security card, birth certificate or ID card, they’ll need to get a job.
But even these bright spots are bittersweet.
Lawmakers continue to “address the back end of this problem,” Daniels explained. “What are we doing with people already in prison, in jail, in the criminal legal system instead of looking at, and making those efforts, and turning that focus to can we keep them from getting there in the first place?”

Consider the following situation. You’re a middle-aged transgender man who transitioned decades ago. You’re balding, have a beard, and would never in a million years be confused for a woman.
Unfortunately, and bizarrely, however, this makes some North Carolina Republican state legislators uncomfortable, so they want to force you to use women’s restrooms.
Seriously. That’s what they’re seeking to do in a recently introduced Senate bill that would reprise the disastrous HB 2 debacle from a decade ago.
Under the bill, among other things, if a public facility allows a trans person to use a restroom that doesn’t match the gender on their birth certificate, it can be sued for damages and forced to pay untold sums of money.
And it’s hard to overstate just how cruel and ridiculous this is.
The bottom line: It’s been years now since North Carolina last ventured down this road and the opponents of trans rights have yet to document a single credible harm that legislation like this would address.
If ever there was ill-conceived proposal in search of a non-existent problem, this is it.

But services like contraception, STI testing, and preventative health screenings are also at risk with Trump administration plans to freeze “family planning” grants in Ohio and across the country.
At risk is funding through Title X, a federal pot of money that goes to clinics that “have played a critical role in ensuring access to a broad range of family planning and preventive health services,” according to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services.
A 2023 annual report from HHS’ Office on Population Affairs on the Title X program lists services provided under the grants, including FDA-approved contraception, pregnancy testing and counseling, “assistance to achieve pregnancy,” infertility services, sexually transmitted infection services and other “preconception health services.”
“Title X services are client-centered, culturally and linguistically appropriate, inclusive, trauma-informed and provided in a manner that ensures equitable and quality service delivery consistent with nationally recognized standards of care,” the annual report stated.
As part of a whirlwind of efforts to cut government spending, the Trump administration reportedly wants to freeze more than $27 million in grants from the program.
That cut would have the largest impact on Planned Parenthoods across the country, which receive $20 million of that funding.

In a March memo, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America underscored the importance of Title X funding, saying its clinics were the largest Title X provider in 2018, the year before the first Trump administration, serving 40% of patients under the program.
The group left the program in 2019, but came back in 2021 after former President Joe Biden rolled back some Trump-era policies.
“If Planned Parenthood patients can’t get quality, affordable health services … there would be grave nationwide consequences,” the memo stated.
Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio was one of the recipients of Title X grants in 2024, when it was awarded $1.98 million. The Ohio Department of Health also received a Title X grant that year of nearly $7 million, about the same amount as it received in both 2023 and 2022.
“Any insinuation to take away critical family planning services from people with lower incomes to afford Trump’s tax cuts to billionaires is dangerous and unprecedented,” Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio said in a statement to the Capital Journal.
The group said they served 600 fewer patients than the Ohio Department of Health in 2023, but did it “for $5 million less in Title X funds.”
“Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio will continue to fight for our right to be a trusted, safety net provider in reproductive health care services like birth control, cancer screenings, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, among other Title X-eligible services.”
In their most recent annual report, the organization reported more than 66,700 visits to their health and surgical centers, providing care for 47,480 patients between 2022 and 2023.
Of those visits, the group provided 86,346 tests for sexually transmitted diseases, administered 16,817 pregnancy tests, served 11,803 patients for contraception-related care and conducted 9,340 HIV tests. The facilities also had 7,734 preventive care visits, 7,136 telehealth visits and 3,255 visits regarding gender-affirming care.
At the greater Ohio arm of Planned Parenthood, 56% of the patient base lives at or below 200% of the federal poverty line. That’s $62,400 for a family of four. Seventy four percent are between ages 18 and 34, 85% identify as female and 46% of patients rely on Medicaid for care, according to the annual report.
The Ohio-based group receives 12.4% of its revenue through state and federal grants, with Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements making up 17.7% of revenue and 14.5% of funds coming from private or commercial insurance payments.
The main source of revenue for Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio in 2022-2023 was individual, institutional and “legacy giving.” It made up 35.3% of the agency’s revenue stream.
As for spending that money, the annual report stated that 80% of the expenses are for program services, including the health services at clinics, education and outreach, and government and community relations. Another 14% went to management and “general” expenses, with 6% going to fundraising over that period.

Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine discussed higher education, the Cleveland Browns stadium, and LGBTQ policy during the most recent Columbus Metropolitan Club weekly forum.
Statehouse News Bureau reporter Jo Ingles asked DeWine several questions during Wednesday’s hour-long forum and here is a rundown of what the governor had to say:
Higher Education 
Ohio lawmakers recently passed Senate Bill 1 — a massive higher education bill that would, among other things, ban diversity and inclusion and prohibit faculty from striking. DeWine received the bill Wednesday and has 10 days to sign the bill into law or veto it. If DeWine vetoes the bill, lawmakers would need a three-fifths vote from each chamber to override it.

“I made it clear I probably will sign the bill, but I want to go through this bill again and and take a look at it,” DeWine said. 
College students and faculty have said the bill will harm higher education in Ohio. 
“It wouldn’t be the first time that something gets passed and everybody looks at it six months later or a year later and says, ‘Hey, that wasn’t what we intended, or it didn’t turn out the way we wanted to,” DeWine said. “I think with any bill …  we should always be open to re-examining everything.” 
Students, faculty are asking Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine to veto massive higher ed overhaul bill

DeWine’s budget would continue the Governor’s Merit Scholarship, which gives the top 5% of each high school graduating class a $5,000 scholarship each year to go to an Ohio college or university.
“We want to keep our top kids in the state of Ohio,” DeWine said. “The data clearly tells us that if you go to school in the state of Ohio, you have dramatically increased your possibility of getting your first job in the state of Ohio and actually staying in the state of Ohio.”
The Governor’s Merit Scholarship was enacted through the last state budget two years ago. Ohio’s high school graduating class of 2024 included 6,250 eligible students and about 76% of them accepted the scholarship, DeWine said earlier this year when he introduced his budget. 
The Governor’s Merit Scholarship is estimated to cost $22.7 million for fiscal year 2025. It would cost $47 million for fiscal year 2026 and $70 million for fiscal year 2027, according to the governor’s proposed budget. 
The budget is currently going through the Ohio House and it will be sent over to the Ohio Senate before going back to DeWine. He must sign it by July 1. 
K-12 school funding
DeWine danced around a question about funding for K-12 schools and if schools will have enough money. The governor’s budget would decrease funding for traditional public schools by 0.9%, according to a workgroup analysis. Voucher programs including the private school program would see a 15.8% increase.  
“The state legislature is going to decide, maybe with some input from me, they’re going to decide what that formula is,” DeWine said.
House Speaker Matt Huffman has called the current formula “unsustainable.”
Cleveland Browns stadium 
DeWine’s proposed budget would double the tax on sports betting from 20% to 40% with the proceeds going to fund professional sports stadiums and Ohio youth sports. Doubling the tax on sports betting would generate between $150-$180 million per year, he said. 
Nearly all gambling in Ohio is done online and “99.5% of the money goes to out-of-state gaming companies who don’t employ anybody in the state of Ohio,” DeWine said. 
Gambling companies pay the sports-betting tax, so DeWine said the increased tax would not affect bettors.
“It’s going to be paid directly by the companies that are outside the state of Ohio,” he said. “This is money that’s on the table … We’re crazy if we don’t do this.”
This proposal comes as the Cleveland Browns are asking the state to help cover a quarter of the estimated $2.4 billion cost of building a new domed stadium in Brook Park, about 20 minutes away from their current stadium downtown. 
“I don’t think we can afford to continue to go into the general fund of our budget and take this money,” DeWine said. “This money directly competes against education. It directly competes against mental health, drug addiction, all these things that we actually need money to try to help people achieve their ultimate goals.”
How to fund professional sports stadiums will continue to come up with other teams throughout the state, he said. 
“This is not just a question about the Browns, it’s a question about every other stadium,” he said. “This will permanently solve our problem. If we don’t do this every legislature, every governor in the future is going to have to face the challenge of do we put $20 million here? Do we put $40 million here for this stadium or that stadium?”
Lawmakers are trying to give $600 million to the Browns by issuing bonds to build the new stadium. DeWine avoided directly answering the question of if he would line-item veto that proposal if it ended up in the budget. 
“We have a long way to go,” he said. “We haven’t seen the House budget yet, let alone the Senate.”
LGBTQ policy 
DeWine signed a bill into law last year prohibiting transgender students from using school bathrooms and locker rooms that align with their gender identity. Despite this, DeWine was adamant during Wednesday’s forum that Ohio does not have an anti-LGBTQ climate. 
“This is a state that welcomes everyone,” DeWine claimed, “And we want you to come to the state of Ohio. We want you to feel welcome here.”

The Buckeye State is known for its water benefits, dentist Dr. Matthew Messina said.
“We’ve had that kind of a profound increase in public health that comes from modern dentistry and fluoride is a part of that,” Messina said.
Naturally occurring in water, fluoride is a mineral that years of research has shown strengthens teeth and prevents cavities and tooth decay. As the four-decade-long serving dentist explains, most public water systems add fluoride.
“It’s hailed as one of the top public health measures in the last century, because really, for a very low cost and very low amount of effort, the massive benefit that this produces for the community is tremendous,” he said.
He has worked in communities that didn’t have fluoride, he said, and the difference between children from cities and ones from rural areas that didn’t have public water fluoridation was night and day.
“We got a chance to see rampant dental decay in children,” he said. “It was like going back to the dark ages, so I really hope we’d never go back there again.”
There has always been a back-and-forth for decades on fluoride, much like vaccines. In recent years, there has been a campaign to push back on the mineral in water.
Although U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is not a doctor, he has claimed that the mineral is toxic.
“Fluoride is an industrial waste,” he wrote on X.
The effort has trickled down to Ohio.
State Rep. Levi Dean, R-Xenia, has proposed House Bill 182, which would ban public water systems from adding fluoride.
“It just says that individuals can then choose whether they want to ingest it or not — it’s not forced on them,” Dean told me.
Current law requires water systems to fluoridate water if the natural content is less than .8 milligrams per liter.
“It’s just for some people for health reasons or just even for individual freedom reasons, they don’t want the local governments to force this into their drinking water,” he said.
Dean and his GOP cosponsors want to prohibit this. He argued that fluoride is bad for you. We asked him where he got this idea from since dozens upon dozens of research papers for decades disagree.
He cited a recent research study sharing that fluoride may be linked to lower IQ in children.
A study published by JAMA Pediatrics in January did a review and meta-analysis of whether exposure to fluoride was associated with kids’ IQ scores.
The authors found that there is a link between slightly lower IQ in children that have more exposure to the mineral.
But Messina explained that this research article is being taken out of context.
“It brings up a study of parts of the world where naturally occurring fluoride levels are much higher than in most of the United States, and they’re higher than the target levels that we have set,” the dentist said.
Looking into the paper, the authors acknowledged that a majority of the studies they looked at were considered “highly biased,” none of the data is from the United States, and that there was “uncertainty in the dose-response association.”
When the fluoride in the water was less than 1.5 mg/L, the link wasn’t apparent. As mentioned, Ohio has a cap of .8 mg/L.
“Now, there’s disagreement on the concentration of where that starts and how, but that’s why I think it should be up to the individual to choose what levels they engage with fluoride at,” Dean said.
The lawmaker argued that if people really want fluoride, they can buy toothpaste, tablets, or drops.
“I’m not arguing with the fact that it could be beneficial to some people for dental health,” he said. “I’m arguing with the fact that should we be ingesting it, if the benefit is for your teeth, shouldn’t you be applying it just to the teeth and not consuming it?”
Toothpaste has significantly more fluoride than water does, which is why you are told to spit it out, according to the CDC.
The Republican continued that this is about Ohioans having a choice — just like he does, as he uses fluoride-free toothpaste.
“What kind of concerns do you have with Ohio considering to remove fluoride from all public water?” we asked Messina.
“Well, if Ohio did that, we would be stepping back in time,” he responded. “We have a known beneficial, preventative part of our tool kit, and for us to continue to go forward without that — we’re really leaving one of our best weapons behind.”
Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, seemed interested in the proposal because when asked if the state should keep fluoride in public water, he acknowledged that he “didn’t know.”
“Fluoride naturally occurs in water, I just found that out this week,” he said. “They started adding it.”
He said that people over the past few years have been “dismissed.”
“Now there appears to be some science that says too much fluoride, including adding fluoride, is bad for folks,” he said. “I’m not a scientist, I’m not a chemist… We’re going to sort of litigate that question… in the legislature here over the next couple of months. I don’t know the answer to your question.”
House Minority Leader Allison Russo, D-Upper Arlington, whose background is in public health, was not thrilled to hear about the bill.
“I entirely support fluoride in water,” she said, noting that the benefits are clear in dental health.
We asked her if she saw this as an effort to privatize water.
“I see this as a basic human right,” she continued. “I think the expectation of every household in this country is that you have access to clean tap water in your households.”
Gov. Mike DeWine, who is routinely against non-doctors making health decisions, is not commenting on this bill yet.
Knowing the governor, this would not be out of the realm of a possible veto. He consistently states that he supports science, vaccines, best practices of doctors in gender-affirming care, prevention of tobacco for kids and the stopping of medical misinformation.

Another proposed energy-saving program is on the chopping block in Ohio.
Duke Energy Ohio quietly dropped plans late last year to roll out a broad portfolio of programs that would have boosted energy efficiency and encouraged customers to use less electricity during times of peak demand. The plans, which would have saved ratepayers nearly $126 million over three years after deductions for costs, were part of a regulatory filing last April that sought to increase charges on customers’ electric bills.
The move came after settlement talks with other stakeholders, including the state’s consumer advocate, which opposes collecting ratepayer money to provide the programs to people who aren’t in low-income groups.
State regulators are now weighing whether to approve the settlement with a much smaller efficiency program focused on low-income neighborhoods.
The case is the latest chapter in a struggle to restore utility-run programs for energy efficiency after House Bill 6, the 2019 nuclear and coal bailout law that also gutted the state’s renewable energy standards and eliminated requirements for utilities to help customers save energy.
Studies show that utility-run energy-efficiency programs are among the cheapest ways to meet growing electricity needs and cut greenhouse gas emissions. Lower demand means fossil-fuel power plants can run less often. Less wasted energy translates into lower bills for customers who take advantage of efficiency programs. Even customers who don’t directly participate benefit because the programs lower peak demand when power costs the most.
Energy efficiency can also put downward pressure on capacity prices — amounts paid by grid operators to electricity producers to make sure enough generation will be available for future needs. Due to high projected demand compared to available generation, capacity prices for most of the PJM region, including Ohio, will jump ninefold in June to about $270 per megawatt-day.
“At a time when PJM is saying we’re facing capacity shortages, we should be doing everything we can to reduce demand,” said Rob Kelter, a senior attorney for the Environmental Law & Policy Center.
Since 2019, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio has generally rejected utility efforts to offer widely available, ratepayer-funded programs for energy efficiency. Legislative efforts to clarify that such programs are allowed under Ohio law have been introduced but failed to pass.
In the current case, Duke Energy Ohio, which serves about 750,000 customers in southwestern Ohio, proposed a portfolio of efficiency offerings that would have cost ratepayers about $75 million over the course of three years but created net savings of nearly $126 million over the same period.
The package included energy-efficient appliance rebates, incentives for off-peak energy use, education programs for schools, and home energy assessments. The company also proposed incentives for customers who let it curtail air conditioning on hot days through smart thermostats.
In November, Duke Energy Ohio filed a proposed settlement with the PUCO staff, the Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel, industry groups, and others. The terms drop all the programs for energy efficiency, except for one geared toward low-income consumers at a cost of up to $2.4 million per year. The Environmental Law & Policy Center and Ohio Environmental Council objected, as did a consumer group, the Citizens Utility Board of Ohio.
The PUCO will decide whether to approve the settlement plan by evaluating whether it benefits ratepayers and the public interest, whether it is the result of ​“serious bargaining” among knowledgable parties, and whether it violates any important regulatory principles or practices. Witnesses testified for and against the settlement at a hearing in January. Parties filed briefs in February and March.
Duke Energy Ohio argued in its brief that the settlement will still benefit customers and serve the public interest, even without the energy-efficiency programs for consumers who aren’t low-income. It also suggested that cutting out most of the energy-efficiency measures was needed to reach a deal with other stakeholders and the PUCO.
Staff at the PUCO said the settlement would benefit customers by cutting some projects and limiting how high other charges could go. They dismissed objections about dropping broadly available programs for energy efficiency. “[T]he standard is whether ratepayers benefit, not whether they could have benefitted more,” state lawyers wrote in their brief.
The Environmental Law & Policy Center, Ohio Environmental Council, and Citizens Utility Board of Ohio all argued there is no evidence to support dropping the energy-efficiency programs. They questioned the approach by a Consumers’ Counsel witness of counting only avoided rider costs as benefits, without considering the projected savings from energy efficiency.
The Consumers’ Counsel defended its perspective in an email to Canary Media. ​“We oppose subsidizing energy efficiency programs through utility rates when those products and services are already available in the competitive marketplace,” the office’s statement said. ​“And when the programs are run by the utility, there are added charges to consumers, such as shared savings and lost distribution revenue.” The statement also noted that other PUCO decisions have refused to allow energy-efficiency programs that would serve groups other than low-income households.
Last year, for example, the PUCO allowed FirstEnergy to run a low-income energy-efficiency program but turned down its proposal to include generally available rebates in a rider package. Those are ​“better suited for the competitive market, where both residential and non-residential customers will be able to obtain products and services to meet their individual needs,” the commission’s opinion said. The commission did, however, say the company should develop a rebate program for smart thermostats to help customers manage their energy use. FirstEnergy included that in its latest rider plan filed on Jan. 31.
Ohio has been particularly devoid of programs like those dropped in Duke’s settlement since HB 6 took effect, said Trent Dougherty, a lawyer for the Citizens Utility Board of Ohio. Calculations as of 2019 estimated the law’s gutting of the state’s energy-efficiency standard costs each consumer savings of nearly $10 per month.
“Continuing a pattern of wish-casting, that the market will provide the savings that HB 6 took away, is not a solution,” Dougherty said.

You can build an internet application that gobbles up this story and its headline and automatically robo-publishes it 10 seconds after we do.
You have our permission. In fact, you have our encouragement.
Kansas Reflector’s explicit invitation — posted at the end of every news article and commentary — encourages everyone to steal our work. Please and thank you.
The notice reads, “Our stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0. We ask that you edit only for style or to shorten, provide proper attribution and link to our website. AP and Getty images may not be republished. Please see our republishing guidelines for use of any other photos and graphics.”
The Reflector’s parent organization, States Newsroom, spreads this generous policy across its network of publications, from the Nevada Current to the Maine Morning Star. Thousands of stories on dozens of websites — for free.
Because Kansas Reflector allows all publications — from Yahoo News to the Peabody Gazette-Bulletin — to reprint its reporting and commentary, these words reach an audience that is often 10 to 100 times larger than a single publication.
Sometimes Reflector writings get printed on honest-to-goodness paper. This is a particular hoot for me when my hometown metro newspaper, the Kansas City Star, prints one of my columns. When they do, I know my wife’s eagle-eyed coworker will clip it out and send it along (Thanks, Dave).
Some folks, including me, believe that this republication policy is a central virtue, power and impact of these publications.
I have been writing for the Reflector since 2021 (141 columns and counting). Still, I have a bit of journalism vertigo when I explain this republication philosophy to others. The idea of giving away your intellectual work for free lacks a contemporary vocabulary. It’s not monetizing. We aren’t selling. No subscription required.
Because of the cognitive leap, I interviewed Sherman Smith, editor in chief of the Reflector and the person who approached me a few years ago in search of a new commentary writer. (I recruited myself.) If anyone understands the tensions and benefits of allowing other publications to republish the work of the Reflector staff, it’s Smith.
“We believe in doing journalism as a public good and making this accessible as part of our public service model,” Smith said. “We let everybody read us for free, and we let other publications republish us for free, because we want to get our work out to as broad of an audience as possible, and this allows us to do that.”
Smith’s data, provided to him in Google News alerts and weekly email reports, shows that more people than ever read the Reflector, whether through republication or on the Reflector’s website. February 2025, as a matter of fact, was the largest month for readership on the website, Smith said, besides the August 2023 readership spike from a particularly viral Kansas news story.
“What I see so often is this idea that news is dying, but the reality is we reach more people today than ever before,” Smith said.
A few decades ago, Smith continues, a brilliant story in a community newspaper might have been restricted to a local audience. Meanwhile, stories on the Reflector are both on the internet and without a paywall.
“Today, when we write that story, we reach a million people nationwide and even internationally,” Smit said. “It ripples across the globe in a heartbeat. That’s a very powerful thing.”
Of course, the benefits of a free product are easy to list for the consumer. Low-income readers can get their Kansas news for free. International readers who just want to read one story about Kansas don’t need to subscribe for $15 per month just for the privilege of reading one article that they might — or might not — like.
Smith also said that the Reflector’s growing readership forces some prominent people to agree to interviews. Kansas state representatives, for instance, know that their hometown newspaper is likely to run a free Reflector article — so they may feel pressure to be a source.
“Leveraging information,” Smith calls it. Of course, a complete report with relevant sources is another benefit for readers.
Many of my current and former University of Kansas journalism students have worked for the Reflector in one way or another. Smith sees the Reflector’s republication policy as serving these young journalists in particular.
“Part of our public service mission here is trying to work with the next generation of journalists to elevate them,” Smith said. “If you’re a young college student, you’re trying to establish a portfolio to take to an employer. You could write three stories for us and present it as three different publications, showing, ‘My work has been in Hays and Manhattan and Dodge City and Hutchinson, and not just the Kansas Reflector.’ ”
Like the young journalists Smith mentioned, many other journalists are obsessed by the impact that their work has. Why write if no one is reading? Why podcast if no one is listening? Why publish a photo if no one is looking?
In that way, the grand bargain that the Reflector has made with the world — that its reporting and commentary are free — reimagines the typical transactional relationship between a journalist and their audience.
My first days in journalism were during the 1990s at a series of community newspapers. The way that I knew people were seeing my work (back then, photojournalism) seems Andy Griffith-era folksy today. I would watch people — at coffee shops, at sporting events and in the local muffler shop — reading the headlines, their chins turned up in a skeptical expression that furrowed their brows.
The feedback on our work in the 1990s? They slung those jabs at us in a way that seems antiquated today: As I lugged camera gear into a high school basketball game, moms and dads would walk up to me, telling me exactly what the newspaper got right or wrong yesterday. Some, but few, would write letters to the editor.
The publisher of a newspaper in the 1990s had a pretty exact sense of how many people their paper reached. Simply track subscription numbers. Then, ask the circulation folks downstairs about single-copy sales at grocery stores and newspaper racks.
Modern journalism, especially when paired with the Reflector’s republication policy, upends this previous journalism world. It’s unlikely that you are reading this column on a printed page. It’s unlikely that you will run into me at your local hardware store. And my work — so tightly guarded by my first employers decades ago — is free for you here.
This limitless distribution of the Reflector’s content also sends me Google-ing for my headlines to discover who ran them. The publications in the search results form a motley parade of websites.
One of these online searches inspired me to write about our republication policy. A few months ago, I wrote about how Donald Trump’s make-up routine confused me. 
Like many pieces by the Reflector, my column was republished by Yahoo News. At the bottom was the biggest response I have seen to anything I have done in journalism, whether photography, editing or writing. I assure you it’s not my best writing.
Nevertheless, it found an audience. Yahoo recorded 2,200 comments in response to my column before it switched them off two days later. The first comment — “More unreadable Trump hating fake news from the lib infested fake news media” — sums up the comment-section death match between MAGA and the left, between real people in the heartland and bots in a server farm.
An audience like this — even if it’s not my dear neighbors — is part of what keeps me writing for the Reflector. I love knowing that you, dear reader, can critique my work without a subscription from just about anywhere on just about any website.
The bitter irony of writing this column about our republication policy: It’s perhaps the least likely column to demand republication.
As Kurt Vonnegut wrote: “So it goes.”

Recently I began typing, “Whereas, DEI is Appalachia and rural Ohio” for a resolution.
How did I know this? Well, my storytelling can be long-winded, but I’ll sum it up quickly for digital attention spans.
First Lesson: Quiet, Humble, Hardworking Appalachian
In 2009, I met a quiet, humble Ph.D. student at Louisiana State University’s Manship School of Mass Communication. He was sandy-haired, reserved, and from Core, West Virginia — deep in the heart of Appalachia. He was shy, humble, and quiet; when he spoke, I listened.
The day before I started my Ph.D. program, I was still working at an ABC television station, surrounded by outspoken quick storytelling personalities. Yet, this quiet soon-to-be scholar could hold his own when discussing gender issues. I was in my 30s, I felt well-versed in theory and research, and here was this guy who could match me in conversations about women’s issues. I thought, “Who is he?”
He had graduated from West Virginia University. He later told me when I began my program, he could see I had my guard up, a necessary skill honed from years as a producer in television news. If I hadn’t, I would have been run over by anchors who had been there since my childhood. But as time passed, he started talking to me more about our shared research interests. I started trusting him. Later, we got married.
Grew up in a Trailer Park, Hunted to Survive, and Limited Medical Care
Through Ben, I learned about Appalachia. During our first winter together, I visited the mountain trailer park where he grew up. There was no cell service, but my Boston Terriers were thrilled, finally having space to run free. I can still picture Bruno, the more bulldog-like of the two, cheeks flapping as he chased after a deer downhill.
Inside the trailer where Ben grew up, I found myself hesitant to use the bathroom under the gaze of a mounted deer head. I learned deer weren’t just eyeballs to frighten me but a necessity — a crucial food source for many families in Appalachia. Without it, there would have been nothing to eat. I learned he had collected cans as a kid for money. As far as medical care growing up, that meant butterfly bandages and dunking yourself in watered-down Clorox if you swam in something questionable.
Instilled with Grit, Dedicated to Family, and Stood Tall When Hard Times Hit
West Virginia was different to me as I wasn’t from there and I loved my visits because it was something I had with Ben. The simplicity, the absence of pressure, the joy of eating pepperoni rolls, and being surrounded by nature offered a sense of peace from our Ph.D. program.
And Ben had grit. I liked to think of him as a clutch. When things got tough, he could help get us through them. When we didn’t have enough money for rent in the summer during our Ph.D. program, he took a yellow book (yes, when people used to use those) and said I won’t be back until I have the rent money. When I was in a car accident because of the ice this winter, he put the pieces of my car back together himself in three days, while watching a five-year-old. He can fix anything. For example, a garage door piece needed replaced suddenly on his February birthday. It was single-digit temperatures, the wind whipped through the house because repair people couldn’t show up due to the snow. Along with this, he can Tetris anything into the car or other spaces and when things are really against the wall, he remains calm and figures it out. I attribute that to his Appalachian character.
Second Lesson: From LSU to Ohio U., Dr. Ralph Izard
My second lesson in Appalachia came from Dr. Ralph Izard, former director of the E.W. Scripps School of Journalism at Ohio University; however, he was my professor at LSU. He founded the National Media Diversity Forum, and with a handshake, I promised to contribute to it forever. He taught me about the First Amendment, and I loved peeking into his office, where he would be eating his lunch — whatever he had grabbed from the fridge, including, on one occasion, a raw turnip. Dr. Izard became my dissertation area head for diversity — another West Virginian who broadened my understanding of interconnectedness, philosophy, and policy. He encouraged me to question how people were affected and to engage closely with communities when seeking answers.










Diversity wasn't just a buzzword — it was a commitment.


While at LSU, the Manship School was the first recipient of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication Equity & Diversity Award in 2009.
Third Lesson: Ohio U. Students Who Have Walked the Bricks Since 2017
My third lesson in Appalachia has been taught at Ohio University since 2017, my fourth university. Until I arrived, I hadn’t heard “food insecurity” used so frequently. Here, I saw firsthand how deeply poverty affects students and residents.
When I read about Ohio Senate Bill 1 and its potential impact, I think of Dr. Izard, Ben, and my students. Ben has taught cross-cultural communication, advocacy, and issues of gender, race, and class. Dr. Izard taught about the First Amendment and the philosophies that shape these conversations. Both are white, male Appalachians who have positively impacted lives — mine included. There are countless student letters to prove it.










If the resistance to diversity means that someone like me will never learn about Appalachia — if these experiences never influenced my understanding of rural poverty, resilience, and identity — then Ohio politicians are acting against the very people they profess to represent.


Because of these diverse experiences with Appalachians, I am a better person, researcher, and professor.
The funds that won’t be allocated to scholarships will directly affect Appalachian students. The opportunities that will vanish due to decisions made by those unfamiliar with higher education will only reinforce stereotypes about gender, race, and class in Appalachia. In the end, it is Appalachian students who will suffer the most.
At a time when the university adopted an interim policy to recruit (and I assume continue to maintain) those with disabilities and veteran status is essential to think who is impacted by DEI. As this interim policy adopted on Feb. 26, 2025 states:

“In compliance with requirements as a federal contractor, Ohio university will make lawful efforts to recruit persons with disabilities, veterans, and Vietnam era veterans, for position openings. In accordance with federal law and Chapter 124 of the Revised Code it is the policy of the university to engage in recruitment practices that yield the best applicants for vacancies.
This policy covers all faculty and staff positions at Ohio university.
This policy also establishes an official diversity statement to be utilized as appropriate during recruitment activity:
Ohio university is proud of its rich history and as part of our ongoing efforts to provide and support a transformative learning experience, we affirm our commitment to fostering a welcoming and respectful workforce and community. All qualified applicants are encouraged to apply and will receive consideration free from discrimination on the basis of age, ancestry, color, disability, ethnicity, gender, gender identity or expression, genetic information, military service or veteran status, national origin, pregnancy, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, status as a parent or foster parent, or any other bases under the law. Ohio university is an equal access/equal opportunity employer.”

Diversity isn’t a threat to Appalachia. It is Appalachia.
The Importance of DEI in Healthcare and EducationLeanne Chrisman-Khawam, MD, MEd
By Leanne Chrisman-Khawam, M.D., M.Ed., Family Physician and Assistant Professor Ohio University Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine Cleveland Campus, Medical Director Doctors on the Street
Recently, I started typing, “Whereas, the healthcare sector relies on DEI initiatives to cultivate a workforce capable of addressing the needs of diverse populations, and the prohibition of such initiatives may worsen existing health disparities among the elderly, rural and urban underserved communities, racial minorities, veterans, individuals with disabilities, food-insecure families, and women, thereby reducing healthcare access and quality of care.”
How do I know this? Well, I’ll sum it up as best as I can.
I grew up in a small town in Oregon. My dad was a seasonal entrepreneur who worked in construction — mainly paving. My mom stayed at home. My school didn’t offer many advanced courses, AP classes, or college credit programs. As a low-income white family, I benefited from DEI initiatives. A summer work program provided grants for employers to hire students like me. I worked with my family doctor, who introduced me to medicine. Without that experience, I might never have attended college, let alone medical school.
Despite my good grades, becoming a doctor wasn’t something my family considered possible. But here I am, 30+ years later — having spoken nationally and internationally, trained hundreds of medical professionals, and recruited students like me to address the shortage of primary care physicians.
Do I recruit them because they are DEI hires? No. They are bright, hardworking medical students. Do I prefer them because they remind me of myself? No. I prioritize them because research shows that when doctors share a background with their patients, health outcomes improve.
Why representation in health care matters
Building strong doctor-patient relationships leads to better care. I’ve seen this firsthand with my husband’s medical journey. He suffered a spinal cord injury ten years before we met, and three years ago, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. His condition has led to complications — pressure sores, infections, and worsening mobility.
When people first meet him, they love his warm smile and long, flowing white hair. (He’s often mistaken for Robert DeNiro — a compliment I take to heart!) But as soon as they see his confusion and inability to speak, they dismiss him. That is, until I share his story — how he lovingly cared for his mother, was an amazing father and respected disability advocate, and always supported my career. Suddenly, hospital staff treats him with the dignity and respect he deserves.
He is not alone in needing that dignity. Throughout our careers, we have worked to advocate for the forgotten — the poor, the immigrant, the disabled, the rural worker, and the veteran struggling with PTSD. Together, we created Doctors on the Street (DOTS) — a student- and resident-run program that provides medical care to individuals experiencing homelessness. These patients are often dismissed because of their appearance, yet they are people who have faced immense hardship—accidents, job loss, mental illness, or economic downturns.
Personal struggles and the bigger picture
Now, at the end of my husband’s life, I feel the weight of financial stress. His care is expensive, not covered by insurance, and I struggle to pay our bills. I may have to take out a mortgage to afford a new furnace and property taxes. I grew up in poverty, and I may return to it — not because of poor choices, but because of circumstances beyond my control.
Our government was created to serve its people. This country was built by immigrants, farmers, and laborers seeking freedom — of speech, of religion, of opportunity. My family came as those farmers and laborer and has fought to protect those freedoms in every American war since the Revolutionary War.










This is why I'm deeply concerned about Ohio Senate Bill 1. It does not protect freedom of speech, it limits it. DEI programs have been falsely portrayed as only benefitting BIPOC and LGBTQ+ individuals. In reality, diversity programs support everyone who lacks a voice — veterans, rural white communities, disabled individuals, and those facing food and housing insecurity.


Rather than focusing on what higher education shouldn’t do, our government should focus on what it can do to help people. When we invest in inclusion, we all do better. I have seen it firsthand.
We may not be able to fix everything, but we can each do something. That is far better than standing by and shouting at others about what not to do.

 Reporting Highlights


The Ohio Model: Rarely seen letters show how the voucher movement started in the 1990s as a concealed effort to finance urban parochial schools and expanded to a much broader push.
Helping the Affluent: An initiative promoted as a civil rights cause — helping poor kids — is increasingly funneling money to families who already easily afford private school tuition.
The Voucher Deficit: Expanding programs threaten funding for public schools and put pressure on state budgets, as many religious-based schools enjoy new largesse.

On a Thursday morning last May, about a hundred people gathered in the atrium of the Ohio Capitol building to join in Christian worship. The “Prayer at the Statehouse” was organized by an advocacy group called the Center for Christian Virtue, whose growing influence was symbolized by its new headquarters, directly across from the capitol. It was also manifest in the officials who came to take part in the event: three state legislators and the ambitious then-lieutenant governor, Jon Husted.

Jon Husted during the Ohio March for Life rally against that November’s Issue 1 reproductive rights amendment, October 6, 2023, outside the Statehouse in Columbus, Ohio.

After some prayer and singing, the center’s Christian Engagement Ambassador introduced Husted, asking him to “share with us about faith and intersecting faith with government.” Husted, a youthful 57-year-old, spoke intently about the prayer meetings that he leads in the governor’s office each month. “We bring appointed officials and elected officials together to talk about our faith in our work, in our service, and how it can strengthen us and make us better,” he said. The power of prayer, Husted suggested, could even supply political victories: “When we do that, great things happen — like advancing school choice so that every child in Ohio has a chance to go to the school of their choice.” The audience started applauding before he finished his sentence.
The center had played a key role in bringing about one of the most dramatic expansions of private school vouchers in the country, making it possible for all Ohio families — even the richest among them — to receive public money to pay for their children’s tuition. In the mid-1990s, Ohio became the second state to offer vouchers, but in those days they were available only in Cleveland and were billed as a way for disadvantaged children to escape struggling schools. Now the benefits extend to more than 150,000 students across the state, costing taxpayers nearly $1 billion, the vast majority of which goes to the Catholic and evangelical institutions that dominate the private school landscape there.
What happened in Ohio was a stark illustration of a development that has often gone unnoticed, perhaps because it is largely taking place away from blue state media hubs. In the past few years, school vouchers have become universal in a dozen states, including Florida, Arizona and North Carolina. Proponents are pushing to add Texas, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and others — and, with Donald Trump returning to the White House, they will likely have federal support.
The risks of universal vouchers are quickly coming to light. An initiative that was promoted for years as a civil ­rights cause — helping poor kids in troubled schools — is threatening to become a nationwide money grab. Many private schools are raising tuition rates to take advantage of the new funding, and new schools are being founded to capitalize on it. With private schools urging all their students’ families to apply, the money is flowing mostly to parents who are already able to afford tuition and to kids who are already enrolled in private schools. When vouchers do draw students away from public districts, they threaten to exacerbate declining enrollment, forcing underpopulated schools to close. More immediately, the cost of the programs is soaring, putting pressure on public school finances even as private schools prosper. In Arizona, voucher expenditures are hundreds of millions of dollars more than predicted, leaving an enormous shortfall in the state budget. States that provide funds to families for homeschooling or education-related expenses are contending with reports that the money is being used to cover such unusual purchases as kayaks, video game consoles and horseback-­riding lessons.
The voucher movement has been aided by a handful of billionaire advocates; it was also enabled, during the pandemic, by the backlash to extended school closures. (Private schools often reopened considerably faster than public schools.) Yet much of the public, even in conservative states, remains ambivalent about vouchers: Voters in Nebraska and Kentucky just rejected them in ballot referendums.
How, then, has the movement managed to triumph? The campaign in Ohio provides an object lesson — a model that voucher advocates have deployed elsewhere. Its details are recorded in a trove of private correspondence, much of it previously unpublished, that the movement’s leaders in Ohio sent to one another. The letters reveal a strategy to start with targeted programs that placed needy kids in parochial schools, then fight to expand the benefits to far richer families — a decadeslong effort by a network of politicians, church officials and activists, all united by a conviction that the separation of church and state is illegitimate. As one of the movement’s progenitors put it, “Government does a lousy job of substituting for religion.”

In the early 1990s, Ohio’s Catholic bishops faced a problem. For more than a century, religious education had been deeply entrenched in the state; in Cleveland, the parochial system was one of the largest in the country. For decades, though, the Church’s urban schools had been losing students to suburban flight. To keep up enrollment, many were admitting more Black students, often from non-­Catholic families. But these families typically could not afford to pay much, which put a strain on church budgets.
Catholic leaders elsewhere faced the same challenge, but Ohio’s bishops had an advantage. The new Republican governor, George Voinovich, was a devout Catholic who went to Mass multiple times a week, an expression of a faith that was inherited from his Slovenian American mother and deepened by the loss of his 9-year-old daughter, who was struck by a van that ran a red light. An unpretentious Midwesterner who loved fishing in Lake Erie, Voinovich had worked his way up from state legislator to mayor of Cleveland before becoming governor in 1991.
  “If we could reconstitute the family and get everyone into Church,” the late Ohio Gov. George Voinovich told the bishop of Columbus in a private letter years ago, “60% of the problems we are confronted with would go away.” (Credit: Najlah Feanny/Corbis/Getty Images.)
In office, Voinovich corresponded frequently with the state’s most prominent bishops, in Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati. Their letters, which are collected in Voinovich’s papers at Ohio University, show a close and collaborative relationship. The bishops wrote to thank Voinovich for the regular donations that he and his wife made to the church, which ranged as high as $2,000. They traded get-well wishes and condolence notes. “The last two times I’ve seen you you looked a little tired,” Voinovich once wrote to Anthony Pilla, the bishop of Cleveland. “Please take care of yourself.”



Most of all, they strategized about increasing state funding for Catholic schools. As a legislator, Voinovich had worked to launch a set of programs that helped private schools pay for administration, special education, transportation and other services. His support for these expenditures, which by the early ’90s amounted to more than $100 million, stood in contrast with his aggressive efforts to cut the rest of the budget. At one point, he banned peanuts and other snacks from official state flights. Legislators passed around a story about seeing him pluck a penny out of a urinal.
But Voinovich saw spending on parochial schools as fundamentally different, driven by his belief in the value of a Catholic upbringing. “If we could reconstitute the family and get everyone into Church, about 60% of the problems we are confronted with would go away,” he wrote to James Griffin, the bishop of Columbus. “I can assure you that the money you spend to deal with all the problems confronting the community is much better spent than the way government would spend it.”
Soon after Voinovich became governor, he and the bishops began discussing another way to fund Catholic schools: vouchers. The notion of publicly funded subsidies for private schools wasn’t totally new. After courts ordered school integration in the South, in the 1950s, some municipalities helped finance “segregation academies” for white students. At around the same time, the economist Milton Friedman argued that education should be subject to market forces, in part by paying parents to send their children to a school of their choosing. But no city or state had funded a true voucher initiative.
For the state government, there was an obvious risk to funding Catholic schools; the Ohio Constitution says that “no preference shall be given, by law, to any religious society.” Voinovich and his aides worried not only about political repercussions but also about the potential for legal challenges from groups like the ACLU. In April 1991, Voinovich intimated to Pilla that he was recruiting proxies who could obscure their alliance. “We are quietly lining up ‘heavy hitters’ in the business community and are trying to identify someone in the legislature who would be willing to become our advocate,” he wrote.
Voinovich had an ideal partner in David Brennan, a well-connected local businessman. A towering presence at 6-feet-5 (not counting his customary cowboy hat), Brennan had attended Catholic school in Akron before earning degrees in accounting and law, and made a fortune forming corporations for doctors seeking tax benefits. When Voinovich ran for governor, Brennan was a major fundraiser for the campaign. Now he started cultivating allies, donating heavily to a Republican from the Cincinnati suburbs who was a promising sponsor of voucher legislation, as reported by the Akron Beacon Journal, which covered the early voucher push.
In May 1991, Voinovich and Brennan met to discuss creating a commission on school choice, which Brennan would chair. Soon afterward, the bishops provided 18 suggestions for possible members. Six of them ended up on the commission — with no mention of the fact that they had been selected by the church.
As word of the commission spread, it raised concerns. The following spring, an executive at Procter & Gamble, one of the state’s largest employers, urged Voinovich to couch “this sensitive issue” in a broader effort at school reform. “Vouchers on their own could lead to unnecessary divisiveness,” he wrote. The head of the Ohio teachers’ union warned that unilateral action “could explode any chance at building a statewide consensus.” Voinovich responded that he was prepared for discord: “I am confident that whatever recommendations they come back with, it will be difficult for the Ohio Federation of Teachers to support.”
The commission was moving fast. Brennan “is doing an outstanding job,” Voinovich wrote to Pilla. “He is on a mission from God.” Voinovich and Brennan took care to disarm political objections. One briefing document argued that any plan the commission produced “must be substantially tilted in favor of low income ­parents and children” and must require private schools to administer the same ­proficiency tests as public schools. By year’s end, the commission produced its recommendation: Ohio should create a voucher pilot program.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Representative C.J. Prentiss monitored the commission’s work with foreboding. Elected to the Ohio House in 1991, Prentiss had distinguished herself as a leading defender of public education and was steeped in the struggle for school integration. Her father had belonged to the Congress of Racial Equality, and after Prentiss graduated from Cleveland’s Marshall High School — where she was one of six Black students — she attended the 1963 March on Washington. Later, she joined local battles against school segregation, during which she met Michael Charney, a white teacher and union activist who became her third husband. She taught for a while in the Cleveland suburb of Shaker Heights and served on the State Board of Education. In 1993, she and other Black officials in Cleveland condemned Voinovich’s plan. “It is difficult to see how subsidizing private schools will improve public education,” she said. “Private schools have selective entrance requirements, serve only private purposes, and are not accountable to the public.”
Brennan deflected the criticism, noting that the plan was still provisional: “We believe when the education choice bill reaches the final stages, these fine legislators will feel differently than they do today.” In fact, he and Voinovich knew that it would be tough to secure backing for a stand-alone voucher bill; school board members, teachers and administrators were already sending letters to legislators to object. In May 1994, Voinovich contacted Brennan to strategize about how to slip a voucher pilot into the next state budget. “We are going to have to crawl before we walk,” he wrote. “I believe if we can really get it underway in one or two districts during my second term, we will have accomplished more than what [has] been accomplished thus far.”
A few weeks later, Voinovich’s assistant for education policy, Tom Needles, sent him a strategy brief on a forthcoming lunch with the bishops. “The Catholic Conference will continue to maintain a low profile in terms of its formal position on voucher legislation,” Needles wrote. “At the same time, the Conference recognizes that parent organizations in each diocese will play a very active role in lobbying for its passage.” On the last day of January 1995, voucher proponents paid for six buses to carry some 300 children and parents from Cleveland to the Capitol in order to lobby legislators. As parents walked from office to office in the Statehouse, one declared, “The public schools are preparing Black children for prison, the welfare office or the graveyard. As a Black parent, that’s unacceptable.”
Prentiss and a state senator from Cleve­land decided to address the throng. With the parents visibly angry, she knew better than to dismiss concerns about their children’s schooling. “There is a crisis,” she acknowledged. “The question before us is, how do we improve the public schools?”
The bishops, though, were far more organized, with efforts unfolding parish by parish across the state; a list in Voinovich’s papers records hundreds of phone calls and letters to legislators, making the case for vouchers and inviting them to visit local parish schools. Voinovich urged them to do still more. “I really need your help and would appreciate being kept informed as to what is being done so I can convey that to the leadership in both the House and Senate,” he wrote to Daniel Pilarczyk, the archbishop of Cincinnati, in February 1995. The next month, Pilarczyk responded with another list of the church’s actions, including some 20,000 letters sent to ­legislators.
Two weeks later, Voinovich let Pilarczyk know that the House had not only increased funding for Catholic schools but also authorized a “limited scholarship program in the City of Cleveland.” The program would start small, with several thousand vouchers worth about $2,200 apiece. Yet Voinovich recognized that it was a “significant pilot project.” At the time, the only other city that allowed private ­school vouchers was Milwaukee, and the initiative there had initially barred religious schools from participating. Cleveland’s program, in contrast, had been designed from the start to benefit Catholic schools.
In June, the budget won final approval. Six bishops wrote Voinovich to express their gratitude. “Everything we asked you to do was included in your budget,” they told him. “Without your leadership and gentle nudging of legislative leaders, none of this would have been possible.”
Prentiss and Charney quickly grasped the pilot’s import. “This is the beginning of the end for public education,” he told her, only half joking. Prentiss resolved to monitor the program to make sure that the money was spent as intended. After one voucher recipient, an Islamic school, was found to have housed students in unsafe buildings, she successfully sponsored a bill requiring schools that received vouchers to meet the same minimum standards as public schools.
Meanwhile, Prentiss kept pushing for public school reforms: all-day kindergarten, smaller classes, mentorships for at-risk boys. She and Charney were encouraged by test results showing that kids in public schools were performing at least as well as those with vouchers at Catholic schools.
In 1998, Voinovich was elected to the United States Senate; Needles, his aide, went to work as a lobbyist for Brennan. And the push for vouchers entered a new phase, as an aggressive generation of proponents took up a battle in the courts.
In both Ohio and Wisconsin, opponents, led by teachers’ unions, were challenging the programs on the grounds that they violated the separation of church and state. The Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld vouchers; a federal appeals court in Ohio ruled against them.
The U.S. Supreme Court took up a First Amendment challenge to vouchers, based on one of the Ohio cases, in February 2002. Robert Chanin, a lawyer for the National Education Association, told the court, “Under the Cleveland voucher program, millions of dollars in unrestricted public funds are transferred each year from the state treasury into the general coffers of sectarian private schools, and the money is used by those schools to provide an educational program in which the sectarian and the secular are interwoven.” Chanin noted that ­virtually all the students in the voucher program were attending religious schools, rather than secular private schools.
But Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, the likely swing vote in the case, interrupted to pick up on a point made by a state attorney who’d defended the vouchers. In evaluating Cleveland’s choice program, shouldn’t the court consider not only private schools but also other options available to students, such as public magnet schools and charter schools?
The question caught Chanin off guard. The issue was the constitutionality of private school vouchers, yet O’Connor was evoking public school options. The state pressed its advantage, with its lawyer stressing the limited scope of the pilot: “It didn’t take too much money away from the public schools, but gave enough for a limited program that is targeted to the most needy, to the poorest of the poor.”
On June 27, 2002, the Court announced that it had ruled, 5-4, in favor of the Ohio program, arguing that it was “part of a broader undertaking by the State to enhance the educational options of Cleveland’s school children.” Clint Bolick, a leading lawyer on the pro-voucher side, declared on the Supreme Court plaza, “This was the Super Bowl of school choice, and the children won.” Later, he and others gathered at the office of the Institute for Justice, a conservative organization, and toasted with Dom ­Pérignon.

Prentiss was on vacation with Charney in Washington state when she got word of the ruling. “PBS NewsHour” invited her to come to a studio in Vancouver and record a response, but she was too upset to think about what she would say on camera. “I’m not going to be the one,” she told Charney. “Let them get a lawyer.”
After the Supreme Court ruling, the momentum in seeking alternatives to traditional public schools shifted to charter schools — publicly funded institutions that are administered separately from school districts. Many Democrats had championed charters in the ’90s as a more palatable way to offer school choice, and Republicans had adopted the idea, too; Brennan, the chairman of Voinovich’s school choice commission, launched a for-profit charter ­school venture.
In 2005, with charters threatening to cut into parochial school enrollment, Ohio’s Catholic bishops secured a crucial expansion of vouchers beyond Cleveland: a new statewide program called EdChoice, which offered vouchers to students assigned to schools that were judged to be failing, many of them in Columbus and Cincinnati.
Prentiss stayed in the legislature until 2006, becoming the second Black woman to serve as Senate minority leader. Up until the end, she led the resistance to vouchers. As she left the legislature, though, an impassioned advocate for vouchers came in: a Republican representative named Matt Huffman.
Huffman was a lawyer from Lima, a small industrial city in western Ohio. Like Prentiss, he had grown up among activists, but with different political aims. His father, a lawyer and a county prosecutor, took a case against a local cinema that was showing “obscene” movies all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court; his mother co-founded one of the state’s first pregnancy ­crisis centers after abortion was legalized.
Huffman was the fifth of nine children, all of whom went to Catholic schools. This was possible, he said later, because the parish schools were so affordable in those days. But, as tuition climbed (partly to cover the salaries of lay teachers who replaced nuns), the student body skewed wealthier. “The middle class was pretty much shut out of alternatives in education,” he told the Columbus Dispatch in 2022.
One of Huffman’s brothers became the principal of a Catholic elementary school. Huffman, after following his ­father into law, served as a fundraiser for Lima Central Catholic High. He also got involved in local politics, rising to president of the City Council. In 2000, he endorsed a young former Ohio State wrestling coach named Jim Jordan as he ran for the state Senate. Jordan, who is now one of the most stridently conservative members of the U.S. House of ­Representatives, later returned the favor by backing Huffman’s campaign for the state legislature.
By this point, school choice was becoming Huffman’s overriding priority. In Lima, he participated in a standing gin rummy game with the Rev. David Ross, a local Catholic priest, and Leo Hawk, the owner of a metal-forming company, who, in Ross’ recollection, repeatedly pressed Huffman on the issue. “Leo Hawk was very influential in terms of trying to inculcate him with ‘Let the parents decide where to spend their tax dollars,’” Ross told me. “Leo was very forceful in those gatherings.” (Hawk could not be reached for comment.)
During Huffman’s first four years in the legislature, the governor was a Democrat, and the focus was on protecting existing vouchers. But after the Republican John Kasich took office, in 2011, Huffman proposed a significant expansion: making vouchers available to middle-­class Ohio families, too, regardless of whether they were in a failing district. “This is starting down the path of looking at funding education in a fundamentally different way,” he said.
The proposal met with impassioned resistance. Opponents pointed to a ­report in the Plain Dealer that showed voucher students had performed worse than students at the public schools that they would have attended. Among the critics were public school administrators in Lima, where hundreds of students were already receiving vouchers because a few local schools were rated as failing. The exodus of students resulted in a loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars in state revenue. As Lima’s school superintendent at the time, Karel Oxley, explained to me: Even if a class lost students, the school still had to pay for their classroom and teacher. To complicate matters, the students who left tended to be motivated kids from stable families, while special-needs students stayed. This made it harder for public schools to improve their poor test scores. “You have to have your A-team to help the school be as good as possible, but the A-team moves over to the other school,” Oxley, who also served as president of the state superintendents’ association, said. “It’s almost impossible to catch up.”
Oxley is herself Catholic, and consults for a Catholic school in retirement, but she testified against vouchers at a committee hearing around this time. She recalled that Huffman was adamant. “There was nothing I could have said that would have allowed him to see that he might be stripping resources from the greater community,” she told me. “He said, ‘You pay taxes, I pay taxes. Why can’t my taxes go toward my children’s school?’ I said, ‘Because you chose that private school.’ He said, ‘That doesn’t make sense, Karel. My taxes should pay for my child’s education.’” (Huffman did not respond to requests for comment.)
Huffman settled for a partial victory: In 2013, the state allowed EdChoice vouchers for families with incomes up to twice the poverty line in any district. It was a step forward, but Huffman wanted the program to be available to wealthier families, and it would take another ally to help him realize his full ambition.

Phil Burress was always candid about what had brought him to Citizens for Community Values: He was a former pornography addict. Burress had fought the addiction from the age of 14, until he finally swore it off, at 38. “I became a Christian that day,” he told me. From then on, he said, he was a “better father and husband” and “started speaking out about things that are wrong.” His background gave him insight into the enemy. “You have to look at your communities through the eyes of a pornographer and stay ahead of them,” he once told reporters.
Burress, a former organizer with the Brotherhood of Railway and Airline Clerks, joined Citizens for Community Values in 1983. By then, the organization, which started as a Cincinnati prayer group, had devoted itself to fighting pornography and strip clubs, including various enterprises belonging to Larry Flynt, who launched his Hustler brand in Ohio. In 1990, it gained national prominence by leading the opposition to an exhibit of Robert Mapplethorpe photographs at Cincinnati’s Contemporary Arts Center. Not long afterward, Burress took over as president. “We are not some radical, right-wing, fundamental bunch of Bible-­thumping nuts out there yelling and screaming,” Burress said at the time. “We do our homework.”
The group grew under Burress — by 1997, it claimed to have 25,000 supporters — and started taking on nationwide causes, such as pressuring hotels to stop offering pay-per-view porn. In 2004, it led a successful petition drive for an amendment banning same-sex marriage in Ohio, a factor in George W. Bush’s narrow win over John Kerry there. “I was thinking, No way we can get that many signatures,” Lori Viars, a conservative activist in the Cincinnati exurbs, told me. “But we ended up doing it.”
The victory attracted more funding, which the group used to hire full-time lobbyists in Columbus. Its top issues were abortion, same-sex marriage, gay rights and, increasingly, school choice. Though the members were mostly evangelical, not Catholic, they shared the conviction that the public should pay for kids to attend religious schools. Still, Burress told me, the group struggled to persuade legislators to expand voucher access. “We could not get any traction whatsoever,” he said. What changed matters was “electing the right people to office.”
In 2017, Matt Huffman arrived in the state Senate. He had served the maximum eight years in the House and, like many other Ohio legislators, simply ran for the other chamber. In the Senate, school choice remained his primary cause. That year, he sponsored a bill to expand eligibility for vouchers to families that made as much as four times the poverty level. Catholic leaders were thrilled. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen a legislator who did more for school choice,” a former employee of the Catholic Conference of Ohio, the church’s public policy arm, said. “He’s just been a rock.”
Huffman still faced resistance from public school officials, but he now had influential assistance from Citizens for Community Values. In 2016, Burress was succeeded by a new director, Aaron Baer, who signaled a more expansive mission. Baer was a 29-year-old graduate of Ohio University, a hip-hop enthusiast raised by a single parent. “This is a Christian conservative movement for the next generation,” he told the Dispatch. “We talk about poverty, human ­trafficking, opioids, while still talking about ­marriage.” The organization moved its headquarters to Columbus and gave itself a forthright new name: the Center for Christian Virtue. Burress welcomed the change. “I was glad to see them admit that without God we’re nothing,” he told me.

Baer and Huffman were unlikely ­allies. Huffman liked to do impersonations and had a profane streak; he was once forced to apologize for making an ­off-color joke at an office party. But on vouchers they were effective partners, with Baer far more willing to advocate in public than the bishops were. In the next couple of years, Baer fought to get the state to define “failing” schools as broadly as possible, and called out suburban districts, many of which opposed vouchers, when they resisted accepting students from struggling city schools.
By early 2020, Huffman was still trying to make the case for a major voucher expansion. That January, he met with a few dozen public school officials in western Ohio. Craig Kupferberg, the superintendent for Allen County, which includes Lima, told me that he’d raised his hand and asked Huffman, “Have you put anything in the bill to stop the David Dukes of the world from starting up their own private schools and having our tax dollars fund their hateful ideology?” Kupferberg recalled that Huffman had looked at him “like I was from outer space” and said, “What stops homeschooling parents from doing any of that?” (Never mind that vouchers weren’t going to home­schooling families.) Then Huffman embarked on a lengthy complaint about how many people viewed Catholicism as a cult.

Huffman’s proposal stalled again that term. But, two months later, the pandemic arrived and schools closed. After nearly a year, about a third of Ohio’s 609 districts still hadn’t returned to full in-person instruction. The holdouts included many of the largest districts, Cleveland and Columbus among them.
The state’s parochial schools, in contrast, had mostly reopened after a few months. The Catholic Conference of Ohio highlighted students’ educational gains in the legislature. “A lot of legislators appreciated what we did for children, because a lot of legislators were frustrated, too,” the former conference employee said. “We were sort of a beacon in the COVID era.” It helped proponents that many legislators had their own children in Catholic schools. Although Catholics account for only about 17% of the state’s population, they constitute more than half of the Senate and a third of the House.
As the pandemic wore on, school closures inspired similar outrage in other states. They “sparked a parent revolution, because families saw that school systems didn’t care about them all that much,” Corey DeAngelis, a leading voucher proponent, said on “The Megyn Kelly Show,” last May. “This is the silver lining of the pandemic.”
Many parents were alarmed by virtual instruction. It was not just that lessons conducted by Zoom seemed frustratingly inadequate; they also offered a glimpse of what their children were being taught, which in some families caused consternation over a perceived progressive agenda. Viars, the Cincinnati-area activist, noticed a surge of interest in Christian schools. “The books being pushed on these little kids were so objectionable,” she said. “It was really sexually explicit material for little kids. We heard that a lot: ‘No, these kids should not be seeing any of this.’”
In May 2021, two Republican representatives in Ohio introduced a “backpack bill,” which would give every ­family voucher money to spend as they saw fit: $7,500 for each high school student and $5,500 for each younger one. At a press conference announcing the bill, Baer stood beside its sponsors. “In the pandemic, we saw the need to have innovative and different learning environments,” he said. “You had some families who, because their local public schools decided not to open for in-person education, they were forced into an online environment that wasn’t ideal for them.”
The bill went a step further than Huffman had before; whereas he had pushed for vouchers for all but the wealthiest families, the backpack bill included everyone. It was a bold move, but proponents had a new advantage: earlier that year, Huffman’s Republican colleagues had elected him president of the Senate. In that role, not only was he able to push for vouchers — he could also block efforts to reform Ohio’s redistricting system, which had produced maps heavily slanted toward the GOP. By 2022, the Senate had 25 Republicans and eight Democrats; the House was split 64 to 35. “We can kind of do what we want,” Huffman told the Dispatch.
Yet Huffman and his allies decided not to advance the backpack bill through regular legislative channels, which would require stand-alone votes in both chambers. Opposition lingered, even within their own party: Some rural Republicans were conscious that there were few private schools in their districts, and so their constituents’ tax dollars would go toward vouchers used mostly by wealthy suburbanites. And, if more private schools did open in rural areas, that would drain enrollment from public schools that often served as centers of the community.
Instead, Huffman and his counterparts used a maneuver that would have been familiar to George Voinovich: they slipped an expansion of vouchers into the budget, a 1,200-page document that they sent to Gov. Mike De­Wine just before the deadline. Families with incomes of up to 450% of the poverty level would qualify for full payments: $8,407 for high school students and $6,165 for younger ones. These sums came close to covering tuition at many Catholic schools, and far exceeded what many public districts received in per-capita funds from the state. Even families making more than that income threshold, which was $135,000 for a family of four, would qualify for some funding. “Every student in Ohio will be eligible for a scholarship worth at least 10% of the maximum scholarship, regardless of income,” Huffman’s office said.
More than 30 years after Voinovich and the bishops proposed vouchers as a solution for underprivileged children in a single city, public subsidies for private ­school tuition were now universal in Ohio, covering tens of thousands of families. “We’re going to have the money to pay for it,” Huffman said afterward. “I hope more people take advantage of that if they want to.”
C.J. Prentiss died last April at 82. She had spent her retirement with Charney in a cottage on Lake Erie, in Ashtabula County. In her final years, declining health kept her from engaging much in the battle over public education. But she did have a confrontation with Huffman when she returned to Columbus for a Senate reunion in 2022. Several speakers had been chosen for the event, and when Prentiss saw that they were all white she asked Huffman about it. According to Charney, Huffman responded that he didn’t have enough time to line up others. “Don’t lie to me,” Prentiss said, and walked away.
That same year, a coalition of school districts, now numbering more than 200, filed suit against the voucher expansion. The suit alleged that the program exacerbated racial segregation, by essentially allowing private schools to select their own students; 90% of the new voucher recipients are white, in a state where only about two-thirds of students are. The suit also alleged that the vouchers violated two principles of the state constitution: a bar against religious control of public school funds and a promise of an adequate education for all. A judge denied the state’s motion to dismiss the case; a trial is expected in the coming months.
Among the districts that joined the suit is the one in Lima, Huffman’s home town. Virtually all the students enrolled in Catholic schools there now receive vouchers. Enrollment at these and other parochial schools has not increased dramatically; as is true across the state, they have limited capacity, so they accept only those students they prefer. This undermines the narrative that vouchers allow families to escape their public school. But public schools still suffer. Kupferberg, the superintendent, estimates that in his county the voucher expansion is costing schools millions of dollars a year. Federal pandemic relief aid has helped mitigate the damage, but that is coming to an end. “We’re starting to feel the impact,” Kupferberg said.
Meanwhile, some private schools are raising tuition, knowing that vouchers allow families to pay more. In Centerville, south of Columbus, the principal of Incarnation Catholic School told parents last year that it would no longer offer a discount for families that had multiple students enrolled there. “Our parishioner tuition rate is nowhere near the true cost to educate,” she wrote. “This increased revenue will allow us to increase teacher and staff salaries, address deferred maintenance, and hire additional staff.”
Huffman and his allies are pushing for more. Huffman (who has now moved back to the House, and was recently elected speaker) inserted funding for new construction at private schools into the last state budget, with an eye toward creating private school options in rural areas. Also on the table is legislation to create education-savings accounts for families with children in unregulated private schools that now can’t receive vouchers.
For these coming fights, the Center for Christian Virtue is stronger than ever. The organization has assembled a network of dozens of religious schools, which pay the center $5 per enrolled student, up to $3,000 per school, to lobby on their behalf. In effect, the state’s religious schools can now use some of the public money they receive to advocate for the flow of funding to increase.
Between 2020 and 2022, the center’s revenue more than tripled, to $4.2 million. It used some of the money to purchase two buildings opposite the statehouse — one previously owned by the Dispatch — for a total of $2.35 million, giving it space to accommodate a staff that has grown to 20. (The Center for Christian Virtue did not respond to a request for comment.)
In early October, the center held a policy conference, called the Essential Summit, at the Greater Columbus Convention Center. A main topic of discussion was Christian education, with sessions led by the executive director of the Center for Biblical Integration at Liberty University, the college founded by the Rev. Jerry Falwell. One session would address the question “How should we plan for teaching knowing that humans are inherently corrupt?” Another asked, “Why do Christian educators have the most dignifying approach to all humans?”
Huffman was slated to join a discussion with the president of Hillsdale College, a small Christian school in ­Michigan that has become a powerful incubator of conservatism. Also in attendance was Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, which produced the policy blueprint for the second Trump administration. The plan, called Project 2025, includes a strong endorsement of vouchers, and Roberts’ presence was an affirmation of Ohio’s role as a model for the school choice movement. In Florida, the number of voucher recipients approached half a million this school year, up 74%. (The state distributes the same voucher — about $8,000 — regardless of income.) In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott helped to defeat nearly a dozen anti-­voucher Republicans in state legislative primaries last year. He had $10 million in campaign funding from Jeff Yass, a Pennsylvania hedge fund billionaire who has made expanding vouchers his central policy goal.
At the convention center, conference staff turned me away, even though I had paid to register. I hung around as attendees emerged from the morning session, their tote bags filled with brochures for Christian schools, investing advice and health coverage. Many of the event’s discussions were aimed at religious schools that were now supported with public funds. But, as I was about to approach Roberts, security guards blocked the path and told me to leave.

This story was originally reported by Shefali Luthra and Barbara Rodriguez of The 19th. Meet Shefali and Barbara and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Daniella Fodera got an unusually early morning call from her research adviser this month: The doctoral student’s fellowship at Columbia University had been suddenly terminated.
Fodera sobbed on phone calls with her parents. Between the fellowship application and scientific review process, she had spent a year of her life securing the funding, which helped pay for her study of the biomechanics of uterine fibroids — tissue growths that can cause severe pain, bleeding and even infertility. Uterine fibroids, an underresearched condition, impact up to 77 percent of women as they age.
“I’m afraid of what it means for women’s health,” Fodera said. “I’m just one puzzle piece in the larger scheme of what is happening. So me alone, canceling my funding will have a small impact — but canceling the funding of many will have a much larger impact. It will stall research that has been stalled for decades already. For me, that’s sad and an injustice.”
Fodera’s work was a casualty of new federal funding cuts at Columbia University, one of several schools targeted by the Trump administration. The administration is also reducing the workforce at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the agency that oversees public health research, while trying to slash NIH funding to universities.
Researchers say threats to federal research funding and President Donald Trump’s promise to eliminate any policy promoting “diversity, equity and inclusion” are threatening a decades-long effort to improve how the nation studies the health of women and queer people, or improve treatments for the medical conditions that affect them. Agency employees have been warned not to approve grants that include words such as  “women,” “trans” or “diversity.”
That could mean halting efforts to improve the nation’s understanding of conditions that predominantly affect women, including endometriosis, menopause, infectious diseases contracted in pregnancy and pregnancy-related death. It could also stall research meant to treat conditions such as asthma, heart disease, depression and substance abuse disorders, which have different health implications for women versus men, and also have outsized impacts on LGBTQ+ people and people of color — often underresearched patients.
“I want every generation to be healthier than the last, and I’m worried we may have some real setbacks,” said Dr. Sonja Rasmussen, a professor and clinician at Johns Hopkins University who studies the consequences of pregnancy-related infections and the causes of birth defects.

The United States already lagged in promoting scientific inquiry that considered how sex and gender can influence health — and has a recent history of focusing research on White men. Less than 50 years ago, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) actively discouraged researchers from including women who could become pregnant in clinical trials for new medical products, leaving it often unclear if U.S.-based therapeutics were safe for them. It wasn’t until 1993 that clinical trials were legally required to include women and “individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds.”
Around that same time, the federal government launched offices within the NIH, the Department of Health and Human Services and the FDA that focused on women’s health and research. Since then, efforts to consider gender in medical research have progressed, if unevenly. A report last fall from the National Academies of Science Engineering and Medicine found that in the past decade, the level of federal funding devoted to women’s health had actually declined relative to the rest of the NIH’s budget.
The report, requested by Congress, also found that researchers still struggled to understand the implications of common conditions such as endometriosis and uterine fibroids, the long-term implications of pregnancy, or gender gaps in mental health conditions — all areas where Black women in particular experience worse health outcomes or face heightened barriers to appropriate treatment. Investments had stalled in looking at how sex and gender interact with race or class in influencing people’s health outcomes.
The report ultimately called for an additional $15.8 billion over the next five years to address the gaps. Now, efforts to cut federal research funding and limit its acknowledgment of gender could thwart forward momentum.
“If we are banning this study of these issues, or deciding we’re not going to invest in that work, it freezes progress,” said Alina Salganicoff, a lead author on the report and vice president for women’s health at KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research organization.
Already, researchers whose work touches on sex or gender are anticipating losses in federal funding, which they fear could imperil their work moving forward. Some have already had their grants terminated. Many specified that they were not speaking as representatives of their employers.
Whitney Wharton, a cognitive neuroscientist at Emory University, learned on February 28 that she would no longer receive federal funding for her multi-year study looking at effective caregiving models for LGBTQ+ seniors at risk of developing Alzheimer’s. Research suggests that queer adults may be at greater risk of age-related cognitive decline, but they are far less likely to be the subject of research.
Wharton is one of numerous scientists across the country whose work was terminated because it included trans people, per letters those researchers received from the NIH. “Research programs based on gender identity are often unscientific, have little identifiable return on investment, and do nothing to enhance the health of many Americans,” the letter said.
Though Wharton’s work focused on queer adults, it proposed caregiving models that could apply to other people often without family support structures who are at heightened risk for Alzheimer’s as they age.
“The sexual and gender minority community is more likely to age alone in place. We’re less likely to be married or have children,” Wharton said. “These additional roadblocks are not only unnecessary but they are unnecessarily cruel to a community that’s already facing a lot of hardship.”
One of Wharton’s collaborators on the study is Jace Flatt, an associate professor of health and behavioral sciences at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who also received separate notice from the NIH that their research beyond the study had been terminated. Flatt studies LGBTQ+ people and their risk for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, as well as thinking about their needs for care.
Flatt said NIH funding for three of their studies have been canceled in recent weeks, as well as a Department of Defense-funded grant looking at veterans’ health that included LGBTQ+ people. The defense letter stated the research did not align with Trump’s executive order that recognizes only two sexes, male and female.
Flatt estimates about $4.5 million in federal funding was cut from their research, requiring some staff layoffs.
“I made a personal commitment to do this work. Now I’m being told, ‘Your research doesn’t benefit all Americans, and it’s unscientific,’ and basically that I’m promoting inaccurate research and findings. The tone comes across as like it’s harmful to society,” they said. “I’m a public health practitioner. I’m about improving the health and quality of life of all people.”
Jill Becker, a neuroscientist at the University of Michigan, uses rodent studies to better understand how sex differences can affect people’s responses to drug addiction and treatment. Her work has helped suggest that some forms of support and treatment can be more effective for male rats and others for female ones — a divide she hopes to interrogate to help develop appropriate treatments for people who are in recovery for substance use disorder, and, in particular, better treatment for cisgender men.
Becker’s studies were singled out in a Senate hearing by Rand Paul, a Republican, who characterized it as the type of wasteful research that shouldn’t continue. Because she looks at sex differences, she anticipates that when her NIH funding finishes at the end of the year, the agency will no longer support her — a development that could eventually force her lab and others doing similar work to shut down entirely.
“If we no longer include women or females in our research, we’re obviously going to go back to not having answers that are going to be applicable to both sexes,” she said. “And I think that’s a big step backward.”
The NIH did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In interviews with The 19th, academics broadly described a sense of widespread uncertainty. Beyond federal funding, many are unsure if they will still be able to use the government-operated databases they have relied on to conduct comprehensive research. Others said the NIH representatives they typically work with have left the organization. Virtually all said their younger colleagues are reconsidering whether to continue health research, or whether a different career path could offer more stability.
But the Trump administration has remained steadfast. In his recent joint address to Congress, Trump praised efforts to cut “appalling waste,” singling out “$8 million to make mice transgender” — a framing that misrepresented studies involving asthma and breast cancer.
The government’s rhetoric is now deterring some scholars from certain areas of study, even when they recognize a public health benefit. One North Carolina-based psychologist who studies perinatal mental health and hormone therapy for menopausal people said her team had considered expanding their research to look at that treatment’s mental health implications for trans people.
“It’s important, and I don’t have any way of doing that work at the moment,” said the psychologist, who asked that her name be withheld from publication because she fears publicly criticizing the NIH could jeopardize research funding. “There is potential for that line of research in the future, but not in this funding environment.”
The concerns spread beyond those who receive government funding. Katy Kozhimannil, a public health professor at the University of Minnesota, doesn’t receive NIH support for her research on pregnancy-related health and access to obstetrics care in rural areas. Her work has looked at perinatal health care for Native Americans, including examining intimate partner violence as a risk factor for pregnancy-related death. The findings, she hopes, could be used to help develop policy addressing the fact that Native American and Alaska Native people are more likely to die during pregnancy than White people.
But future studies may not be possible, she fears, because of an interruption in data collection to PRAMS, a comprehensive federal database with detailed information about Americans’ pregnancy-related health outcomes. Within the first weeks of the new administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reportedly told state health departments to stop collecting data to maintain the system, while saying that it will be brought back online once it is in compliance with the new government diversity policies.
Kozhimannil and other scholars in her field are worried about what that means — and whether PRAMS will continue to publish information showing outcomes by race or geography. Those would be  tremendous omissions: A vast body of data shows that in the United States, Black and American Indian women are at elevated risk of dying because of pregnancy. People in rural areas face greater barriers to reproductive health care than those in urban ones. Without the  information PRAMS is known for, Kozhimannil said, it will be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to conduct research that could address those divides.
It’s not clear if or when that information will be available, she added. One of her doctoral students requested access to PRAMS data in January and has still not heard back on whether it will be made available to her — a delay that is “not normal,” Kozhimannil said.
“It’s hard to imagine getting toward a future where fewer moms die giving birth in this country, because the tools we had to imagine that are not available,” she said. “I’m a creative person and I’ve been doing this a while, and I care a lot about it. But it’s pushing the boundaries of my creativity and my innovation as a researcher when some of the basic tools are not there.”
Paul Prince, a spokesperson for the CDC, acknowledged “some schedule adjustments” to PRAMS to comply with Trump’s executive orders, but claimed it does not affect the program’s continuation. He added: “PRAMS was not shut down.”
“PRAMS remains operational and continues its mission — identifying issues impacting high-risk mothers and infants, tracking health trends, and measuring progress toward improving maternal and infant health,” he said in an email.

It’s unclear the scope of long-term ramifications to health research, but Kathryn “Katie” Schubert is tracking it closely. She is the president and CEO of the Society for Women’s Health Research, an organization that has advocated on decades of congressional policy. In 2005, the group released a report that found just 3 percent of grants awarded by NIH took sex differences into consideration.
In February, her organization and other groups sent a letter to the administration highlighting the need to continue prioritizing women’s health research.
“We have gotten to the point where we know what the problems are. We know where we would like to try to solve for — so how are we going to find these solutions, and what’s the action plan?” she told The 19th.
In the past, Trump has shown a willingness to address women’s health inequity in at least in some arenas. A 2016 law, signed by former President Barack Obama, established a committee on how to better incorporate pregnant and lactating people into clinical trials. Trump continued that work under his first administration.
Still, when pharmaceutical companies began developing vaccines against COVID-19 in 2020, they at first did not include pregnant or breastfeeding people in clinical trials, despite federal policy encouraging them to do so and data showing that pregnant people were at higher risk of complications from the virus. Those same vaccine trials also initially excluded people who were HIV positive — a policy with particular ramifications for trans people, who are living with HIV at a higher rate than cisgender people — and only changed their policy after public outcry.
Trump returned to power on the heels of a renowned federal focus on women’s health research and gender equity. In 2023, President Joe Biden announced the first-ever White House Initiative on Women’s Health Research to address chronic underfunding.
During his final State of the Union address, Biden called on Congress to invest $12 billion in new funding for women’s health research. He followed that with an executive order directing federal agencies to expand and improve related research efforts.
In December, former First Lady Jill Biden led a conference at the White House where she highlighted nearly $1 billion in funding committed over the past year toward women’s health research. She told a room that included researchers: “Today isn’t the finish line; it’s the starting point. We — all of us — we have built the momentum. Now it’s up to us to make it unstoppable.”
The Trump administration rescinded the council that oversaw the research initiative. The press office for the Trump administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Schubert said prioritizing women’s health has bipartisan support, and she remains hopeful of its popularity across both sides of the aisle. She also recognizes it could mean a new era of investment sources.
“We’ll continue as an organization, of course, with our partners, to work to fulfill our mission and to advocate for that federal investment and to make sure that the workforce is there and make that policy change. We’ll do that under the best of times and the worst of times,” she said. “But I think when we think about sort of the broader community — we’ve seen other philanthropic organizations come in and say, ‘OK, we’re ready to partner and really make this investment on the private side.’”
Women’s health research has more visibility than ever, and not just because some high-profile celebrities and media personalities are investing time and money toward addressing it. Social media algorithms are also increasingly targeting messaging around women’s health and wellness. Economists estimate that investing $350 million in research that focuses on women could yield $14 billion in economic returns.
“Yes, we are in a very difficult time when it comes to the federal budget,” Schubert said. “Even in spite of that, there will be opportunities to see this issue continue to rise to the top.”
The speed and scope of those opportunities may not extend to researchers like Flatt in Nevada. They plan to appeal their NIH funding cuts, but they don’t feel optimistic — in part because the letters state that no modifications of their projects will change the agency’s decision.
Flatt noted that in recent weeks, some people have suggested that they exclude transgender people from their studies. Flatt said excluding people of all genders is not pro-science.
“I refuse to do that,” they said. “The administration is saying that it needs to be for all Americans. They are Americans.”
Fodera, the Columbia doctoral student, will continue her research on uterine fibroids for now, due partly to timing and luck: The fellowship had already paid out her stipend for the semester, and her adviser pooled some money together from another source.
But the future of her fellowship is in question, and such research opportunities are closing elsewhere. Fodera is expected to graduate in a few months, and plans to continue in academia with the goal of becoming a professor. She’s looking for a postdoctoral position, and is now considering opportunities outside of the United States.

The Judiciary Committee is hearing public testimony starting at 9:30 a.m. on Friday on seven of these bills, which comes after about two dozen people gathered at the State House on Wednesday for the annual “Hands Around the Capitol” lobbying effort, during which organizers also called on young people to get involved in the anti-abortion movement.
House Minority Leader Katrina Smith (R-Palermo) and Sen. Dick Bradstreet (R- Kennebec) spoke at the event, calling for federal intervention to provide resources for women facing unplanned pregnancies and the establishment of pregnancy resource centers. These centers, also called crisis pregnancy centers, often present themselves as a resource for pregnant people, but most are run by anti-abortion groups and do not provide or refer for abortion services.
Smith and Bradstreet framed the event as supporting women’s rights while providers say the legislation being advocated for would harm women.
“Mainers have made it clear that access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive healthcare is essential to their lives. Since the fall of Dobbs in 2022, they have twice elected a pro-reproductive rights majority to the statehouse,” said Maine Family Planning President and CEO George Hill in a statement to Maine Morning Star.
Hill said, on the other hand, the bills before the Legislature “would harm patients’ health by limiting access to essential sexual and reproductive health care.”
Overturning existing laws
The most extreme of the proposals comes from Rep. Abigail Griffin of Levant in LD 975, which would repeal the state laws authorizing abortion.
The bill would also change the definitions of “human being” and “person” within the Maine Criminal Code to include “all human beings beginning at the moment of conception.” These definitions would apply to the statutes prohibiting murder, assault, domestic violence assault and other offenses against a human being or a person.
In light of these changes, the bill would also repeal the crimes of elevated aggravated assault on a pregnant person and domestic violence elevated aggravated assault on a pregnant person. 
Other proposals take a more targeted approach by seeking to walk back abortion protections added in recent years. 
Maine shield law protecting reproductive, gender-affirming care takes effect Friday

LD 682 would alter the 2023 law that allows abortions late in a pregnancy if a doctor deems the procedure to be necessary. The bill would change the statute to only when it is “medically necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother,” rather than when a licensed physician determines it is necessary, or when “the fetus is diagnosed with a fetal anomaly that will, with a reasonable certainty, result in the death of the child within three months after birth.”
The bill would also reestablish criminal penalties for performing an abortion without a license or after viability as well as require that the report of abortions made to the state include the race, marital status and level of education of the person on whom the abortion is performed. 
It is sponsored by Sen. David Haggan of Penobscot and nine Republican co-sponsors, including Assistant Senate Minority Leader Matthew Harrington of York and Assistant House Minority Leader Katrina Smith of Palermo.
Lawmakers’ ongoing debates about MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program, are also manifesting in abortion law. 
Rep. Reagan Paul of Winterport earlier attempted to remove coverage of abortion under MaineCare through a floor amendment in the two-year budget that failed.

Maine started requiring MaineCare coverage of abortion in 2019 and has seen proposals to repeal the law every session since. 
This session, that proposal is in LD 253, sponsored by Rep. Kathy Javner of Chester and co-sponsored by Paul and others. 
Medication abortion
Three bills directly discuss abortion by medication, but two specifically aim to restrict access to it. 
The vast majority of abortions in Maine last year used medication. Over 80% of Maine Family Planning patients, more than 60% of Mabel Wadsworth patients, and roughly 63% of Planned Parenthood of New England’s relied on medication abortion for procedures in 2024, according to the providers.
LD 866 would prohibit purchasing or obtaining any abortion drugs online. It would also require a licensed health care professional to oversee medication abortions in person. It’s sponsored by Griffin and seven Republican co-sponsors. 
LD 887 would make it a Class C crime — a low level felony, punishable by up to five years in prison — to provide or attempt to provide an abortion drug to a patient without physically examining the patient, being physically present for the abortion, scheduling a follow-up visit with the patient and providing them with a catch kit and medical waste bag. The bill also would also make manufacturers liable for the improper disposal of abortion drugs, with a civil penalty of $20,000.
LD 887 is sponsored by Paul and five Republican co-sponsors, including Griffin and Haggan. 
Particularly since the overturn in 2022 of Roe v. Wade, the landmark case that had established the right to abortion, there have been ongoing attempts to restrict medication abortion across the country, including efforts to reinterpret the dormant Comstock Act to criminalize the mailing of abortion-related drugs and legal challenges to the Food and Drug Administration‘s approval of mifepristone, one of two pharmaceuticals used in medication abortion.
In 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously rejected attempts to roll back access to mifepristone. 
Reproductive health providers call for more state funding as federal threats loom

While President Donald Trump has reinstated some of the anti-abortion policies from his first term, the president has yet to act on the FDA’s loosening of restrictions to accessing abortion pills since then. On Tuesday, the Senate confirmed Trump’s pick for FDA commissioner, Marty Makary, who wouldn’t commit to specific action on mifepristone during his confirmation hearing, though he’s been public about his anti-abortion views. 
Informed consent 
Related to medication abortion, Paul proposed LD 1007, which would add to what health care professionals are required to inform a patient to obtain informed consent for such a procedure. 
Currently, medical professionals are required to inform the patient at least the following for all abortion procedures: that the person is pregnant, the number of weeks since the probable conception date, the risks associated with the pregnancy and abortion technique to be performed, and, at the patient’s request, alternatives to abortion such as adoption and information about economic assistance that can be accessed to help carry the fetus to term. 
The bill would add to this list, solely for medication abortions, “specific information about the potential ability of qualified health care professionals to reverse the effects of the abortion.”
Paul also proposed LD 1154, which would require that for all abortions, providers also inform patients about something called perinatal hospice services.
As defined by the bill text, these services mean comprehensive support after a prenatal diagnosis indicating the fetus has a life-limiting condition and may die before or shortly after birth.
The support would start from the time of diagnosis through the time of birth and death of the child, including counseling and medical care by maternal and fetal medical specialists — or also a member of the clergy, social worker or “specialty nurse focused on alleviating fear and ensuring that the woman and the woman’s family experience the life and death of the child in a comfortable and supportive environment.”

This article was originally published by Barn Raiser and Floodlight News.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced late Tuesday it will release previously authorized grant funds to farmers and small rural business owners to build renewable energy projects — but only if they rewrite applications to comply with President Donald Trump’s energy priorities.
The move has left some farmers perplexed — and doubtful that they’ll ever get the grant money they were promised, given the Trump administration’s emphasis on fossil fuels and hostility toward renewable energy.
Some of the roughly 6,000 grant applicants have already completed the solar, wind or other energy projects and are awaiting promised repayment from the government. Others say they can’t afford to take on the projects they’d been planning unless the grant money comes through.
Ohio businesses were promised funding for solar but worry the Trump administration won’t pay

A Floodlight analysis shows the overwhelming majority of the intended recipients of this money reside in Trump country — congressional districts represented by Republicans.
After hearing of the USDA’s latest announcement Wednesday, Minnesota strawberry farmer Andy Petran said he suspects many previously approved projects won’t be funded. He’d been approved for a $39,625 grant to install solar panels on his farm. But like many other farmers nationally, Petran got word from the USDA earlier this year that his grant money had been put on hold.
“It’s not like any small farmer who is looking to put solar panels on their farms will be able to put a natural gas refinery or a coal refinery on the farm,” Petran said. “I don’t know what they expect me to switch to.”
Petran was counting on the benefits that solar power would bring to his farm.
After getting word in September that the USDA had approved his grant application, he expected the solar panels would not only reduce his electricity bill but allow him to sell power back to the grid. He and his wife figured the extra income would help expand their Twin Cities Berry Co. and pay down their debt more quickly.
Petran’s optimism was soon extinguished. A USDA representative told him earlier this year that the grant had been frozen.
His 15-acre farm about 40 miles north of Minneapolis operates on a razor-thin margin, Petran said, so without the grant money, he can’t afford to build the $80,000 solar project.
  Andy Petran, shown here in front of the barn at his Minnesota strawberry farm, had been counting on a USDA grant to help him build a solar array that would have saved the farm money. Now that grant is frozen, so Petran can’t move forward with the project. (Photo courtesy of Andy Petran)
“Winning these grants was a contract between us and the government,” he said. “There was a level of trust there. That trust has been broken.”
In its announcement, issued Tuesday night, the USDA said grant recipients will have 30 days to review and revise their project plans to align with President Trump’s Unleashing American Energy Executive Order, which prioritizes fossil fuel production and cuts federal support for renewable energy projects.
“This process gives rural electric providers and small businesses the opportunity to refocus their projects on expanding American energy production while eliminating Biden-era DEIA and climate mandates embedded in previous proposals,” the USDA news release said. “… This updated guidance reflects a broader shift away from the Green New Deal.”
USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said in the release that the new directive will give rural energy providers and small businesses a chance to “realign their projects” with Trump’s priorities.
It’s unclear what this will mean for grant recipients who’ve already spent money on renewable energy projects — or those whose planned projects have been stalled by the administration’s funding freeze.
The USDA didn’t directly answer those questions. In an email to Floodlight on Wednesday, a department spokesperson said the agency must approve any proposed changes to plans — but offered no specific guidance on what or whether changes should be made.
“Awardees that do not respond via the website will be considered as not wishing to make changes to their proposals, and disbursements and other actions will resume after 30 days,” the email said. “For awardees who respond via the website to confirm no changes, processing on their projects will resume immediately.”

 IRA funding targeted

The grant funding was put on hold after an executive order issued by President Trump on his first day in office. It froze hundreds of billions of dollars for renewable energy under President Joe Biden’s massive climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
The law added more than $1 billion to the USDA’s 17-year-old Rural Energy for America (REAP) program.
About 6,000 REAP grants funded with IRA money have been paused and are being reviewed for compliance with Trump’s executive order, according to a March 5 email from the USDA’s rural development office to the office of U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland.
A lawsuit filed earlier this month challenges the legality of the freeze on IRA funding for REAP projects.
Earthjustice lawyer Hana Vizcarra, one of the attorneys who filed the suit, called the latest USDA announcement a “disingenuous stunt.”
“President Trump and Secretary Rollins can’t change the rules of the game well into the second half,” she said in a statement Wednesday. “This is the definition of an arbitrary and capricious catch-22.”
Under the REAP grant program, farmers pay for renewable and lower carbon energy projects, then submit proof of the completed work to the USDA for reimbursement. The grants were intended to fund solar panels, wind turbines, grain dryers, irrigation upgrades and other projects, USDA data shows.
At a press conference in Atlanta on March 12, Rollins said, “If our farmers and ranchers, especially, have already spent money under a commitment that was made, the goal is to make sure they are made whole.”
But some contend the administration is unfairly making farmers jump through more hoops.
“This isn’t cutting red tape; it’s adding more,” said Andy Olsen, senior policy advocate with the Environmental Law and Policy Center, a Midwest-based environmental advocacy group. “The USDA claims to deliver on commitments, but these new rules could result in awarded grants being permanently frozen.”
U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, a longtime farmer and Maine Democrat who sits on the House agriculture committee, said she thinks it’s illegal and unconstitutional for the administration to withhold grant money allocated by Congress. Beyond that, she said, it has hurt cash-strapped farmers.
“This is about farmers making ends meet,” she told Floodlight. “It’s not some ideological issue for us.”
 GOP lawmakers silent

Using USDA data, Floodlight identified the top 10 congressional districts that received the most grants. They’re all represented by Republicans who have said little publicly about the funding freezes affecting thousands of their constituents. It’s impossible to tell from the USDA data which REAP grants will get paid out.
The congressional district that received the most REAP grants was Iowa’s 2nd District, in the northeastern part of the state. Farmers and business owners there got more than 300 grants from 2023 through 2025. The district is represented by U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, who has previously voiced support for “alternative energy strategies.”
!function(){“use strict”;window.addEventListener(“message”,(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[“datawrapper-height”]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(“iframe”);for(var t in a.data[“datawrapper-height”])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[“datawrapper-height”][t]+”px”;r.style.height=d}}}))}();
“More than half of the energy produced in Iowa is from renewable sources, and that is something for Iowans to be very proud of,” she told the House Appropriations Committee in June 2022.
Hinson’s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the matter.
The No. 2 spot for REAP grants: Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District, represented by U.S. Rep. Brad Finstad. In that district, which spans southern Minnesota, more than 260 farmers and rural businesses were approved for REAP grants.
Finstad’s office did not return multiple emails and calls requesting comment. His constituents have been complaining about his silence on funding freezes. They’ve staged at least two demonstrations at his offices in Minnesota. Finstad said he held a Feb. 26 telephone town hall joined by 3,000 people in his district.
In a Feb. 28 letter to a constituent, Finstad said Rollins has announced that the USDA will honor contracts already signed with farmers and that he looks forward to working with the administration “to support the needs of farm country.”
Finstad is no stranger to the REAP program. Before becoming a congressman, he was the USDA’s state director of rural development for Minnesota. In that role, he was a renewable booster.
“By reducing energy costs, renewable energy helps to create opportunities for improvement elsewhere, like creating jobs,” Finstad said in a 2021 USDA press release. That has since been deleted from the agency’s website.
Rollins, meanwhile, called herself “a massive defender of fossil fuels” at her confirmation hearing, and she has expressed skepticism about the findings of climate scientists. “We know the research of CO2 being a pollutant is just not valid,” Rollins said at the Heartland Institute’s 2018 conference on energy.
She has also said that she welcomes the efforts of Elon Musk and his cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency team at the USDA.
 Losing trust in government

Jake Rabe, a solar installer in Blairstown, Iowa, said he has put up more than 100,000 solar modules in the state since getting into the business in 2015. More than 30 of his customers have completed their installation but are awaiting frozen grant funding, he said. At least 10 more have signed the paperwork but are hesitant to begin construction. Millions of dollars worth of business is frozen, he said.
On top of that, Rabe said, the state’s net metering policies — in which solar users get credits for any excess power they send back to the grid — are set to expire in 2026.
“I kind of feel like it may be the beginning of the end for the solar industry in Iowa with what’s going on,” said Rabe, who owns Rabe Hardware.
Despite it all, he remains a Trump supporter.

“Under the current administration, I think we’re doing things that are necessary for the betterment of the entire United States,” he said.
On March 13, Earthjustice, a nonprofit environmental law group, filed a federal lawsuit against the USDA on behalf of five farmers and three nonprofits. They’re seeking a court order to compel the Trump administration to honor the government’s grant commitments, saying it violated the Constitution by refusing to disburse funds allocated by Congress.
Vizcarra, the Earthjustice lawyer, said she is disturbed by the lack of concern from Congress, whose powers appear to have been usurped by the administration.
She added, “These are real people, real farmers and real organizations whose projects have impacts on communities who are left with this horrible situation with no idea of when it will end.”
One of the plaintiffs, Laura Beth Resnick, grows dahlias, zinnias and other cut flowers on a small farm about 30 miles north of Baltimore.
Florists are her customers, and demand for her flowers blooms during cold-weather holidays like Thanksgiving. Each of her three greenhouses is half the length of a football field, and heating them during those months isn’t cheap, Resnick said. The power bill for Butterbee Farm often exceeds $500 a month.
So a year ago, Resnick applied for a USDA renewable energy grant, hoping to put solar panels on her barn roof — a move that she estimated would save about $5,000 a year. In August, the USDA sent word that her farm had been awarded a grant for $36,450.
The cost of installing solar panels was $72,000, she said. So she paid a solar contractor $36,000 upfront, expecting that she’d pay the rest in January when the federal grant money came in. The solar panels were installed in December.

But the federal government’s check never arrived. A Feb. 4 email from a USDA representative said her request for reimbursement was rejected due to the Trump administration’s recent executive orders.
Resnick said she sought help from her elected representatives but got “pretty much nowhere.”
After hearing about the USDA’s announcement Wednesday, Resnick said that based on the response she’s previously gotten from the USDA, she’s not confident she will get her grant money.
“I’ve lost my trust in the USDA at this point,” she said. “Our project is complete, so we can’t change the scope of it.”
Van Hollen, the Maryland Democrat, said he supports the legal fight against the funding freeze.
“Donald Trump and Elon Musk are scamming our farmers,” Van Hollen said in a statement to Floodlight. “By illegally withholding these reimbursements for work done under federal grants, they’re breaking a promise to farmers and small businesses in Maryland and across the country.”
 Renewable projects on hold

Since 2023, when IRA funding became available, the USDA has given or loaned about $21.3 billion through programs to support renewable energy in rural areas, according to a Floodlight analysis of agency data, including the REAP program.
Those grant payments were processed until Jan. 20, when the Trump administration announced its freeze.
Trump’s decision was in line with Project 2025, a conservative blueprint crafted by the Heritage Foundation aimed at reshaping the U.S. government. That document called for repealing the IRA and rescinding “all funds not already spent by these programs.”
Environmental groups have sharply criticized the administration’s move, and several lawsuits are challenging the legality of the freeze of IRA funding.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
At a recent public roundtable, Maggie Bruns, CEO of the Prairie Rivers Network which supports Illinois communities’ transition to clean energy, listed REAP grants that have been held up in Illinois, where her multifaceted environmental nonprofit is based. A $390,000 grant for a solar array at the grocery store in Carlinville; $27,000 for solar panels at an auto body shop in Staunton; $51,000 for a solar array for a golf course in Alton.
Since 2023, farmers and businesses in Illinois have been approved for more than 590 REAP grants, making the state the third highest in number of recipients in the United States, Floodlight’s analysis shows. In an interview with Barn Raiser, Bruns said the decision to freeze such grants has caused unneeded stress for farmers. Before the executive order, USDA’s rural development team had worked hard to bring dollars for renewable energy projects to Illinois farmers, she said.
“That’s the thing we should be celebrating right now,” Bruns said, “and instead we have to fight to make sure that money actually does land into the pockets of the people who have gone ahead, jumped through all these hoops and are attempting to do the right thing for their businesses and their farms.”
In January, Dan Batson’s nursery in Mississippi was approved for a $400,367 REAP grant — money that he planned to use to install four solar arrays. He intended to use that solar energy to power the pumps that irrigate more than 1 million trees, a move that would have saved the company about $25,000 a year in electricity costs.
Seated in a wooded area about 30 miles north of Biloxi, his 42-year-old GreenForest nursery ships potted magnolias, hollies, crepe myrtles and other trees to southern states. Until a couple of months ago, Batson had been excited about what the grant money would mean for the business.

But now the grant has been frozen and Batson says he can’t afford to move ahead with the project. (Photo courtesy of Daniel Batson)
But when he saw news about the funding being held up earlier this year, he called a local USDA representative who confirmed the funds had been frozen. Batson had already sent the solar contractor $240,000. Now, his plans are on hold.
“I just can’t do the project if I don’t get the money,” he said.
Tuesday’s announcement from the USDA makes him no more confident he’ll get the money, he said.
Batson said he’s a fiscal conservative so he understands the effort to cut costs. “But,” he said, “the way they’ve gone about it has disrupted a lot of business owners’ lives.”

American Indian and Alaska Native tribes are fighting for equal governance and sovereignty over their own health data. (Kris Hanning/University of Arizona)When Stephanie Russo Carroll, a citizen of the Native Village of Kluti-Kaah in Alaska, set out to earn her doctorate in tribal health 15 years ago, she focused her research on tribal cultural and health programs within six tribes.
She needed vital statistics data, such as birth and death rates, for each of them. But getting that data from the state, which houses vital statistics, was difficult — and in some cases, the data she needed was missing.
“Health outcomes data were unobtainable,” Carroll recalled. In one case, her team had to try using breastfeeding rates as a proxy to estimate birth rates. But even getting those for all six tribes was impossible.
For the next two decades, Carroll would continue to push for U.S. tribes — which are sovereign nations — to own and maintain control over their data, including health statistics.
The concept, known as data sovereignty, is important amid the harrowing health disparities seen in tribal people, rooted in forced assimilation dating back more than a century. Often, data gathered by and about tribes has been shared with state and federal agencies; but those same agencies haven’t always shared their tribal-related statistics in return.
The reasons vary, from systemic issues within the health care system to mistaken assumptions by some federal officials about what data be securely sent to tribes without risking privacy violations.
Lackluster investigations may perpetuate high Native infant mortality rate

The lack of tribe-specific data has hindered tribes from fully taking care of their members and clouded their work on public health responses to disease outbreaks such as syphilis and COVID-19, on maternal and infant health outcomes, and on chronic issues such as diabetes, heart disease and substance use.
Data sovereignty is especially relevant now, as the Trump administration scrubs federal health websites of data that recognizes and tracks metrics among the country’s various racial and ethnic groups, including what little data there is on tribal members.
States govern their own health data systems. But the same isn’t true for the nation’s 574 federally recognized tribes.
Now an associate professor of public health at the University of Arizona, Carroll co-founded the U.S. Indigenous Data Sovereignty Network and directs the Collaboratory for Indigenous Data Governance. Both are groups that work to research and strengthen Indigenous data governance, accuracy and data-driven policy.
“If you don’t know who has been sick or hospitalized,” Carroll said, “how can you make sure you have the right care systems for your community?”
 Withholding tribes’ data

As part of its slashing of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, the Trump administration removed numerous racial, ethnic, adolescent and maternal health datasets from the websites of several federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While some of the data has been reinstated, the swift deletions raised alarms in tribal communities.
Abigail Echo-Hawk, a member of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma and director of the Urban Indian Health Institute, said the youth behavioral risk surveys were reinstated, but were missing key race and ethnicity search features that tribes use to track mental health conditions in American Indian and Alaska Native teens.
“Now, we can’t search, disaggregate by Native youth,” she said. “That information is about our children, and it is the legal right of both now the tribal epidemiology centers and the tribes to have access to that previously gathered information.”

Despite their public health authority, tribes and tribal epidemiology centers, which support tribes with health data tracking, say federal and state health officials have long withheld or denied requests to direct access of health data related to their tribes, including coronavirus data during the pandemic.
Such data is tied to treaty rights obligations and shouldn’t be lumped together with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives currently under attack by the Trump administration, Echo-Hawk said.
“Our treaty rights are tied to having information around tribal people. So, if you’re going to uphold our treaty rights, you need to say: ‘This number of Native people are experiencing this issue,’ or ‘This number of Native people exist,’” she said.
It wasn’t until 2021 that the CDC conducted its first comprehensive life expectancy profile of American Indians and Alaska Natives; it showed that in 2019, their life expectancy was seven years lower than that of white people.
“All of the data is a story. It’s a grandmother, it’s a son, it’s a story of a community’s well-being,” Echo-Hawk said.
When tribes receive federal grants — whether for transportation, housing or education initiatives — there are grant reporting requirements.










All of data is a story. It's a grandmother, it's a son, it's a story of a community's well-being.


– Abigail Echo-Hawk, director of the Urban Indian Public Health Institute


Under those rules, tribes send raw data to federal agencies, but they often don’t get that data back, said social demographer Desi Small-Rodriguez, an assistant professor of sociology and American Indian studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, who co-founded the data sovereignty network with Carroll.
“It’s a one-way data highway coming from tribal governments — leaving tribal governments and going into the feds — and it’s not coming back,” said Small-Rodriguez. She also directs the Data Warriors Lab, working with tribes — including her own Northern Cheyenne Tribe of Montana — to develop legal mechanisms to ensure data ownership.
She said the federal government should provide funding, as part of its treaty obligations, to pay for expensive data support such as secure storage systems, high-performance computers and analytics staff.
“As part of our treaty rights, we have a right to health care and education. We have a right to clean water and air — and data form the basis for all of that,” she said.
 State data agreements

In January, the Tulalip Tribes in northwest Washington state secured a data-sharing agreement with the state department of health. It gives the tribes access to the state’s disease reporting system, allowing them to extract some data directly. Tulalip plans to eventually secure access to more datasets.
It’s the first agreement of its kind in the state, said Summer Hammons, legislative policy analyst in the Treaty Rights and Governmental Affairs Department of the Tulalip Tribes, which has at least 5,000 members. Hammons grew up on the reservation.
She hopes it will help the tribe direct resources and funds where they’re needed — whether it’s more cancer screenings or vaccinations against diseases such as measles, as other states grapple with outbreaks of the virus.
“It allows us to collaborate and lead on outbreak investigations related to tribal members,” Hammons said. “It’s a clear outline that tribes own their data in partnership with the state, because the state’s the one that’s collecting it. But we want to tell our story, and we want to be able to work with DOH [department of health] to be mindful of our stories and to also get better access to the statistics.”
For Indian Country, federal cuts decimate core tribal programs

A few other states — Alaska, Arizona, Oregon and South Dakota — also have limited-scope agreements with tribes.
Gary Ferguson, Unangax (Aleut), is the director of integrative medicine at Tulalip Health Clinic. He said he hopes the data will help the tribe track health care interventions over time.
“We don’t know what’s working. We don’t know what’s not working,” he said. “We want to celebrate our wins.”
 Tracking disease

In recent years, the nation has seen alarming surges in congenital syphilis, a preventable infection passed through pregnancy to newborns. Nearly 40% can be stillborn or die as a newborn. Babies can also suffer lifelong blindness or deafness. Tribal babies suffer the highest rate.
Officials at the Great Plains Tribal Epidemiology Center, which tracks tribal public health across four states, were denied syphilis data from local public health departments for years until the group leaned on the CDC for assistance.
It wasn’t until then that, finally, last year, one state — South Dakota — agreed to share American Indian and Alaska Native syphilis cases as soon as they’re reported, said Sarah Shewbrooks, the group’s lead tribal epidemiologist. Shewbrooks hopes the new South Dakota access will pave the way for more agreements in the other Great Plains states.

 ‘We needed this yesterday’

During COVID-19, American Indian and Alaska Native people were more likely to be infected and compared with white people, had double the risk of in-hospital death and three times the rate of severe infection, research shows. Yet even then, data weren’t telling the whole story.
Echo-Hawk’s organization published a report card in 2021 that scored each state’s collection of Natives’ COVID-19 cases. In total, the nation averaged a D+. This year, she published a follow-up for epidemiologists on addressing the misclassification of Native people, who often are listed as “white” or “Hispanic” in health settings and death certificates. Many states also inconsistently or don’t report tribal affiliation on death certificates, which can make tribe-specific death rates elusive.
A report in 2021 from the nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office found that some officials from the CDC and the Indian Health Services agency didn’t recognize that they were required by law to share data with tribal epidemiology centers, the centers told investigators.
In the GAO report, investigators detailed logistical barriers, including federal agencies’ reluctance to share COVID-19 data because of concerns around privacy and security in data transmission.
“This is one of the best examples of what structural racism looks like,” said Shewbrooks. “Because when you look at the infrastructure for public health systems and public health data, tribes and [tribal epidemiology centers] were never included in that infrastructure.
“COVID really put it up there as: No, we needed this yesterday.”
Shewbrooks said that as part of her work she’d go to funeral directors, who may fill out death certificates, throughout the region to educate them on proper classification of American Indian people. “I even had one say to me once, ‘I just always code them by how they look. I never ask what their race is.’”
“A lot of them didn’t know that this is data that gets really used,” she said. “Vital records data is just super important, foundational work in a lot of epidemiological work.”

There is no national standard for tribal health data, explained Cheryl Ellenwood, who is a citizen of the Nez Perce Nation and also Diné (Navajo).
Ellenwood, an assistant professor in Washington State University’s School of Politics, Philosophy and Public Affairs, experienced firsthand the data disconnect when both her parents died of COVID-19.
Four years ago this month, her mother, Annie Benally Ellenwood, an enrolled Navajo tribal member from New Mexico, died at age 71 in a hospital in Idaho. Annie Ellenwood’s death, however, wouldn’t show up in primary statistics of COVID-19 deaths in Navajo people — her tribe isn’t listed on her death certificate.
“I was very hurt by this, because my mother died because of COVID-19, and I wanted her death to count and mean something,” Ellenwood said.
“It still feels very life and death, like we are fighting to demonstrate the impact of so many things on our people,” she said.

Tim Fleming of Covington said he decided to remove a new election night ballot counting rule after local election supervisors testified Wednesday that a tight Election Day counting deadline would place unfair burdens on election staffers. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderA Georgia GOP-controlled Senate panel Thursday greenlighted a revised version of a wide-ranging bill packed with controversial provisions that no longer include plans to hand voter challenge complaints to state election officials and  enforce new ballot counting methods.
House Bill 397, which still contains several controversial rule changes, passed the Senate Ethics Committee Thursday night with four Democratic senators voting against it.
The bill has been criticized for limiting voters’ ability to drop off absentee ballots on the final weekend before Election Day and other proposed changes to election law.
The bill’s sponsor, Covington Republican Rep. Tim Fleming said he also decided to remove a new election night ballot counting rule after local election supervisors testified Wednesday that a tight Election Day counting deadline would place unfair burdens on election staffers and present chain of custody challenges.
The bill still aims to ban the state from participating in third-party voter list sharing databases like the Electronic Registration Information Center, known as ERIC. Georgia secretary of state officials are asking legislators to maintain what they say has been a successful partnership that allows Georgia to share updated voter rolls with 24 other states.
Big overhaul planned for Georgia elections: Bills aired in state Legislature’s waning days

 
Under HB 397, the Georgia elections board would evaluate the procedures and policies for withdrawing from ERIC. and provide recommendations to the legislative committees.
Fleming’s updated bill would delay the state’s transition from the multi-state voter database. It now proposes July 1, 2027 as the implementation date for Georgia to transition to another system. It allows for additional time to find a new way during legislative sessions in 2026 and 2027 and following next year’s general election, Fleming said.
“If there is a new secretary of state, it gives them time to work with this legislative body to implement what we have asked them to do,” Fleming said.
The revised bill still would still give the controversial State Election Board new rulemaking authority and independence, however it no longer would hand appeals to voter eligibility challenges to the board. The appeals are currently resolved in Superior Courts.
Sen. Derrick Mallow, a Savannah Democrat, questioned whether the election board could take over  election rulemaking powers that rightfully reside with the General Assembly.
Ethics Committee Chairman Sam Watson, a Moultrie Republican, credited Fleming and HB 397’s co-sponsor Rep, Victor Anderson for incorporating some key recommendations into the election bill.
“They listened to a lot of concerns that we heard last night for two hours and they took those concerns back and now they’ve got a good bill that I think we can move forward with,” Watson said.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)A controversial bill that would significantly roll back Kentucky’s ability to regulate water pollution will become law after the GOP-controlled legislature on Thursday overrode its veto by Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear. 
Senate Bill 89, sponsored by Sen. Scott Madon, R-Pineville, would considerably narrow the definition of state waters that are regulated by the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet. Madon, with the backing of the Kentucky Coal Association, has touted the bill as a move to relieve industries from housing construction to coal mining of bureaucratic barriers.
Environmental groups have lambasted the bill as potentially opening the state’s water resources to pollution, threatening the groundwater of hundreds of thousands of Kentuckians who rely on rural public water utilities and private wells. 
Rebecca Goodman, the secretary of the Energy and Environment Cabinet, had previously said she had “grave concerns” with the bill. Beshear in his veto message wrote SB 89 by “failing to protect all water sources” would result in “pollution, sickness and more dangerous flooding.” 
Sen. Stephen West, R-Paris, on the Senate floor said he believed changes to the bill made as it advanced through the legislature, after hearing concerns about groundwater pollution, helped improve the legislation. 
“We protected our (coal) operators from overreach of the agency, and after listening to constituents, after listening to comments on this floor, provisions to protect groundwater were put back in,” West said.
Environmental groups and the cabinet have said the changes made to SB 89 don’t go nearly far enough to protect groundwater resources across the state. Democrats opposing the bill referenced a letter from Goodman, the cabinet secretary, who wrote Kentucky would be the only state in the country to cede its authority to regulate water to the federal government. 
Sen. Robin Webb, D-Grayson, who voted against overriding the veto, said the “compromise” made to change the bill did not “go far enough.” 
“The origination of this measure arose from agency overreach, but the pendulum now has swung far to the other end,” said Sen. Robin Webb, D-Grayson, who voted. “I have utilities in my district that rely on groundwater sources. I represent sportsmen and women across this country in the state that have reached out.” 
Kentucky Waterways Alliance executive director Michael Washburn — in a statement also representing leaders from the Kentucky chapter of the Sierra Club, the Kentucky Resources Council and the Kentucky Conservation Committee — said the legislature sided “with polluters over Kentucky’s people and the industries that rely on clean, safe water.” 
“This decision gives coal companies greater freedom to pollute our headwater streams, at the expense of the tens of thousands of homes, farms and businesses that depend on groundwater from private wells in rural Kentucky,” Washburn said. “To the polluters who championed this bill: we are watching. We have built a resilient, determined coalition — and we are ready to act.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_0524-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-28 00:57:53.378965

A bill backed by Republican leadership in the state Senate could soon return the commission to all-white. (Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources photo)FRANKFORT — The president of the GOP-controlled Kentucky Senate says a political Facebook post justifies removing the Kentucky Fish and Wildlife Commission’s first Black member.
But Jerry Ferrell, who in 2021 became the first Black Kentuckian named to the board overseeing wildlife management, told the Lantern that his political views shared on social media should not disqualify him from continuing to represent hunters and anglers in his Central Kentucky district.
“My social media are just that: mine,” Ferrell said, suggesting Stivers was finding a reason not to reappoint him. “It’s none of his business.” 
Senate Bill 245, which became law on Thursday after GOP supermajorities overrode Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s veto, changes what happens when a Fish and Wildlife Commission member reappointed by the governor is not confirmed by the Senate. Ferrell is the only member the change in law could apply to this year. Under the new law, sponsored by Sen. Brandon Smith, R-Hazard, a member not confirmed for reappointment must leave the board when  the legislature adjourns Friday. In the past, members reappointed but not confirmed could serve until the end of the year.
  Sen. Reggie Thomas, D-Lexington (LRC Public Information)
As the Senate considered whether to override the veto Thursday, Sen. Reggie Thomas, D-Lexington, called the bill “pure politics at its best,” saying it targeted Ferrell because he made derogatory comments about President Donald Trump. 
“No board has been more politicized in this body than the Fish and Wildlife Commission,” Thomas said. “I think that’s wrong.” 
The Lantern  reported Wednesday that Ferrell believed SB 245 was intended to remove him because of social media posts he’s shared critical of Trump. 
Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester, however, said more than “a few derogatory statements” prompted the bill. Stivers on the Senate floor then described an image purportedly on Ferrell’s Facebook page “of the Supreme Court of the United States with the majority of them in KKK hoodies.” 
“If this individual were in this body or anywhere else, there would be a hue and cry for them to be impeached, removed or censured. I don’t think putting Supreme Court justices in KKK hoodies is appropriate for anybody who sits on a board or commission of this state,” Stivers said.

A spokesperson for Senate Republicans shared screenshots with the Lantern that appear to show Ferrell making two separate posts on his personal Facebook page visible only to his Facebook friends. One of the posts shared a profile picture from another Facebook account that featured conservative members of the U.S. Supreme Court in Ku Klux Klan hoods. Ferrell said he doesn’t remember sharing the post, which appears to have been shared in 2024 or earlier, but doesn’t disagree with the sentiment.
Ferrell, who described himself as an “anti-Trumper,” said he believed recent decisions by the country’s highest court — including a decision giving presidents criminal immunity from prosecution for some official acts — were “nuts.” 
How Ferrell could be removed from the Fish and Wildlife Commission 
The commission is made up of nine unpaid members who oversee the KDFWR’s budget consisting of tens of millions of dollars in hunting and fishing license fees, boat registration fees, and federal grants. State law directs the commission to keep a “watchful eye” over the department, and the commission controls the employment of the KDFWR’s head executive, Commissioner Rich Storm. 
First Black member suspects politics is booting him from KY Fish and Wildlife Commission

Each commission member represents a different geographic part of Kentucky. Fellow sportspeople vote for commission nominees in district meetings. A list of the top vote-getters is sent to the governor who selects someone from the list. The Senate then decides whether or not to confirm the governor’s appointments or reappointments. Commission members are allowed to serve two four-year terms. 
Ferrell was originally appointed by Beshear to the commission in 2021 and confirmed by the Senate in 2022. In January, Beshear reappointed Ferrell to a term ending in 2028. 
Stivers, when asked about Ferrell’s comments Thursday evening, said of the Facebook posts,  “you can’t be putting things like that in the public domain when you’re here to represent an entity or an agency of the commonwealth.” 
The confirmation process for  Fish and Wildlife Commission appointments by Democrat Beshear has been politically contentious before with the GOP-controlled Senate rejecting a number of them. Earlier nominees have been scrutinized for social media comments critical of the state’s fish and wildlife agency. One appointee was rejected by the Senate after being criticized because his wife was quoted saying complimentary things about Beshear in a Wall Street Journal article. 
Stivers said “we have found many occasions that people have posted things on Facebook.” He said talking about others in a “derogatory, demeaning and inappropriate way” is “a reflection of your person and your thoughts.” 
The commission, under state law, is designed as bipartisan in its makeup, and commission members aren’t identified by political party. Sportsmen have said the work of the commission is largely apolitical. 
Politics swirl around who will oversee Kentucky Fish and Wildlife

In another purported Facebook post by Ferrell that the Senate spokesperson showed the Lantern,  Ferrell shares a link to a TikTok. Above the link, Ferrell wrote he did not understand “how or why people vote against” their best interests in supporting Trump and that “every veteran that voted for him” needed to lose health care. 
Ferrell, a veteran, told the Lantern he deleted the post with the TikTok link after he received a call from someone advising him to “clean up his Facebook page.” 
“There’s rumors going around that I was a Trump hater on the Senate floor, so that was the reason for the deletion,’ Ferrell said. “I didn’t want to because how I feel is how I feel.” 
Ferrell had previously told the Lantern he was proud of his work serving on the commission and helping represent Black Kentuckians who hunt and fish and that he wanted to continue that work which he views separate from his personal politics. 
He also told the Lantern he was worried his potential removal is part of a larger “culture” against diversity, an assertion that Stivers dismissed. The board would have all white representation if Ferrell is removed. 
“I had no idea what his race was when this was brought to me,” Stivers said. “Now you can sit here and say, ‘Wait, I should get a pass because of that?’ No.”

The coronavirus pandemic, mainly, but also the chaos of last year’s election and the new administration of President Donald Trump.
So, when Kitchpanich heard about an impending volcanic eruption near her hometown of Anchorage — and the accompanying recommendations to equip herself with masks and air filters — it was time to vent. In a video she cut for her TikTok audience of 500,000, she had a stern message for Mt. Spurr, the 11,000-foot conical lava dome volcano that’s threatening severe disruption to life in urban Alaska.
“Mt. Spurr, read the f—king room. There is enough going on in Alaska, in the world,” said Kitchpanich, 30. “Take some antacids and put a cork in it, and come back in a decade. Come back in five years. Just not now, dude. Not now.”
Far more than most Americans, Alaskans contend with natural hazards as part of their daily lives.
Urban bear encounters don’t even make headlines. Avalanches and landslides close roads on the regular. Earthquakes? Anything less than a 6.0 on the Richter scale doesn’t rate.
Eruptions aren’t really exceptional, either: The Alaska Volcano Observatory lists 55 volcanoes that were “recently active.”
But many of those are in remote areas, like the Aleutian Islands and Katmai National Park and Preserve. Spurr, 78 miles from Anchorage, is unusual in its potential to foul air quality, disrupt jet service and otherwise snarl the lives of hundreds of thousands of Alaskans.
The volcano is far enough from Anchorage that destructive mudflows and avalanches pose no significant threat to people. The primary problem is ash, which can severely damage planes that fly through it and also poses risks to human health, pets and vehicles and other machinery — if winds carry it over Anchorage.

Scientists say an eruption looks increasingly likely, but on the vague timeline of “the next few weeks or months.” That uncertainty has provoked a wide range of emotions from the Alaskans living in Spurr’s shadow, who have turned to social media and therapists to help them get through it.
“It’s in the back of your mind all the time,” Kitchpanich said in an interview this week. “It’s going to be super annoying to me — but I think it also could be harmful for other people, as well.”
At the same time, Kitchpanich, like other Alaskans, acknowledged at least a twinge of curiosity about the potential for a once-in-a-generation event.
“This will be, like, our first volcano moment,” said Martin Phillips, another Anchorage resident. “I’m kind of excited. If I get the day off work, I’ll be a happy camper.”
An eruption from Spurr, Phillips conceded, would “cause a lot of trouble for folks.”
“But, personally, I think it’s going to be a really cool experience to live through,” Phillips added. “It’s not often that you can say, ‘Yeah, I was there when that volcano erupted and spat ash everywhere.’”
An eruption does not appear imminent, and may not happen at all.
The volcano observatory, earlier this month, detected “significantly elevated” gas emissions from Spurr, and it’s also seen other signs like higher earthquake activity.

Scientists say the most likely outcome is an “explosive eruption” that could last for a few hours and generate ash clouds, but they anticipate more intense warning signs before it happens. Just before Spurr’s explosive eruptions in 1992, a small lake at one of the volcano’s vents changed color and started to boil.
“We expect some other things to happen, and then we could revise our estimate to, maybe, a span of days. But right now we’re kind of waiting,” said David Fee, a scientist at the volcano observatory.
In the meantime, Alaskans are girding themselves for a major inconvenience.
An eruption from Spurr could deposit as much as one-fourth of an inch of ash on Anchorage and other Southcentral Alaska communities, the observatory says. It’s made of fragmented rock, minerals and volcanic glass — meaning that it’s highly corrosive and can cause respiratory problems, irritate eyes, infiltrate cars and trucks and clog their machinery.
In 1992, Spurr forced a 20-hour closure of Anchorage’s international airport, while the military ran out of hangar space and had to fly 28 planes to other locations, the Anchorage Daily News reported at the time. Ash drifted on the Seward Highway and caused “whiteout conditions” along the ocean southeast of town.
Hospitals reported no serious health problems, though one person interviewed by the newspaper complained that the ash “burns my throat.”
Like during the coronavirus pandemic, Anchorage residents have been stocking up on N95 masks, as well as extras like goggles and even pantyhose that can be used to filter ash from car engines.
One added complication is that, unlike the coronavirus, volcanic ash can affect pets, who experts say should be kept indoors during ashfall. Amazon and local stores have been doing brisk sales of PPPE — pet personal protective equipment — and Alaskans have found moments of levity as they’ve fitted their dogs with goggles, jackets, booties and even canine masks.
“They look ridiculous, because they’re slightly tinted. But the tinted were $11.99,” Anchorage resident Noah Star said of the goggles he bought for Morgan, his cattle dog-husky mix.

	Another option was a pricier pair of Rex Specs, which some dog owners buy for non-eruption-related outdoor activities. “But I just know my dog’s going to hate it, and I’m not going to put them on” under any other circumstances, Star added.
Other Alaskans have leveraged the Spurr uncertainty into entertainment. Multiple “Mt. Spurr Classics” have popped up in recent days — a volcanic twist on the popular Nenana Ice Classic, a century-old Alaska tradition in which people can bet on the date and time that winter ice breaks up on a river in the state’s Interior.
At a recent Anchorage house party, attendees were asked to submit their guesses of when ash would erupt from Spurr, down to the hour and minute.
Fee, the Alaska Volcano Observatory scientist, is also a professor at University of Alaska Fairbanks’ Geophysical Institute, and he said students have been making their own guesses.
The observatory also has internal polls where experts have predicted the likelihood and date of an eruption, Fee added. But he declined, apologetically, to reveal his own prognostication.

	“I guess I would stick with the party line,” he said, chuckling. “All signs still point to, likely, within weeks to months. Sorry.”
The guessing games and other forms of socializing aren’t just frivolous — they can be supports for Alaskans grappling with uncertainty and anxiety around a possible eruption, according to Dr. Anne Zink, a former chief medical officer for the state who helped lead residents through the coronavirus pandemic.
“Connection provides us great resiliency,” she said. “Prepare for the worst and hope for the best. But don’t overdo it in your preparedness and preparation, or doomscroll.”
Zink, like others, said she appreciates the “natural wonders” that come with living in the state. But she’s still not rooting for an eruption, she added, because she’s seen how natural disasters consistently have the harshest effects on society’s most vulnerable people.
“The people who will be most impacted by it will be those who have chronic lung conditions, or might be battling cancer, or don’t have access to transportation. And it will make already challenging aspects of their life that much harder,” she said. “So, for that reason, I’m very much hoping it doesn’t happen.”
Fee, the volcano scientist, also acknowledged Spurr’s disruptive potential, and he diplomatically declined to say whether he and his colleagues hope for an eruption. But he agreed that such an event would be “very scientifically interesting.”
“That’s why we do it, right? That’s why we study volcanoes — it’s exciting,” he said. “And hopefully we can help out.”

(Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Two tax bills will head to the Kansas governor’s desk after clearing the Senate Thursday, but Republicans and Democrats differed on whether the tax relief made good on their campaign promises to Kansans. 
Senate Democrats condemned the legislation in back-to-back debates as lawmakers worked into the night to finalize the remaining legislation of the 2025 regular session.
The Democrats spoke of broken promises as the chamber considered Senate Bill 35, which cuts state property taxes, and Senate Bill 269, which reduces income tax rates. 
The House advanced SB 35 bill Wednesday in a 96-26 vote. It passed the Senate unanimously, despite criticism from Democrats, in a 40-0 vote.
The bill eliminates the statewide levy of 1 mills for the state education building fund and the .5 mills levy for the state institution building fund. 
“Promises, promises, promises,” said Topeka Democrat Sen. Patrick Schmidt. “And this is what we’re going to get. One-and-a-half mills.”
“Kansans, you get scraps from this majority,” Schmidt added, referring to Republicans.
State General Fund dollars would replace the lost revenue from eliminated tax collections. In fiscal year 2027, which begins June 2026, the state education building fund would receive about $56 million and the institutional building fund would receive about $25 million from the State General Fund.
Sen. Caryn Tyson, a Parker Republican who presented the property tax relief bill, said she was proud of the work the Senate had done in attempting to limit taxable property values, among other tax break measures.
“We can go home and hold our heads high (knowing) that we worked for our constituents,” she said.
SB 269 is designed to reduce the individual and corporate income tax rates to 4% and bank rates could drop as low as 2.6%. However, the cuts are contingent on maintaining the state’s budget stabilization fund. 
House lawmakers advanced the bill Wednesday in an 84-38 vote after debate from only Democrats. The Senate approved it in a 30-10 vote, with Republican Sen. Rick Billinger of Goodland joining Democrats in opposition. 
Tyson characterized the bill as a way to combat “out-of-control” government spending, although she acknowledged that taxpayers won’t immediately see its impact.
“Instead of continuing to grow government and feed the beast, we’re going to reign that growth in by creating a step-down,” she said.
The changes would go into effect in 2025, and taxpayers could see effects if the State General Fund revenue exceeds the previous fiscal year’s revenue, adjusted for inflation. 
The budget director would make that determination by Aug. 15, and the secretary of revenue would calculate tax rate reductions starting with individual income taxes.
Once individual rates in both the lower and higher tax brackets reach 4%, rate reductions for corporations and financial institutions would be triggered. Reductions would continue until the combined rate for corporations reaches 4%, the combined rate for banks reaches 2.6% and the combined rate for other financial institutions reaches 2.62%.
Sen. Ethan Corson, a Fairway Democrat, pushed the point that taxpayers won’t see immediate relief.
In response, Tyson listed a number of income tax reductions, praising the Legislature’s work in recent years. She then turned to Democrats.
“You can’t stand in one breath and say it’s not tax cuts and then in the second breath say ‘Oh, we’re going to lose $260 million of school funding,’ ” Tyson said. “You can’t have it both ways, guys. It’s either tax cuts, or it’s not.”
Corson said that Kansans have been “crying out” for property tax relief. Last year, during the special session, lawmakers passed income tax relief, and then legislators underwent election season campaigning on delivering property tax relief this session, Corson said.
“Well, here we are … on day 74 of the legislative session, and the only property tax relief we delivered is a measly one-and-a-half mills,” he said. “I was frankly surprised, Mr. President, that the majority party was able to even put that bill on the floor with a straight face.”
Harking back to SB 35, he said under the proposal, owners of a $150,000 home would save $25.88, and owners of a $230,000 home would save $39.68.
“You know, as my grandpa used to say, ‘Don’t spend it all in one place,’ ” Corson said. 
He compared the Legislature to Charlie Brown’s Lucy with a football.
“We keep promising property tax relief for Kansans, and then we yank it away,” he said. 
Tyson pushed back. 
“Oh my gosh,” she said. “Turn down your W-I-F-M station: What’s In it For Me. This is for the taxpayers. This is for us stopping government growth. This is absolutely needed.”
The Senate adjourned around 9:40 p.m. and will not meet again until the veto session begins April 10.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Corson-Senate-3.26.25-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-03-27 23:58:21.464596

(Sophie Nieto-Munoz | New Jersey Monitor)ELIZABETH — The Union County Board of Commissioners took an initial step toward selling the county jail on Thursday, with critics who fear the facility will become a privately run migrant detention center chanting, “Shame, shame!” after the board’s vote.
The nine-member board approved by a 6-3 vote two resolutions — one that allows the county to subdivide public property that includes the jail and another that allows the county to consider proposals to sell the unused jail.
“I sit alongside our immigrant community, work alongside each one of you,” said Commissioner Sergio Granados. “With the possibility of a detention center being there, I must vote no on these two items.”
Commissioner Michèle Delisfort and Chairwoman Lourdes Leon also voted against the measures after immigrant activists and other members of the public spent nearly two hours urging the board to either oppose selling the jail or commit to not turning it into a migrant detention center.
Thursday’s vote comes as the Trump administration ramps up efforts to detain and deport undocumented immigrants.
Brian Lozano of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey told commissioners that soliciting bids for the jail without meaningful input from residents undermines “the fundamental principle that governments must answer to their constituents and operate transparently.”
“Institutions that detain and deport immigrants only serve to terrorize these communities, and ultimately under this administration, to hold their family members, everyday people, and increasingly political protestors in violation of the United States Constitution,” he said.
Elizabeth resident Giovanna Castaneda said she used to sit in school fearing that she’d come home to her mom being deported. Castaneda told commissioners to pay attention to other problems plaguing the city — homelessness, a lack of affordable housing, food scarcity — rather than adding another one.
“This could be one of the largest detention centers in the northeast, along with Delaney Hall in Newark, along with Elizabeth Detention Center, which is only two miles away from where we are right now. These sites are designed to deliver profit, not justice,” said Viri Martinez of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice. “It’s a system that has no regard for the lives it destroys.”
The meeting turned tense at several moments. The police approached people who went past their allotted speaking time, while audience members shouted from the crowd when the board cut the microphone. The room also quickly filled to capacity, leaving nearly 100 people — including Newark Mayor Ras Baraka — outside the county administration building.
“Our fight here is a fight for humanity, a fight for all people, a fight for dignity and respect, a fight for all human beings, whether you’re documented or not,” Baraka said.
The county did not commit to selling the jail to a private prison company, though immigrant advocates fear that is what will happen. Commissioner Rebecca Williams said she hopes the county will get bids from entities hoping to use the former jail for mental health facilities, workforce development, or college classes.
“As the very first stage to see what interest there is, I am in favor of that,” William said. “But again, as I said, everyone who knows me and who follows me knows exactly how I feel about what’s happening broadly in terms of people being disappeared, people being detained without due process.”

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)Air Force veteran David Kelsen stood on a stage and decried Trump administration plans to privatize health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
“The VA should never be about making a profit any more than the active military force is,” Kelsen said to applause. 
Kelsen was among a group of speakers who listed off complaints about the Trump administration – and occasionally the North Dakota Legislature – at a town hall meeting organized by the Democratic-NPL Party. 
Rep. Fedorchak vows to protect Social Security during virtual town hall

Over the course of an hour, speakers covered topics such as potential impacts to Medicaid, the possibility of family members being deported and cuts to Social Security staff. Moderators then gave people an opportunity to voice their concerns. 
Organizers left empty chairs for members of North Dakota’s congressional delegation – Sens. John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer and Rep. Julie Fedorchak – all Republican supporters of President Donald Trump. 
Speaker Kylie Oversen did give Fedorchak some credit for taking questions during a livestream town hall, but criticized the congresswoman for downplaying the concerns of constituents. 
Oversen is a former Democratic legislator and an attorney who deals with Social Security claims. 
She said the Trump administration’s goal is to make veterans benefits and Social Security “so unworkable and so inefficient that they have to find a way to privatize them.”

Several audience members addressed frustration with cuts to Social Security staff, long lines and long waits times when calling the Social Security Administration. 
Larry Schwartz of Fargo said he considers himself an independent but came to the event in part for a catharsis and to be with like-minded people.
“These are troubling times,” he said. “Some people are afraid. Some people are angry.” 
Paul Meyers, who spent 16 years on the Fargo School Board, said he was concerned about actions of the state Legislature on several issues, but especially education. 
“The whole business of giving public tax dollars to private schools is not what the constitution intended,” he said. 
The Legislature is considering bills that would establish Education Savings Accounts, which families could spend on private school tuition.
He also said the congressional delegation has not been listening to constituents. 
“We’d like to see someone stand up to Donald Trump. And so far, our congresspeople are kneeling down.” 
The event was held in conjunction with people’s town halls organized by Democrats being held across the country.
North Dakotans rally for town hall meetings with congressional delegation

The crowd exceeded the seating area in the Sanctuary Event Center in downtown Fargo. 
The crowd also exceeded the expectations of Cheryl Biller, executive director of the North Dakota Democratic-NPL. 
“Clearly people have a lot to say,” Biller said. “We have to keep the energy going to make a productive difference.” 
She said a similar event is planned for April 19 and a virtual town hall is in the works. Indivisible is another group that is protesting cuts in federal services. The group is planning a rally April 5 on the Veterans Memorial Bridge between Fargo and Moorhead, Minnesota. That event is part of a national day of action organized through Handsoff2025.com.

(Photo by Peter Dazeley/Getty Images)As of February 2025, about 10% of Utah’s population rely on Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program for health care services. The public health programs serve over 353,000 people in the state, according to a study by the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute. 
“Since Utah adopted Medicaid in 1966, changes in federal requirements and within the Utah Medicaid program have expanded coverage to new population groups, such as low-income adults, and additional services like behavioral health,” Maddy Oritt, senior public finance economist at the Gardner Institute, said in a news release. 
Those Utahns, who are usually eligible for the coverage because of their limited income and resources, may be especially vulnerable in case of cuts to federal programs under the Trump administration.
The most likely Medicaid cuts would hit rural areas the hardest

The U.S. House voted to approve a budget resolution that instructs the House Energy and Commerce Committee to reduce the nation’s deficit by at least $880 billion through 2034. While the proposal doesn’t specifically name Medicaid, it is expected that the program will inevitably face substantial cuts so that the committee can reach that goal, since it’s a significant part of the committee’s jurisdiction.
The cuts would also mean other economic losses for Utah. According to Axios Salt Lake City, the state would lose 7,500 jobs in 2026 alone, $727 million to its GDP, and about $51.3 million in lost state and local tax revenue.
During the 2024 fiscal year, funding for Medicaid was approximately $5.3 billion in Utah — 68% of it came from the federal government, with the remaining 32% from state funds and other revenue, according to the report. 
“​​When viewed as a share of each county’s total population, Medicaid enrollment is highest in San Juan County (30.0%), Carbon County (22.5%), and Duchesne County (20.9%),” Gardner Institute analysts wrote in the report.
After Utahns voted to expand Medicaid eligibility for adults with annual incomes of up to 138% the federal poverty level, individuals with wages below about $21,600 annually and families of four earning less than roughly $44,400 per year qualify for coverage. The programs are also available for low-income children, some caretakers, pregnant women and people with disabilities.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Legislature adopted a spending plan Thursday that fully funds public schools, provides pay raises for state employees, eliminates DEI initiatives, polices pronouns in emails, and puts the state on a course to blow through billions in reserves and face a budget shortfall within three years.
Senate Bill 125 finalizes $27.08 billion in spending for the current fiscal year, which ends June 30, and provides the blueprint for how the state will spend $25.6 billion next year. Those figures include $10.85 billion from the State General Fund in the current year and $10.64 billion next year, a $210 million decrease in spending of state revenues.
When coupled with the five-year, $2 billion slash to income taxes from last year’s special session, and assorted new legislation that would deliver tax cuts, the state would be an estimate $461 million in the red in fiscal year 2028. That would be a stark departure from the $3.2 billion surplus from a year ago, which is already projected to decline to $2.1 billion as expenses for the current fiscal year exceed revenues.
Rep. Henry Helgerson, an Eastborough Democrat, said the state was in “a financial mess.” He warned House members they were “going to come to loggerheads with a new governor” as a result of last year’s tax cuts and an appetite for spending created by federal COVID-19 aid.
“The chickens are coming home to roost, and we are in a hole,” Helgerson said.
Rep. Troy Waymaster, a Bunker Hill Republican who chairs the budget committee, acknowledged “a tough road ahead.”
“That’s the reason why we had the new legislative budget process,” Waymaster said, referencing the decision by lawmakers to ignore the governor’s budget proposal and make their own.
The House adopted the budget on an 89-36 vote, followed by the Senate’s approval on a 24-16 vote.
“There’s things that people will like, there’s a few things people do not like, and I can find that in any budget we’ve ever done,” said Sen. Rick Billinger, a Goodland Republican who chairs the Senate budget committee.
Senate Democrats expressed concerns in a caucus meeting about adopting a budget during an abbreviated legislative session. A revenue forecast in late April will show the full impact of last year’s income tax cuts, but lawmakers were set to adjourn late Thursday and wrap up business April 10-11.
“This is deliberate that we pass things without having knowledge,” said Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes.
Republicans who crafted the budget attached numerous policy strings to the money allocated to state agencies, universities, boards and other government entities. The provisos include directives to ban the use of gender-identifying pronouns in state employee email signatures and to stamp out any diversity, equity and inclusion positions, mandates, policies, programs, activities and training.
Rep. Susan Ruiz, a Shawnee Democrat, said it was “troubling” that the state would hold Department of Administration funding hostage until the agency showed it had implemented the directives.
“I don’t know what it’s satisfying or who it’s satisfying,” Ruiz said.
Other provisos will end continuous eligibility for Medicaid recipients, ban purchases of candy and soda with money for food assistance, allow the state treasurer to invest rainy day funds, authorize the Kansas Developmental Finance Authority to issue STAR bonds, and prohibit Larned State Hospital from using contract agency nursing staff in 2027.
Sen. Cindy Holscher, an Overland Park Democrat, took issue with the decision to raise the rent of journalists who work from the Statehouse, a move spearheaded by Sen. Virgil Peck, a Havana Republican who said it was unfair that the six news outlets that have a Statehouse office could pay just $100 per year in rent while writing “inaccurate” stories. He successfully inserted language that will charge the news outlets, which do not include Kansas Reflector, $1 per square foot per month — a combined annual cost of about $16,000.
When Holscher asked for an example of a factual error in a news story, Senate President Ty Masterson told her she was a “little far afield.” Billinger, who presented the budget to the Senate, said he “didn’t hear of any stories that were inaccurate or anything else.”
Holscher said the decision to raise the rent for news outlets “feels extremely punitive, kind of small of us.”
“Just because we don’t like something the press has published doesn’t mean we can seek to punish them,” Holscher said. “This is concerning to me, the action that’s been taken in this regard.”
Lawmakers got rid of a proposed mandate that all executive branch employees work from the office, opting instead for a requirement that state agencies report how many employees are working from home.
The budget would fully fund public schools but eliminate funding for training and other items not required under the school finance legal settlement. It also provides just $10 million in new funding for special education services, short of the $73 million commitment made a year ago.
Spending items include the allocation of $106.3 million for state employees, mostly for 2.5% wage increases, $5.8 million for a top-secret military weapons project in Wichita, $24.9 million for a new Kansas Highway Patrol dispatch center in Salina, $19.3 million to complete renovation of the Docking Building, $10 million for firearm detection software in public schools, $179 million for local bridge construction, $71.2 million for a Wichita Biomedical Campus, $41.3 million for an Ag Innovation Initiative at Kansas State University, and $30 million for a Health Science Education Center at Wichita State University.
Sen. Chase Blasi, a Wichita Republican, said he planned to go home this weekend and tell constituents he voted for a budget that fully funds public schools, adds funding for special education services, and rewards state employees “with a salary increase that they deserve.”
“We can sit here all day and point out a few things that are just not perfect, but we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good,” Blasi said.
The budget eliminates funding for the Blueprint for Literacy, an initiative the Legislature adopted last year to train teachers and improve reading levels. The program is a collaboration among the Kansas Board of Regents, Kansas State Board of Education, state universities and K-12 teachers.
Rep. Nikki McDonald, an Olathe Democrat who serves on the Blueprint for Literacy advisory committee, said she was “ashamed” the Legislature would defund the initiative.
“It’s insulting to the work that we’ve done in good faith, and the more I talk about it, the more mad I get,” McDonald said. “So I think I’m just going to leave by saying a budget is a reflection of our priorities, and I had hoped that we would prioritize our children more.”
The budget also calls for the state to take on $128 million in debt for a veterinary diagnostic laboratory in Manhattan and $80 million in debt for a new Kansas Bureau of Investigation headquarters in downtown Topeka.
Adam Proffitt, the state budget director, told Senate Democrats that Republicans had taken “an across-the-board shotgun approach” to trimming the budget that lacks strategic planning. And he said he was concerned about adding debt after spending the past few years trying to pay it down.
“Now we’re going in the wrong direction,” Proffitt said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P3111056-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-03-27 22:58:49.495490

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)FRANKFORT — With most of Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s vetoes overridden Republican lawmakers in the General Assembly have shown the power they wield over policy in Kentucky. 
Legislators returned to Frankfort Thursday, the second to last day of the 2025 legislative session. Within hours, both the House and Senate overrode nearly all of Beshear’s 20-some vetoes, save for a few line items.
In his weekly press conference, Beshear highlighted his futile vetoes, as well as some of the bills he signed or let become law without his signature.
Beshear also aired grievances shared by some of his fellow Democrats  in the General Assembly regarding what they see as a lack of transparency in the legislative process. He criticized Republicans for using “shell bills” or lengthy committee substitutes to quickly move legislation, particularly in the final days of the session. The governor said it is “designed to limit public review” of policy. 
“We know that ain’t right,” Beshear said. “We know that we are always better with the sunshine, with the transparency, and I hope that this practice will be reduced or eliminated in the future.” 
Last week, Republican leadership rebuked Democrats’ complaints about legislation being changed and moved with little notice, saying time is limited in a 30-day session. 
Before Thursday, Beshear issued more than 20 vetoes and five line item vetoes to legislation. To override the governor, lawmakers must give final passage to vetoed bills by the end of Friday. 
During floor debate on the veto override of House Bill 552, Republican Senate President Robert Stivers chided Beshear for not working with lawmakers on a trade commission between Kentucky and Ireland that was proposed in the bill. 
“By constitution, it is this body and the one down the hall who makes the laws,” Stivers said, referring to the House of Representatives. 
The Republican closed by pointing to the Republican supermajority in the legislature. The GOP has 31 of 38 Senate seats and 80 of the 100 House seats. 
“People who see us — if they want to change the policy in this state, then they will change the makeup of this body,” Stivers said. 
Here’s what is now Kentucky law
House Bill 2 allows Kentuckians to sue the governor over taxes paid on gold and silver bullion. In his veto message, Beshear decried the legislation as “unconstitutional” and said it was “out of touch with reality” for most Kentuckians who are feeling the strain of inflation at grocery stores and the gas pump. The Senate voted 31-6 to override the veto and allow the legislation to become law. 
House Bill 4 eliminates diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives at Kentucky’s public universities. Republicans have argued this session that such programs cause division on college campuses, while students and professors have testified DEI has made spaces for them in academia. Beshear signed his veto of the bill in front of advocates who opposed the bill and said it was “about hate.”
House Bill 6 limits state agencies in how they can issue administrative regulations and bolsters the authority of Kentucky’s legislative branch. Beshear argued in his veto message the bill “would likely stop and prevent the executive branch from implementing numerous bills passed by the General Assembly.” The House voted 80-20 to override the veto Wednesday afternoon. 
House Bill 90 adds language to the state’s near total abortion ban in an attempt to clarify that doctors can intervene in complex pregnancies without fear of criminal punishment for violating the ban. Doctors have said the language fell short of that goal and confused them more than current law. In vetoing it, Beshear said it “threatens the life of pregnant women in Kentucky.”

House Bill 136 requires the Department of Corrections to include more data about people released from prison or on parole, including information like gang affiliations, time served and education levels. Beshear said in his veto message the bill would breach a contract by requiring a new communications service for inmates. 
House Bill 216 allows some employees of the Department of Agriculture to apply for or receive funds or awards from the Kentucky Office of Agriculture Policy. No lawmakers voted against the bill in either the House and Senate. Beshear argued in his veto message the legislation would allow “conduct that has always been unethical and unlawful” under the executive branch’s ethics code. 
House Bill 240, which has had bipartisan support from lawmakers, requires Kentucky kindergarten and first-grade students to take a universal screener before advancing to the next grade. Beshear used his veto message to push an issue he’s long preferred for improving learning for young students — universal pre-K programs. “House Bill 240 is not the answer,” Beshear wrote. “We should prepare, not punish, our youngest learners.” 
House Bill 346 will prohibit the Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District or the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet from considering whether emergency stationary internal combustion engine emissions are subject to fees. Beshear in his veto message said it was “at least one entity’s attempt” to get a refund on emissions fees, fees that the bill would cause to fall on ratepayers. The House and Senate overrode his veto.
House Bill 398 will further limit state labor protections to a less-stringent federal standard, a move touted by Republican proponents as a business-friendly move but lambasted by labor unions as an “attack” on workers. Beshear in his veto message said HB 398 said On Thursday afternoon, the House voted 78-22 to overturn the veto. The Senate then voted 29-9 to overturn the veto, allowing it to become law. Two Republicans, Sen. Stephen West, R-Paris, and Sen. Michael Nemes, R-Sheperdsville, joined the minority of Democrats in voting against overriding the veto. 
House Bill 399 makes interrupting a legislative proceeding a crime in Kentucky. Beshear argued in his veto message that sufficient laws are already on the books to cover such conduct. 
House Bill 424 — Kentucky professors have warned this bill would erode academic tenure at the state’s public universities and colleges. The legislation would give universities and colleges the ability to remove faculty members and presidents for not meeting “performance and productivity requirements” set by the institutions’ boards. In his veto message Beshear said it “will limit Kentucky’s ability to hire the best people and threatens academic freedom.” 
House Bill 495 cancels the Beshear administration’s restrictions on conversion therapy and prohibits Medicaid from covering transgender-affirming medical care. In his veto message, Beshear called it an “unconstitutional infringement” that “promotes a dangerous and discriminatory practice that has led to the deaths of Kentucky children.” Conversion therapy is a discredited practice that attempts to alter gender expression and sexual attraction that diverges from heterosexual normativity “with the specific aim to promote heterosexuality as a preferable outcome,” according to the The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.” In 2024, Beshear signed an executive order aimed at ending the practice on Kentucky minors. 
House Bill 552 changes the makeup of local tourist and convention center commissions to allow a chief executive officer to appoint someone representing local businesses if no formal business association exists and creates the Kentucky-Ireland Trade Commission of the General Assembly. Beshear said in his veto message that the state Constitution gives the executive branch the authority to make such boards, but he would be willing to make a commission through an executive order. 
House Bill 684 is a lengthy election rules bill that received bipartisan support.. However, Beshear vetoed the bill and noted in his veto message the legislation reverses a 2020 rule to allow voters to present a debit or credit card as proof of identification at the polls. He drew ire from Republican Secretary of State Michael Adams, who said on X the governor “just murdered bipartisan election reform.” 
Public education advocates opposed House Bill 694, which made changes to the Kentucky Teachers’ Retirement System, saying it would undermine previous legislation. Beshear wrote in his veto message that he opposed the bill because it “breaks a promise made to teachers” without their input. 
House Bill 695 requires the General Assembly’s OK for administration changes to Medicaid, will require able bodied adults ages 18-60 without dependents to work in order to get Medicaid health benefits, reinstates 2020-era prior authorizations for behavioral health and more. Beshear, who has supported Medicaid benefit expansions, vetoed it because, he said, it would “put up barriers to and delay health care for Kentuckians.” 
Senate Bill 19 mandates a moment of silence at the beginning of school days and allows public schools to let students leave school for an hour a week for “moral instruction.” Beshear questioned how the bill could be enforced, as kindergarten students who do not stay silent could be violating the law. “At best, the bill will cause students to miss out on important instructional time,” Beshear wrote in his veto message. “At worst, it is subject to abuse and threatens the safety of Kentucky children.” 
Senate Bill 28 will create a new economic development program within the Kentucky Department of Agriculture to promote agribusiness or the development of alternative fuels. Beshear in his veto message said the bill could lead to the secretary of the Cabinet for Economic Development to disclose confidential information on projects, and it was unconstitutional because the governor did not have any appointments to the board overseeing the program. 
Senate Bill 65 will nullify two executive branch regulations involving Medicaid that were found deficient by a legislative committee last year. Beshear in his veto message called the bill an unconstitutional overreach by the legislature and said it was unnecessary because the regulations were already withdrawn.
Senate Bill 84 requires courts to interpret laws without deferring to a state agency’s interpretation of them and mirrors last year’s U.S. Supreme Court decision to strike down the precedent for the Chevron deference at the federal level. Beshear challenged the constitutionality of the bill, saying in his veto message it “violates the separation of powers” among Kentucky’s branches of government. 
Senate Bill 89 will significantly roll back the state’s ability to regulate water pollution in the state by narrowing the definition of state waters that officials oversee. Republican proponents backing the bill said it would relieve industries from housing construction to coal mining from permitting barriers erected by the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet.Environmental groups and Democrats lambasted the bill as opening up the state’s water resources to more pollution and potentially threatening Kentuckians’ drinking water. 
Senate Bill 183 requires a proxy adviser contracted by a state retirement plan to complete an economic analysis before voting on or recommending a vote on a shareholder-sponsored proposal that is different from a board of directors’ proposal. Beshear wrote in his veto message the legislation undermines the authority of the Kentucky Public Pensions Authority. 
Senate Bill 207, known as the School Innovation Act, allows public schools to seek exemptions from the Kentucky Board of Education from certain state laws or regulations. It also directs the board to consider if granting such waivers would hinder or improve “student academic achievement.” Beshear said the legislation would give the board “unfettered authority” to suspend Kentucky laws in his veto message. 
Senate Bill 245 will require that pending reappointments to the Kentucky Fish and Wildlife Commission that are not confirmed by the Senate during a legislative session would have to vacate their position on the commission when the legislature adjourns for the year. For this year , it would only impact 
Line item vetoes 
House Bill 546 sets terms to fund the Local Assistance Road Program. Beshear vetoed part of the bill that would establish tolls for a planned I-69 Ohio River Crossing bridge to Indiana. 
House Bill 566 makes additional changes to last year’s law creating the Kentucky Horse Racing and Gaming Corporation. Beshear had vetoed a few sections of the bill and said in his veto message he had concerns about a possible “significant conflict of interest” in how the corporation worked on the drafting of the bill. 
Senate Bill 25 began as a shell bill, but later became a bill with multiple pieces of legislation in it toward the end of session. While the General Assembly overrode most of Beshear’s line item vetoes, some were sustained. That included a provision about how lawmakers will deliver legislation to the governor while they convene in a temporary structure while the Capitol is renovated in future sessions. 
House Joint Resolution 30 would release funds for specific projects submitted by drinking water and wastewater utilities through a program created by the legislature and managed by the Kentucky Infrastructure Authority. Beshear vetoed parts of the bill to give two specific projects “flexibility” in being completed in more efficient ways proposed by the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet. 
House Joint Resolution 46 — This resolution sets up a list of priority projects for county roads. Beshear issued some line item vetoes to correct the names of some listed roads, but the House overrode the veto 80-20. Lawmakers created the resolution based on a list previously provided by the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet.

  Sen. Max Burns. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
House Bill 127 is the revival of Senate Bill 120, which did not pass the Senate by a key legislative deadline and would otherwise be dead for the year. The original bill by Dawsonville Republican Brent Cox expanded the number of sick days teachers could use to be absent for personal or professional reasons from three to five.
The version that passed the Senate Education and Youth Committee Thursday instead builds on language by Tyrone Republican Sen. Marty Harbin that bars schools and colleges from practices like promoting the different treatment of or provides benefits to people based on their race, color, sex, ethnicity, national origin, gender identity or sexual orientation.
Committee Chair Billy Hickman, a Statesboro Republican, read the names of about a dozen people who came to speak at the hearing but said they would not be heard because there was not enough time.
Under the bill, postsecondary institutions would also be barred from promoting ideas such as “unconscious or implicit bias, cultural appropriation, allyship, gender ideology or theory, microaggressions, group marginalization, antiracism, systemic oppression, social justice, intersectionality, neopronouns, heteronormativity, disparate impact, racial privilege, sexual privilege or any similar or related formulation of these concepts” as their official opinions.
The sponsor, Sylvania Republican Sen. Max Burns, compared the concept to college basketball.
“It’s March Madness, and we’re all watching the tournament,” he said. “I have 6’11” basketball players. I have 5’11” basketball players. They’re not all the same size, but they all compete on the same floor. Some would suggest that’s not equitable because they’re not all 5’11” or they’re not all 6’11”. At the end of the day, the equality issue is their ability to compete and achieve based upon their performance, so you can’t treat people differently or provide special benefits to them based upon their protected class.”
Democratic opposition
  Sen. Freddie Powell Sims debates Sen. Max Burns’ DEI bill. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Democrats including Dawson Sen. Freddie Powell Sims opposed the legislation.
“Very few Blacks embrace DEI,” said Sims, who is Black. “Let me tell you why. We never thought after civil rights bills were passed that we would have to acquiesce to that because we thought that there would be a fair, level playing field. The DEI is here for opportunities only. I don’t want to go to your country club. I don’t want to go to church with you. I don’t want to sit at your dining room table. I enjoy being with my Black girlfriends –”
“– I want you to know you’re welcome at my church,” Burns interrupted.
The two talked over each other.
“But I’m not done yet, no no no,” Sims said.
“Yeah, you are (welcome),” Burns interrupted again. “I have members of my church –”
“But we wanted opportunity,” Sims said. “And we wanted to be able to have those opportunities, especially in the workplace.”
Sims said instead of equality, Black people experienced other forms of discrimination like white flight and characterized DEI as a means of attaining economic opportunity.
“Again, Blacks don’t particularly care for DEI. We want to be considered as intelligent, as equals –”
“– as peers, as colleagues,” Burns interrupted.
“ –but we know that that’s as long as we live on this earth,” Sims continued. “It’s not going to be accepted. So having said that –”
“– I hope we both live long enough that that is not true,” Burns interrupted.
The University System of Georgia has not used race as an admissions factor since at least 2001, but Atlanta Democratic Sen. Elena Parent questioned whether the bill could ban affinity groups like the University of Georgia’s Black Law Students Association.
“The University of Georgia can have any association that is appropriate, that does not discriminate,” Burns said. “If that Black student law association is willing to accept individuals of any color, that’s not discriminatory.”
American history
Cumming Republican Sen. Greg Dolezal said the bill fits in with the values of the times. President Donald Trump signed an anti-DEI executive order in January, and major companies have announced they are scaling back or eliminating DEI initiatives.
“I think that part of the reason that we are seeing Fortune 500 companies abandon DEI policies in droves – in fact, the Fortune 500 companies that are keeping DEI policies in place are now the outlier – and I think the reason for that is the equity piece has really been co-opted by neo-Marxists who are focused on this concept of equal outcome,” Dolezal said.
  Sen. Ed Setzler discusses the 2025 DEI ban bill. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Acworth Republican Sen. Ed Setzler said the bill would ensure those who died in the struggle for civil rights did not die in vain.
“Before the victories of the Civil Rights Movement, isn’t it true, there were, in particular, there’s people of other backgrounds, but in particular, people of Black descent, African American descent, Blacks in our nation, who were more highly qualified to get to the University of Georgia, University of Alabama and other schools, who were denied access because of their skin color. Is that true? And the victory of the Civil Rights Movement was that people who were fully qualified were no longer denied access, but could get access like others, correct?”
Burns agreed.
“At the end of the day – and I was challenged to live through the Civil Rights Movement, and most of you haven’t had that challenge – I had friends who were one of the first African American students at the University of Georgia,” Burns said. “We worked together, we communicated closely, we had dinner together, we socialized together. They were no different, but they overcame the challenge of preparing themselves to have access to higher education. We want to provide that access, we want to provide the skills and materials to ensure that they have that opportunity. At the end of the day, equal protection is essential.”
Are you anti-racist or Anti-racist?
Atlanta Democratic Sen. RaShaun Kemp took umbrage at the inclusion of “anti-racism” in the long list of concepts that postsecondary institutions would not be able to promote as official opinions and asked to amend the bill to remove that word.
  Sen. RaShaun Kemp debates with Sen. Max Burns over Burns’ anti-DEI bill. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“I’m really concerned that the word antiracism is in there,” Kemp said. “Mr. Chairman, you spoke about wanting equality, and I’m curious to know why the word antiracism is included in this if you are saying that you oppose racism, and if you could give me the definition of anti-racism?”
“That’s a series of issues that would not be a part of a official position of a post-secondary institution,” Burns said. “Anti-racism would be something where individuals would be opposed to racism.”
“So why is that a bad thing, we should not promote that?” Kemp asked.
“Well, you should not promote the reverse,” Burns said. “Anti-racism, don’t promote racism. Is that not true?”
“Anti-racism is opposing racism and promoting equality,” Kemp said. “So why are we including anti-racism as something that we should not promote in the state of Georgia?”
“To not have a position on,” Burns said.
“So do you think we should have a position in support of racism?” Kemp asked.
“I believe we should ensure that everyone has equal opportunities,” Burns said.
Dolezal told the committee the term anti-racism has been co-opted by unsavory elements in society.
“These are ideologies rooted in neo-Marxism focused on centralizing the means of production, focusing on the outcomes and assuming that outcomes are tied to systemic racism,” Dolezal said. “They were a key factor that led to the riots in 2020, that led to billions of dollars of damage in this country. So anti-racism is a very specific thought, I should say ideology, currently in culture, and it is not some kind of nebulous idea. There are volumes of books written around the concept of anti-racism, and it is anti-capitalism and in many cases it is anti-American.”
Setzler proposed an alternate amendment to capitalize Anti-racism in the bill so as to distinguish the good anti-racism from the anti-American one, and Democrats agreed.
The session is set to end on Friday, April 4. If the DEI bill is to become law, it must pass both chambers and receive Gov. Brian Kemp’s signature.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)FRANKFORT — The Kentucky General Assembly has overturned Gov. Andy Beshear’s veto of a bill meant to clarify the state’s abortion ban, which some doctors said fell short of that goal. 
House Bill 90 will immediately add to Kentucky law an itemized list of  certain conditions under which doctors can legally end a pregnancy — including during hemorrhage, ectopic and molar pregnancies. It will also make it possible for Kentucky to have freestanding birth centers. 
Doctors previously told the Lantern that the bill doesn’t clarify the ban for them and causes more confusion about when they can legally perform an emergency abortion.
Lawmakers voted to overturn Beshear’s veto largely along party lines. The governor had said the bill “threatens the life of pregnant women in Kentucky.” 
Planned Parenthood called the legislature’s override of Beshear’s veto “unforgiveable.” Tamarra Wieder, Planned Parenthood’s Kentucky director, said it is a “a devastating blow to the health and dignity of Kentuckians.”
“Lawmakers had the opportunity to course-correct — to listen to doctors, to trust patients, and to put people above politics. Instead, they doubled down on cruelty and control,” Wieder said. “These power grabs do nothing to serve public health. They are a calculated attempt to cement government interference in the most personal, life-altering medical decisions — whether it’s denying care to someone facing a pregnancy crisis or medical care for trans Kentuckians.” 
Kentucky’s near-total ban on abortion has exceptions only to prevent death or the permanent impairment of a life-sustaining organ. Doctors charged with violating the ban could be charged with a felony punishable by prison.
Lawmakers’ debate
In the house, Rep. Lindsey Burke, D-Lexington, said she couldn’t support the bill because of the abortion language. Burke has tried unsuccessfully in recent years to reverse the state’s abortion ban. 
“We can’t gamble with another Kentucky mother,” said Burke, calling women’s lives “too sacred to blunder again like we did before.” 
“We’ve made an exhaustive list in a place where an exhaustive list is unhelpful and limiting,” she said. “There were so many missed opportunities, and it just does not sit well with me that we couldn’t do better for you, Kentucky moms, so I’m sorry.” 
Rep. Sarah Stalker, D-Louisville, called the new abortion language “a calculated attack on women’s health disguised as legislative clarity.” 
  Rep. Ashley Tackett Laferty of Martin was the only House Democrat voting to override Beshear’s veto of HB 90. (LRC Public Information)
Rep. Ashley Tackett Laferty, D-Martin, sided with Republicans in voting to override. 
“I strongly feel we should unequivocally be protecting the life of a mother in these situations,” she said. “While very legitimate concerns have been raised by both knowledgeable and compassionate people, I do genuinely feel that this legislation will save lives.” 
In the Senate, Sen. Karen Berg, D-Louisville, said the effort may have been “well intentioned,” but “you cannot clarify what people are allowed to do medically, if you only use totally nonmedical terms that mean nothing to the health care profession.”
Sen. Cassie Chambers Armstrong, D-Louisville, said she hopes the legislature works on improving the language in the future. 
“I’m glad to see that people want to make sure our laws aren’t causing pregnant women to die because we don’t allow doctors to effectively manage miscarriages,” she said. “I’m glad to see that this body has an appetite to address that serious life or death problem, and I hope that we can continue to work together to address that problem, to save pregnant women’s lives, but the way to do that is by making sure that we are including the medical community at the outset, so that we can make sure the language does what we’re seeking to accomplish.”  
Sen. Shelley Funke Frommeyer, R-Alexandria, called the bill “the beauty of life.” 
Funke Frommeyer has worked on freestanding birth center legislation since joining the General Assembly in 2024. 
In addition to ending a regulatory impediment to freestanding birth centers, “we were able to so clearly articulate some of the significant challenges that come along with pregnancy and natural abortions — abortions that you didn’t intentionally cause, these unintentional and dangerous situations,” she said. 
Sen. Lindsey Tichenor, R-Smithfield, called reproductive health an “oxymoron” when praising the bill. “We want to be a pro-life state,” she said. “And when we talk about reproductive health, that’s really just an oxymoron, because health is not ending a life, obviously, and if you’re not reproducing, then you’re ending that life. So it’s not reproductive when you talk about abortion rights.” 
Tichenor also said she’s had family members with “premature birth and ultimate ending of their child’s life” who were unsure how the abortion ban would affect them. 
“So this brings clarity for women to know that they are going to be protected if their health is at risk and if any of these instances come up and they need to just make the discussions about how they can protect their life,” she said. 
Stivers: ‘A political issue’ 
  Senate President Robert Stivers speaks with reporters over coffee, March 26, 2025. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)
Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester, said Wednesday during a conversation over coffee with several reporters that there had been a lot of “misinformation” around the abortion ban — and he blamed Beshear for contributing to it. Beshear took issue with the new language that he said could jeopardize in vitro fertilization, among other issues. 
“I think he’s trying to create a political issue,” Stivers said, saying he believes IVF to be protected in Kentucky. 
“People were saying, ‘oh, there’s no exceptions to abortion.’ Well, that’s not accurate. There has always been the life of the mother. And then people were trying to say, ‘Well, what does that mean? Clarify that, what is the life of the mother? Is that … physical life? Is it mental health?’ Those types of things,” Stivers said. 
He specifically wanted to clarify the issue of ectopic pregnancies, he said, since his family experienced that very issue in 2015, years before the United States Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion and Kentucky’s ban went into effect. 
“My daughter-in-law had one and had to be terminated, because, if not, she and the baby — well, the baby had no chance — but she would have been very at risk if they let that go through,” Stivers said. 
He also admitted “there always will be” bipartisan appetite in the legislature to add exceptions for rape and incest, and he understand the arguments in favor of them. 
Despite that, he said, “when there has been a heinous act with rape or incest, there is a being created … and that being had nothing to do with this, but that being gets punished by the loss of life.” 
Both Republicans and Democrats have tried to add rape and incest exceptions to the abortion ban, but all attempts have failed. 
Meanwhile, Wieder with Planned Parenthood said the legislature’s override “made it clear: political posturing matters more than preventing needless suffering, more than protecting medical providers, more than saving lives.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_9802-scaled-e1739484217138-2048x1310-1-1024x655.jpeg,,,2025-03-27 22:01:17.777992

(File photo) Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder Legislation passed by the Senate on Thursday would place the Georgia governor at the top of the list of high-paid governors in the nation and significantly increase the salaries of the attorney general, House and Senate leaders, and several other key officials.
The Senate voted 45-10 to approve a revised House Bill 86 that would increase the governor’s annual salary from $182,000 to $250,000 for next year. Several state court judges will receive higher salaries under the legislation, while the attorney general, state school superintendent, secretary of state, and agricultural, insurance, and labor commissioners will receive annual salaries of $200,000.
Now that the bill has been amended by the Senate, the changes must be adopted by the House before the session concludes on April 4.
According to data collected by the Council of State Governments on gubernatorial salaries for 2022, Republican Gov. Brian Kemp’s pay raise will move him from 10th highest earning to tied for first with Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York.
Sen. John Albers, a Roswell Republican, said the new salaries will provide uniformity among several executive officers while also addressing disparities, such as the governor earning less than the Atlanta mayor’s $236,000 salary. The bill would set the other salaries at $200,000, based on 80% of the governor’s salary.
“This simply sets the governor’s salary at $250,000 which I believe is appropriate, but then it falls in line with our constitutional officers and the speaker of the House,” Albers said.
“I think it actually will bring us up to where we need to be. If you look at constitutional officers like the speaker of the House, they sometimes make twice as much money as them,” Albers said.
According to the open.ga.gov database, the reported salaries in 2024 for six Georgia public officials who could get pay bumps through HB 86 were: Attorney General Chris Carr with $146,000; $131,000 for Insurance Commissioner John King and State School Superintendent Richard Woods; Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger made $125,637; $106,000 for House Speaker Jon Burns, and $98,000 for Lt. Gov. Burt Jones.
In comparison, the Council for State Governments reported that the average salary for secretary of states nationally was $121,628 in 2022, with Arizona paying the lowest salary at $70,000, while Tennessee had the highest at $222,252.
The report also says that the 2022 national average salaries for state attorneys general was $139,000. New York’s AG led the nation with $220,000 while Oregon’s $82,200 ranked last. Some lawmakers questioned the wisdom of giving such large raises to top Georgia executives at the same time.
Stone Mountain Democratic Sen. Kim Jackson said she supported the higher salaries but had reservations about the raises taking effect this summer instead of waiting until next year when Georgia’s next elections for state offices will be held.
“Isn’t it true that we typically do salary increases to be effective for the next election cycle, not during the time when people want to see it as a decision,” Jackson said.
Albers said he understands why government officials may hold off  from publicly requesting better pay in order to avoid being accused of supporting their own pay raises.
There is also an added layer of scrutiny about elected officials raising pay during an election year, Albers said.
“We can find a reason each and every year to not do this,” he said. “This is the right time, the right year to do this.”
Under the bill, the General Assembly would approve salaries for Supreme Court justices and judges for the Court of Appeals, state Business Court and Tax Court based on pay of judges for the United States District Court for Northern Georgia, who currently earn $247,400, according to U.S. Courts government website..
The justices could earn equal pay to the federal district court judges while the other state judges could earn 95-99% of the U.S. district court judges.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)It only stands to reason that a bunch of elected officials who are term-limited would believe that terms limits are good for everyone. That’s the case in the South Dakota Legislature, where both chambers endorsed House Joint Resolution 5002. It calls for a national constitutional convention to create an amendment that imposes term limits on members of the U.S. Congress.
HJR 5002 was approved by votes of 42-24 in the House and 25-10 in the Senate. Joint resolutions don’t require the signature of the governor. The Legislature’s action did earn praise from U.S. Term Limits, an organization pushing for a constitutional amendment determining how long members of Congress can serve.
It takes 34 states to call for a constitutional convention. Now South Dakota is one of 10 states that has endorsed USTL’s version of the amendment. Nineteen other states have endorsed congressional term limits, but their language has to be made to conform with USTL’s or the entire effort will just become a jobs program for lawyers.


Let us know what you think...


 

USTL would like to see members of the U.S. House limited to three two-year terms and members of the U.S. Senate limited to two six-year terms. That’s quite a change for an institution that has some members who make a career out of getting reelected.
“Term limits provide fresh faces with fresh ideas to elected office,” USTL says on its website. “They reduce lobbyist and special interest influence and make room in Congress for the citizen legislator.”
The citizen legislators in South Dakota’s Legislature are limited to four two-year terms in each house, though they are allowed to try to jump to the other chamber after eight years. Legislators here became subject to term limits with the passage of an initiated constitutional amendment in 1992. Many of the faces in both chambers have changed due to term limits. However, many of the same lobbyists are still hanging in there, ready to offer their brand of guidance, expertise and institutional memory to each group of newbie lawmakers.
Chances are that congressional term limits would make lobbyists more important rather than less powerful, as claimed by USTL. Term limits would also place more emphasis on the expertise of government bureaucrats. After all, co-President Musk and DOGE can’t fire them all.
The prospect of congressional term limits is worrisome for a small state like South Dakota. This is particularly true in the U.S. Senate, where longevity leads to power. If term limits were already the law of the land in Washington, D.C., there’s likely no way that Sen. John Thune would rise to be the Senate majority leader.

Granted, Thune’s tenure so far hasn’t exactly been a profile in courage as the Senate confirmed a group of Fox News has-beens and conspiracy theorists to serve in President Trump’s Cabinet. Still, it will be good to have someone from South Dakota in a position of authority to look out for the state’s interests when Congress tackles the next farm bill.
The battle cry for term limits is usually based on the power of incumbents and how tough it is to kick the bums out of office. Some of the same South Dakota legislators who embraced HJR 5002 proved last year that incumbency is not all that it’s cracked up to be.
The ditches of South Dakota roads are littered with Republican incumbents, tossed aside by voters in last year’s GOP primary. All the new faces in this year’s Legislature prove that, as they always have, voters hold the true key to term limits.
By design, amending the U.S. Constitution takes time. With just 10 states signed on for its version of the term limits amendments, USTL has a long way to go. For small states it may be best if USTL never reaches its goal. Through the years, South Dakota has enjoyed the Senate leadership of Tom Daschle and now John Thune. It’s hard to see how our small state could be in that position of power if the U.S. Capitol were to install a revolving door.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Thune-Rounds-Johnson-Dakotafest-cropped-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-03-27 22:01:17.777992

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen calls President Donald Trump’s sweeping executive order overhauling the administration of U.S. elections a “new and hopeful chapter.” 
Evnen said state election officials have long faced federal roadblocks to using “databases that could help confirm the citizenship status of those on the voter rolls.” He pointed to a joint letter from him and 19 other secretaries of state last month that requested more access to federal immigration data to help verify voter registrations. Evnen’s statement and recent actions echo national Republican framing that election experts warn could undermine trust in elections.

Fewer voters were turned away under the law than in other states with similar laws.
If the SAVE Act was signed into law, it would codify parts of the executive order. While Evnen said he welcomes the executive order, his office has defended Nebraska elections in the past.

Among their requests is the ability to search multiple voters at once, clearer guidance on how and when state election officials may use the database, and free use of the system. 
“This is not just a letter from certain states requesting a sort of seemingly bureaucratic access to a database,” Eliza Sweren-Becker, a voting watchdog, said of the joint letter. “This is a part of a broader effort to restrict voting access for all Americans.” 
She and other election watchdogs said the framing from Republicans is based on the “myth” of widespread non-citizen voters. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, analyzed election conduct from 2003 to 2023 and found only 29 instances of noncitizens voting.
“With this action, President Trump is moving the rocks out of the road so that states can access the data they need and should have,” Evnen said in a statement praising Trump’s executive order. 
When the Nebraska Examiner asked how many non-citizens have been removed from voter rolls or voted in past elections, a spokesperson for the secretary of state said earlier this month that the agency has not “removed anyone due to their status as a non-citizen, nor do we believe that there are many such people registered to vote.” Evnen told KETV earlier this month that the secretary of state would like to investigate whether 46 Nebraskans who have voted over the last several elections are U.S. citizens. The agency spokesperson told the Examiner it is developing a process with the Attorney General to request confirmation of citizenship status from a small number of registrants whose citizenship status is unclear.
According to Evnen’s office, 13,550 voters were removed from the voter rolls after the November 2024 election – they were removed due to death or relocation from the state. Such removals are routine and required by federal and state law.
State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue introduced a bill in the Nebraska statehouse to eliminate online voter registration, restrict absentee voting, provide more security for ballot boxes, and require hand-counting of election results, citing “election integrity concerns.” Evnen agrees with some provisions of Legislative Bill 541, such as tightening security around ballot boxes. But a spokesperson said he has practical concerns about hand counting and legal concerns about voter registration during its hearing.  
Trump’s Executive order will likely face legal challenges from voting rights groups and Democratic state attorneys general.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)FRANKFORT — With a veto-proof supermajority, Republican lawmakers overturned Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s vetoes on two notable higher education bills Thursday.
House Bill 4 eliminates diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives (DEI) at Kentucky’s public universities and was at the center of heated debates in the General Assembly this session.
Some Kentucky professors have warned that House Bill 424 erodes academic tenure at the state’s public universities and colleges, although its sponsor has said it is about employment contracts at universities.
The House and Senate quickly gave both final passage by largely party-line votes.
In his veto messages on the bills, Beshear argued they could both hinder higher education in Kentucky.
Some advocates agreed with him. Four people — college students Jillian Gabhart, Savannah Dowell and Alice Harkins and Eastern Kentucky University lecturer Carl Root — read eulogies for university education on the steps of the Capitol Thursday morning. Dressed in black, they held a funeral as lawmakers convened for business.

“We may have lost a battle here in Frankfort, and we should absolutely mourn what we’ve lost here today,” Root said. “But we must also organize, agitate, educate and fight back against those who would use all the power of government in attempts to force uniformity, inequity and exclusion on all our universities, classrooms and curriculum.”
Some House Democrats met with the funeral-goers outside.
When HB 424 was called to the floor, Rep. Adrielle Camuel, D-Lexington, said she feared passing the bill would upend recruiting faculty to the state’s public universities. She added that protecting tenure gives faculty “the ability to explore complex, and sometimes controversial topics.”
“Tenure protects the core mission of higher education,” she said. It is the fearless pursuit of knowledge and critical thinking.”
Democrats in the Senate raised similar concerns in their chamber. Sen. Cassie Chambers Armstrong, D-Louisville, and a law professor at the University of Louisville, said HB 424 has produced “confusion and fear” among facultyi. She said she was supportive of Beshear’s reasoning for the veto, adding that “these sorts of policies that take away faculty self-governance” and “put in place these programs with no guardrails” undermine the security tenure establishes.
Meanwhile, Republicans easily had the votes to enact their policies. Rep. Vanessa Grossl, R-Georgetown, said she supported the veto override of HB 4 because she believes “in equality” and “equal opportunity.”
“Our greatest divide as a commonwealth and as a nation is not based in race, but is rural and urban,” she said. “I’m voting no today because DEI on our college campuses is not helping poor kids in Kentucky who are seeking to further their educational goals, regardless of their immutable characteristics.”
In speaking in support of HBl 4, Sen. Donald Douglas, R-Nicholasville, looked back to the Civil Rights Movement and said activist Martin Luther King Jr. “gave us a great start and what happened?” Douglas then asked, “Should we continue to blame others and hold others accountable for our own personal decisions?”
“This legislation is only a message to those who are unwilling or unable to love others deep enough to allow them to seek their own way or their own level of success,” the senator said. “We have to love them.”
The Kentucky bills are reflective of actions Republicans have taken elsewhere to exert their influence over higher education. On the issue of tenure, Florida recently passed a law requiring post-tenure reviews of professors at public universities and termination should they fail them. This year, a Nebraska Republican lawmaker introduced a bill that would replace academic tenure with annual performance evaluations of faculty members.
Though an anti-DEI bill failed to pass in Kentucky last year, the passage of the current law comes as Republican President Donald Trump has made DEI a target of his administration. In addition to issuing an executive order aimed at curbing DEI in the private sector early on in his second term, Trump is facing a lawsuit from fired federal workers who were tasked with implementing DEI policies.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_3729-1024x781.jpg,,,2025-03-27 21:00:06.270306

Senate Majority Leader Sen. David Hogue, R-Minot, introduced amendments to House Bill 1176, a property tax proposal backed by Gov. Kelly Armstrong.
Hogue proposed lowering the primary residence credit from the $1,450 approved by the House to $1,250. He also proposed changes he called a “skin-in-the-game” amendment that would limit the credit to 75% of the property owner’s total tax liability. Homeowners would get a minimum tax credit of $500, the same level approved by lawmakers in 2023.

“If we adopt (House Bill) 1176 as is, you are virtually wiping out the tax liability of all the primary residence owners in those small communities,” Hogue said. “I don’t think that’s good policy.”
The committee adopted the amendment with a 12-4 vote.
Armstrong’s proposal, which was incorporated into the bill sponsored by Rep. Mike Nathe, R-Bismarck, called for a primary residence tax credit of up to $1,550. Though not included in the bill, Armstrong’s long-term vision is to eliminate property taxes for most homeowners within a decade, a proposal he highlighted during his first State of the State address.
“I don’t think what got put on in Appropriations today is nearly good enough for the North Dakota citizens,” Armstrong told the North Dakota Monitor after the hearing. 
Armstrong said he hopes senators defeat the amendments on the floor and pass the bill as originally intended.
Hogue said if property tax liability is eliminated for a large portion of homeowners, then they won’t have an economic stake in voting for future property tax increases or bonding proposals.

The committee also adopted an amendment from Hogue that adds language urging lawmakers in the 2027-29 session to consider property tax reductions for agriculture, commercial and centrally assessed properties. The language would not be binding.
The property tax credits would be paid for through earnings from the Legacy Fund, which was created by voters and is fueled with oil and gas revenue. Hogue expressed concerns about Legacy Fund earnings being used to only benefit homeowners.
“It should be broader based,” Hogue said.
Armstrong said he has concerns about using Legacy Fund earnings to benefit out-of-state interests that own farmland, businesses or other types of property.
“I don’t think giving out-of-state landowners a tax break helps anybody buy farmland cheaper and I don’t think it helps anybody rent land cheaper,” Armstrong said.
The committee rejected amendments related to the 3% property tax levy cap for local subdivisions. 
The bill will now head to the Senate floor for a vote of the whole chamber. If passed, it will need to be reconciled in a conference committee between the House and Senate.

Burnett (far left), Jim Murren (center), and former Gov. Brian Sandoval (far right) face Nevada Gaming Commission. (Photo: Dana Gentry/Nevada Current)The Nevada Gaming Commission on Thursday agreed to a stipulated agreement and $10.5 million fine against Resorts World Las Vegas, which faced multiple counts of failing to comply with anti-money laundering laws by allowing known illegal sports bookies to gamble on dozens of occasions.
“We’ve got a dream team of governance on the board here in front of us today. You’ve all had extensive Wikipedia pages,” Gaming Commissioner and former Lt. Gov. Brian Krolicki gushed of the newly-minted Resorts World board of directors seated in the front row – former Gov. Brian Sandoval (who Krolicki served under as Lt. Gov.), former Gaming Control Board chairman A.G. Burnett, and former MGM Resorts CEO Jim Murren, who also chairs the gaming commission of the United Arab Emirates. 
Resorts World attorney Erica Okerberg called the revamped leadership “Resorts World 2.0.” 
The new board is intended to right the $4.3 billion listing ship that opened on the Las Vegas Strip in 2021. 
The Current was first to report in 2023 that the Criminal Division of the Internal Revenue Service was investigating Resorts World and MGM Grand for alleged anti-money laundering violations. 
The IRS settled its case last year with MGM, which paid a $7.45 million fine. Former MGM Grand president Scott Sibella, who later became president of Resorts World, was fired by Resorts World weeks after the Current broke the news of the investigation. Sibella later pleaded guilty in federal court to one count of failing to file federal anti-money laundering reports. 
Nevada gaming regulators subsequently filed a complaint against Resorts World, and resolved a complaint against Sibella by revoking his gaming license for five years.  
The Nevada Gaming Control Board (GCB) “found that the violations alleged in its amended complaint are particularly egregious, warranting a substantial penalty and significant changes at Resorts World,” Darlene Caruso, who represents the commission on behalf of the Nevada Attorney General’s Office, told gaming commissioners.  
“It’s breathtaking,” Krolicki said of the GCB complaint against Resorts World. “The lack of control, the lack of reward of open culture,” that extended from the casino floor “to the C suites, and I’ll argue, even beyond Las Vegas, was truly extraordinary.” 
Resorts World Las Vegas is owned by Genting Assets, a Malaysian conglomerate. 
The stipulated agreement states Resorts World “believed it was operating within industry standards and norms” and does not accept responsibility for the alleged violations. 
“I’m surprised by that a little bit, just given the posture that it’s in,” Commissioner Rosa-Solis Rainey said. “They fell down on the job. I don’t think there can be any reasonable dispute about that from anybody. This is not a situation where information wasn’t available to them. It was there and leadership chose to ignore it.” 
“I don’t know who is denying liability and pays $10.5  million. It’s not a thing, usually,” observed Commission Chairperson Jennifer Togliatti. 
“Personally, I feel the fine is on the low side,” Solis-Rainey said, adding she’d vote in favor of the stipulation because of the “extensive efforts” the company has taken and “tremendous expenses” it has and will incur as it imposes corrective action. 
The GCB, in its settlement with Resorts World, reserves the right to take additional disciplinary action in the event the Department of Justice or Department of Treasury takes any criminal, civil, or administrative action against the casino.
During public comment, high-stakes professional gambler R.J. Cipriani told the commission that “harassment and intimidation” by Resorts World executives led to his “unwarranted arrest, multiple bogus felony charges and wrongful exclusion from the property.” 
Cipriani said he turned to the Criminal Division of the IRS and other federal authorities in California because he was ignored by Sibella, Genting chairman K.T. Lim, and then-Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo, who is now governor of Nevada.
Federal authorities have yet to file a complaint against Resorts World but are said to be negotiating a non-prosecution agreement and fine with the casino, according to sources close to the case. Murren and Burnett declined to comment following the commission meeting. 
“I believe this will be a wonderful fix and a new pivot for Resorts World,” Krolicki said, calling the agreement a “clarion call up and down the street that AML (anti-money laundering), compliance audits, all of these things we talk about all the time – we really mean it. Nevada is a best in class, you know, whatever we want to call it, regulatory environment.”
Although the fine, second in size only to the $20 million fine imposed against Wynn Las Vegas for its namesake’s sexual encounters with employees, was criticized by some as insufficient, “I don’t think it’s for us to tweak” the fine, Krolicki said. “I accept the hard work that was done with the GCB. I never wanna do this again.” 
Gaming Commissioner and former Nevada Supreme Court Justice Abbi Silver recused herself from the vote because of her “long-standing friendship” with Sibella, adding Sibella, while president, was a member of the casino’s anti-money laundering compliance committee. The personal relationship, she said, “would materially affect the independent judgment of a reasonable person in the situation.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/0B6E9273-02B1-46A2-9901-B3AC16C3428D-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-03-27 21:00:06.270306

Greg Gianforte signed two bills Thursday intended to “safeguard fairness, privacy and security for women and girls,” but that opponents say will limit the rights of transgender and intersex Montanans. 
House Bill 121, one of the first measures introduced during the session, would require public restrooms and changing areas exclusively for males or females, and require people use the one “designated for their sex” based on “external genitalia present at birth.” The bill — which landed in court the same day — would also require individuals be housed at a prison aligning with their designated sex at birth. 
The other bill, House Bill 300, restricts the ability of transgender women from participating in female sports. 
“Today, we’re maintaining equal opportunity for all Americans, while also protecting women and girls and their right to safe and separate facilities and activities,” Gianforte said in a statement. “Because we think it’s pretty simple. A man shouldn’t be in a women’s restroom. Shouldn’t be in a women’s shower room. And shouldn’t be housed in a women’s prison.”
  Rep. Kerri Seekins-Crowe speaks on the floor of the Montana House of Representatives in support of a ‘bathroom bill’ that would mandate public restroom usage based on the gender assigned at birth (Photo by Micah Drew of the Daily Montanan).
Both bills were sponsored by Rep. Kerri Seekins-Crowe, R-Billings. 
Speaker of the House Brandon Ler, R-Savage, in a statement called them “victories for common sense,” that show that “in Montana, we still believe in biological reality.”
The bills were unanimously opposed by Democrats in both chambers, and Thursday, House Minority Leader Katie Sullivan said Montanans have other priorities. She said she thought Gianforte did too — cleaning up the property tax crisis early in the session.
“The Republican Governor has failed to deliver on taxes, and by his own metric,” Sullivan said in a statement “Yet, he’s proud to enact new laws on toilets.
“Gianforte and Republicans in the legislature have their minds in the gutter. Democrats have our minds on lowering taxes, funding public schools, and fixing healthcare. Democrats know Montanans can go to the bathroom without the government getting involved.”
House Bill 300 is part of a nationwide trend to restrict transgender athletes in women’s sports. Montana is now one of 25 states with laws that ban transgender students from participating in sports consistent with their gender identity, according to the Movement Advancement Project.
Montana previously passed a similar ban on transgender athletes in sports in 2021 but a district court judge found it unconstitutional. 
The same day HB 300 cleared the House in Montana, President Donald Trump signed an order banning transgender student athletes from women’s sports.
Several national advocates for protecting women’s sports testified on the bill, including Riley Gaines, a former collegiate swimmer who tied for fifth place with a transgender swimmer in a collegiate championship race.

“The legislature’s passage of House Bill 121 and House Bill 300 sends a clear message that the legislature and the Gianforte administration stand with over half a million Montana women and girls,” Gaines said in a statement shared by Gianforte. “I was glad to support this bill through my testimony, and it is an even greater honor to see yet another state pass such critical legislation!”
House Bill 121 raised substantial opposition for its broad application to bathrooms and changing rooms in correctional centers, juvenile detention facilities, local domestic violence programs, public buildings, public schools, and other places.
Several Democrats noted that while a fiscal note said “immediate costs” are expected to be minimal, a similar failed bill from a previous session was pegged at costing nearly $1.8 billion. 
Sen. Laura Smith, D-Helena, said during floor debate that she’d spoken with domestic violence shelters and homeless shelters that were concerned they’d have to shut down immediately in order to be compliant with the law. 
A majority of legislation that has impacted transgender and nonbinary Montanans in recent years has been temporarily or permanently blocked by the court system, and on Thursday the ACLU of Montana announced it had already filed a legal challenge. 
Alex Rate, with the ACLU of Montana, said his organization filed a lawsuit against HB 121 along with an emergency request that the judge immediately pause the bill.
“House Bill 121, unlike House Bill 300, goes into effect immediately upon the governor’s signature,” Rate said. “It’s operational right now, and we need to get relief for our clients and for anybody who may be impacted by this terrible law.”
Rate said the ACLU’s clients are transgender and intersex individuals throughout the state of Montana.
In a video statement, Gianforte said the bill shows Montana is fighting the “far-left gender ideology” sweeping the nation.
“Here in Montana, we’ve stood up against this radical agenda and maintained equal opportunity for all Americans,” Gianforte said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bathroom-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-27 21:00:06.270306

(Photo by Becca Paschal/Arkansas Governor's Office)Meteorologists predicted the volatile weather that hit Arkansas on March 14 at least five days in advance by using sophisticated equipment and advanced forecasting techniques, surpassing their normal two-day warning of potential tornadic activity.
Those advancements may soon be throttled, however, as budget cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration could strip National Weather Service stations of needed meteorologists, cut funding for research and upgrades in equipment and eliminate educational outreach programs such as storm spotter training classes.
Under President Donald Trump’s administration, his Department of Government Efficiency has called for slashing NOAA’s $6.8 billion budget by up to 20 percent and either laying off employees or not filling positions vacated by transfers or retirement.
Already, 1,300 were laid off at the country’s 122 National Weather Service stations in February. Another 1,000 people may soon lose jobs in the near future.
Five stations in North Little Rock; Memphis; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Shreveport, Louisiana; and Vicksburg, Mississippi, monitor weather conditions in Arkansas.
“We consider ourselves a public safety institution,” said Dennis Cavanaugh, the warning coordinator for the National Weather Service’s North Little Rock station. “We provide a place for the public to go for information about the weather. “

Cavanaugh wouldn’t comment much further, saying his office doesn’t get into politics.
“I can say if we have more cuts, it will make it tougher to cover events like the [March 14] one,” he said.
Just recently, stations in Omaha, and Rapid City, South Dakota, suspended the launching of weather balloons because of cost, according to The Associated Press. Stations in Albany, New York, and Gray, Maine, recently quit sending their balloons skyward also. Weather Service balloons, which contain GPS tracking and a radio for transmitting data, cost about $350 each.
Weather balloons launched by the North Little Rock station are what alerted meteorologists to increase the March 14 warnings in Arkansas.
The Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, a division of NOAA, predicted on March 9 that meteorological elements would combine — cold air from the north, desert winds from the west and humid Gulf moisture — to create the potential for storms.
Normally, the center issues its daily convective outlook report and indicates anything more than two days in advance is difficult to forecast.
This time, though, the outlook gave a week’s warning, placing northeast Arkansas in the “moderate” level. The center rates potential storm chances on a five-level scale. The first, the least dangerous, is “marginal.” The highest ranking is “high.”
The pre-March 14 ranking of “moderate” was the fourth highest level for storm potential.
For most of the week, Jonesboro and Memphis were in the area’s ‘bull’s-eye’ for the worst possibility for storms. Early on March 14, though, the area was moved slightly northeast into eastern Missouri and west central Illinois.
“It was a really big storm system that we had been tracking by satellite all week,” Cavanaugh said. “Most of the models showed it was packing incredibly strong winds.
“We knew this one had extreme wind energy,” he said.

Meteorologists continued monitoring the system as it trekked through Nebraska and dipped down into Oklahoma and then Arkansas that afternoon.
Cavanaugh said his station’s meteorologists launched several weather balloons that day to record air temperatures aloft. He wanted to determine if the “cap was breaking,” referring to an upper level of warm air that forms and saps energy from any potential storms. If the cap breaks, cold air rushes in and creates the turbulent supercells that could spawn tornadoes.
At 1:30 p.m. on March 14, Cavanaugh saw the cap had broken over Arkansas. He immediately issued a tornado watch for much of the state.
“When I saw what was happening, I told our meteorologist on duty that night that this had the potential to be a career-defining night,” he said.
In Jonesboro, county officials prepared to open its safe room in the recently finished new courthouse annex in downtown. The building, which houses additional courtrooms and a quorum court chambers, officially opened earlier in the month.
The safe room — the only one in the state maintained by a county government — can withstand winds of up to 250 miles per hour and can hold nearly 600 people.
Craighead County administrator Brandon Shrader said the county opened the safe room at 7:30 p.m. well before storms began rolling in.
“About 75 came in,” he said. “Then when storms began hitting around, we started seeing more.”
By the time an EF-4 tornado hit Diaz, a Jackson County town about 5 miles southwest of Jonesboro, there were 207 inside the Craighead County safe room.
The people crowded in and waited for the storms, watching storm coverage on KAIT, the local ABC-television affiliate, on three large screens mounted on the room’s walls.
The more violent storms hit Jonesboro at about 11:30 p.m. There were no tornadoes, though the weather service did report there were at least four twisters within about 20 miles of the city that night. Torrential rains, 60 mph winds and hail peppered the area for a while. Radar did indicate rotation, indicative of the formation of a tornado, over the NEA Baptist Hospital and near Brookland to the northeast of Jonesboro.
“We knew it was coming,” said Craighead County Office of Emergency Management director Anthony Coy. “We had a four-hour advance warning, but we didn’t expect that many people to come to the safe room though.”

Shrader said people called his office the following week to thank the county for providing the shelter. He said one person suffering from “storm anxiety” after riding out a devastating tornado in Jonesboro in 1968 was appreciative of the shelter.
Coy added that a March 2020 tornado that hit Jonesboro also created a higher level of awareness among residents.
“We know what to do,” Coy said. “Our safe room will provide more safety than what we had before.”
He also credited the advance warning meteorologists gave. Three people did die in a tornado in Cushman just north of Batesville, but he thought more people were aware of the impending storms than had been in previous storms.
The National Weather Service was even able to rate the tornado that hit Cave City as an EF-3 twister with winds of up to 165 miles per hour before survey teams inspected damage.
Cavanaugh said advances in radar — mainly in the dual-polarization Doppler radar — were able to determine how high debris was lifted into the air in the tornado’s path and how large the debris was to get an idea of the twister’s wind speeds.
Storm survey teams still went out in the week after March 14 and determined 15 tornadoes hit the state that evening.
Four days after a twister hit The Enclave, a high-end subdivision in southwestern Paragould, a man pushed a baby stroller along South 30th Street. He didn’t give his name, but said he knew a tornado was headed toward his neighborhood.
“We had plenty of time to get ready,” he said. “We knew bad weather was coming and we watched the coverage on [KAIT] as it came in.”
His family hunkered down in their storm shelter and waited. The winds spared their home, but scores of others just west of his were damaged. He said he was thankful for the advance warning.
The potential for cuts has weather officials worried those warnings may not be as advanced in the future.
Coy, who still second-guesses decisions he made in the wake of the sudden March 2020 tornado that hit Jonesboro, said he was anticipating even earlier storm detection methods in the future.
Advances in artificial intelligence could help forecasters, he said.
“They are incorporating AI in storm models now,” he said. “It can learn from data fed into it and could eventually provide even more lead time.
“But the National Weather Service was a strapped agency to begin with,” Coy added. “I don’t think the cuts will totally impact safety, but it could cut SkyWarn classes to teach spotters how to detect possible tornadoes, and it will cut the public services they produce.”
Under the Trump administration’s plans, the National Weather Service would function more as a “data-gathering” agency while private companies such as AccuWeather would issue public notices such as storm warnings.
During his previous administration, Trump nominated Barry Myers, the former CEO of AccuWeather, to lead NOAA. After two years of failed confirmation hearings, Myers withdrew from consideration in 2019.
Meteorologists also remember in 2019 the “Sharpiegate,” episode when Trump ignored Weather Service warnings for a hurricane headed for the Gulf coast. Trump used a Sharpie pen to draw on a map of the country an area for potential damage from Hurricane Dorian and included Alabama. Weather service meteorologists said that was not true and issued a public statement refuting Trump’s predictions after receiving scores of calls.
“You can’t totally replace the National Weather Service,” Coy said. “But these cuts will hurt the things that you don’t see. It will impact infrastructural upgrades that could even better improve radar and give us even more warnings.”

(Capital-Star photo by Peter Hall)The Shapiro administration is reviewing President Donald Trump’s sweeping executive order that overhauls U.S. elections. Secretary of the Commonwealth Al Schmidt said Thursday Gov. Josh Shapiro will do everything in his power to protect voting rights.
“There’s a lot there for us to assess, whether it’s from providing in person, documentation of citizenship when registering to voting, to what voting systems can be certified,” Schmidt said in a press briefing on Trump administration cuts to a federal agency that monitors and warns states of threats to election security.
While an executive order could not overrule federal and state election law, staff at the Pennsylvania Department of State and Gov. Josh Shapiro’s Office of General Council are working to identify possible consequences and what issues could be litigated, Schmidt said.
Trump signed the order Tuesday requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote. It’s aligned with the president’s  campaign trail rhetoric about non citizens voting in federal elections and his strongarm tactics on immigration.
U.S.House Republicans have prioritized passing the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, or SAVE Act, which would codify parts of the order. Trump’s order uses the threat of losing federal funding to compel states to comply. It directs the Election Assistance Commission, which distributes federal grants, to require people registering to vote to provide proof of citizenship such as a passport or state-issued ID. 
Last week, Schmidt warned U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem that cuts to the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency program that helps monitor and prepare for election threats will “make elections less secure.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Thursday, Schmidt said the resources CISA provides aren’t available anywhere else and withdrawing them will affect the state and counties’ capabilities.
“They participated in our election threat task force that Governor Shapiro set up in advance of the 2024 election, so that federal, state and local partners were in regular communication with one another,” Schmidt said.
“We saw the value of that … when we did have some threats targeting our county election operations on Election Day,” he said.
Several county election offices received bomb threats around the time polls closed on Nov. 5. In the week before the election, a fake video showing mail-in ballots cast for Trump and Sen. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) being destroyed and thrown away was linked to a Russian disinformation campaign.
“CISA was able to quickly identify not only that it was fraudulent, but also the source of it, so that we could share with our counties and we could share with the public so confidence in the election wasn’t undermined,” Schmidt said.
Suzanne Spaulding was under secretary for cybersecurity and infrastructure at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security during the Obama administration. CISA is responsible for protecting assets, systems and networks “necessary for our ways of life,” Spaulding said in the press briefing.
“It’s clear that election infrastructure meets that definition, and it was officially designated as critical infrastructure in 2017,” she said, noting that Trump’s latest order maintains that definition.

The election security mission took on heightened importance in 2016 when the presidential election brought a marked uptick in cyber espionage, Spaulding said. Primarily from Russia, it targeted election infrastructure ranging from voter registration processes and databases, ballot preparation, tabulation, reporting results and news wire services that informed the public.
Initial efforts to help state and local governments safeguard their systems were met with skepticism from officials who were wary of a federal takeover of elections, Spaulding said.Over the following eight years, CISA worked to build trust by providing nonpartisan assistance over a range of election-related cyber, physical and informational realms.
“Sadly, the election security work related work at CISA seems to have stopped. The men and women who are doing this vital work at CISA have been placed on administrative leave. The funding has been eliminated,” Spaulding said.
Deborah McCarthy, former U.S. ambassador to Lithuania, lead a team at the United Nations negotiating an international treaty to allow American law enforcement to pursue cyber criminals around the world. Russia remains a serious threat to cyber security, she said, but Iran and China have also shown clear intent to influence elections through fake social media posts and phony news reports and by building relationships with state and local officials. 
China has also engaged in cyber attacks on U.S. communications infrastructure.
“Now they’ve penetrated our U.S. telecoms companies and internet providers, accessing messages, text messages, IP addresses and, in some cases, audio recordings. It’s unclear what they’re going to do with this information, but they hold a lot and they’re still present,” McCarthy said.
Asked why the Trump administration implemented cuts to the election security program, Schmidt said they are aligned with the false perception that election administrators are adversaries.
“I can’t really speak to their motives,” Schmidt said. “I can’t really speak to their thought process. But clearly, the fact is that election administration has been perceived as being partisan, political and seeking to influence the outcome of elections, which is not the case in Pennsylvania.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_5321-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-03-27 20:01:50.875663

Henry Helgerson, seen during a March 11, 2025, session of the House, warned the state is in ""a financial mess."" (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The House adopted a spending plan Thursday that puts the state on a course to blow through billions in reserves and face a budget shortfall within three years.
Senate Bill 125 finalizes $27.08 billion in spending plans for the current fiscal year, which ends June 30, and provides the blueprint for how the state will spent $25.6 billion next year. Those figures include $10.85 billion from the State General Fund in the current year and $10.64 billion next year.
When coupled with the five-year, $2 billion slash to income taxes from last year’s special session, and assorted new legislation that would deliver tax cuts, the state would be an estimate $461 million in the red in fiscal year 2028. That would be a stark departure from the $3.2 billion surplus from a year ago, which is already projected to decline to $2.1 billion as expenses for the current fiscal year exceed revenues.
Rep. Henry Helgerson, an Eastborough Democrat, said the state was in “a financial mess.” He warned House members they were “going to come to loggerheads with a new governor” as a result of last year’s tax cuts and an appetite for spending that was created by federal COVID-19 aid.
“The chickens are coming home to roost, and we are in a hole,” Helgerson said.
Rep. Troy Waymaster, a Bunker Hill Republican who chairs the budget committee, acknowledged “a tough road ahead.”
“That’s the reason why we had the new legislative budget process,” Waymaster said, referencing the decision by lawmakers to ignore the governor’s budget proposal and make their own.
The House adopted the budget on an 89-36 vote. The Senate planned to take action Thursday night.
Senate Democrats expressed concerns in a caucus meeting Thursday about the abbreviated schedule for the legislative session. A revenue forecast in late April will show the full impact of income tax cuts passed during a special session last year, but lawmakers are set to wrap up business April 11.
“This is deliberate that we pass things without having knowledge,” said Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes.
Republicans pressed forward with their budget, which attaches numerous policy strings to the money allocated to state agencies, universities, boards and other government entities. The provisos include directives to ban the use of gender-identifying pronouns in state employee email signatures and to stamp out any diversity, equity and inclusion positions, mandates, policies, programs, activities and training.
Rep. Susan Ruiz, a Shawnee Democrat, said it was “troubling” that the state would hold Department of Administration funding hostage until the agency showed it had implemented the directives.
“I don’t know what it’s satisfying or who it’s satisfying,” Ruiz said.
Other provisos will end continuous eligibility for Medicaid recipients, ban purchases of candy and soda with money for food assistance, raise the rent of journalists who work from the Statehouse, allow the state treasurer to invest rainy day funds, authorize the Kansas Developmental Finance Authority to issue STAR bonds, and prohibit Larned State Hospital from using contract agency nursing staff in 2027.
Lawmakers got rid of a proposed mandate that all executive branch employees work from the office, opting instead for a requirement that state agencies report how many employees are working from home.
The budget would fully fund public schools but eliminates funding for training and other items not required under the school finance legal settlement. It also provides just $10 million in new funding for special education services, short of the $73 million commitment made a year ago.
Spending items include the allocation of $106.3 million for state employees, mostly for 2.5% wage increases, $5.8 million for a top-secret military weapons project in Wichita, $24.9 million for a new Kansas Highway Patrol dispatch center in Salina, $19.3 million to complete renovation of the Docking Building, $10 million for firearm detection software in public schools, $179 million for local bridge construction, $71.2 million for a Wichita Biomedical Campus, $41.3 million for an Ag Innovation Initiative at Kansas State University, and $30 million for a Health Science Education Center at Wichita State University.
The budget eliminates funding for the Blueprint for Literacy, an initiative the Legislature adopted last year to train teachers and improve reading levels. The program is a collaboration among the Kansas Board of Regents, Kansas State Board of Education, state universities and K-12 teachers.
Rep. Nikki McDonald, an Olathe Democrat who serves on the Blueprint for Literacy advisory committee, said she was “ashamed” the Legislature would defund the initiative.
“It’s insulting to the work that we’ve done in good faith, and the more I talk about it, the more mad I get,” McDonald said. “So I think I’m just going to leave by saying a budget is a reflection of our priorities, and I had hoped that we would prioritize our children more.”
The budget also calls for the state to take on $128 million in debt for a veterinary diagnostic laboratory in Manhattan and $80 million in debt for a new Kansas Bureau of Investigation headquarters in downtown Topeka.
Adam Proffitt, the state budget director, told Senate Democrats that Republicans had taken “an across-the-board shotgun approach” to trimming the budget that lacks strategic planning. And he said he was concerned about adding debt after spending the past few years trying to pay it down.
“Now we’re going in the wrong direction,” Proffitt said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P3111056-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-03-27 20:01:50.875663

(Getty Images)A bill that would strengthen state regulators’ ability to deny and revoke wastewater permits for those who have a demonstrated history of noncompliance with environmental regulations was filed in the Arkansas Senate last week.
Senate Bill 557, sponsored by Sen. Mark Johnson, would also broaden public notice requirements for new permits or major modifications to existing ones by requiring the state to provide a written notice to residents and property owners within the same Zip Code as the proposed or existing facility. 
Currently, for wastewater permits, the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment’s Division of Environmental Quality is only required to place a notice within a “newspaper of general circulation” in the county where the facility will be or is located.
The proposed legislation says DEQ “may deny a permit relating to wastewater if the applicant has a history of noncompliance with environmental regulations, whether at the applicant’s site or at any other permitted or unpermitted facility in this state.”
It goes on to list specific examples of what such noncompliance could look like, such as, “noncompliance that is recorded on inspections or other compliance activities performed by the division,” or “a demonstrated history by the applicant of submitting incomplete or deficient permit application information.” 
It also lists consent administrative orders (CAOs) as examples of noncompliance and would apply to companies or entities “whose ownership includes individuals who own at least five percent (5%) of the applicant and who own or have owned at least five percent (5%) of any other entity that has a history of noncompliance with environmental regulations.”
The bill would also add a requirement that DEQ deny permits to applicants with a history of noncompliance if the applicant has had five or more “events of noncompliance with environmental regulations” within the previous five years.
Johnson called the proposal his “bad actor bill,” and said it is specifically targeted toward land developers who install what he described as low-quality sewage treatment equipment called package wastewater treatment systems that would discharge insufficiently treated wastewater into ephemeral streams or across people’s yards.
He compared what his bill would do to what states already do with driver’s licenses.
“You get, you know, 23 speeding tickets, and they take it away from you,” Johnson said. “I don’t think people ought to be able to just thumb their nose at the law and the regulations.”
If enacted as written, the bill also could have ramifications for large industrial dischargers down to small municipal wastewater treatment plants.
For example, the Lanxess Corporation, which operates three facilities for bromine extraction in South Arkansas and has active wastewater permits, has entered into 11 separate CAOs with DEQ over the last five years, with CAOs applying to multiple Lanxess facilities counting as one. 
Those CAOs also include air permit violations, and the bill filed by Johnson isn’t clear on whether violations of air or land disposal permits would count toward a history of noncompliance where wastewater permits are concerned. 


Let us know what you think...


 

Johnson didn’t rule out amending the bill if other industries had concerns, saying that he had tried to tailor it to wastewater issues caused by property development in rural areas. He said such concerns are why bills can be amended after they are introduced, that if it wasn’t for the “law of unintended consequences,” the legislative session would not be as long as it is.
“Clean water is probably the most important thing that we can deal with,” Johnson said.
Al Drinkwater, a retired environmental consultant and former employee of the Arkansas Department of Pollution Control and Ecology, one of DEQ’s predecessor agencies, is involved with the Pinnacle Mountain Community Coalition, which has rallied against developments in rural Pulaski County, frequently citing water pollution concerns. One of the developers in the area, he said, has had multiple noncompliance issues with environmental regulators.
“In the process of getting to this point, we’ve had a number of conversations with other involved people, some of the people at the Arkansas Division of Environmental Quality and others, about the problem that we have with people that go out and have violation after violation after violation,” Drinkwater said. “And there’s no rule that the department has to say, ‘Look, you’re a bad actor, we’re not going to continue to play with you.’”
Drinkwater said the bill would make sure DEQ considers the “history” of a permit applicant when making permit issuance or reissuance decisions.
Arkansas leaders approve multimillion-dollar water projects, note progress despite high costs

Last year, DEQ saw a significant increase in consent administrative orders —  a kind of voluntary enforcement settlement —  issued by the Office of Water Quality. The increase was driven by noncompliance with wastewater permits, a DEQ spokesperson said in January. 
Many of those CAOs were between DEQ and municipal wastewater systems that consistently were not meeting the discharge quality requirements specified in their permits.
This is the second bill filed in the last month with language that could force an environmental permit revocation. Rep. Brad Hall, R-Alma, filed a bill two weeks ago that would automatically revoke the permits of an entity permitted to land-apply industrial poultry waste as fertilizer, if that facility violated its permits three or more times within a 45 day period.
Hall said in an interview with the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette last month that his bill was specifically targeted at Denali Water Solutions. Denali has been out of compliance with its permits multiple times over the last year due to its land-applying of industrial waste from poultry processors and similar facilities onto fields when the chance of rain is greater than 50%, which is prohibited under state no-discharge permits.
A Denali spokesperson said they were aware of the bill and had no comment other than to say that “we are working with legislators, agency officials and industry partners to satisfy all concerns.”
SB 557 would also require DEQ to create a way that local officials “responding to a sewage or storm water emergency” could get “immediate access to personnel of the division for technical support.”
Lastly, the bill would prohibit discharges into ephemeral or intermittent streams, overflows onto the private property of another, or “any situation in which the normal course of discharge shall result in accumulation of wastewater in areas outside of the stream or waterway.”

Even after the Senate amended the bill to avoid fully repealing minimum child-to-staff ratios, many child care advocates remained opposed to the bill — worrying that loosening regulations will risk harm to kids. 
Idaho’s existing child-to-staff ratios are the 41st loosest in the nation, compared to all 50 states and the District of Columbia, a report by Idaho Voices for Children found. In other words, Idaho’s existing state-set child care standards let individual staffers care for more children at a given time than most states. 
The new law will leave Idaho with the 45th least stringent child-to-staff ratios in the nation, Idaho Voices for Children Executive Director Christine Tiddens previously told the Idaho Capital Sun.
The bill was cosponsored by Republican lawmakers Reps. Barbara Ehardt, from Idaho Falls, and Rod Furniss, from Rigby, and Sen. Carl Bjerke, R-Coeur d’Alene.

The bill will retain the state’s points-based ratio that only allows up to 12-points, determined by kids’ ages, per each staff member. But the underlying points for kids would almost all be reduced.
Here’s how the bill will change Idaho’s child-to-staff ratio standards:

Each child under 24 months old would remain at two points.
Each child at least 24 months old but younger than 36 months would be 1.33 points. That is a decrease from the current 1.5 points in Idaho law.
Each child at least 36 months old but younger than 5 years old would be 0.923 points. That is a decrease from 1 point in Idaho law.
Each child at least 5 years old but younger than 13 years old would be 0.48 points. That is a decrease from 0.5 points in Idaho law.

The curtailment order was in place for about three weeks until the two sides reached an agreement that resolved the issue for 2024. The two sides then continued negotiations until the Surface Water Coalition and Idaho Groundwater Association reached a long-term settlement agreement last fall.
Then, in conjunction with his Jan. 6 State of the State address, Idaho Gov. Brad Little called for spending $30 million on water projects to increase water levels in the aquifer and support the settlement agreement.

 Idaho legislators make the case for water projects funding 

Several legislators stood up on the House floor and made passionate speeches in favor of approving the funding and the budget.
“Water is the lifeblood of our state,” Rep. David Cannon, R-Blackfoot, said. “Water is the lifeblood of my legislative district. There is no more urgent issue in the immediate term or in the medium term or in the long term to the state of Idaho than water. And in my view, House Bill 445, is one of the most important bills to come through this session. And I urge unity. I urge the state to join together on this issue for the betterment of Idaho and for the protection of Idaho water going forward.”

Rep. Stephanie Mickelsen, an Idaho Falls Republican and chair of the Idaho Ground Water Appropriators, said there are more water projects than there is money to go around, and many projects take multiple years to complete. But Mickelsen said legislators have a responsibility to protect water resources. She described investments in water projects as investments in the state’s overall economy. 
“I had ancestors that came and dug the very beginning of the canals in Taylor, Idaho,” Mickelsen said. “And now I sit here and I look and we’re not going to sacrifice anything to keep these waterways and this aquifer healthy? We could have the problems of the Ogallala (Aquifer) that are in Nebraska and Kansas, and they are a declining resource that they may not be able to save. The lucky thing for Idaho is we have plenty of water, but we have to make the investment to protect the resource that we have.”
  How will the water projects be prioritized under the bill? 

Not every legislator agreed with spending the money, however.

“I understand the importance of water in our state,” Rep. David Leavitt, R-Idaho Falls, said. “It is the lifeblood of our state. It’s what makes everything function, every single industry. But the reality is this is $30 million. This is a massive amount of money. And with this money, we don’t know where it’s going to be spent.”
Several legislators pushed back, saying it is not true that the state doesn’t know where the money is going or what the projects are for.

Hopefully someday I can afford to live on it, too,” Regier told reporters during a press availability this week. “But [&#8230;]","Somers Beach State Park on Flathead Lake. (Provided by Montana FWP for the Daily Montanan)Senate President Matt Regier grew up learning to water ski on Flathead Lake — the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi — as did many of his constituents. 
“I have friends that live there. Hopefully someday I can afford to live on it, too,” Regier told reporters during a press availability this week. “But Flathead Lake is not just for the people around it. Tourism is a big draw for the Flathead Valley. And when you have a problem like we did two years ago with lake levels and not being able to put boats in, I mean, that’s just the start of it.”
Regier presented Joint Resolution 18 to the Senate Natural Resources Committee on Wednesday, which requests that water managers consider recreation to be as important as other priorities when making decisions about Flathead Lake. 
In late June 2023, water levels on Flathead Lake were historically low — nine inches below the lake’s full-pool mark and a foot below the 23-year median, according to U.S. Geological Survey data — and causing problems for businesses and recreational users. 
Requests to raise the lake level, made to the inter-agency team that coordinates dams across the Columbia River Basin, were denied, as water managers had to balance multiple uses including flood control, wildlife management and irrigation — not just recreation. 
“I needed to do something to stand up for my constituents, especially back home, (to show) how vital having water in Flathead Lake is,” Regier told reporters. “I always speak for my constituents, but this is special to them.”
Regier cited comments from Gov. Greg Gianforte made that year about the importance of the lake to the region’s economic vitality — roughly $600 million is spent from anglers, boaters and other tourists in Flathead County alone, according to a University of Montana study. 
During a normal year, the dam-controlled lake fills up during the spring runoff by mid-June and tends to stay level throughout the summer months. 
In 2023, however, low snowpack and regional drought conditions prevented the lake from reaching full-pool levels.
According to the University of Montana’s Flathead Lake Biological Station — which operates from a campus on the east side of the lake — snowpack the previous winter was just 80% of the long-term average, and an unusually warm May led to a rapid meltout. 
Flathead Lake Biological Station Director Jim Elser said inflows from the main stem Flathead River, which is the primary source for the lake, was between 34% and 60% throughout the year.
With so little water entering the lake, levels continued to drop, ultimately reaching a full two feet below full pool, which is 2,893. 
Low water levels affected boat and business owners around the lake, according to the Flathead Beacon, as many public and private boat access sites couldn’t operate. Rental companies lost customers, too. 
Farmers upstream of the lake saw irrigation issues, as lake water often backs up the river to an elevation high enough to divert into sloughs, and hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of crops were jeopardized. 
Efforts to address the problem ran up the ladder from county officials, to the governor and Montana’s Congressional delegation. 
One avenue considered was a plan to release water from Hungry Horse Reservoir located upstream.

Hungry Horse Dam, along with Se̓liš Ksanka Qĺispe̓ (SKQ) Dam, operated by Energy Keepers Inc., on behalf of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, are part of a network of 60 dams throughout the the Columbia River Basin. Many of the dams are operated by the Army Corps of Engineers or Bureau of Reclamation, but all of them are jointly coordinated to regulate flood control, energy generation, irrigation, streamflow for fish migration and recreation. 
An inter-agency Technical Management Team comprising representatives from four states, five federal agencies and six tribal nations, coordinates operations across the Columbia River Basin. A proposal by Gov. Greg Gianforte to fill Flathead Lake using water from Hungry Horse was considered, but ultimately found to be an inadequate solution, due to the risk of draining too much water from the reservoir during drought conditions. During the fall, water released from Hungry Horse augments the Flathead River to aid endangered Bull Trout. 
Many elected officials, including U.S. Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke lambasted the decision, accusing the Technical Management Team of prioritizing fish over people.
Zinke later introduced legislation to Congress that would require Flathead Lake to be held at full-pool capacity through Labor Day each year, but the legislation never got out of committee. 
Regier said during the committee hearing on Wednesday that he had considered similar legislation “with a lot more teeth than just a resolution” until he researched the intricacies involved in coordinating the water system of the Pacific Northwest.
“Once we started digging into that, there were a lot more players than I realized that were involved in water levels in Flathead Lake,” Regier said.  
The resolution put forward instead requests that “all decision-making bodies with an influence on the usability of Flathead Lake ensure that recreation needs be measured fairly compared to hydropower, fish, and irrigation demands,” and also requests that Flathead Lake Recreation be “expressly reflected” in the next iteration of the Columbia River Treaty. 
Negotiations to update the 61-year old treaty between the U.S. and Canada are currently paused due to President Donald Trump’s threats to Canada’s sovereignty.

 State of the lake

Management of Flathead Lake primarily rests with Energy Keepers Inc, the company that operates SKQ Dam.
Under the dam’s federal license, the lake is dropped to its lowest level during the winter, and has specific flood-risk limitation on how quickly the water level can be brought up during the spring runoff. 
In a February news release, Energy Keepers said that streamflow conditions in the Flathead Basin were “similar to 2023 and 2024” and the dam was being operated to increase the likelihood of meeting refill requirements. 
In both 2023 and 2024, the dam operators requested waivers from the Army Corps of Engineers to deviate from the normal process and begin filling the lake early in order to maximize capacity. 
The first water level benchmark to be released won’t come until mid-April, and Energy Keepers has not updated its forecast for the lake since Feb. 2.
Data from the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service show that snowpack in northwest Montana is significantly better than in recent years. 
As of March 27, NRCS data indicated that snow water equivalent — the amount of moisture contained within the snowpack — across the Flathead Basin is at 96% of the 30-year median. Rain and snow are forecast during the next week in the area.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Somers-2-1024x612.jpeg,,,2025-03-27 20:01:50.875663

Brandon Beach, recently appointed U.S. Treasurer by President Donald Trump, amended a bill by Rep. Katie Dempsey to allow for wrongful conviction compensation when district attorneys are subsequently disqualified. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderA bill that would grant compensation to wrongfully convicted Georgians was just given a second chance after lawmakers spliced it into a bill inspired by President Donald Trump’s election interference case in Georgia.
Senate Bill 244, which is aimed at allowing criminal defendants to recoup their legal costs if the prosecuting attorney in their case is disqualified for personal or professional misconduct, now includes the bulk of House Bill 533, which would establish a standardized process in Georgia state law for people who have been exonerated. It passed out of the House Judiciary Non-Civil Committee in a contentious vote Thursday afternoon.
House lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have faced an uphill battle in their efforts to properly compensate those who have been wrongfully incarcerated. The process is currently done on a case-by-case basis through individual compensation resolutions that must pass through the full legislative process like any other bill. Legislation to standardize the process was initially introduced by Atlanta Democratic Rep. Scott Holcomb in 2022, and re-introduced in 2023, but his efforts have repeatedly been stalled in the Senate by Republican opposition. 
This year, HB 533, also known as the Wrongful Conviction Compensation Act, was sponsored by Rome Republican Rep. Katie Dempsey. It passed through the House Judiciary Non-Civil Committee unanimously ahead of Crossover Day but never made it to a vote on the House floor. House lawmakers did, however, overwhelmingly pass a measure that included individual compensation resolutions for five people who served time in prison after being wrongfully convicted.
In contrast, SB 244 was sponsored by state Sen. Brandon Beach, an Alpharetta Republican and staunch Trump ally who was recently appointed by the president to serve as U.S. Treasurer. It was originally aimed solely at allowing criminal defendants to recoup their legal costs in the event that the prosecuting attorney in their case was disqualified as a result of “improper conduct.” The bill, Beach said, was inspired by Trump’s election interference case in Georgia, in which Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis was disqualified after an appeals court judge found that her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade created a “‘significant’ appearance of impropriety.” 
“When you think about somebody getting indicted, it’s somewhat of a scarlet letter,” Beach said at a committee hearing on the bill Tuesday. “It is tough. It can ruin your life, and it can definitely cost you a lot in attorney’s fees to defend yourself. And so I just am doing this so that people that have been wrongly accused and then the case goes away, they have some type of ability to recoup some of their fees and reasonable cost.”
Democratic lawmakers on the committee objected to Beach’s portion of the bill, pointing out that the bill would benefit Sen. Shawn Still, a Johns Creek Republican who was indicted in the Fulton County election interference case alongside Trump and 17 other codefendants. 
“My concern is that we are specifically aiding one of our colleagues, not to mention the issue that Rep. Dempsey and Rep. Holcomb’s bill is essentially being used, essentially, as political extortion,” said Rep. Esther Panitch, a Sandy Springs Democrat.
Democrats also raised concerns about the disproportionate impact the law would have on smaller counties with more limited budgets, as well as fears that local district attorneys could be discouraged from prosecuting complicated cases out of fear of having to cover the cost of defendant’s attorney fees, but they ultimately failed to successfully amend the bill.
 
Dempsey also made an effort to distance her language from Beach’s proposal as she presented the substitute bill to the committee.
“This is truly quite separate from the measure that Senator Beach has on the front,” Dempsey said. “This is a completely different conversation. We are not trying to target anyone. We are trying to take a process and make it fair and remove it from the hands of the Legislature and put it into administrative law judges’ hands, who are much better skilled and equipped to handle those decisions.”
Though Dempsey said she was grateful that the language regarding wrongful convictions has a second chance to pass through the Legislature this year, she admitted that it may be an uphill battle to get the bill through both chambers before the 2025 legislative session ends on April 4. 
But in its new form, she has reason to be optimistic, she said.
“This bill is a priority for Senator Beach,” Dempsey said, adding that he could be instrumental to the bill’s passage.

(Photo by Mia Maldonado/Idaho Capital Sun)A federal judge on Thursday evening temporarily blocked a new Idaho immigration law from taking effect.
The block was issued hours after the ACLU of Idaho on Thursday filed a lawsuit against the state of Idaho over a new policy Idaho Gov. Brad Little signed into law on Thursday, which allows law enforcement to record a person’s documentation status if they are suspected of a crime. 
Modeled after a controversial 2023 Texas law, House Bill 83, as amended, creates Idaho immigration crimes “illegal entry” and “illegal reentry,” targeting individuals who do not have proper immigration authorization and those who have already been deported from coming to Idaho. Law enforcement would only be able to convict someone of those crimes if they are suspected for a different crime. 
The law also creates the crime of “trafficking a dangerous illegal alien,” or knowingly transporting an unauthorized immigrant who has previously been convicted of a crime in the U.S. or another country. The law grants immunity to law enforcement, meaning they are protected from lawsuits that could arise from the damages and liability they cause while enforcing the law. 
As federal agencies tighten immigration enforcement, House Bill 83 represents Idaho’s own approach to address unauthorized immigration in the Gem State – where about 35,000 unauthorized immigrants live, according to a report from the University of Idaho’s McClure Center for Public Policy. 
However, the ACLU of Idaho anticipated the law taking effect, and it immediately sued. 
 About Idaho’s newest lawsuit: IORC v. Labrador

There are multiple plaintiffs in the case including the Idaho Organization of Resource Councils, an organization that promotes the safety, health and justice of immigrant communities. Another plaintiff includes The Alliance of Idaho, a nonprofit that provides low-cost immigration services to families in Blaine County. There are also five individual plaintiffs whose names are anonymous in the lawsuit for protection purposes, including four Mexican citizens and a Peruvian citizen who live in Idaho and Oregon, all of whom have children who are U.S. citizens. 
The defendants include Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador and 13 prosecuting attorneys who represent the counties that the plaintiffs live in, ACLU of Idaho spokesperson Rebecca De León told the Idaho Capital Sun. The lawsuit alleges House Bill 83 violates the U.S. Constitution in three ways. 
First, the plaintiffs allege the law violates the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which establishes that federal law overrides state law, including in immigration matters. 
“Courts in other states who have passed these laws have agreed with our legal argument, and we expect the court to do so here,” ACLU of Idaho legal director Paul Carlos Southwick said in a press conference, referring to immigration policies in Texas, Iowa and Oklahoma.
Second, the plaintiffs allege the law violates the Commerce Clause in the U.S. Constitution because it regulates people’s ability to enter into Idaho and imposes burdens on interstate and foreign commerce. 
Third, they argue the law is vague.
“This was a result of a lot of back and forth between the House and the Senate and deciding what version of this bill would pass, and unfortunately they cobbled together a version that is incomprehensible,” Southwick said. “And everyone, including our undocumented community, has a right to understand the law so that they know what the provisions of that law are and what they may or may not be violating.”
 Bill sponsors say law targets immigrant criminals. ACLU of Idaho disagrees.

Bill sponsors have said the bill’s purpose is to curb unauthorized migration and prevent dangerous unauthorized immigrants from entering Idaho. 
However, Southwick said the bill clearly does not just target criminals. 
“You do not have to have any criminal conviction in order to be arrested, detained or prosecuted for these crimes,” he said in a press conference. “Law enforcement merely needs suspicion that you have engaged in some kind of independent crime.”
Emily Croston, a staff attorney at the ACLU, agreed with Southwick. 
“It affects anyone who is stopped or accused of committing even minor crimes, so these could include littering, shoplifting or disturbing the peace,” she said. “So even if someone is never actually convicted for those minor crimes, if there’s suspicion against them, then the police are allowed to engage in prosecuting the H.B. 83 crimes.”
Croston said the law would discourage unauthorized immigrants from reporting crimes they’ve witnessed or are experiencing. 
Because the bill had an emergency clause, it went into effect immediately after the governor signed it. The court’s temporary restraining order issued Thursday evening will prevent the law’s enforcement for 14 days. The lawsuit has been assigned to federal Judge Amanda Brailsford, and a preliminary injunction hearing is scheduled at 10 a.m. April 10 at the James A. McClure Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse in Boise. A preliminary injunction could block the law’s enforcement throughout the litigation process.

(Getty Images)More than 180 religious or philosophical exemptions to the state’s school immunization requirements have been requested in the approximately two months since Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s executive order, and all of the requests have been approved, health officials say. 
The West Virginia Department of Health released the number of exemptions approved this week in response to a Freedom of Information Act request from West Virginia Watch. The response included the number of requests, but no identifying information about the nature of the requests. 
Morrisey issued an executive order Jan. 14 directing the state, through the 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act, to allow religious exemptions to the state’s vaccine requirements. The department said 186 exemptions have been made and approved between then and Monday.
All states require school children to be vaccinated against a number of infectious diseases, including measles, polio and chicken pox. Until January, West Virginia was among only five that did not allow religious or philosophical exemptions to those requirements. West Virginia state code currently allows only exemptions for children who have a medical reason, such as an allergy or a previous severe reaction to a vaccine. 
Morrisey’s executive order also directed the state health officer, a position that’s currently not filled, to come up with rules and legislation to facilitate religious exemptions. 
The state House of Delegates on Monday rejected Senate Bill 460, a bill Morrisey requested that would have established those religious exemptions in state code. 
Morrisey said Monday he would not rescind the order, setting up a potential clash between the state’s executive and legislative branches. The Department of Health said it would continue to abide by Morrisey’s order, despite the Legislature rejecting the bill. 
The Senate easily passed Senate Bill 460 last month with a vote of 20 to 12. In the House, the Health Committee had pared down the legislation, aiming to change the medical exemption process only. The religious exemptions were added back into the bill on the House floor last week.  
During an interview with HD Media’s Outside the Echo Chamber this week, House Health Committee Chair Evan Worrell, R-Cabell said that Senate Bill 460 is dead, but that lawmakers could continue to have conversations about whether to change the medical exemption process for vaccines. 
“I think ultimately some people had a lot of consternation around the religious exemption, that you could just write a letter and you could have that exemption,” Worrell said. “I personally believe that we should be able to do that, but that’s just my vote and that’s why we have this debate.”
The 186 exemptions represent a minuscule portion of the state’s school age population, estimated to be about 250,000. But it’s more than three times the 53 medical exemptions requested in 2023, according to a report from the state Department of Health.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) As Republicans move forward with their proposal to overhaul Iowa’s property tax system, House Democrats introduced their own property tax relief proposal Thursday: a $1,000 rebate for all Iowa homeowners and $500 rebate for renters.
In a news conference Thursday, Rep. Dave Jacoby, D-Coralville, ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee, said both Republicans and Democrats heard on the campaign trail that property tax costs were one of the top concerns for Iowans across the state. But he said the Republicans’ plan, House Study Bill 313 and Senate Study Bill 1208, will not necessarily guarantee lower property tax costs.

Jacoby said the Democrats’ bill, House File 691, would provide immediate relief through rebates, which would be funded using the Taxpayer Relief Fund, which currently holds $3.75 billion. Democrats also released another bill, House File 916, to expand the existing Homeowner Property Tax Credit, which freezes property tax rates, to all seniors over age 65.
“Over the years, as we’ve all door knocked and talked to people when we’re running for office, property taxes is one of the number one things that people bring up,” Jacoby said. “Their frustration is coming to a boiling point, because everything we’ve done to date has been totally ineffective. How many people’s — as homeowners — property taxes have gone down in the last 10 years? Nobody. The Democrats have a plan that puts the dollars right back into Iowans’ pockets.”
House Speaker Pat Grassley told reporters Thursday that he had concerns about using the Taxpayer Relief Fund, which contains one-time money, for these rebates, as these funds will also be used to implement the income tax cuts enacted by Republicans in recent years.
“I would just want to be mindful of that to make sure that we don’t over commit to something, regardless of what the tax would be,” Grassley said. “We know right now that, that Taxpayer Relief Fund helps smooth any unforeseen things that happen as we reduce the tax to 3.8%, so I’d want to see what that direct proposal would look like and how that would impact the income tax cut.”
The GOP bill, proposed by Ways and Means chairs Rep. Bobby Kauffman, R-Wilton and Sen. Dan Dawson, R-Council Bluffs, would remove Iowa’s “rollback” system that limits how much the aggregate taxable value of properties can grow each year. It would move the state to a “revenue-restricted” system, where taxable property value can grow by a larger margin, but would set new limits on how much local property tax levy rates can increase each year and how much new tax revenues could be collected by local governments.
Jacoby said the rollback system was first introduced in the 1970s as a way to lower property taxes in the face of the farm crisis and high inflation. He said as inflation remains a current concern, removing this system could lead to even higher costs for property owners especially as property valuations would be roughly doubled by removing the rollback. The residential property rollback rate was 47.4% in fiscal year 2026, meaning for a $100,000 home, only roughly $47,400 would be taxed.
“The way it’s laid out right now, there’s no guarantee that residential homeowners will see any decrease in their tax liability,” Jacoby said. “There’s no guarantee whatsoever.”
Jacoby said while Democrats support making changes to Iowa’s property tax system, lowering property taxes would have to involve providing state funding for costs that were shifted to local governments through the 2013 property tax legislation signed by former Gov. Terry Branstad. While state lawmakers had agreed at that time to backfill costs related to issues like health and public safety costs, Jacoby said the state did not end up providing funding for these measures, leading to higher property taxes.
He said a similar problem could arise with this year’s bill, which proposes shifting $426 million funding for K-12 schools currently paid for using property taxes to the state.
“In the 2013 bill, the agreement was with cities, counties and schools that the state would make the backfill from the decrease in the revenues,” Jacoby said. “The state abdicated on that promise from 2013, so I don’t trust state government to honor its commitment to the school districts to make up that difference.”

Grassley said Republicans were committed to providing the education funding contained in the property tax bill if it were to pass.
“When it comes to the funding aspect of it, I continue to remind Iowans we’re spending more money on education right now than we ever have as a state,” Grassley said. “… We’ve been pretty consistent that if we’re going to do it, we need to fund it. And that’s why this plan looks at that direct shift to the education piece, which affects all property taxpayers.”
The House speaker also emphasized that conversations were still ongoing on the Republican property tax proposal and that “no bill right now is set in stone.”
“When you’re looking at such a system that’s been in place as long as it has, it’s going to take time,” Grassley said. “And we need to be very deliberate in our approach to make sure we’re not only providing relief, but that is something that’s sustainable as well.”

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)On Tuesday, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order dealing with federal elections, but because the U.S. Constitution reserves many electoral powers for the states, experts across the country and here in Alaska say they’re not certain what effects Trump’s action will have.
“The Division of Elections is reviewing the executive order and will collaborate with the Department of Law on any potential changes to policies or procedures,” said Carol Beecher, director of the Division of Elections, in a written statement.
Multiple attorneys with expertise in Alaska elections law declined comment on the order, citing uncertainty about its applicability.
Trump’s order comes just as the Alaska Legislature is considering proposals to rewrite state elections law. A bill in the House and a similar bill in the Senate would each make a variety of changes, including to the state’s absentee ballot process.
Many states, including Alaska, count some absentee ballots that arrive after Election Day, as long as they were postmarked on or before Election Day.
Trump’s order seeks to change that by stating that all ballots must reach elections officials on or before Election Day.
“I don’t know that he can legally change that just with an executive order,” said Sen. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage and one of several senators leading the push for the Senate bill.
“In fact,” Wielechowski said, “I highly doubt that he can, and I’m not even sure that Congress can, quite frankly, because under the Constitution, the states have very strong abilities to run their own elections.”
Earlier this year, Wielechowski requested a legal opinion asking whether existing caselaw requires Alaska to abide by an Election Day deadline for absentee ballots.
No, said a legislative attorney.
The Trump order also states that voters who register to vote via a national mail voter registration form must present a U.S. Passport, military ID or other document that shows the voter’s citizenship.
Most voters register to vote via state forms, rather than federal forms, so the impact of the new ID requirements isn’t clear. One section of the Trump order says that states may lose federal elections funding if they don’t mirror the new ID requirements in their own states.
Alaska received $1 million in federal elections funding last year, budget records show.
Wielechowski said he has already requested that legislative attorneys perform a detailed analysis of the elections executive order.
“I think the further they encroach, the more questionable what they do becomes,” Wielechowski said of the Trump administration’s actions on elections.

(Photo by Leah Romero / Source New Mexico)Las Cruces could see New Mexico’s state-funded reproductive health clinic open its doors on the east side of town by late summer or fall 2026, according to project organizers.
Christopher Ramirez, spokesperson for the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, told Source NM that organizers are in the final stages of design and development and expect to present plans to the Department of Higher Education and the State Board of Finance for approval in May and June. Once approved, the search for a contractor will start.
“Our hope is to have a contractor in place and construction to begin by September/October,” Ramirez told Source NM in an email, adding that the goal is to open doors to patients about a year later.
The Center for Reproductive Health is part of a $10 million capital outlay project requested by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and approved in 2023 to expand access to reproductive health care in Southern New Mexico. The project is a partnership between UNM and advocacy organizations Bold Futures, Strong Families New Mexico and Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains. 
Lujan Grisham, legislators, organizers and local leaders broke ground on the center in September 2024, on East Lohman Avenue near MountainView Regional Medical Center, following over a year of few updates on the project.
The center is expected to offer medication and procedural abortion, contraception options, pregnancy loss support and management, lactation support and doula support, along with other services.
Lujan Grisham recently requested another $10 million in capital outlay funds for a reproductive health center in Northern New Mexico. Neither the governor nor the Las Cruces center organizers have confirmed that the same organizers will be part of the planning for the second center. A location for the center has not been released, though Republican lawmakers speculated during the legislative session that Santa Fe would be the target. 
The Legislature passed capital outlay projects in House Bill 450 and it awaits the governor’s signature. 
Ramirez previously told Source NM that “as with all items relating to UNM, this capital outlay funding will be thoroughly analyzed, and our teams will continue working with the Legislature and the Executive to understand UNM’s role.”

He said the measure, one of the most hotly-contested this year, “will save lives.” 
“We are not doing enough currently to protect people,” Brown told a state Senate committee on Tuesday. “Washington has already introduced components of a robust permitting system. House Bill 1163 would build on that progress.”
Brown is following the tradition of his predecessor, Gov. Bob Ferguson, who made gun control one of the marquee efforts of his tenure as attorney general. It’s not new terrain for Brown, who helped write the ballot initiative that raised Washington’s minimum age to buy a semiautomatic rifle from 18 to 21, added a 10-day waiting period and enhanced the background check process.
On Thursday, House Bill 1163 passed the Senate Law & Justice Committee on a party-line vote.
The proposal would require prospective gun buyers to first apply for a five-year permit from the Washington State Patrol. To get the permit, applicants must have completed a certified firearms safety training program within the past five years, with exceptions for police officers and active military servicemembers. 
If the applicant has completed the safety course, the state would have to issue the permit unless the person is barred from having guns, out of custody on bond awaiting trial or sentencing on felony charges, or the subject of an arrest warrant. 
The state patrol’s Firearms Background Check Program would issue the permit within 30 days, or 60 days if the applicant doesn’t have a state ID. 
State patrol expects to receive 120,000 applicants per year on average, with over 40 employees handling the applications. 
The state patrol says it will cost $13.7 million in the next state budget to handle the new program. The amount rises to nearly $20 million in the 2027-29 budget. Fees collected for fingerprinting and background checks would offset the cost of the new permit-to-purchase program, according to a fiscal analysis.
The House passed the measure this month on a 58-38 vote without Republican support. During floor debate, one conservative lawmaker said this “may be the worst bad bill we’ve seen so far this session.”
On Thursday, the committee amended the bill to exempt licensed armed private investigators and security guards from the training requirement.
Opponents say their constitutional right to bear arms shouldn’t require a permit.
Sen. Jeff Holy, R-Cheney, questioned if the proposal would comply with a U.S. Supreme Court decision known as Bruen that held firearm laws must adhere to the nation’s “historical tradition of firearm regulation.” 
“To be rather blunt about this, I think this is another imprudent piece of legislation,” Holy said Thursday, guaranteeing the bill will face legal challenges if it passes both chambers.
About a dozen states have permit to purchase laws on the books. 
Judges have consistently upheld these laws. Last year, for example, a panel of federal appeals judges appointed by both Democrat and Republican presidents upheld a similar law in Maryland. The judges ruled the Supreme Court’s decision in Bruen explicitly allowed for laws like this. 
Last year in Oregon, a judge ruled gun regulations that included a permit to purchase violated the state’s constitution. This month, a state appeals court overturned that decision.
Advocates applauded the Washington bill’s progress.

“It’s encouraging to see our lawmakers continue to prioritize gun safety and address America’s gun violence crisis with the urgency it deserves,” said Finley Gonzales, of the Kamiak High School chapter of Students Demand Action. “Permit to purchase is a key component of responsible gun ownership. This policy is something everyone should be able to get behind because it makes our communities safer.”
Several other Democratic priorities on guns have stalled this session, including proposals to limit bulk purchases of firearms and ammunition, require gun owners to lock up their weapons in their cars and homes and add new requirements for gun dealers.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/guns-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-27 19:03:22.324661

A problem Habitat saw in crafting the promise last year, however, was that property taxes owed by the homeowner could be thrown out of whack. Enter 2024 legislation pushed by State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln, which is now law and allows such sales-restricted houses a property tax break via a special method that “stabilizes” values in recognition of limited marketability.
“It’s a huge huge deal for the people it fits,” said Amanda Brewer, CEO of Omaha Habitat. “This is ensuring that there are affordable places where people can own a home in Omaha for the next 50 years.”
Nebraska Habitat leaders see such potential in what the law can do to preserve homeownership accessibility for lower-income families that the organization honored Bostar this week with its 2025 Housing Champion Award. 
 Rally in Rotunda

Bostar received the award during two days of Habitat-led housing advocacy activities that wrapped up Thursday in Lincoln. He and a panel of state senators spoke Wednesday night to statewide Habitat affiliates and housing allies including Front Porch Investments and the Nebraska Housing Developers Association. Conversations with lawmakers continued the next day, capped by a “Homeownership Matters” rally in the State Capitol Rotunda.
The rally drew about 75 housing advocates — some carrying signs that read, “A house shouldn’t cost anywhere near half your paycheck” — and several state lawmakers.
Among them was Speaker John Arch of La Vista, a health care consultant, who underscored the role homeownership has in building a social network that helps mental and physical health.
“We as a society, as a state, need to focus on helping people get into homes so that those roots can be put down, community can be built, and society, as a result, benefits from that,” said Arch.
He said the Legislature should be mindful of how to help especially first-time homebuyers, though Arch said he was not focused on pushing any specific housing-related bill over the finish line this session.
“We can do a number of things with tax incentives and making it easier for people to get in, but it’s a challenge,” he said. “Every year we need to be constantly searching for those new ideas.”

The Bostar-backed legislation last year, which began as Legislative Bill 1217 and became LB 1317, was multifaceted and included several elements advocates say should help preserve and create affordable housing opportunities in Nebraska. 
Indeed, the part of the law that captured the most attention had to do with renter-occupied housing for low-income residents and adjusting property valuation methods for those Section 42 apartments. 
That spotlight prompted Habitat to approach Bostar about pursuing the change related to its situation, representatives said. The provision applies to affiliates statewide, as well as NeighborWorks and other charitable organizations with a homeownership mission. The law took effect in July.
Habitat’s Tracie McPherson said counterparts in other states worked several years to pass similar legislation, and she was grateful Nebraska lawmakers acted more quickly.
“We knew it was the right thing to do to keep affordable housing in our state,” she said.
 Property tax relief

Bostar said the law makes strides toward a couple of the Legislature’s top priorities: property tax relief and preserving affordable housing.
McPherson said the changes should also help keep houses in local hands — and away from out-of-state investors that she said often turn them into costly rental property.
Lacey Studnicka, program director for Habitat, called the Bostar-backed law “transformational” in supporting the nonprofit’s equity promise and goal to preserve affordable homeownership for working families. 
She said alarm bells had been going off as home prices spiked, putting houses out of the reach of nonprofits, such as Habitat, to sell to low-income residents. For context, she said, Habitat houses valued for tax purposes at $140,000 in 2019 in Omaha now are valued at $260,000.
The Habitat Omaha board approved its “equity promise” approach at the start of 2024, which also gave the nonprofit the first right to buy back the house. Here’s how that works:
  Amanda Brewer, CEO Habitat for Humanity of Omaha (Courtesy of Habitat for Humanity)
The buyer agrees to covenants guaranteeing that another low-income family can purchase the home at an affordable price, if the homeowner chooses to sell or move. Habitat would get the first shot at buying the home back.
A seller still builds modest equity based on a formula and the time they stay in the house. In one scenario, the resale price for a buyer of a Habitat home whose mortgage is $200,000 (after downpayment and other assistance) and who owned the property for just under 3 years, would be $205,800.
The Bostar legislation then allows for a stabilization of property taxes, based on that first mortgage and a slight annual increase, said Studnicka. She said the homeowner must apply annually for the special assessment, similar to those seeking a homestead exemption.
The special valuation method is limited to properties first held by a nonprofit such as Habitat, NeighborWorks or a local community foundation that sells homes to individuals who are low income. The sales restrictions must run for at least 20 years and limit the sale of the property to another individual with a low income.
Bostar said he was grateful and encouraged by Habitat’s reaction.
“Access to homeownership really represents access to the American dream,” he said. “So much of a family’s wealth and their ability to hand wealth down to their children to ensure they have a better life than their parents had rests with homeownership.”



Priority bills
Habitat for Humanity Nebraska affiliates have identified four 2025 legislative priorities:

Legislative Bill 531, introduced by State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha, would provide an exception to the requirement that buildings constructed with state funds comply with the 2018 International Energy Conservation Code. 
LB 566, Sen. Dan Quick of Grand Island, eliminates expiration dates relating to an income tax credit for the purchase of certain residential property.
LB 622, Sen. Rob Dover of Norfolk, intends to make the Nebraska Affordable Housing Trust Fund more effective by getting funds to granting agencies quicker and making funds revolve as much as possible. It also proposes a documentary stamp increase for downpayment assistance. 
LB 643, Sen. Jason Prokop of Lincoln, would remove the tax advantage investor-owned housing has over owner-occupied housing for companies that own more than 30 properties.",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Amanda-Brewer-introduces-Homeowner-Autumn-Austin-State-Capitol-Rally-_4874-3.27.25-2-scaled-copy-1024x525.jpg,,,2025-03-27 19:03:22.324661

,DC,2025-03-27 22:51:35+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,The AP and Trump administration renew court fight over White House press access,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ap-and-trump-administration-renew-court-fight-over-white-house-press-access,,"WASHINGTON — The Associated Press and the Trump administration delivered arguments in federal court Thursday in a case that could alter decades of established press access in the White House.U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden for the District of Columbia heard details from the AP’s White House reporter and photographer about their exclusion for the last 44 days from joining their competitors and peers in witnessing President Donald Trump’s events in the Oval Office.The two journalists, and other AP reporters, have also been refused entry to most larger White House events, including in the East Room, and the tarmac for Air Force One departures.The AP, which has been a member of the White House press pool since the 19th century, maintains that the sudden ban violates its First Amendment and due process rights and has hurt its competitiveness as a wire service that reaches thousands of newsrooms.The AP continues to have access to the daily White House press briefings and the driveway near the West Wing entrance, along with over 1,000 other journalists who have “hard passes” to the general White House complex — an argument Trump officials have made to prove they are not altogether banning the wire service.The news organization is seeking a preliminary injunction mandating the administration immediately cease barring the AP from events that are open to a limited number of credentialed press and rescind its policy excluding the outlet from the smaller daily White House press pool. Such an action would likely last until a final judgment is reached.McFadden, who was appointed to the D.C. Circuit by Trump in 2017 and confirmed by the Senate in a 84-10 vote, asked the parties to halt any other evidence submissions so that he can rule in a timely manner.At a hearing Feb. 24, McFadden rejected the AP’s request for a temporary restraining order that would have required the White House to immediately restore its access to the Oval Office, Air Force One and other places.‘The president wasn’t happy’White House chief correspondent Zeke Miller testified that Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, summoned him on Feb. 11 to say “the president wasn’t happy” that the AP continued to use the name Gulf of Mexico after he had ordered the U.S. coastal waters should be called the Gulf of America.“He had decided we wouldn’t be permitted into the Oval Office if we didn’t change our policy and that we should ‘act quickly’ to (change it),” Miller recalled of Leavitt’s message.The AP has not changed its style guidance because the Gulf of Mexico shares borders with Mexico and Cuba, and the AP’s coverage reaches global clients and readers that have recognized the body of water as the Gulf of Mexico for centuries.When asked by the AP’s legal counsel if the new policy has chilled the AP’s coverage, Miller said “undoubtedly our reporting has suffered.”Miller, a White House reporter for just over 12 years, said before Feb. 11 he would regularly see his own news alerts pop up on his cell phone “while the event was still going.”The wire service, which transmits news and photos in near real-time to subscriber members around the world, is now spending time independently verifying reports from other outlets or relying on delayed video feeds that do not show who else is with the president or his environment, Miller said.“We don’t know what those other outlets are including or not including,” he said, especially when those outlets may fear the “viewpoint discrimination” the AP contends it’s faced from the Trump administration.Miller testified neither he nor his White House colleagues have been permitted with other reporters in the Oval Office since Feb. 11, and that they have only been intermittently admitted to press conferences with foreign leaders or ceremonies in larger spaces, including the East Room, which can hold over 100 journalists.The news outlet has had to fly its foreign correspondents to the United States to be part of the foreign press permitted in the Oval Office during visits from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Kier Starmer, according to the news organization.While the White House has admitted AP photographers to some events in the East Room, they’ve been shut out of others.Evan Vucci, the AP’s chief Washington photographer, testified “there’s no rhyme or reason.” The “only thing that’s consistent” is that the AP has been targeted, Vucci said.White House defenseThe government called no witnesses but instead filed a last-minute supplemental declaration Wednesday from Taylor Budowich, White House deputy chief of staff and Cabinet secretary, and lead defendant in the case.The AP moved to strike the declaration Wednesday, arguing the judge had ordered live witnesses, but McFadden denied the motion Thursday.Budowich contends the wire services, TV and radio correspondents and print reporters that comprised the smaller press pool “under the old system continue to be eligible for pool selection in the new system.”Leavitt announced Feb. 25 that going forward, the White House would choose which journalists can access the Oval Office and Air Force One — breaking decades of agreement between numerous administrations and the White House Correspondents Association.The independent group, made of journalists, has self-governed since the Eisenhower administration, operating on the principle that the press corps, not the president, should determine the makeup of the press pool that accompanies the president almost everywhere.Under the new pool system, White House officials “have been empowered to better perform their jobs by creating a pool that best serves the public by pairing the topics of each event with the reporters and audience who are most curious about them,” Budowich stated in his declaration.But AP attorney Charles Tobin said that argument “just doesn’t hold up.”Showing the list of journalists chosen to be in the pool on Feb. 28 — the day of the explosive Oval Office meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy — Tobin pointed out that the White House had chosen The Los Angeles Times to be in the room.But for the past several months, the LA Times’ coverage of Ukraine only consisted of republications of AP wire service feeds, he said.By banning the AP, the White House is “shrinking” its reach to the public, argued Tobin, of Ballard Spahr law firm.Tobin also said he doesn’t buy Budowich’s argument that the AP remains eligible to be chosen for the smaller press pool, pointing to the deputy chief of staff’s public social media postings and statements from other White House officials, all the way up to the president.“If he’s saying it does not constitute a ban, then we don’t speak the same language because that’s exactly what he’s saying,” Tobin said.In his closing statement, Brian Hudak, assistant U.S. attorney in the District of Columbia, said “we’re not saying they can’t publish (what they want), we’re just saying ‘You can’t go here.’”Hudak also added that the president is well within his power to choose “a certain population of journalists” he wants to allow in the Oval Office and other spaces.“I don’t think that offends the Constitution on the First Amendment side,” Hudak said.How it startedPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order hours after his inauguration renaming the U.S. coastal waters along Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas as the Gulf of America. He also reinstated the name of Alaska’s Denali mountain to Mount McKinley.The AP, which issues editorial guidelines followed by journalists around the world, advised it would continue using the Gulf of Mexico with the notation that Trump had renamed the portion of water along the U.S. coast.The outlet, however, issued guidance for journalists to use the name Mount McKinley because the president can rename locations fully within the U.S.In an attempt to avoid litigation, the outlet’s executive editor, Julie Pace, contacted Trump administration officials to discuss the action against the AP. But the AP ultimately filed a lawsuit on Feb. 21 as the White House and Trump “doubled down” on the new policy, according to court documents.White House Chief of Staff Susan Wiles told Pace in Feb. 18 correspondence that the AP Stylebook, a detailed online and print guide for reporters and editors, “has been misused, and at times weaponized, to push a divisive and partisan agenda,” according to court documents.That same day, Trump said the White House would “keep (the AP) out until such time that they agree that it’s the Gulf of America.”As of a March 3 court filing, the AP said it was still banned from the pool and wider events that other reporters — even at least one that didn’t sign up ahead of time — were permitted to attend in person.The outlet wrote in the brief that it “has repeatedly explained to administration officials that government attempts to control the words that journalists use — and excluding those journalists and retaliating against them when they do not comply — are unconstitutional and contrary to the public interest.”A March 17 declaration by Miller lists dozens of events covered by the press pool at the White House and during the president’s travel that the AP has been denied access to.Barring journalists for what they writeThe AP maintains the Trump administration violated the outlet’s Fifth Amendment protections when the White House, without written warning and avenue to challenge, barred its journalists for “arbitrary and viewpoint-discriminatory reasons” from locations and events open to other press.The outlet has a liberty interest in exercising its First Amendment rights, the AP argued, and therefore must receive due process if the government seeks to take away that constitutional right. And, the AP points to precedent set by the D.C.Circuit that the liberty interest in exercising freedom of speech extends to newsgathering.Quoting the 1977 D.C. Circuit ruling in Sherill v. Knight — a key decision repeatedly mentioned — the AP argued: “‘Not only newsmen and the publications for which they write, but also the public at large have an interest protected by’ the First and Fifth Amendments ‘in assuring that restrictions on newsgathering be no more arduous than necessary, and that individual newsmen not be arbitrarily excluded from sources of information.’”In that case, the Circuit Court ruled that press credentials to the White House could not be denied without procedural protections and that “the protection afforded newsgathering under the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of the press requires that this access not be denied arbitrarily or for less than compelling reasons.”But the White House argues that the AP has no liberty interest in “having special media access to the president.”“The Associated Press’s journalists continue to enjoy the same general media access to the White House press facilities as all other hard pass holders and continue to occasionally have special access to the President. The Associated Press’s special access is simply no longer permanent,” according to the White House opposition brief.Quoting from the 1996 case JB Pictures, Inc. v. Department of Defense, the White House argued “‘the First Amendment does not provide journalists any greater right of access to government property or information than it provides to members of the public, despite the fact that access to government information ‘might lead to more thorough or better reporting.’”White House press officials also maintain that the president has discretion over which journalists join him in the “most intimate of his work and personal spaces.”Press pool historyFor decades the White House Correspondents Association has included in the daily pool three wire service reporters, from the AP, Reuters and Bloomberg; four photographers, from AP, Reuters, Agence France-Presse and The New York Times; and rotations of three TV network journalists, a radio correspondent and a print reporter, according to an amicus brief filed by the organization.The wire services regularly included in the pool have the largest reach of all news outlets covering the White House, and is why the association structures the pool as it is, according to court filings.",,,,2025-03-27 19:03:22.324661

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)There’s one less uncertainty surrounding the Washington Bridge demolition and rebuild, with the state securing the $221 million in federal funding, Gov. Dan McKee announced in a press conference Thursday.
Much like the hastily put-together press event, for which reporters were notified 15 minutes prior, confirmation of the federal grant money came abruptly — with the grant agreement signed digitally at 3:04 p.m. Thursday, according to a copy obtained by Rhode Island Current.
Rhode Island was awarded the pair of federal infrastructure grants under Biden-era spending authorized by Congress. But what seemed like a solid win suddenly stood on shaky ground after President Donald Trump took office, with federal funding across a slew of agencies and initiatives suddenly paused or frozen. A federal lawsuit filed in District Court in January by 23 Democratic attorneys general, including Rhode Island’s Peter Neronha, highlighted uncertainty surrounding federal funding for the Washington Bridge as one of many “irreparable harms” the new administration’s actions could cause to states.

Letters sent by Rhode Island’s congressional delegation and state officials seeking confirmation of the bridge funding went unanswered.
Until Thursday. That’s when the state signed the agreement with the U.S. Department of Transportation, committing the promised federal allotment to the project, McKee said. Already, the state has tapped $30 million of the funding as it advances the demolition work and prepares to issue a rebuild contract in June.
The agreement authorizes up to $208.4 million in fiscal 2025, with the remaining $12.5 million to be available in fiscal 2026. 
“This is good news for everyone, including the contractors bidding on the project, knowing there will be no delays,” McKee said. “The timing is right.”
Rhode Island’s congressional delegation touted the news as a “success” in a joint statement Thursday.
“This is a positive outcome and I hope the state will accelerate progress toward a new bridge that meets capacity and safety needs now and in the future,” U.S. Sen. Jack Reed said. “Everyone recognizes the importance of this project to the community and the need for safe, modern, and resilient infrastructure. This federal money is vital to completing this massive project that is already underway.”
The final stage of demolition for the westbound highway began this month. Meanwhile the top two bidders competing to build the replacement bridge have until May 30 to submit pricing proposals to the state. A winner will be chosen in June, though the completion date and cost for the colossal infrastructure job has not been determined.
The newly inked federal agreement for Washington Bridge funding does not cover federal funds appropriated for other state infrastructure repair, including $251 million to rehabilitate bridges along the Interstate 95 corridor.
However, McKee said he was optimistic based on U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy’s willingness to hand over the Washington Bridge money.
“He clearly understands the economy is attached to these infrastructure improvements,” McKee said.
McKee plans to speak with Duffy by phone “early next week,” he said.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Attorney Vera Eidelman rushed to the defense of her clients when she took the stand Thursday morning in a Providence federal courtroom, speaking swiftly as to why national arts funding remains imperiled under President Donald Trump’s administration.   
“You’re going very fast,” U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island Senior District Judge William E. Smith told Eidelman, a senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). “Maybe just slow down a little bit for the court reporter.”
The court reporter smiled and nodded as Eidelman slowed and continued her defense of four performance arts organizations: Rhode Island Latino Arts, The Theater Offensive, National Queer Theater, and Theatre Communications Group. The court case, first filed March 6, is another shockwave running from President Donald Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order aiming to root out federal support and funding that “promotes gender ideology.” 
But time is short: The plaintiffs are seeking an injunction to stop adoption of the executive order at the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) ahead of the agency’s April 7 grant application deadline — grants on which the organizations rely to put on their performances, many of which involve LGBTQ+ performers and storylines. 
“This is clearly about funding private speech,” Eidelman argued before the judge, underlining that the NEA decision would violate First and Fifth Amendment rights. One plaintiff, Rhode Island Latino Arts, has already started to self-censor a planned storytelling program, by considering removing LGBTQ+ elements to accommodate possible changes in federal policy, according to a court document by Marta V. Martínez, the organization’s executive director. 
Arguing the case alongside Eidelman was Scarlet Kim, also a senior staff attorney at the ACLU, who detailed how the NEA would violate the Administrative Procedures Act as well as the basic statutory underpinnings of the NEA. 
A March 25 filing from the ACLU attorneys suggests the judge should not limit relief to the plaintiffs, as the NEA funding issue is nationwide. Smith said he plans to deliver his ruling on April 3, or the morning of April 4 at the latest.

Martínez/Rhode Island Latino Arts)
The roughly two-hour hearing Thursday invoked an artistry different from the sort practiced by the plaintiffs, with attorneys on both sides of the case engaged in a technical blow-for-blow that tried to determine what could be litigated. That’s because the Department of Justice’s arguments, relayed through its lone attorney Kevin M. Bolan, who has worked in the civil division of the district attorney’s office since 2023, disputed that there was even anything to dispute.  
“This whole case arises and centers on an agency action that no longer exists,” Bolan said in court.  
Since the lawsuit’s March 6 filing, the NEA has removed the cornerstones of the plaintiffs’ complaints. First, on March 7, the agency removed a checkbox for grant applications which would have required grant applicants to affirm that their work does not promote gender ideology. Second, on March 17, NEA Senior Advisor Mary Anne Carter issued a memo to agency staff that proclaimed, “Any prior statements the NEA has made concerning any provisions of the EO that apply to its grantmaking are null and void.”
But the notion that the NEA had undone or prevented any possible damage proved unpopular with Smith. “You’ve made that point there,” Smith told Bolan. “I think it’s inconsistent with the law.” 
Bolan offered that litigation is preventing the NEA from figuring out how or if to implement the executive order. The court, he said, should “allow the process to continue.”
“They’re uncertainties because your client has made them uncertainties,” Smith said of the confusion surrounding the executive order on the agency side.
“I’m the agency’s lawyer,” said Bolan at one point. “I’m not someone at the agency making decisions.”
Legal bait and switch?
Hotly discussed was the idea of voluntary cessation, or when a defendant stops doing something — usually the something that prompted litigation — but without any promise the misbehavior will not resume in the future. The ACLU cited FBI vs. Fikre, a 2024 Supreme Court case in which the justices unanimously ruled that when a man sued the FBI for being on the no-fly list, being removed from the list did not render the litigation useless.  
Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in the majority opinion, “A live case or controversy cannot be so easily disguised, and a federal court’s constitutional authority cannot be so readily manipulated.”
In his opening remarks, Bolan argued that the recent recissions by the NEA did not live up to the cessation claims, because the orders had been rescinded.
“Well, you’re going up against Justice Gorsuch on that,” Smith said, cutting off Bolan. “Tell me why Gorsuch got it wrong.”
Bolan replied that cessation involves “manipulation” to “evade judgment.”
“Well, that kind of looks exactly like what’s going on here, no?” Smith said.
Voluntary cessation has come into play with a number of Trump-related lawsuits, as blue state attorneys have rallied to prevent substantial funding changes from taking place at the federal level.  
“One of those cases is in this district,” Kim said, referring to a national lawsuit filed in Rhode Island against the Office of Management and Budget and presided over by Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr.
“Yes, we’re very familiar with it,” Smith replied.

What’s the harm?
The ACLU attorneys relied on the cessation aspect to argue as if the original policy changes had never been rescinded. First, the NEA funds private speech, Eidelman argued, and its underlying statutes are designed with the intent to prevent the agency from becoming “a propaganda machine.”
“Congress took numerous steps to insulate the agency from political pressures,” Kim said in her turn at the stand. “The agency has now explicitly done what Congress forbade it from doing.” 
The federal government’s interpretation of the law was completely opposite, with Bolan arguing that works the agency funds are government speech.
“This is a very different form of subsidy. It’s not something that is widely available,” Bolan said, outlining NEA grants as competitive
Organizations could also apply during a grant cycle later in the year, Bolan thought. “If they have to wait a few months, the show will go on,” he said. “There is no irreparable harm.”
“As soon as the speech is being squelched, isn’t that the harm?” Smith asked.
Eidelman’s rebuttal: “To borrow the opposing counsel’s phrase, the show actually won’t go on.” She noted arts organizations need reliably timed grant cycles to fund their production. 










Congress took numerous steps to insulate the agency from political pressures. The agency has now explicitly done what Congress forbade it from doing. 


– Scarlet Kim, senior staff attorney at the ACLU


Outside the courthouse, Kim was mostly optimistic about the case. “I think the court seemed amenable to our arguments that the prohibition could simply spring back at any time and that our clients need relief,” she said. 
The demands of the litigation on an artist’s time were not lost on Jess Ducey, who co-chairs the National Queer Theater’s board of directors. Yes, Ducey said, the grant process is already “notoriously complex.” Resisting the executive order and “defending the integrity of our work, defending our identities” has sapped even more time away from planning and casting shows, they said.
“But it feels good to be doing this in community and in solidarity with other organizations,” Ducey said. “To be doing this together with other groups, I think is important to show the government the NEA that we’re here. We’re making art. We won’t be silenced.”
The NEA grants are important, Ducey said, because they can exponentially broaden an artist’s audience. “That endorsement is incredibly valuable for an artist, and when you look at any artist’s career, that’s a huge jumping point,” Ducey said.
In the courtroom, Bolan argued that the artwork’s prestige comes from the government subsidy.
Ducey agreed that NEA grants do indeed confer legitimacy, and recognition of merit from a respected agency like the NEA means a lot to artists. But the merit still comes from the art itself, from what artists are already making — and from audiences who go see live performances, Ducey said.
“With or without NEA funding, audiences are the most important part,” Ducey said. “So you, as an individual civilian, go to your theater…Show up to opening night, cheer for them, and show your communities and your government that art’s important.”

A proposal to allow optometrists to perform several in-office surgeries passed the Legislature and awaits the governor’s possible signature, but the New Mexico Academy of Ophthalmology has raised concerns about “serious risks” to patients.
House Bill 36, sponsored by Majority Whip Rep. Dayan Hochman-Vigil (D-Albuquerque), would expand the Optometry Act and how the “practice of optometry” is defined. An optometrist holds a doctorate in optometry, or primary eye care, while an ophthalmologist is a medical doctor with surgical training.
Currently, certified ophthalmologists are the only eye professionals who can perform laser procedures in New Mexico.
If enacted, the bill would allow licensed optometrists to perform various laser-involved procedures to treat conditions like clouding or glaucoma, and also require the state Board of Optometry to create standards for training in laser procedures before an optometrist could begin performing them on patients. 
An analysis of the bill notes that expanding optometrists’ scope of practice could help address the shortage of healthcare providers in New Mexico qualified to care for patients with such needs. The American Academy of Ophthalmology reported that the number of ophthalmologists in the U.S. is predicted to decrease by 12% between 2020 and 2035, while demand for these medical professionals is expected to increase by 24%. The report notes that rural areas in particular do not have adequate access to ophthalmologist services.
Rep. Luis Terrazas (R-Santa Clara), a co-sponsor of the bill, told Source NM he was asked by a local optometrist in his area of rural southwest New Mexico to support the expansions proposed in the bill. Terrazas said he was told that a large number of the optometrist’s patients were being referred to care in Tucson due to long wait times.
“Not every family can afford to travel out of town,” Terrazas said. He told Source that he has experienced five eye surgeries himself that required trips to Phoenix. He said as long as the state continues to struggle with access to health care, the longer patients will continue looking for care elsewhere. 
However, an analysis by the Department of Health reported that the expansion of “laser authority” for optometrists in Oklahoma, Louisiana and Kentucky has not proven to increase access to procedures in a significant way and actually poses “serious concerns” for the safety of patients, particularly due to a lack of standardized guidelines for training in laser surgery. 
The DOH report says, “there is a risk of inconsistent preparation among providers performing these procedures. This inconsistency could lead to an increase in vision loss, blindness, and negative patient outcomes.”
“Lowering the quality of care is not a valid workforce strategy for rural New Mexico,” Rebecca Leenheer, board president of New Mexico Academy of Ophthalmologists, said in a statement. “Every New Mexican—regardless of ZIP code—deserves the highest level of health care, including qualified, highly trained medical doctors performing delicate eye surgery.”
Terrazas emphasized to Source NM that HB36 does not require optometrists to offer laser procedures, but gives them the choice for what fits best with their practice and their patients’ needs.
“I’m not a doctor, but if I was, I would make sure that I had all the proper training that I feel that I need so that I can provide a good service, right, and safe for my patient,” he said. “I would assume that most doctors are going to do that because they don’t want to have any malpractice problems.”
Hochman-Vigil told Source NM that if the bill is enacted, New Mexico would be the 13th state to expand the scope of practice for optometrists, and that medical malpractice insurance has not gone up in those states. She added that optometrists are ethically obligated to consult with or refer patients to ophthalmologists in more complicated cases.
“This actually frees up the ophthalmologist to be able to concentrate on those more complicated cases, so that the optometrist can kind of spend more time working on just your more typical patient care,” Hochman-Vigil said. “I really feel like, especially for how common these types of procedures are, the argument that it’s unsafe [is] just not founded because these types of procedures are performed thousands of times daily and some of them usually take no more than two or three minutes.”
HB36 passed the Legislature and is waiting for Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s signature, but the academy is asking the governor to veto the bill. Jodi McGinnis-Porter, a spokesperson for the governor, told Source that “the bill will be evaluated in its entirety when it makes it up [to the governor’s office] and she has until April 11 to act on the bill.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)After missing its mandated deadline, the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) won’t waste any more time in getting an independent assessment of its operations and financial situation done and submitted to state leaders.
The agency’s board of directors voted 7-0 Thursday to award a $412,346 contract to Canadian engineering consulting firm WSP and subcontractor Foursquare of Washington D.C. to conduct an efficiency study that will help find cost-saving measures for the agency. WSP designed the recently renovated East Side Tunnel in Providence.
A copy of the contract was not immediately made available.
Rhode Island Department of Transportation Director Peter Alviti Jr., who chairs the board, was on a call at the time of the vote. Board member Marcy Reyes was not present.
The efficiency study was requested by Gov. Dan McKee and the General Assembly as a condition in last year’s state budget to plug the agency’s deficit. RIPTA now faces a $32.6 million shortfall heading into the fiscal year beginning July 1, which has gone unaddressed in McKee’s proposed budget.
The assessment was supposed to be submitted to state leaders at the beginning of March 2025, but RIPTA’s board suspended the procurement process until it could find a new leader — which wound up being former CFO Christopher Durand.
With the contract awarded, agency spokesperson Cristy Raposo Perry told Rhode Island Current would start immediately. Durand told the board he intended to provide initial efficiency details before the Senate Committee on Finance when it tentatively meets April 8 to look over RIPTA’s budget.
RIPTA’s request for proposals called for work to start April 1.
“Time is of the essence here, and we are focused,” Durand told the board.
RIPTA had issued its RFP in mid-February and drew five bidders when the window closed March 13: AECOM Technical Services of Dallas; Complex Consulting of Boston; HDR of Orange County, California; Transpro of Tampa; and WSP.
A summary form given to board members stated that WSP confirmed its ability to meet all draft deadlines outlined in the RFP before the current legislative session ends.
The scope outlined in the RFP includes delivering a memo within 30 days detailing best practices among public transit agencies, a performance assessment of transit operations within 45 days, and a review of the state’s long-term transit strategy and its implementation within 75 days.
WSP, which has an office in Providence, works on-call with RIPTA’s project management team and is the owner’s representative for the public private partnership working on the agency’s new Providence transit center.
Though a unanimous vote, board member James Lombardi expressed reservations that such a study would even matter should the state fail to plug RIPTA’s financial woes.
“We may have an entirely different operation after this budget,” he said.
The agency projects about 300 employees losing their jobs if lawmakers don’t provide any new funding. RIPTA had 849 employees as of February, according to a House Fiscal Office presentation.
But board member Normand Benoit argued that RIPTA’s financial future hinges on submitting the study to state leaders.
“I don’t think we have a choice on this thing, we need to move right away,” he said.
What’s going on with the Providence bus hub?
Time may be of the essence for RIPTA’s efficiency study, but that did not apply to an agenda item on the agency’s plans to construct a state-of-the-art transit center to replace Kennedy Plaza.
Board members were provided a report from Next Wave Partners, the contractor handling the project, recommending the agency further study two spaces near the Amtrak Station on Gaspee Street.
The first location is a 1.48 acre vacant lot abutting the station, while the other is a 4.4 acre lot on Francis Street, across from the Providence Place Mall.
Durand told the board that because the Francis Street site was not discussed publicly before, the agency wants to hold off on any vote until it can garner public feedback on the site.
But the plan has already drawn critics. 
Randall Rose, a member of the Kennedy Plaza Resilience Coalition, said it was a worse choice than the existing bus hub, citing an uphill walk from downtown Providence.
“Elderly and disabled are clearly not going to be able to do it,” Rose said. “It’s a terrible thing for our bus riders.”

At Butler, he is a lecturer on entrepreneurship and innovation at the Lacy School of Business.
During a community forum as part of the search, he was asked why he wanted to leave the private sector for higher education. 
“I’m in the fourth quarter of my life. Let’s do something that matters,” Molander said. “I love this place.” 
He said he will be an active recruiter for Dickinson State. 
“I am going to be out and visible,” Molander said during the forum. “One of the things we have is a little bit of an image problem. … The education is here.” 
Molander grew up on a farm near Stanley. He earned an associate degree from University of North Dakota-Williston, now Williston State College, in 1985, and a bachelor’s degree in business administration from Dickinson State in 1988. He played college basketball at Williston and Dickinson.
He earned a master’s in business administration from Indiana State University in 2016.  
Molander will start July 1. He has been offered a salary of $263,815, according to the University System.
Ty Orton, executive director of the Dickinson State University Heritage Foundation, has been serving as acting president.
He replaces Stephen Easton, who resigned last summer as the school’s nursing faculty resigned. 
Molander has served on the DSU Heritage Foundation Board and has earned the North Dakota Business Innovator of the Year Award.

Dickinson State was the only campus in the North Dakota University System to report a decrease in enrollment last fall. It reported 1,410 students in fall 2024 compared to 1,453 in fall 2023. 
“My focus will always be on people,” Molander said in a news release. “Teamwork is everything and together, we need to build partnerships within the community. Collaboration with our University System institutions is key.”

On March 14, the U.S. Department of Education issued a new release informing 45 universities that the Office for Civil Rights had received a complaint that they were allegedly discriminating against graduate students based on race or ethnicity for their past affiliations with the PhD Project.
The New Jersey-based nonprofit PhD Project supports Black, Hispanic and Native American students pursuing business PhD programs, and provides peer support as they become professors, according to its website.
PBS reported that letters sent to other higher education institutions instated a March 31 deadline for universities to submit information about their relationship to the nonprofit.
However, UNM’s Chief Marketing and Communications Officer Cinnamon Blair told Source NM she had not seen a copy of a letter from federal education officials.
“What I can share is that the University was notified that a complaint was filed with the Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights, related to Project PhD,” Blair said in a written statement Wednesday. “UNM prohibits unlawful discrimination and will cooperate with OCR in its review of this matter.”
Blair told Source NM the UNM administration is “still determining the extent of its relationship with the PhD Project,” in a phone call Thursday.
Blair also said she could not make anyone who had read the letter available for an interview as the university would not comment on an open investigation before issuing its formal response.
A spokesperson for the PhD Project did not respond to questions regarding the organization’s relationship with UNM, but issued the following statement on behalf of the nonprofit.


Higher Ed Diversity by the numbers:
While college student populations have become increasingly diverse in the past 20 years — especially Hispanic and Latino students, who doubled their share of admissions to approximately 21.2% of the population, according to a 2024 report from the higher-ed think tank American Council on Education. However, enrollment of white students (40.6%) and Asian students (61.6%) remain “far above” other racial and ethnic groups.
Higher education faculty are less diverse than student bodies. The latest federal data from 2022 reports that 72% of all faculty at post-secondary institutions are white; 13% Asian; 7% Black; 6% Hispanic; 1% are more than one race; and the remaining 1% split between American Indian/Alaskan Native and Pacific Islanders.


“For the last 30 years, The PhD Project has worked to expand the pool of workplace talent by developing business school faculty who inspire, mentor, and support tomorrow’s leaders. Our vision is to create a broader talent pipeline of current and future business leaders who are committed to excellence and to each other, through networking, mentorship, and unique events.”
The statement concluded: “This year, we have opened our membership application to anyone who shares that vision. The PhD Project was founded with the goal of providing more role models in the front of business classrooms, which remains our goal today.”
Source NM has filed public information requests at both the federal and state level for the complaint against UNM, as well as for the letter informing UNM of the complaint.
The complaint comes amid a period of uncertainty for higher education as President Donald Trump and other Republicans move to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education fully, while also threatening to pull universities’ funding for continuing programs to increase diversity, equity and inclusion. The Department of Education touches nearly every level of education in the U.S., from issuing grant funds to lower-income schools, to administering loans, grants and work-study funds for college attendees.
The investigation also follows a  “Dear Colleague” letter from federal education officials stating that universities must “cease using race preferences and stereotypes as a factor in their admissions, hiring, promotion, compensation, scholarships, prizes, administrative support, sanctions, discipline, and other programs and activities” or face the loss of federal funding. An FAQ on that letter from the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights includes — as its first FAQ — information on where to file discrimination complaints.
Earlier this month, President Garnett Stokes, in a weekly newsletter to students, said the university will continue to “monitor and review” UNM’s policies and provide updates on the President’s webpage.
“To avoid amplifying uncertainty or disrupting our work unnecessarily, we have established a general response philosophy that we will only respond to specific and actionable federal requirements or actions, says a statement posted to website. “We will avoid making rapid changes to university policies and programs where not clearly warranted.”

Ronnie Cromer, R-Prosperity, speaks on the Senate floor Tuesday, March 18, 2025, about his proposal that would double car insurance minimums. (Screenshot courtesy of SCETV)COLUMBIA — South Carolina drivers who pay as little as possible for their auto insurance would need to double their coverage under legislation passed Thursday by the Senate.
State-required insurance minimums set 18 years ago simply aren’t enough to cover any serious accident, which shifts the costs to the people who aren’t at fault, senators said.
A proposal to double those bare minimums got wrapped into the Senate’s broad bill overhauling the rules on personal injury lawsuits and insurance. The suggestion by Sen. Ronnie Cromer quickly gained bipartisan support, offering a moment of easy consensus as debate on the larger package dragged out over four weeks.
“If somebody were to hit your car and total it, hopefully they would have enough to pay for it,” the Newberry County Republican told senators. But the minimums won’t even cover the car, much less pay the bills “if you had to go to the hospital.”
State law requires drivers to have insurance policies that pay for property damages and injuries in wrecks they cause. Since 2007, drivers have been able to have policies that pay no more than $25,000 for property damage, $25,000 for medical expenses if a single person is hurt, and $50,000 total for injuries no matter how many people are in the vehicles.
“We have long needed to increase it,” said Sen. Margie Bright Matthews, D-Walterboro. (Despite her support of that particular piece, she ultimately voted against the entire bill.)
Unlike many of his colleagues at odds with each other over the bill, Cromer is not a lawyer or an insurer. He’s a pharmacist. But he realized a change was needed, he said, after a driver with minimum coverage rear-ended a friend’s new Corvette, which had less than 8,000 miles on it.
“You’re not going to fix a Corvette rear end for $25,000,” he told the SC Daily Gazette on Thursday.
The bill would double the liability minimums to $50,000 and $100,000, though not immediately. The new minimums would take effect two years after the bill becomes law.
That would “give insurance companies time to prepare,” as well as “allow those who have minimum limits to start getting ready for a much higher limit,” said Sen. Mike Johnson, R-Tega Cay, who was instrumental in the Senate reaching a compromise on the larger bill.
It’s unclear how many drivers in South Carolina have policies that only pay the minimums. The state Department of Insurance doesn’t keep those numbers, a spokesperson said.
What is clear is that “people who insist on just buying the minimum amount” will have to pay more, said Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey, R-Edgefield.
However, he added, “there’s protection for them as well by making this change,” since it means they’re better covered in case someone hits them.
The change would align South Carolina’s minimums with North Carolina, after coverage minimums rise in that state July 1. Georgia’s minimums are the same as South Carolina’s.
Since everything costs more, it’s a “wise” move to reset the baseline, said Sen. Tom Fernandez, R-Summerville.
Chris Oxford, an agent at North Charleston-based Pinckney-Carter Insurance, said he won’t write auto insurance policies at the existing minimums. It’s just his own personal rule, he said, since the payouts likely won’t cover damages, even if the wreck is little more than a fender bender.
“You run into the back of a Tesla or the back of a Mercedes … that’s more than $25,000,” Oxford said.
His insurance plans just happen to start at the proposed new numbers.
While Oxford couldn’t guess what percentage of drivers carry the minimum coverage, whatever the number is, he said, is too much. Television ads enticing people to not pay as little as possible is part of the problem, he added.
“You watch TV, and it says, ‘You only pay for what you need,'” he said. However, customers need more coverage than they realize, he said.
When the driver at fault doesn’t have enough coverage to pay damages, then the other driver’s insurance can pay for repairs if that policy covers for “underinsured motorists.” But filing a claim to be fully recouped will likely lead to a premium hike for the driver who wasn’t to blame.
The percentage of claims in South Carolina paid through “underinsured” coverage has risen rapidly in recent years, according to data from the Pennsylvania-based Insurance Research Council.
In 2018, the coverage accounted for 12.8% of all claims for auto wrecks in the Palmetto State. By the end of 2023, it accounted for 21.5%, or 3.5 percentage points above the national rate, according to the council.
“It does cost more to repair cars and people than it did yesterday and the day before,” said Dale Porfilio, president of the nonprofit research group.
But many drivers don’t realize why they need “underinsured” coverage. While state law requires insurers to offer it, drivers aren’t required to buy it.
Massey said the debate could be a public service announcement of sorts.
For anyone paying attention to the Senate livestream, he said, “You should have underinsured motorist coverage.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-35-1024x576.png,,,2025-03-27 19:03:22.324661

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)FRANKFORT — Kentucky’s Republican-controlled legislature voted largely along party lines to override Gov. Andy Beshear’s veto of a bill to cancel his restrictions on conversion therapy and prohibit Medicaid from covering transgender-affirming medical care. 
That means House Bill 495 will become law. It has an emergency clause, meaning that will happen immediately. 
In a statement after both chambers overrode the veto, Chris Hartman, the executive director of the  Fairness Campaign, called it a “a sad day in Kentucky.” 
“HB 495 opens the door to ‘conversion torture’ and denies Medicaid coverage for transgender healthcare,” Hartman said. 
Conversion therapy is a discredited practice that attempts to alter gender expression and sexual attraction that diverges from heterosexual normativity “with the specific aim to promote heterosexuality as a preferable outcome,” according to the The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.” 
In 2024, Beshear signed an executive order aimed at ending the practice on Kentucky minors. 
“Conversion therapy has no basis in medicine or science and causes significant long term damage to our kids, including increased rates of suicide, anxiety and depression,” he wrote in his veto message on HB 495. “As leaders and policy makers, we should be in the business of protecting our citizens and kids from harm, not subjecting them to discredited methods that jeopardize their health, well being and safety.” 
Beshear’s veto message did not mention the bill’s ban on Medicaid covering gender-affirming medical care. 
House debate
Early Wednesday afternoon, the House voted to override the veto 78-20 along party lines. 
Democrats reiterated many of their previous objections, saying the bill was an “overreach” and “oppression.” 
“I am here to stand in the gap between our trans friends, neighbors and constituents and the oppression that this body is inflicting on them,” said Rep. Lisa Willner, D-Louisville. “This is going to be one of those times when we look back in history and say, ‘was I on the right side of history?’” 
Rep. Mary Lou Marzian, D-Louisville, appeared to invoke a Lady Gaga song when she said, “you’re born this way” to LGBTQ+ Kentuckians while asking her colleagues to let Beshear’s veto stand. 
Marzian said she hopes lawmakers don’t “go after” another minority population next year “to make us feel good about ourselves. I hope it’s not the disabled or mentally ill that we decide are less than us,” she said. 
Rep. Joshua Watkins, D-Louisville, said he’s heard from constituents who are “scared and terrified” of the legislation. 
Rep. Ken Fleming, R-Louisville, said that no matter where anyone stands on conversion therapy, Beshear “overreached” his powers by issuing an executive order on the matter. 
Senate debate 
A few hours later, the Senate voted 31-6 to override the veto. Sen. Robin Webb, D-Grayson, sided with Republicans in voting to go against Beshear. 
Sen. Karen Berg, D-Louisville, said it is “absolutely appalling that we can sit here over and over and over again and legislate against a small, small group of people in this country that, by the way, do exist and do have every right to exist.” 
“We know that kids who were forced to go through conversion therapy are twice as likely to attempt suicide,” Berg said. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 988. 
“Why in the heck do we do this over and over and over again? Get over your hate,” Berg said. “Let people live their lives the way they choose to.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_0926-1024x772.jpg,,,2025-03-27 19:03:22.324661

(Photo by Jared Strong/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird filed a lawsuit Thursday against Winneshiek County and its sheriff, Dan Marx, for allegedly violating Iowa law by discouraging law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration officials.
The lawsuit, filed in Polk County District Court, claims that Iowa law “requires stripping Winneshiek County of state funding until the sheriff follows the procedure to reinstate the funds” by disavowing his previous public statements on immigration enforcement.
The lawsuit acknowledges that Sheriff Marx “has complied with every Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainer request made of his office since Nov. 26, 2018.”

In a Feb. 4, 2025, Facebook post, Winneshiek County Sheriff Dan Marx, a Republican, stated that if his office received “detainer” requests to hold suspected illegal immigrants, and those requests were not vetted and approved by the courts, they would be rejected by his office.
In his post, Marx distinguished between detainer requests of that kind and what he called “valid” judicial warrants and court orders. He wrote that “the only reason detainers are issued is because the federal agency does not have enough information or has not taken the time to obtain a valid judicial warrant.”
Bird claims that assertion by Marx is false.
Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican like Bird, had sent the attorney general’s office an official complaint seeking an investigation into the Facebook post.
In a report summarizing her investigation, Bird alleged Marx’s post violated Iowa Code Chapter 27A, which prohibits state law enforcement from discouraging public cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Bird says Marx’s Facebook post discourages such cooperation by making “false claims” and by threatening to interfere with enforcing Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainers.
According to Bird, Marx has said that his office has complied with all 21 of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainers that it has received. But on Wednesday, she said her office would take action against Marx unless he posted a statement specifically stating that his previous claims were wrong and that he disavowed them.
Bird provided Marx with specific language to include in the public statement, which she said had to conform “substantially” to the language she dictated. The statement was written in the first-person to appear over Marx’s signature.
Although Marx’s office recently deleted the January Facebook post, Marx did not publish the statement prescribed by Bird.
In a press release issued Thursday, Bird’s office said “the attorney general gave the sheriff an opportunity to fix the violation” by 5 p.m. on Wednesday by issuing the statement she provided. “He refused, even though he knows that the violation may result in a loss of state funding for his entire county,” the press release stated.
“Sheriff Marx was given the chance to retract his statement, follow the law, and honor ICE detainers, but he refused — even at a cost to his home county,” Bird stated in the press release. “He left us with no choice but to take the case to court to enforce our laws and ensure cooperation with federal immigration authorities.”
The lawsuit concedes that rather than “defying” ICE, Marx has “enforced federal and state law whenever asked” and has complied with “every single ICE detainer request made.”
Despite this, the lawsuit alleges, Marx “intentionally posted false information” through his Facebook post. “That false information had the effect of discouraging violation enforcement in violation of the law,” the lawsuit claims, adding that there has been “no public walk back, revocation, or other corrective action” taken.
The lawsuit seeks a court order declaring Winneshiek County to be ineligible to receive any state funds. The lawsuit also seeks “all other relief necessary or appropriate to remedy the effects” of the sheriff’s actions.
Marx has yet to file a response to the lawsuit. He could not be reached for comment Thursday.

Pat Proctor, pictured here March 24, 2025, was a vocal proponent Thursday of a rejected property tax relief proposal. (Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas House shot down a property tax relief plan in a game of back and forth with the Senate, which defeated the resolution on Wednesday but revived it Thursday for the House’s consideration.
House Concurrent Resolution 5011, which requires support from two-thirds of both chambers and voter approval, would cap annual increases to commercial and residential property appraisals at 4%. However, while the valuation would remain lower, mill levies would continue to increase. The resolution is estimated to give about $1 billion in state property tax cuts over five years, but critics argue that taxpayers aren’t likely to see benefits.
The House rejected the resolution in an 88-37 vote but declined a procedural move that could have sent it back to negotiations or killed it.
Under the proposal, mill levy rates wouldn’t raise as much money as they normally would, said Rep. Adam Smith, a Weskan Republican who presented the resolution on the House floor.
“For local governments, they would also be seeing that loss in valuation,” he said.
Rep. Tom Sawyer, a Wichita Democrat, said people would end up paying different rates on similar properties.
“We are taking a system that’s based on fairness, on market value, treating everybody at market value, and … creating really huge discrepancies,” Sawyer said. “We’re screwing up our system, is what it does.”
The Senate fell one vote shy of the necessary two-thirds support to pass the resolution after a debate Wednesday. On Thursday morning, Topeka Sen. Brenda Dietrich, one of the five Republicans who had joined Democrats to defeat the measure, made a motion to reconsider and flipped her vote.
Dietrich said she voted to support similar proposals dealing with property tax valuations earlier this session.
“I have heard from some of my constituents about that lack of consistency, and for me, I think that has caused me to reflect on my actions,” Dietrich said.
The Senate shipped the resolution to the House on a 27-13 vote.
Constitutional amendments require support from two-thirds of each chamber — 27 in the 40-member Senate and 84 in the 125-member House — and voter approval. If the House were to reconsider and approve the resolution, a roughly 325-word question would appear on voters’ ballots in a special election on Aug. 4, 2026.
The state’s school general fund and state building fund benefit from property taxes and would lose more than $200 million combined each year under the proposal. The school fund would lose an estimated $200 million in its first year, increasing to $260 million in the fourth year. The state building fund would lose about $19 million in its first year, increasing to about $25 million lost in its fourth year. Over five years, the estimated effect would have been more than $1 billion in lost tax revenue.
Rep. Pat Proctor, a Leavenworth Republican, called property tax “a racket” in an impassioned speech supporting the resolution. He said he never thought the day would come when he could vote to control appraisals.
“I want to pinch myself,” he said. “I think I’m dreaming.”
Proctor blamed skyrocketing property values for his community’s declining population. 
“We cannot continue to fund our government on the backs of homeowners,” Proctor said. “We’re going to break their backs.”
Proctor’s speech brought Rep. Tim Johnson, a Basehor Republican, to the front of the chamber to deliver a one-word response.
“Aaaaaaamen!” Johnson said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/3.24.251-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-03-27 18:03:42.655786

(Brett Nachtigall/Fall River County Herald-Star)Property taxes eat away larger and larger slices of 71-year-old Shirley Schumacher’s fixed income each year.
She has lived in the same 900-square-foot home in the southwestern South Dakota community of Oral since she moved there in 1999. She’s watched her annual taxes increase 641% from $129.02 to $956.40, according to the Fall River County auditor. 
Her Social Security and pension benefits can’t keep pace.
“The price of everything is going up,” Schumacher said. “Our assessed value and property taxes go up. So does our insurance.”
South Dakota offers a property tax relief program to elderly and disabled residents. But Schumacher said she was denied when she applied for the program a few years ago. Officially, she was told her income barely exceeded income eligibility, but she believes she filled the form out incorrectly.
She hopes an expansion of the program approved by the Legislature this year will make it easier for seniors like her to qualify, and allow more older South Dakotans to remain in their homes.
Governor’s property tax law includes assessment freeze expansion
The program allows South Dakotans who meet qualifications including income and home valuation limits to freeze their home’s assessed value to the year they turned 65 or the year they became disabled. Participants apply yearly to the program.
The local property tax rate is applied to a home’s assessed value, so if the value doesn’t go up, it holds the person’s property taxes in check.
The state approved 4,705 elderly and disabled property tax assessment freeze applications in 2024, according to a records request fulfilled by the state Department of Revenue. The program reduced those properties’ assessed values by a collective $333 million.
Rhoden signs property tax relief bill with eye toward another solution

There were 327 people denied for exceeding income limits, assessed value limits or for another reason, such as incorrect paperwork.
Gov. Larry Rhoden signed a bill into law this month that will expand eligibility in two ways. It will raise the limit on a home’s assessed value from $300,000 to $500,000 and increase the program’s income limit by $20,000 — from $35,000 to $55,000 for a single person, and from $45,000 to $65,000 for a multi-person household. 
Both limits will increase yearly by inflation or the annual percentage change in federal Social Security payments, whichever is greater. Eligible residents must have owned a home in South Dakota for at least five years and lived in the state for more than six months of the previous year.
The program shifts some property taxes onto other property tax payers, according to Bobi Adams, a spokeswoman with the state Department of Revenue. That impact is “minimal,” she said, though it varies for each taxing district.
The proposal to expand eligibility for assessment freezes came as part of a property tax relief package with other provisions including a 3% cap on growth in countywide owner-occupied home valuations for five years.
Schumacher rushed to print out her new application for the program before the annual April 1 deadline, hoping to qualify this time.
If her application is accepted, it would freeze her home’s assessed value to the year she turned 65, which was 2019. That would bring her home’s assessed value down from $104,700 to $58,070, according to the Fall River County Equalization Office.
According to information from the county auditor, Schumacher would save $394.38 on her taxes this year through the program.

“That money back would give me just a little bit more flexibility to meet basic needs,” Schumacher said. “This is just subsistence right now.”
Schumacher said she canceled her online subscriptions years ago because she could no longer afford them, started raising rabbits for food because she can’t afford beef, and canceled her garbage pickup. She brings her trash to a friend for collection and burns her paper garbage.
Demand for targeted relief grows statewide
A 2024 AARP survey found that 75% of adults aged 50 and older prefer to stay in their homes as they age. Aging in place allows older people to maintain independence for as long as possible, stay in familiar surroundings, maintain relationships with friends, family and neighbors, and reduce the costs of long-term care.
Participants in South Dakota’s assessment freeze program can continue to use it when their valuations increase beyond the new $500,000 limit, if they’ve received assessment freezes before.
According to data from the state Department of Revenue, assessment freeze applications in Minnehaha County nearly doubled from 427 in 2021 to 849 in 2024. Statewide, applications grew by 1,485 during the same timeframe.
Auditors across the state said they’ve been raising awareness about the program in recent years, though the program is still underutilized in some areas.
Although fewer than 5,000 households are enrolled in the freeze program statewide, about 23,000 households are eligible, according to the Governor’s Office. An estimated 11,000 additional households will be eligible under the expansion.
There were no approved applicants in 2024 in Buffalo, Oglala Lakota or Ziebach counties. Only one or two applicants were approved in Corson, Jones and Mellette counties.
Older people have visited Minnehaha County Treasurer Kris Swanson’s office “shaken” by property tax increases in recent years, as home valuations increased in the Sioux Falls area.
Swanson helps them fill out applications, even if it’s unlikely they’re eligible for the program.
“As an older person, if I had to leave my home because I can’t afford to pay my taxes, I think that’d be heartbreaking,” Swanson said. “You leave something you’ve always known and worked so hard for in your life and you’re forced out. I don’t like that.”
Some cities offer expanded relief
If Schumacher lived in Sioux Falls or Rapid City, she’d also be eligible for a property tax refund program through the city.
Sioux Falls refunds residents up to an additional $500 if they participate in the state assessment freeze program, and Rapid City offers a similar program. The South Dakota Municipal League isn’t aware of any other municipal property tax refund programs in the state.
Sioux Falls started its program in 2022, renewing it each year as part of the city’s budget, said Shawn Pritchett, the city’s director of finance, innovation and technology. Nearly 675 households participated in the program in 2024, costing the city $232,000 to provide an average refund of $345.

Here a train is seen at the Olympia-Lacey station in 2022. (Photo by Tom Banse)The years-long process to restore regional intercity rail service and build up train ridership in western Washington and Oregon was dealt a major setback this week when Amtrak suddenly withdrew dozens of train cars from service for emergency repairs. 
It means the state-supported Amtrak Cascades service is, for now, left with just one working train.
On its website, Amtrak said substitute bus service will be offered to passengers booked on cancelled trains “until further notice.” 
Corrosion discovered on Amtrak’s aging Horizon-class railcars caused the trouble. The rail company immediately removed all 70 of its Horizon train cars from the fleet nationwide, including 26 used on the Amtrak Cascades line.
“Amtrak is determining how to replace the grounded Horizon trains by redistributing other trains in its national fleet,” said Washington State Department of Transportation rail division spokesperson Janet Matkin via email Wednesday. “Amtrak will notify the states of Washington and Oregon as soon as a plan is in place to move replacement trains to the Pacific Northwest.”
Matkin deferred to Amtrak to provide further details. An Amtrak spokesperson was unable to fit in an interview on Thursday.
“My guess is that it’s going to take robbing other services to come up with cars,” said rail consultant Thomas White by phone from Mountlake Terrace, Washington. “It’s not going to be easy.”
“To me, this is really disappointing,” White added, since this happened against a backdrop of rising ridership on Amtrak Cascades despite its poor on-time performance.
“Now if we wind up doing without trains for a year or more, we’re going to have to start over from scratch on ridership,” White said. “It’s kind of a habit thing.”
In 2024, nearly one million passengers boarded the state-supported trains between Eugene and Vancouver, British Columbia. That surpassed the pre-pandemic high of 829,000 riders in 2019. White is active in several groups that advocate for improvements to the regional rail service, including the Climate Rail Alliance and Rail Can’t Wait Campaign.
Spare passenger rail cars were already in short supply before Amtrak sidelined its Horizon fleet at midweek. Amtrak told WSDOT last year that it was unlikely to be able to supply additional carriages for the 2026 World Cup because of a nationwide equipment shortage. 
The one remaining non-Horizon Amtrak Cascades train is now scheduled to make one daily southbound run from Seattle to Eugene during mornings (train #503) and return north to Seattle in the afternoon and evening (train #508). There is no rail service for the time being between Seattle and Vancouver, British Columbia, which used to have two daily round trips.
Amtrak’s long-distance trains in the Northwest, the Coast Starlight and Empire Builder, are not affected. The Coast Starlight makes the same stops as the regional Cascades service on its once-daily departure between Seattle and Northern California, but this run is frequently delayed by freight trains that share the mainline.
New rail cars ordered, but not due before next year
The Amtrak Cascades line has new trains on order from manufacturer Siemens in California, but the first deliveries are not scheduled before spring 2026. The train car order is part of a larger transformation of the Amtrak fleet funded through the bipartisan infrastructure package passed by Congress in 2021. Amtrak Cascades is slated to get eight of the next-generation “Airo” class trainsets, along with two additional new locomotives.

The Amtrak Cascades line was already down one trainset before this week due to a scary accident last November. An Amtrak-operated train owned by Oregon DOT hit a fallen tree north of Seattle on a stormy night. The stout tree impaled the cab where the engineer was driving, but he miraculously survived. The badly damaged, integrated Talgo Series 8 trainset remains on a maintenance siding in Seattle awaiting repairs.
The Horizon train cars were manufactured more than 35 years ago by Bombardier Transportation at a now-closed factory in Vermont. They have an aluminum body bolted to a steel undercarriage. Unhappy rail fans active in the Amtrak Cascades Facebook group said that corrosion was a foreseeable risk for the Horizon cars due to electrolysis where the aluminum comes in contact with steel. 
Even before this latest setback, passenger rail advocates were trying to light a fire under the Washington Legislature and WSDOT to aim higher with the regional Amtrak Cascades service. A bipartisan legislative bill to set ambitious goals for service upgrades and reliability passed the state House earlier this month on a 68 to 29 vote.
House Bill 1837 directs WSDOT, in partnership with Oregon, Canada and BNSF Railway, to set a goal to shave about an hour off the current scheduled trip times between Seattle and Portland as well as Seattle and Vancouver. The bill also sets a target for Amtrak Cascades to provide a minimum of 14 round trips per day between Seattle and Portland and a minimum of five round trips per day between Seattle and Vancouver by 2035.
The Legislature did not provide additional funding to achieve the new targets in the policy bill. A BNSF lobbyist cautioned lawmakers last month that speeding up Amtrak trains above 90 mph would be incompatible with the slower freight trains that share the rails. The bill says that if WSDOT determines a service improvement goal is unlikely to be achieved, it must report on what the constraints are and how to fix them.
The priority-setting measure is now pending in the state Senate, where the Transportation Committee will give it a hearing next Tuesday.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Olympia-Lacey-Amtrak-Cascades-arrival-1024x665.jpg,,,2025-03-27 18:03:42.655786

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source New Mexico)The fired CEO of the New Mexico office tasked with investigating police misconduct told Source NM this week he won’t challenge his termination.
The Law Enforcement Certification Board fired Joshua Calder on March 20, less than a year into his tenure as its first CEO and less than one month after New Mexico Department of Public Safety Secretary Jason Bowie urged the board to do so following Calder’s accusation of DPS interference in police misconduct investigations.
In an interview with Source NM on Wednesday, Calder said while he believes an appeals process exists for his termination, “I’m not planning on moving forward with an appeal.”
The Santa Fe New Mexican reported that Board Member Joseph Walsh, in moving to terminate Calder following a closed-door meeting, alleged that he had failed “to keep the board apprised of lobbying and other legislative efforts affecting board operations.”
Walsh has not responded to an email seeking clarification about those lobbying and legislative efforts.
Calder told Source he and LECB Operations Officer Laura Escarcida met with Walsh in person to discuss Senate Bill 50, which would have made a series of reforms to New Mexico police training and clarified the relationship between the board and DPS.
SB50 would have explicitly given the CEO and their staff the ability to “function with complete independence of the department of public safety,” with their “own budget and budget authority.”
Calder said he learned about SB50 from co-drafter Rachel Feldman, the appointed citizen-at-large of the Law Enforcement Standards and Training Council and the chair of SOS Santa Fe’s Civil Rights & Law Enforcement Reform Committee.
“I don’t know of, other than that, any other legislative items that would have affected the Law Enforcement Certification Board,” Calder said.
SB50 sponsor Sen. Antonio Maestas (D-Albuquerque) previously said the relationship between the cabinet-level state agency and the independent police misconduct board has been the subject of “confusion” due to the department’s failure to complete tasks necessary for an “administratively attached” agency.
Calder told Source NM that DPS never took the steps for the LECB to have its own budget, email system and hiring practices.
“This was all supposed to be taken care of before I took the CEO position. That was supposed to be handled by DPS, that did not occur,” he said.
Lawmakers tabled the legislation on Feb. 28, after opposition from Bowie, the New Mexico State Police and the New Mexico Police Chiefs Association.
The same day, the Police Chiefs Association issued a no-confidence vote against Calder and accused him of “weaponizing” state law against Bowie, according to the Albuquerque Journal.
Calder said he doesn’t know how LECB moves forward without a CEO.
“The challenges that this person is going to face are going to be difficult,” he said. “Unless they have somebody in mind already that’s going to do what DPS is recommending or wants to do, then it would still be under the control of DPS, as it had been in the past, prior to the legislation that separated it.”

(Florida A&M University hemp pilot project report to Florida Senate Agriculture Committee)New regulations on hemp-derived THC products in Florida have passed unanimously in the Senate Fiscal Policy Committee, and now go to the full Senate for consideration.
This is Polk County Republican Sen. Colleen Burton’s third attempt in three years to tighten rules around what has become a billion-dollar industry since the plant was legalized for sale in Florida in 2019.
  State Sen. Colleen Burton via Florida Senate
Her 2023 bill was ultimately watered down to essentially banning hemp-derived products from being sold to anyone under 21, and adopting rules ensuring they were not marketed to be attractive to children. The 2024 version, passed in the Senate but only narrowly in the House, imposed strict strict limits on THC levels in hemp products and a complete ban on the sale of delta-8 THC — but it was vetoed by Gov. Ron DeSantis.
This years’s bill (SB 438) is similar to last year’s — with more restrictions. It would forbid any amount of synthetic cannabinoids, including Delta-8. The amount of Delta-9 hemp-derived products couldn’t be more than five milligrams per serving or 50 milligrams per container.
It limits the amount of THC in hemp-infused drinks to just five milligrams per container. Such drinks could only be sold through a retailer with a liquor license — a provision strongly supported by lobbyists representing the beer and wine industry.
“This bill to me takes an appropriate stance, if you will, on the regulation of products that are sold in Florida,” Burton said. “It still allows hemp-infused products to be sold, but it regulates them.”
The bill would ban any business from selling hemp products within 500 feet of a school or a daycare facility. If enacted, businesses would not be able to advertise the availability of such products in a manner visible to the public from any street, sidewalk, park, or other public place.
Veto
DeSantis was heavily pressured by the hemp industry last year to veto Burton’s bill. In his statement announcing that veto, he complained the measure would “impose debilitating regulatory burdens on small businesses.”
Later, multiple news stories reported that the hemp industry helped him financially work to defeat Amendment 3, the proposed constitutional amendment that would have legalized recreational cannabis in the state for adults 21 and older.
That perceived quid pro quo was noted at Thursday’s committee hearing by Alex Petrick, owner of Florida Hemp Distribution.
“If the exact same bill passed this year again, and it makes it back to DeSantis’ desk, will he stand by his word and veto it again because it is a ‘regulatory hurdle?'” he asked. “Or do we think he’ll pass it this time because Amendment 3 is not on the ballot.”
Jessica Spencer, who served as director of advocacy for the Vote No on 3 campaign last year, pointed to a proliferation of gas stations and smoke shops advertising “THC” and “No medical marijuana card needed” in their storefronts.
“This unregulated, non-FDA-approved intoxicating THC products that are synthesized from hemp and are easily accessed at our gas stations and convenience stores, are in fact endangering children and families,” she said.
Déjà vu
Manatee County Republican Jim Boyd acknowledged a sense of déjà vu. “Here we go again, but here we go again for the right reasons,” he said. “This was a good bill last year. I believe it’s a good bill this year.”
The measure passed out of the Senate Fiscal Committee unanimously — no surprise, since every senator supported Burton’s bill last year on the floor. The question now is when does the House start moving its version (HB 1597), sponsored by St. Lucie County Republican Dana Trabulsky.
House Speaker Danny Perez certainly takes the issue seriously. He convened a special workgroup that spent three days researching the hemp industry in Florida during the first week of the legislative session earlier this month.
Trabulsky’s bill was sent to four House committees, none of which have scheduled a hearing for it yet. There are still five weeks left in the 60-day session.

(Daniella Heminghaus for New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey’s six-day grace period for vote-by-mail ballots that reach election officials after polls close on Election Day could soon come under scrutiny amid Republican-led efforts to block such ballots from being counted.
President Donald Trump issued an executive order Tuesday directing U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to take “all necessary action” against states that allow mail ballots received after Election Day to be tallied, regardless of whether those ballots were postmarked on or before Election Day.
The order received a strong rebuke from New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin, a Democrat who has filed numerous legal actions against the Trump administration.

“This is the most serious attempt to disenfranchise voters from any President in modern American history,” Platkin said in a statement to the New Jersey Monitor.
Under New Jersey law, election officials are required to count mail ballots in the six days after polls close as long as they are postmarked on or before Election Day, and they must count mail ballots with no postmark received within 48 hours of polls closing.
Trump’s new order directs the U.S. Election Assistance Commission to freeze aid to election officials in states that allow them to count some mail ballots received after polls close. It also seeks to require proof of citizenship on voter registration forms and allow federal access, including by the new U.S. Department of Government Efficiency, to state voter rolls.
“This blatantly unlawful order attacks states’ rights to set elections laws and undermines the most fundamental right we have as citizens — the right to vote. We stand ready to protect New Jersey voters from this egregious and illegal action,” Platkin said.
It’s not clear whether the order will withstand legal scrutiny. The U.S. Constitution’s elections clause affords states broad authority to regulate the “times, places, and manners” of their congressional elections but allows Congress to alter those regulations.
The American Civil Liberties Union has already pledged to file suit over the order.
“We deserve better than elected officials weaponizing xenophobia and the myth of voter fraud to jeopardize our rights,” said Sophia Lin Lakin, director of the group’s voting rights project. “We will do everything in our power to stop this unconstitutional attack on the right to vote to ensure that every eligible American can participate in our democracy.”
Spokespeople for Gov. Phil Murphy deferred comment to the offices of the attorney general and Secretary of State Tahesha Way, who is lieutenant governor. Way’s office did not return a request for comment.
Trump’s order characterizes late-arriving mail-in ballots as “illegal dilution.”
“Free, fair, and honest elections unmarred by fraud, errors, or suspicion are fundamental to maintaining our constitutional Republic,” it reads.
New Jersey’s voting grace period could face attacks from different sources. Similar laws in other states have been the focus of legal assaults in recent months, and at least one ruling has signaled the courts could imperil the counting of late-arriving mail ballots.
In response to a suit lodged by the Republican National Committee, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals — a conservative federal appeals court that covers Mississippi, Texas, and Louisiana — in October ruled Mississippi’s five-day grace period is preempted by federal law. The court declined to reconsider that decision last week.
Meanwhile, conservative legal group Judicial Watch earlier this month challenged California’s seven-day grace period on behalf of Rep. Darrell Issa (R-California).
Those challenges turn on federal law that sets the date of congressional elections to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November in even-numbered years, arguing it makes ballots received later than that day uncountable.
Compared to some of the other 17 states with laws that allow for the counting of late-arriving mail ballots, relatively few mail ballots reach election officials during New Jersey’s six-day grace period.
Camden County counted 4,628 mail ballots received after Election Day 2024, according to state data. That’s about 5.3% of all mail ballots cast there that year and only 1.8% of total turnout in the county.
Statewide, mail-in ballots accounted for nearly 20% of votes cast in last year’s general election.

March 25, 2025. Michigan House photo.After Detroit-area pastor Lorenzo Sewell, an advocate of President Donald Trump, testified this week in the newly renamed Michigan House Election Integrity Committee, Republican and Democratic members of the committee are at odds on their respective visions of fair elections.
While Republicans regarded the testimony of Sewell and Detroit-area activist Ramon Jackson, who alleged without proof mass fraud in recent presidential elections, as an important look at Michigan’s election systems, Democrats decried the day as nothing more than a “circus”.
Sewell, the pastor of 180 Church in Detroit, who delivered the benediction at Trump’s second inaugural in January and gained national attention for his impassioned speech, was a key surrogate in 2024 for Trump’s campaign to win over voters in Detroit, a historically Democratic voting block. And though support for Trump increased in Detroit in 2024 compared to his 2016 run, Sewell told lawmakers the people of Detroit are being misrepresented in elections due to “cheating” and he and Jackson are looking to change that.
“Just like Detroit has moved the world through music with Motown, just like Detroit has moved the world through the automotive industry, so it is Detroit is about to move the world with fair elections, because if we don’t have fair elections, we do not have a democracy. We don’t have fair elections, we’re like China. We have literally become what we hate if we don’t have fair elections,” Sewell said.

Sewell introduced Jackson as the “political minister” of 180 Church, which hosted Trump for a campaign visit in June. Jackson told lawmakers on the committee that he had evidence of individuals who say they didn’t vote or have since left the city but their vote was counted in Detroit.
And the search for “poison” in Michigan’s Qualified Voter file isn’t over, Jackson said, and members of the church will continue to seek out examples of fraud.
During the hearing, Rep. Matt Koleszar (D-Plymouth) asked Jackson for details on the allegations he was making.
“You had mentioned that you knew that a lot of these alleged illegal votes were going to Democratic candidates saying they voted straight ticket Democratic Party,” Koleszar said. “Sir, voting is secret ballot, so how could you possibly know that?”
“I know that based on who won. A cheated vote won’t go to a loser,” replied Jackson.
Committee Chair Rep. Rachelle Smit (R-Martin) thanked the pair for testifying and for investigating the issue of reported fraud in Detroit.
“These reports and claims are very concerning, especially since we are repeatedly told that our elections are completely safe and secure,” Smit said in a statement after the committee hearing. “If these claims are accurate, and the scale and scope are this bad, then Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Attorney General Dana Nessel clearly aren’t doing their jobs, and they’re failing the people of Michigan.”
But it’s Republican leadership that is failing the people of Michigan, Koleszar said in his own statement after the committee. Koleszar and other Democrats have condemned actions taken by the House’s election committee, which has been given an “integrity” focus, by new GOP leadership who have repeated Trump’s disproven claims that he was cheated out of victory in the 2020 election.
“In the last few weeks, the House Elections Integrity Committee has devolved into a three-ring circus,” Deputy Secretary of State Aghogho Edevbie said following Tuesday’s hearing. “Today, Chair Smit decided to ignore verified information from the qualified voter file and over 250 bipartisan audits to once again relitigate the 2020 presidential election. Her continued attempts to defile Michigan voters demonstrates a stunning and profound lack of seriousness.”
Currently, House Republicans are pursuing an amendment to the state constitution that would require proof of citizenship to vote in Michigan, which several Democrats have criticized as being akin to a poll tax while potentially keeping women who’ve changed their last name after getting married from being able to vote.
“It is disheartening to see the Republican leaders of the Election Integrity Committee continue to platform election deniers and prioritize their own political agenda over working on legislation that could make a real positive impact on Michiganders’ lives,” Koleszar said in the statement. “They are wasting taxpayer dollars by creating a circus of election disinformation, rather than governing responsibly. It’s time to stop rehashing the past and stop misusing government time.”

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – The Oklahoma Senate on Thursday advanced a bill that could imprison protesters who interrupt a religious service. 
Critics said the prohibition, which extends to one mile of the religious service, violates free speech rights.
Senate Bill 743 makes it a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $500 and or one year in prison to willfully disturb a worship service within one mile of a church.
A second offense would be a felony and carry a fine of $1,000 and or two years in prison.
It would apply to those who protest or  demonstrate without a license by the proper authority.
Sen. Todd Gollihare, R-Kellyville, said the protest would have to be directed at the worship facility. He is the author of Senate Bill 743.
The nation’s Founding Fathers and Pilgrims crossed oceans to get here so they could worship without prosecution and do so in peace and tranquility, Gollihare said.
He said the measure strengthens existing law.
Sen. Mark Mann, D-Oklahoma City, said the bill seeks to stop disruptive, threatening behavior around houses of worship. It does not apply to peaceful protests, he said.
But Sen. Dusty Deevers, R-Elgin, said he’s  concerned that it would impact those protesting or sharing the Gospel outside Planned Parenthood clinics located within a mile of a church.
Deevers said he remembered when the Kansas-based Westboro Baptist Church tried to picket at his church.
“We asked them to move to a public easement and would not suppress their First Amendment rights,” Deevers said.
The Westboro Baptist Church, which has been designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, has held controversial protests across the country, including at the funerals of deceased military personnel.
Deevers said the bill is a violation of the First Amendment right to free speech.
Sen. Shane Jett, R-Shawnee, said the bill gives the government a tool to erode or diminish the right to free speech, to assemble and to protest.
“I don’t like anyone disrupting a church, a mosque or a synagogue for any reason,” Jett said. “It is inappropriate. I may not like what people have to say, but they have a right to say what they want.”
The bill passed by a vote of 43-4 and is available for consideration in the House.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderA sequel to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp’s push to overhaul Georgia’s civil litigation system has passed the House in a 98-69 vote, bringing the governor’s top legislative priority closer to fruition.
Unlike its far-reaching counterpart, Senate Bill 69 focuses solely on promoting greater transparency into third-party groups that finance civil suits, which supporters argue could give both judges and juries a clearer sense of what forces might be influencing a case before deciding whether to award damages.
The bill was amended in the House Subcommittee of Rules on Lawsuit Reform to include a new section allowing the Department of Banking and Finance to deny litigation financing registrations and outlining an appeals process for organizations that have been denied. It also clarifies prior language defining foreign adversaries and requires additional disclosures for any stakeholders who own 10% or more of a company financing litigation.
Because of the additional provisions added on the House side, SB 69 will need to return to the Senate for another vote to reconcile changes before it can advance to the governor’s desk, but is not expected to encounter any additional hurdles. The bill has enjoyed more bipartisan support than Senate Bill 68, passing unanimously during its first vote in the Senate. 
The use of third-party lawsuit funding is a multibillion dollar industry, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. It works by allowing hedge funds and other investment groups to finance lawsuits in exchange for a portion of anticipated damages awarded to the plaintiffs. Supporters of the practice, which is sometimes referred to as champerty, argue that it can expand access for plaintiffs, who may be struggling financially in the wake of an accident that leaves them unable to work or results in hefty medical bills. 
However, critics say that it allows private equity groups to exert influence over trials, which could prolong costly litigation expenses, and may give foreign actors access to sensitive information they would not otherwise be able to obtain. Georgia law doesn’t currently require plaintiffs to disclose the use of outside funding. 
“Currently there are no provisions whatsoever that outline regulations on litigation financing,” said House Majority Caucus Whip James Burchett, a Waycross Republican who sponsored the bill in the House. “What this bill seeks to do is put some guard rails and regulation on the industry.”
Efforts to require greater transparency for third-party lawsuit financing have become increasingly popular in state legislatures across the country in recent years, with Indiana, Louisiana and West Virginia all passing new restrictions against the practice in 2024. Georgia lawmakers also said the legislation will help safeguard business innovation to support growth in the state’s economy.
“We have to be thinking of different ways to get more innovation into our economy and our industries,” said Rep. Todd Jones, a South Forsyth Republican who chairs the House Technology & Infrastructure Innovation Committee. “One of the ways that we protect innovation is to ensure that bad actors don’t capture trade secrets, patents and other intellectual property through bad actors and the litigation process.”
As with the first part of Kemp’s tort overhaul legislation, the majority of House Democrats opposed the bill, though Rep. Michelle Au of Johns Creek, Rep. Tangie Herring of Macon and Rep. Brian Prince of Augusta crossed party lines to vote in favor of the legislation. Rep. Charlice Byrd of Woodstock was the sole Republican “no” vote.
Minority Caucus Chair Tanya Miller, an Atlanta Democrat who served on the House Subcommittee of Rules on Lawsuit Reform where the bill was heard, condemned SB 69’s passage, calling Kemp’s push to overhaul Georgia’s civil courts a “manufactured crisis.”
“Like so many Republican-backed bills, it attempts to solve a problem that simply doesn’t exist,” she said of SB 69. “In committee, not a single case in Georgia was identified to justify this legislation. That’s because the need for this bill was never grounded in facts—it’s part of a broader propaganda playbook designed to protect big business and the insurance industry at the expense of everyday Georgians.”

Iowa farmers with unpaid grain sold to Benson Hill Holdings, Inc. prior to March 20, can file a claim for indemnity, according to the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship. 
Don McDowell, communications director for IDALS, said the department is not “immediately aware” of any affected farmers. 
The grain indemnity fund will pay farmers 90% of their loss, up to $300,000, though claims related to Benson Hill must be mailed or personally delivered to IDALS’s Grain Warehouse Bureau by July 18. 
The fund was established by the Iowa Legislature in 1986 and accrues via a per-bushel fee on purchased grain and fees on licensed warehouses and grain dealers. 
According to minutes from the Iowa Grain Indemnity Fund Board, the balance of the fund as of Feb. 19 was $8.4 million.

Benson Hill filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy March 20 and has up to $11 million in debtor-in-possession financing to continue its day-to-day operations. 
Christi Dixon, a spokesperson for the seed innovation company, said it is “restructuring” its finances. 
“We will continue to meet our contractual commitments and support key farmers without interruption,” Dixon said in an email.
Dixon said the company maintains a seed processing facility in Bondurant and employs seven people in Iowa. Benson Hill previously owned a soy processing facility in Creston, but sold the facility in February 2024 to White River Nutrition. 
McDowell said the grain license for Benson Hill included locations in Cherokee and Galva. 
Changes to the fund
In 2023, the grain indemnity fund fell below its minimum threshold, which triggered the farmer-paid fees to support the fund, after nearly 30 years without needing to fill the fund. It also triggered legislative efforts to reform the grain indemnity fund to reflect modern farming practices and pricing. 
The efforts have stalled out in the past due to disagreements on including credit-sale contracts, which are currently excluded from the fund. 
House File 508, introduced this year, would increase the fund’s minimum from from $3 million to $8 million, and its maximum from $8 million to $16 million. It would also extend protections to farmers with credit-sale contracts, but would only reimburse these contracts at 70%. 
The bill is not yet eligible for floor debate in the House and could be killed by the upcoming April 4 “funnel” deadline if it does not advance to the Senate and through committee. 
The Senate version, Senate File 608, would increase the minimum and maximum to $5 million and $12 million, respectively, and would include credit-sale contracts as transactions covered by the fund. 
SF 608 is eligible for floor debate.

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)The New Mexico Supreme Court announced Thursday its verdicts on three high-profile homicide cases, including an alleged murder-for-hire plot that the court overturned.
Victims in the other two cases were a 2-year-old child and an 86-year-old woman. The court upheld convictions of the defendants charged with murdering them. 
Read a summary below of each of the cases, according to news releases from the New Mexico Administrative Office of the Courts:
 
Cristal Cardenas
Cardenas was sentenced to life in prison, plus 24 additional years, for the murder of her ex-boyfriend, Mario Cabral. Cabral and his girlfriend, Vanessa Mora, were found shot to death in their Doña Ana County home in 2018.
A jury found Cardenas guilty of ordering a hit on Cabral and Rodriguez and helping to kill both, according to the Las Cruces Sun News. Cabral and Cardenas shared a child and were involved in a custody battle at the time, the newspaper reported.
NM Supreme Court Chief Justice: Pay court workers a living wage

But Cardenas argued in an appeal that the prosecution’s questioning about that child’s drug test, which was positive for methamphetamine, unfairly prejudiced the jury against her. The court, in a split decision, agreed that the trial court made a mistake in allowing prosecutors to go down that line of questioning.
“The evidence of defendant’s guilt, although substantial, was circumstantial,” Justice Michael E. Vigil wrote in the court’s majority opinion. “The error affected an important issue in the case — credibility.”
The court determined that nothing in Cardenas’ testimony up to that point should have opened the door for that line of questioning, especially given rules that prohibit introduction of testimony about a defendant’s character used as proof of guilt. 
In a dissent, Chief Justice David K. Thomson wrote that the drug test was admissible as “proper rebuttal evidence,” and that the trial court did not err in allowing that line of questioning.
 
Ricardo Soto
The court upheld a lower court’s ruling against a Lincoln County man convicted in the death of his 2-year-old son in 2018. 
Ricardo Soto was taking care of his son Jeremiah Nevarez during a visit away from the custody of the boy’s mother. Nevarez was rushed to a hospital after suffering a seizure, ultimately dying in an El Paso Hospital.
Prosecutors’ medical experts testified that the boy’s skull was fractured in two places, causing fatal brain swelling. Soto’s lawyers said the fractures could have resulted from an earlier playground injury.
Lawmakers, advocates lament Gov’s veto of parole reform

The appeal centered on the court’s use of statistical predictions about the cause of the boy’s injuries. The court, in ruling to uphold the conviction, provided guidance about medical testimony in cases where people are charged with intentional child abuse. 
“We therefore caution trial courts to avoid unduly restricting the testimony of medical experts, especially by precluding testimony explaining the process by which they used differential diagnosis to rule in or rule out diagnoses,” Justice Briana Zamora wrote in the court’s unanimous opinion. “It will be for the opposing party to attack the weight and sufficiency of the evidence through cross-examination and the introduction of competing expert evidence, if available.”
 
Craig Talbert Smith
The court also unanimously upheld the conviction of an Albuquerque man sentenced to life in prison plus 45 additional years for killing his 86-year-old aunt and stealing almost $100,000 from her.
Craig Talbert Smith appealed the conviction on grounds that a judge should have ordered a mistrial when a juror became ill and that his lawyer provided ineffective legal assistance. 
Smith was convicted of suffocating his aunt Josephine Ortega with plastic bags in 2017. 
The trial occurred in 2022 when protocols were in place to protect jurors and others from contracting COVID-19. A day after deliberations started, a juror reported having a fever. A judge then suspended deliberations for a week. When they resumed, two jurors said they’d been exposed to family members who tested positive for COVID-19.
It took jurors an hour to find Smith guilty when deliberations finally resumed. 
The court ruled that, despite the pandemic-related disruptions, Smith was not denied a right to a fair trial and further ruled that his lawyer provided an adequate defense despite having only three months to prepare for trial.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/20220212_165816-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-03-27 17:05:38.045221

Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer.As the value of commercial buildings collapses in the wake of the pandemic, Minnesota city leaders want state help to convert underutilized buildings into housing or better commercial uses.
Office towers that were once prime locales for blue chip tenants have been selling at massive discounts — 97% in one recent case — alarming city leaders who are forced to shift the tax burden to residents. 
There are already state and federal tax credits for the rehabilitation or conversion of historic buildings, but developers and city leaders want a bigger state tax credit — up to 30% of a project’s cost, compared to 20% for the existing historic state credit — and to apply it to more buildings.
The bill (SF768/HF467) does not require that the buildings be converted to housing to qualify for the credit. Instead, conversions qualify if they remake a commercial building for another commercial use that the building was not originally built to accommodate, or if at least half of the building has been vacant for five years, and the conversion “will return that vacant area to an income-producing, habitable condition.”
The credit — called the “credit for conversion of underutilized buildings,” or the “CUB credit” — would apply to buildings at least 15 years old.
“The CUB credit is not the silver bullet that will fix all of our cities’ challenges,” said Sen. Zaynab Mohamed, DFL-Minneapolis, the bill’s chief author. “However, without it, many adaptive reuse projects in Minnesota simply will not move forward.”
Any program that will cost the state money will have a difficult path to passage this year. The state is spending more money than it’s bringing in, meaning lawmakers will look for areas to cut more than new programs to spend on. 
Senate Taxes Committee Chair Sen. Ann Rest, DFL-New Hope, said in a hearing Thursday that the bill as written is too expensive — a Department of Revenue analysis found it would cost between $20 and $25 million per year, with no cap on payouts. Mohamed said the program could be capped based on budget targets.
Converting office buildings to apartments is complicated.
Many office towers aren’t structurally fit for housing: Some are so large that many apartments would lack windows, a dealbreaker for prospective residents. Others have exteriors made almost entirely of glass. Plumbing is often centralized — one floor may have one or two common restrooms, while apartments require many bathrooms spread across the floor. 
And while interest rates have dropped from their most recent peak in 2023, they’re still well above the rates of the 2010s and the historic lows reached during the pandemic.
Zoning rules can also present hurdles to redevelopment. Minneapolis changed its rules last year to eliminate some red tape for office-to-residential conversions, exempting developers from public hearings, extensive traffic studies and the city’s inclusionary zoning ordinance, which requires developers to either include a number of affordable housing units or pay large fees to the city.
Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey testified in support of the tax credit proposal. Commercial property values in Minneapolis have dropped by 9.5% over the past year, and the shrinking commercial tax base means an increased property tax burden on homeowners. 
Rest, a co-author of the bill, pointed out that commercial properties are taxed at a higher rate than residential properties, so conversions could reduce the tax rate on many buildings. 
Higher post-conversion property values would more than offset the lower tax rate, said Chris Sherman of Sherman Associates, a Minneapolis real estate developer that recently converted the historic Northstar Center East from offices to a mixed-use building with more than 200 apartments.

(Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)The Senate on Thursday defeated a bill 22-25 that originally sought to legalize conversion therapy.
Initially, House Bill 1430 bill would have authorized social workers to provide “a treatment plan or counseling plan that aligns with heterosexuality or the individual’s biological sex,” so long as it was freely chosen by the client.
The bill was introduced by Rep. Lori VanWinkle, R-Minot, who said people should have the right to seek treatments that affirm their religious beliefs about sexuality or gender. She previously told lawmakers that she is concerned most counseling is now LGBTQ-affirming and therefore would not be helpful for someone with anti-LGBTQ beliefs.
“To prohibit counseling that aligns with traditional or biblical viewpoints is religious discrimination,” she said.
Bathroom bill would make schools less safe, opponents, LGBTQ advocates testify

The North Dakota Board of Social Work Examiners and North Dakota Chapter of the National Association of Social Workers opposed the bill, arguing that it endorsed a form of treatment widely denounced as ineffective and unethical, and was grounded in misunderstandings about how counseling works.
Licensed social workers are already barred from providing conversion therapy under regulations set by the Board of Social Work Examiners. 
In committee hearings, multiple social workers testified that they don’t try to force people to accept their gender identity or sexual orientation. They said counselors are trained to support their clients, not tell them what to think.
The Senate Human Services Committee adopted an amendment that sought to address many of those concerns. The amendment said social workers may provide counseling to an individual who “wants to align their sexuality or gender with the individual’s personal or spiritual beliefs,” but also specifically held that conversion therapy is illegal.
Sen. Tim Mathern, a Fargo Democrat and licensed social worker, opposed both versions of House Bill 1430. He said on the floor Thursday that the amended bill wouldn’t accomplish anything since it parrots existing regulations.
“This bill essentially says, ‘Do what you’re doing — listen to people and help make choices,’”  Mathern said. “It’s a total waste of the Century Code.”
Kristin Roers, R-Fargo, also opposed the bill. She said if the bill passed it would have been the first time North Dakota put ethical standards set by a occupational board into Century Code, which raises questions about government overreach.

(Keila Szpaller / Daily Montanan)Hailing from St. Regis, George Bailey has an idea of the benefits a passenger railroad stop near one of the gems of the state could bring.
St. Regis, of course, is a common stop for drivers on I-90. Huck’s Grill, within the St. Regis Travel Center, already has (arguably) the best milkshakes in the state.
But what if rail was bringing passengers too?
“Our little town relies on tourism,” Bailey said while testifying in House Transportation in support of a bill that would boost the effort to bring localized passenger rail through Montana. “And I can envision people using the train to get to our beautiful area.”
Brought by Rep. Denise Baum, D-Billings, House Bill 848 would create a “Big Sky Rail Account”  within the state special revenue fund. It would appropriate $2 million annually to the new rail account and would come from a tax on certain railroad cars.
“I hope that committee members, both in transportation and appropriations, really look at and appreciate the huge economic opportunity for the state to continue to move this forward,” Baum said in an interview with the Daily Montanan. “Just in connectivity with rural and urban jobs, health care, and again, it benefits freight and rail. They can coexist.”
Rail advocates have long pushed for more options in Montana for more railroad options in Montana, led by the Big Sky Passenger Rail Authority. The organization’s stated goal is to expand passenger rail in the state, which used to be commonplace.

The organization is a transportation authority with membership from 20 counties, as well as cities and transit services across the state. A $500,000 grant through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2023 helped the agency move through Phase 1 of the project, which involved creating a service development plan and cost estimates, according to the Billings Gazette.
The second phase, which the appropriated money in HB 848 would go toward, would include more planning, as well as support for grants to move the project further along. Phase Two of the project would confirm the stops, Baum added. While the Rail Authority is being led by Montana, the organization’s chairman — and Missoula County Commissioner — Dave Strohmaier said it includes eight states.
Those eight states are part of the 2,300 miles of passenger rail the agency is seeking to use. During the Biden Administration, the project received an important federal green light as two routes through Montana were selected as “preferred routes” in the Amtrak Daily Long-Distance Service Study.
One of the routes would start in Chicago and run through Billings, Helena and Missoula before getting into Washington and going to either Seattle or Portland. In an interview, Strohmaier said it’s still up for discussion which of those two major West Coast cities it would connect.
The second route would run from El Paso, Texas, to Billings. Between the two routes, Baum said, passenger rail could run through Montana towns including Glendive, Miles City, Billings, Livingston, Bozeman, Helena, Missoula, and possibly either Paradise or Thompson Falls.
‘Critical infrastructure for our nation’
Passenger rail went by the wayside following a boom in the 19th and early 20th century.

It’s popular — Whitefish is the most visited stop on the Empire Builder between Seattle and Minneapolis. The station had 38,674 visitors in 2022.
However, the project will not be cheap, nor will it be coming soon.
Rep. Ed Stafman, D-Bozeman, said he was not trying to “throw cold water” on the project, but pressed Strohmaier for answers on cost and timeline during the hearing. He also expressed concern the rail could be outdated by the time it was built.
Strohmaier said if everything comes together without major issues, increased passenger rail service could come to Montana in 8 to 10 years.
The total cost was more difficult to estimate, he added.
“Infrastructure wise, in this country, it would not be inconceivable that this would be upwards of $2 billion for a 2,300-mile long route,” Strohmaier said.
Paying for the project will likely require significant federal money, and with Elon Musk’s quasi-government agency, the Department of Government Efficiency, attempting to find waste, cost was a real worry for Stafman.
Strohmaier seemed confident infrastructure investments would be protected. Former North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who is now the Secretary of the Interior, has been a strong supporter of increased rail service, Strohmaier said.
“We feel this is straight up critical infrastructure for our nation. There is no secret that rail infrastructure, particularly passenger rail infrastructure, in the United States has lagged behind other places around the globe,” Strohmaier said. “So I think that this administration that we have has certainly expressed thus far, support for investing in that critical infrastructure, and we’ve had some strong support in the past from our congressional delegation.”
Large infrastructure projects are inherently expensive. For example, an 8.5-mile extension of light rail opened north of Seattle last year, costing over $3 billion and taking 15 years to build after voters approved the project in 2008.
Strohmaier said the Big Sky Passenger Rail Authority could seek a voter-approved tax to fund rail, which is how some metropolitan areas pay for their transportation infrastructure, but that avenue is not likely to occur in Montana.  
Strohmaier said it would be difficult to ask Montana voters to help subsidize a project that involves multiple states.
Importantly, rail projects over 750 miles fall into federal jurisdiction for operation and capital cost, Strohmaier said.
“We’ve not exercised that option to put the question to voters, and have opted for what other ways can we fund our operations and administration of the rail authority,” Strohmaier said in an interview with the Daily Montanan. “Which is separate than operating a train or the infrastructure necessary for that.
“When we’re talking a long distance route and talking about trying to bankroll the operation and capital infrastructure, that ought not to fall on the backs of Montanans.”

‘It brings people together’
Proponents of the bill came from all corners of the state and much of their testimony focused on how rail could benefit elderly Montanans.
Margaret MacDonald, a former Montana senator and representative, who is now with Big Sky 55+, testified in support of the bill.
“I live in Billings, and my husband and I, and I certainly hope we’ll be able, at some point in the future, be able to take that train to Missoula, particularly as we get older and may not be the best drivers in the world,” MacDonald said. “It brings people together. It brings families together. It unites rural areas with urban centers.”
Whitehall Mayor Mary Hensleigh also pointed to the benefits rail would have for aging populations. 
“Whitehall has a population of 1,000 people, approximately, and a large percentage of those are boomers who have a real hard time admitting that they are now senior citizens, but they are, as I am,” Hensleigh said.
Whitehall helps operate one of the few bus services in the state, called Whitehall Public Transportation, which is run through the nonprofit Liberty Place, Inc. The bus service already runs to Bozeman or Belgrade and could allow people to catch the train there, Hensleigh said.
Other proponents pointed to economic and tourism benefits. They included the Montana Economic Developers Association, the Missoula Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO — all spoke in favor of the bill.
Former Missoula City council member and current Mountain Line CEO Jordan Hess said it could reduce costs associated with transportation.
“Transportation is the second-largest household cost, right behind housing,” Hess said. “We all know the terrible strains we’re in in terms of the cost of housing in the state of Montana. By offering transportation options, we can reduce the second-largest household cost, and make it more affordable for families and seniors to live in Montana and stay in Montana.”
Other proponents pointed to the bipartisan nature of rail, including former Glendive City Council member Jason Stuart. He is the vice-chair of Rail Authority and serves as the executive director of the Dawson County Economic Development Council.
“Glendive and Dawson County are no quote, unquote, liberal bastion,” Stuart said. “It is a deeply conservative community with deeply conservative elected officials. And in the four years since our county commission voted unanimously to make Dawson County one of the founding members of the BSPRA, I have heard no complaints or regrets about that from the people I represent.”
Action was not immediately taken on the bill.

Josh Stein’s press office reported Thursday.
The plan was submitted to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for approval on Wednesday after a 30-day public comment period.
If approved by HUD, a little more than 60% — $860.7 million — of the Community Development Block Grant-Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) money would go to reconstruct and rehabilitate owner-occupied housing damaged during Hurricane Helene. Meanwhile, 13.55% — $193.5 million — of the federal dollars would go to electrical, gas water, sewer, waste and telecom infrastructure repairs and improvements as well as road and bridge repairs. Another 13.4% — $191.3 million would go to rental housing repairs.
The plans also call for 13% — $186 million — for “mitigation set-asides.” HUD describes these as efforts to “increase resilience to disasters and reduce or eliminate the long-term risk of loss of life, injury, damage to and loss of property, and suffering and hardship by lessening the impact of future disasters.” Also, 7.8% — $111 million — is earmarked for economic revitalization.

“To rebuild damaged communities, we must rebuild people’s homes and our critical infrastructure,” Stein said in a news release. “I am grateful to the many North Carolinians who provided input on this plan over the past 30 days, and I urge the federal government to review and approve it swiftly so we can jumpstart permanent home rebuilding as quickly as possible.”
Stein has created a new division at the Commerce Department to administer the HUD CDBG-DR program for western North Carolina. The Division of Community Revitalization is led by Deputy Secretary Stephanie McGarrah, which spearheaded the development of the Action Plan.
CDBG-DR grants focus on longer-term rebuilding rather than immediate needs for shelter. They are intended to address unmet needs in three core areas of recovery – housing, infrastructure, and economic revitalization. The Action Plan proposes that most funds go to housing recovery for low- and moderate-income residents, with the remaining funds targeted for infrastructure rebuilding and economic revitalization, particularly for small businesses and commercial districts.
“We are moving with urgency so that western North Carolina receives the relief it needs,” said N.C. Commerce Secretary Lee Lilley.
As the state awaits HUD approval, the Division of Community Revitalization’s housing recovery work has already gotten underway with a recent appropriation of $120 million in state funds from the General Assembly for home reconstruction and repair. Although damage assessments are still ongoing, the current allotment of $1.42 billion will fall short of the unmet housing needs facing the region. A separate HUD CDBG-DR grant of $225 million was allocated directly to the City of Asheville to administer.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Image-4-1024x642.jpeg,,,2025-03-27 17:05:38.045221

(Main photo via Google Earth; inset photos courtesy City of Dubuque)  Dubuque city officials say they’re not ready to pursue any penalties against a hotel repeatedly cited for dozens of health-and-safety violations.
Since January, city inspectors have visited the 98-year-old Canfield Hotel, 36 W. 4th St., on at least three occasions and have cited the business for more than two dozen regulatory violations, including bed bugs, cockroaches and hallways strewn with garbage.
The most recent inspection was March 18, when the hotel was cited for many of the same violations found earlier in the year, including worn carpet, damaged walls, broken window glass, dirty bathrooms, peeling paint and several areas that were in need of a “thorough cleaning.”
City inspector Tim Link said this week that the owners are making progress coming into compliance with state law but more remains to be done.
According to inspectors, the hotel is operating as something more akin to an apartment building, with some guests registered for monthly stays without receiving linen or housekeeping services.

City of Dubuque Public Health Director Mary Rose Corrigan said that while the citations for the violations carry no fines or penalties, the city, in conjunction with the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing, does have the power to pursue simple-misdemeanor criminal charges.
“We’re not ready to impose that at this point because our goal is compliance,” she said. “It’s not necessary to be punitive. We want to get the problems corrected and since the hotel is making progress we’re going to keep working with them.”
City Attorney Crenna Brumwell said Thursday there have not been any fire-code inspections at the Canfield Hotel in 2024 or 2025. She said the fire department indicated the building was last inspected for fire-safety violations in July 2023 – seven weeks after city health officials approved the owners’ application for a hotel license.
During the July 2023 fire-safety inspection, the hotel was cited for 10 violations, including nonfunctioning emergency lights and exit lights, an uncovered junction box that left wiring exposed, an uncovered electrical outlet, wall openings that had yet to be repaired, and limited access to fire extinguishers.
In 2021, a Dubuque woman who had lived at the hotel for close to three months was charged with felony first-degree arson after telling police she had set fire to her divorce papers inside the hotel. Police alleged that when officers asked Crystal Farrell whether she had planned to set fire to the building with its other 37 tenants still inside, she replied, “Sure.” She was later sentenced to one year in a residential facility and five years of probation.
In 1946, a fire at the Canfield Hotel killed 19 people, making it one of the deadliest fires in Iowa history.
City assessment records indicate the 54-unit hotel was built in 1927. It was purchased in June 2023 by Krupa LLC, a company that is managed by Mihir Patel. Since 2023, when Patel took over the hotel, the net assessed value of the property has dropped from $923,700 to $717,700.
Patel said last month that he had hired four new housekeepers, stepped up pest control in the building, and hired a general contractor to address the issues cited by the city inspector. He said there are roughly 25 people living in the building, with most of them paying rent on a week-to-week basis.
In 2022, the Iowa Capital Dispatch reported that the Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing acknowledged that for the previous eight years, it had violated a law requiring the routine inspection of Iowa’s hotels and motels.
By law, the agency had been required to inspect all hotels within its jurisdiction at least once every two years. The department was instead conducting preopening inspections and complaint investigations, and any others were based on an agency risk assessment.
Last year, the Iowa Legislature approved, and the governor signed into law, legislation that codified the department’s long-standing practice. The bill repealed the requirement for biennial inspections.

Free.,"After deadly midair collision, lawmakers grill FAA, Army on 'shocking' lack of safety system",Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/after-deadly-midair-collision-lawmakers-grill-faa-army-shocking-lack-safety-system,,"The U.S. Army and Federal Aviation Administration continued to allow some flights to operate near a Washington, D.C.-area airport with a location communications system turned off, even after the absence of that system contributed to the January midair collision that killed 67 people, officials testified at a U.S. Senate panel hearing Thursday.Acting FAA Administrator Chris Rocheleau told the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Aviation, Space and Innovation Subcommittee that he was ordering all flights in the airspace of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport operate with a certain aircraft tracking system.But until Thursday, no such order was in place, Rocheleau said, to the dismay of some leading committee members.The system, known as Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast, or ADS-B, automatically broadcasts once per second an aircraft’s location to other nearby pilots. The system from broadcasting outgoing signals is called ADS-B out, and the ability to receive the signals is called ADS-B in.The U.S. Army continues to allow flights with ADS-B turned off, even in the area around the Virginia-based airport that serves the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia, also known as DCA, U.S. Army Brigadier Gen. Matthew Braman, the director of Army aviation, told the panel.“I have to say I find that shocking and deeply unacceptable,” Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican who chairs the full committee, told Braman.“And I want to encourage the Army right now to revisit that policy and revisit that policy today,” Cruz continued. “If the Army chooses not to, I have a high level of confidence that Congress will pass legislation mandating that you revisit the policy. If today another accident occurs over DCA with another helicopter that had ADS-B out turned off, the Army will have very direct responsibility, and I am at a loss to come up with any justification for risking the lives of the traveling public with that decision.”Rocheleau said he was putting in place a requirement Thursday to require all flights near DCA, including military flights, to have ADS-B turned on.ADS-B is considered much more accurate than traditional radar, which broadcasts once every four to six seconds, National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy said.The full committee’s ranking Democrat, Maria Cantwell of Washington, appeared not to know in advance Rocheleau was planning to issue the requirement and questioned his handling of the issue.“Acting administrator, you're not building faith in this system of oversight of the FAA,” she said.She noted several government agencies and departments, including the Department of Homeland Security, had applied for exemptions to be allowed to keep their safety systems off.Rocheleau said the FAA had a memorandum of understanding with other federal airspace users that they must use the safety system, though Cantwell noted that was not legally enforceable.‘Intolerable risk’Several factors contributed to the deadly Jan. 29 collision of an Army Black Hawk helicopter with an American Airlines commercial jet over the Potomac River, Homendy said. Sixty-four people on the regional jet died, along with three in the Black Hawk.But the helicopter’s approved flight path that left no margin for error presented an “intolerable risk to aviation safety,” she said.Subcommittee Chairman Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican, said the FAA ignored warning signs for years.Over a 13-year span, there was not a single month that did not include a “close call” between a helicopter and a commercial jet operating at DCA, Moran said.He added that in just more than three years, from October 2021 to December 2024, there were 15,000 “close proximity events” between a helicopter and a commercial jet.“I want to know how, with these statistics in the FAA files, why, prior to Jan. 29 the agency failed to improve safety protocols at Reagan National Airport,” he said.The American Airlines flight attempting to land at DCA departed from Wichita, Kansas, and Moran opened the hearing with an acknowledgment of the lives lost.“Sixty-seven lives that were lost on Jan. 29 were taken prematurely in an accident that, by all indications, should have been avoided,” he said.The collision was the first disaster of President Donald Trump’s second term and came just two days after the Senate confirmed former Wisconsin Rep. Sean Duffy as Transportation secretary.It was the deadliest plane crash in the Washington area since 1982, when an Air Florida flight crashed into the Potomac River and killed 78 people.TransparencyHomendy also told the panel her agency had trouble procuring records and even basic information from an FAA-led working group on helicopter safety in the D.C. area.The Army is also a member of that working group, Braman said.“Can I please say there is a D.C. helicopter working group that we have been trying to figure out who is part of the working group and get minutes and get documents from that working group to see what information was shared and what was discussed over the years, and we have not been able to attain that yet,” Homendy said.She added she wanted to review how the flight plan was approved.Rocheleau said he would work to figure out why the NTSB has had issues with the records.In a statement, the law firm representing some families of those killed in the crash, called for more transparency from the agencies involved.Rocheleau and Braman “were less than forthcoming to the American public and did their best to obfuscate the information provided to the committee,” the statement from Clifford Law Offices read. “They failed to accept responsibility and accountability for this needless tragedy and the thousands of other adverse experiences that could have led to additional disasters.”",,,,2025-03-27 17:05:38.045221

The legislation, dubbed the “Pray Safe Act,” is meant to help worshippers of all religions feel safe practicing their faith amid a rise in violence toward religious institutions [&#8230;]","Rep. Beth Bernstein, D-Columbia, pictured in the South Carolina House chamber on Dec. 4, 2024 (Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Churches, synagogues and other religious institutions in South Carolina could apply for up to $25,000 in state aid for security improvements under a bipartisan proposal.
The legislation, dubbed the “Pray Safe Act,” is meant to help worshippers of all religions feel safe practicing their faith amid a rise in violence toward religious institutions and groups, Rep. Beth Bernstein, the bill’s lead sponsor, told reporters Wednesday.
“Freedom to worship cannot be enjoyed unless you have freedom from fear,” said Bernstein, a Columbia Democrat and the state’s only Jewish legislator.
Any tax-exempt organization “at particular risk of being subject to a religiously motivated crime” would be able to apply for a grant of up to $25,000 to hire security guards, train existing security, make buildings more secure, or install cameras and lighting systems, according to the bill introduced earlier this month.
With a proposed pot of $750,000 to pull from, that would allow at least 30 religious groups to receive funding. The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division would award the grants based on a religious group’s risk of being targeted, which include whether crimes have been committed there in the past and its existing level of security.
Violence at places of worship is an issue close to home for South Carolina, where an avowed white supremacist killed nine members of Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston during a 2015 Bible study.
The number of attacks on religious institutions and the people who worship there has only grown in the decade since, Bernstein said.
“In recent years, we have seen hundreds of houses of worship facing violent attacks, from shootings to bomb threats to potential fires,” Bernstein said. “Individual people of faith have also been targeted at alarming rates.”
Instances of vandalism, arson, shootings and bomb threats at churches across the country doubled last year, according to numbers tracked by the Family Research Council. In 2023, the most recent data available, the evangelical nonprofit reported 436 “acts of hostility” against churches nationwide, compared with about 195 the year before.

The same year, the Anti-Defamation League reported nearly 9,000 antisemitic incidents, which include assaults, vandalism and harassment. That was more than double the 3,600 reported in 2022, according to the anti-hate organization.
The Charleston and Columbia Jewish federations have seen an uptick in synagogues applying to the joint Secure Community Network, a national nonprofit that provides security training and facility assessments and helps them connect with local law enforcement officers, said Tair Giudice, CEO of the Charleston Jewish Federation.
But because of funding restrictions, less than half of all applications to the nonprofit are accepted, Giudice said. Synagogues that can’t afford security improvements on their own are left with few other options, she said.
“South Carolina is a state that has always valued faith and worship, and for our faith communities to thrive, it is critical people feel safe,” Giudice said.
The bill has yet to have a hearing, and the House did not include the $750,000 in its budget plan for the coming fiscal year. Bernstein hopes the grant program gets added before the budget is finalized. The Senate will debate its plan later this month.
The bill’s co-sponsors suggest its chances are good. Republicans who have signed on include House Ways and Means Chairman Bruce Bannister of Greenville and House Judiciary Chairman Weston Newton of Bluffton.
Private security in schools
A separate bill that advanced this week to the Senate floor would require private security officers working in K-12 schools to go through stricter training.
Lawmakers have long wanted every school in the state to hire a school resource officer, who is a law enforcement officer dedicated to patrolling a school. Last year, legislators designated $2 million to help schools that couldn’t afford to hire officers.
With shortages of officers across the state, though, some districts have still struggled to fill positions. For instance, 37 of Greenville County’s 91 schools have no dedicated security officer, said Sen. Jason Elliott, a co-sponsor on the bill. So, the district turned to private security officers to fill in the gaps, the Greenville Republican said.
The goal is to “supplement and not supplant” school resource officers, Elliott said. Schools would be encouraged to continue searching for full-time resource officers, he said.
The bill would require officers working in certain schools to go through extra training with SLED “to enhance accountability and compliance.” Any officers working in a school would also have to be at least 21 years old and get re-certified every two years.
Only schools with a full-time security division and a written agreement with local law enforcement would be able to hire private security officers under the bill.
“Kids’ safety and protection is the number one key,” said Sen. Ross Turner, a Greenville Republican and the bill’s chief sponsor. “Before anybody can learn, you’ve got to feel safe.”
The Senate Education Committee voted unanimously Wednesday to advance the proposal.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/DSC_0775-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-27 17:05:38.045221

American Indian and Alaska Native tribes are fighting for equal governance and sovereignty over their own health data. (Kris Hanning/University of Arizona)When Stephanie Russo Carroll, a citizen of the Native Village of Kluti-Kaah in Alaska, set out to earn her doctorate in tribal health 15 years ago, she focused her research on tribal cultural and health programs within six tribes.
She needed vital statistics data, such as birth and death rates, for each of them. But getting that data from the state, which houses vital statistics, was difficult — and in some cases, the data she needed was missing.
“Health outcomes data were unobtainable,” Carroll recalled. In one case, her team had to try using breastfeeding rates as a proxy to estimate birth rates. But even getting those for all six tribes was impossible.
For the next two decades, Carroll would continue to push for U.S. tribes — which are sovereign nations — to own and maintain control over their data, including health statistics.
The concept, known as data sovereignty, is important amid the harrowing health disparities seen in tribal people, rooted in forced assimilation dating back more than a century. Often, data gathered by and about tribes has been shared with state and federal agencies; but those same agencies haven’t always shared their tribal-related statistics in return.
The reasons vary, from systemic issues within the health care system to mistaken assumptions by some federal officials about what data be securely sent to tribes without risking privacy violations.
Lackluster investigations may perpetuate high Native infant mortality rate

The lack of tribe-specific data has hindered tribes from fully taking care of their members and clouded their work on public health responses to disease outbreaks such as syphilis and COVID-19, on maternal and infant health outcomes, and on chronic issues such as diabetes, heart disease and substance use.
Data sovereignty is especially relevant now, as the Trump administration scrubs federal health websites of data that recognizes and tracks metrics among the country’s various racial and ethnic groups, including what little data there is on tribal members.
States govern their own health data systems. But the same isn’t true for the nation’s 574 federally recognized tribes.
Now an associate professor of public health at the University of Arizona, Carroll co-founded the U.S. Indigenous Data Sovereignty Network and directs the Collaboratory for Indigenous Data Governance. Both are groups that work to research and strengthen Indigenous data governance, accuracy and data-driven policy.
“If you don’t know who has been sick or hospitalized,” Carroll said, “how can you make sure you have the right care systems for your community?”
Withholding tribes’ data
As part of its slashing of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, the Trump administration removed numerous racial, ethnic, adolescent and maternal health datasets from the websites of several federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While some of the data has been reinstated, the swift deletions raised alarms in tribal communities.
Abigail Echo-Hawk, a member of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma and director of the Urban Indian Health Institute, said the youth behavioral risk surveys were reinstated, but were missing key race and ethnicity search features that tribes use to track mental health conditions in American Indian and Alaska Native teens.
“Now, we can’t search, disaggregate by Native youth,” she said. “That information is about our children, and it is the legal right of both now the tribal epidemiology centers and the tribes to have access to that previously gathered information.”

Despite their public health authority, tribes and tribal epidemiology centers, which support tribes with health data tracking, say federal and state health officials have long withheld or denied requests to direct access of health data related to their tribes, including coronavirus data during the pandemic.
Such data is tied to treaty rights obligations and shouldn’t be lumped together with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives currently under attack by the Trump administration, Echo-Hawk said.
“Our treaty rights are tied to having information around tribal people. So, if you’re going to uphold our treaty rights, you need to say: ‘This number of Native people are experiencing this issue,’ or ‘This number of Native people exist,’” she said.
It wasn’t until 2021 that the CDC conducted its first comprehensive life expectancy profile of American Indians and Alaska Natives; it showed that in 2019, their life expectancy was seven years lower than that of white people.
“All of the data is a story. It’s a grandmother, it’s a son, it’s a story of a community’s well-being,” Echo-Hawk said.
When tribes receive federal grants — whether for transportation, housing or education initiatives — there are grant reporting requirements.




All of data is a story. It’s a grandmother, it’s a son, it’s a story of a community’s well-being.


– Abigail Echo-Hawk, director of the Urban Indian Public Health Institute



Under those rules, tribes send raw data to federal agencies, but they often don’t get that data back, said social demographer Desi Small-Rodriguez, an assistant professor of sociology and American Indian studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, who co-founded the data sovereignty network with Carroll.
“It’s a one-way data highway coming from tribal governments — leaving tribal governments and going into the feds — and it’s not coming back,” said Small-Rodriguez. She also directs the Data Warriors Lab, working with tribes — including her own Northern Cheyenne Tribe of Montana — to develop legal mechanisms to ensure data ownership.
She said the federal government should provide funding, as part of its treaty obligations, to pay for expensive data support such as secure storage systems, high-performance computers and analytics staff.
“As part of our treaty rights, we have a right to health care and education. We have a right to clean water and air — and data form the basis for all of that,” she said.
State data agreements
In January, the Tulalip Tribes in northwest Washington state secured a data-sharing agreement with the state department of health. It gives the tribes access to the state’s disease reporting system, allowing them to extract some data directly. Tulalip plans to eventually secure access to more datasets.
It’s the first agreement of its kind in the state, said Summer Hammons, legislative policy analyst in the Treaty Rights and Governmental Affairs Department of the Tulalip Tribes, which has at least 5,000 members. Hammons grew up on the reservation.
She hopes it will help the tribe direct resources and funds where they’re needed — whether it’s more cancer screenings or vaccinations against diseases such as measles, as other states grapple with outbreaks of the virus.
“It allows us to collaborate and lead on outbreak investigations related to tribal members,” Hammons said. “It’s a clear outline that tribes own their data in partnership with the state, because the state’s the one that’s collecting it. But we want to tell our story, and we want to be able to work with DOH [department of health] to be mindful of our stories and to also get better access to the statistics.”
For Indian Country, federal cuts decimate core tribal programs

A few other states — Alaska, Arizona, Oregon and South Dakota — also have limited-scope agreements with tribes.
Gary Ferguson, Unangax (Aleut), is the director of integrative medicine at Tulalip Health Clinic. He said he hopes the data will help the tribe track health care interventions over time.
“We don’t know what’s working. We don’t know what’s not working,” he said. “We want to celebrate our wins.”
Tracking disease
In recent years, the nation has seen alarming surges in congenital syphilis, a preventable infection passed through pregnancy to newborns. Nearly 40% can be stillborn or die as a newborn. Babies can also suffer lifelong blindness or deafness. Tribal babies suffer the highest rate.
Officials at the Great Plains Tribal Epidemiology Center, which tracks tribal public health across four states, were denied syphilis data from local public health departments for years until the group leaned on the CDC for assistance.
It wasn’t until then that, finally, last year, one state — South Dakota — agreed to share American Indian and Alaska Native syphilis cases as soon as they’re reported, said Sarah Shewbrooks, the group’s lead tribal epidemiologist.
Shewbrooks hopes the access in South Dakota will pave the way for more agreements in the other Great Plains states.
‘We needed this yesterday’
During COVID-19, American Indian and Alaska Native people were more likely to be infected and compared with white people, had double the risk of in-hospital death and three times the rate of severe infection, research shows. Yet even then, data weren’t telling the whole story.
Echo-Hawk’s organization published a report card in 2021 that scored each state’s collection of Natives’ COVID-19 cases. In total, the nation averaged a D+. This year, she published a follow-up for epidemiologists on addressing the misclassification of Native people, who often are listed as “white” or “Hispanic” in health settings and death certificates. Many states also inconsistently or don’t report tribal affiliation on death certificates, which can make tribe-specific death rates elusive.
A report in 2021 from the nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office found that some officials from the CDC and the Indian Health Services agency didn’t recognize that they were required by law to share data with tribal epidemiology centers, the centers told investigators.
In the GAO report, investigators detailed logistical barriers, including federal agencies’ reluctance to share COVID-19 data because of concerns around privacy and security in data transmission.
“This is one of the best examples of what structural racism looks like,” said Shewbrooks. “Because when you look at the infrastructure for public health systems and public health data, tribes and [tribal epidemiology centers] were never included in that infrastructure.
“COVID really put it up there as: No, we needed this yesterday.”
Shewbrooks said that as part of her work she’d go to funeral directors, who may fill out death certificates, throughout the region to educate them on proper classification of American Indian people. “I even had one say to me once, ‘I just always code them by how they look. I never ask what their race is.’”
“A lot of them didn’t know that this is data that gets really used,” she said. “Vital records data is just super important, foundational work in a lot of epidemiological work.”

There is no national standard for tribal health data, explained Cheryl Ellenwood, who is a citizen of the Nez Perce Nation and also Diné (Navajo).
Ellenwood, an assistant professor in Washington State University’s School of Politics, Philosophy and Public Affairs, experienced firsthand the data disconnect when both her parents died of COVID-19.
Four years ago this month, her mother, Annie Benally Ellenwood, an enrolled Navajo tribal member from New Mexico, died at age 71 in a hospital in Idaho. Annie Ellenwood’s death, however, wouldn’t show up in primary statistics of COVID-19 deaths in Navajo people — her tribe isn’t listed on her death certificate.
“I was very hurt by this, because my mother died because of COVID-19, and I wanted her death to count and mean something,” Ellenwood said.
“It still feels very life and death, like we are fighting to demonstrate the impact of so many things on our people,” she said.

The New Hampshire House of Representatives voted, 180-164, to pass House Bill 191, which would make it a crime in the state to knowingly transport an unemancipated minor to receive a “surgical procedure” without a parent’s notarized permission. It also opens people up to civil lawsuits if they do so. Under the bill, a first offense would be a misdemeanor and a third offense would be a felony. 
However, an earlier version of the bill specified that this was — at least originally — about abortions. The original text of the bill made it illegal to help a minor receive an “abortion” without their parents’ permission. The criteria for what constitutes a violation under the proposed law was also broader in the original text. The bill originally made it illegal to hide the fact that a minor is receiving an abortion or help them obtain an abortion, whether surgical or through drugs, without parental permission. However, before the House voted on the bill, it was amended to limit the scope and to change “abortion” to “surgical procedure.”
On the House floor, Rep. Alissandra Murray, a Manchester Democrat, argued the amendment “attempts to conceal the real motives of obstructing abortion access.” She also said the amendment created “unnecessary confusion” and means the bill would require “notarized consent to drive a teen to get their tonsils removed or face criminalizing grandma.”
Republicans supporting the bill didn’t buy that argument.
“I cannot imagine any world where anybody in this room can come up with a scenario where it’s OK for somebody else to take their child for a scheduled medical procedure and them not have to know about it,” Rep. Jennifer Rhodes, a Winchester Republican, said. “I wonder what that could be. Doesn’t make any sense to me.”
The bill will need approval from the Senate and the governor before it can become law. Prior to Wednesday’s vote, the bill was approved by the House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee in a 9-7 vote.
Abortion has been legal up to 24 weeks of pregnancy in New Hampshire since 2021. The law has exceptions for medical emergencies and fetal abnormalities, but not for rape or incest.
There was an unsuccessful effort to further restrict that this year though. House Bill 476, sponsored by Wolfeboro Republican Rep. Katy Peternel, sought to ban abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy with exceptions for medical emergencies and fetal abnormalities. However, the House withdrew the bill in February after Peternel and her cosponsors no longer stood behind it.
This comes after Gov. Kelly Ayotte, a Republican, promised on multiple occasions, including during her inaugural address, that she would not approve legislation restricting abortion beyond the 24-week limitation already in place.

Under Senate Bill 9, originally authored by Roswell Republican Sen. John Albers, it would be a crime for political campaigns to knowingly publish certain audio or AI-made materials within 90 days of an election.
  Rep. Brad Thomas. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
To be caught under the law, the material would have to be posted with the intention of significantly influencing a candidate’s chance of being elected, creating confusion about the election or otherwise influencing the result. Including a disclaimer on the advertisement would protect a candidate who posted an ad that would otherwise violate the law.
A first offense would be a misdemeanor, and a second offense would be a felony, carrying a potential sentence of two to five years in prison and a fine of up to $50,000.
The legislation originally created punishments for creating obscene images of children using AI but was amended in a House committee to deal with fraudulent election materials. Language aimed at obscene AI materials still survives in House Bill 171, which passed the House and is awaiting a Senate vote.
Holly Springs Republican Rep. Brad Thomas, the House sponsor of the bill, argued that the bill is narrowly tailored to catch purposely deceptive speech and contains a carveout for constitutionally protected speech including satire, parody, works of art and journalism.
“I want to make it clear, First Amendment-protected speech, such as satire and parody, as listed on line 56 – aka memes – are explicitly written as not applying to this bill,” Thomas said.
  Rep. Long Tran. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Dunwoody Democratic Rep. Long Tran said bad actors are already using cutting-edge tech to deceptively influence elections, referencing a bit of infamous audio from last year’s election.
“Just a year ago, we saw in New Hampshire, during the New Hampshire presidential primary, a voice robocall went out to Democratic voters that imitated President Joe Biden’s voice and told Democratic voters not to call out and vote,” he said. “And that is the danger that AI poses today.”
A similar bill passed the House last year but fell short in the Senate over free speech concerns. Thomas said he worked since the 2024 legislative session to shore up any of those concerns, but not every legislator felt assured.
“This isn’t freedom, it’s Soviet-style control,” said Woodstock Republican Rep. Charlice Byrd. “SB 9 could jail you for so-called deception, exposing corruption on felony charges up to five years. We already have deception laws for lies that harm. This is silencing dissent, plain and simple. If it passes, Georgia becomes like California, dissenters in handcuffs.”
  Rep. Charlice Byrd. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
The 12 lawmakers opposed to the bill included members of both parties.
Lilburn Democratic Rep. Jasmine Clark, who voted against the bill, said she thinks it should go further than the 90-day window before an election.
“My concern would be if a campaign that is very well-funded has 300 days – or whatever 365 minus 90 is, I don’t feel like doing math – they have that many days to make deceptive materials about you, and then there’s just a 90-day moratorium,’ she said. “How do you undo that damage?
Because it was amended, the bill will need to return to the Senate for a final vote before it can land on Gov. Brian Kemp’s desk. The deadline for that to happen is April 4, the last day of the 2025 legislative session.

Assistant House Minority Leader Joe Neguse, a Lafayette Democrat, said Hegseth should be fired “IMMEDIATELY” in a post on Bluesky.
U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet said in a post on X that Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, who was also on the chat, “must resign immediately” after she said in an Intelligence Committee hearing that “Trump administration officials did not discuss any classified information.”
“As the chat’s transcript makes clear, this is plainly false, meaning that Gabbard lied to Congress and committed perjury,” Bennet said. 
Bennet also said Hegseth and Waltz must resign “for the sake of our national security and the safety of our troops.”
U.S. Rep. Brittany Pettersen, a Lakewood Democrat, said in a post on X that sharing attack plans through an unsecured platform is “an egregious breach of protocol that can never happen again.” She said Hegseth failed the “basic mission” of protecting the safety and security of U.S. service members. 
“He must step down, and everyone involved with this heinous breach of security must be held accountable,” Pettersen said. 
U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper said in a post on X that the “dangerous and reckless” actions from senior Trump officials “put our service members and national security at risk.”
U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette, a Denver Democrat, said Wednesday that “at minimum” Hegseth and Waltz should resign and demanded an investigation into the breach.

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A Kansas House investigative committee called off a meeting Thursday scheduled to delve deeper into evidence that could lead to the extraordinary removal from office of outspoken Democratic Rep. Ford Carr of Wichita.
Rep. Bob Lewis, the Garden City Republican who serves as chairman of the bipartisan panel, said pressure to conclude debates and votes on the House floor took precedence over convening the committee to resume examination of the case against Carr. The committee is expected to meet again in early April, he said.
Carr, subject of the disciplinary complaint submitted by Republican Rep. Leah Howell of Derby, said he was annoyed but not surprised by the delay.
“This is just another attempt, again, just to silence my voice,” said Carr, who is Black and has made controversial statements about racism in Kansas Legislature. “I came prepared. My supporters showed up. People took off work. This is just an effort so they can attempt to push this thing off until maybe there’s no one that’s willing to show up. I’m always going to be here. You know, they’ll never shut me up.”
After word trickled out from the House chamber the investigatory committee’s meeting would be postponed, Lewis arrived in the fifth-floor committee room to explain to Carr and others that protracted House debate on an abortion-related bill conflicted with the scheduled meeting.
“The proceedings are not over,” Lewis told Carr.  “You’ll be given every consideration.”
GOP Rep. Susan Humphries, a Wichita attorney serving on the special committee, was carrying House Bill 2062 on the House floor that would mandate payment of child support from the date of conception.
In a brief exchange in the committee meeting room, Carr said material he asked to be introduced into evidence for the special committee “appears to be missing.”
“I think you’re drawing some assumptions that aren’t true,” Lewis said.
“I don’t know if they’re true or not,” Carr replied.
“I know you don’t,” Lewis said.
“I’m just telling you to calm down,” Carr said.
“I’m not upset,” Lewis answered. “I’m trying to present the evidence that’s admissible in clear form.”
Lewis said House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican, participated in the decision to postpone the Carr inquiry so House members could participate fully on the floor.
The peer review of behavior among House members began when Carr filed a complaint against Wichita Rep. Nick Hoheisel. He alleged Hoheisel hurled abusive language at Carr during consideration of a firearm education bill in February. The House Select Investigating Committee deadlocked 3-3 along partisan lines on whether Hoheisel was guilty of using disorderly words while expressing himself to Carr.
In wake of that case, Howell stepped forward with a rebuttal complaint backed with information about Carr’s purported harsh language and disruptive behavior. Her evidence file included videos, columns, statements and news reports related to Carr that stretching from 2023 to 2025.
The packet included material on Carr’s reference to a House colleague as a “House Negro,” which resulted in an admonition from House GOP leadership not to impugn motives of others. Carr responded with a letter declaring Republicans in the House wouldn’t succeed in the attempt to “silence my voice as a Black lawmaker.”
In January, Carr was involved in a disturbance with Wichita City Council member Brandon Johnson at the Celtic Fox tavern across the street from the Capitol in Topeka. Video of that exchange was posted to social media and was included in the basket of evidence submitted by Howell.
That was followed by the conflict between Carr and Hoheisel. In that encounter, Carr had thanked a House Republican for not being too racist to answer his questions. Hoheisel took exception to Carr’s statement and approached Carr at his desk on the House floor to emphasize Carr’s conclusion was  “bulls***.”
The investigatory committee evaluating the complaint against Carr could wind up in a 3-3 tie and make no recommendation to the full House. A majority on the panel could vote to dismiss the case or submit to the House a proposal to discipline Carr with a reprimand, censure or expulsion.
In the full House, disciplinary action would require support from two-thirds of the 125-member chamber. In the 2025 legislative session, Republicans hold an 88-36 advantage over Democrats in the House.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Carr-facing-Lewis-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-03-27 16:04:13.533572

In 2024, the board alleged that pharmacist Christopher Steele of Underwood incorrectly filled prescriptions for at least four patients in 2023.
The board did not publicly disclose where Steele was working when the drugs were dispensed, the nature of the alleged errors, the types of drugs that were dispensed, or the effect the alleged errors had on the patients. Steele told the Iowa Capital Dispatch the errors occurred at the pharmacy within the Food Land store in Woodbine where he worked.
Earlier this month, the board charged Food Land Pharmacy with 10 separate regulatory violations — an exceptionally large number of violations for a pharmacy of that size.
The charges include failing to follow board rules related to recordkeeping, failing to follow board rules related to temporary pharmacy staff, failing to follow proper procedures related to controlled-substance registrations, failing to follow proper procedures for a change in the pharmacist in charge, failing to follow board rules related to accountability of controlled substances, failing to follow rules related to system security and safeguards, and failing to comply with the required drug utilization review process for a patient.
The nature and timing of the alleged actions that serve as the basis for those charges has not been publicly disclosed by the board. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for May 21, 2025.

Lawmakers in Nebraska and Missouri are considering changes to voter-approved laws requiring paid sick leave. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Missouri lawmakers are on the verge of gutting a voter-approved law requiring most employers to provide workers with paid sick leave.
On Wednesday, a state Senate committee approved a bill overturning the sick leave requirement. Already approved by the House, the bill has only Senate approval left before being sent to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has voiced support for the proposal.
In November, Missouri’s Proposition A passed with 58% of the vote. The law increased the minimum wage from $12.30 to $15 per hour and required employers to provide one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked.
Business groups filed a court challenge in December, asking the Missouri Supreme Court to overturn the ballot measure’s outcome. That lawsuit argues the election results should be overturned because of several alleged constitutional violations, including of the state constitution’s single-subject requirement and a lack of a clear title.
Legislative sponsor state Rep. Sherri Gallick said the ballot initiative dealt a blow to Missouri businesses, particularly small businesses and would increase the cost of goods and services. Gallick, a former executive in the food industry, has also said employees would “abuse” the sick leave provision, the Missouri Independent reported.
On Wednesday, backers of last fall’s ballot measure said it was modeled on paid sick leave policies in more than a dozen other states.
“Opponents made their argument, we made our argument, and the voters spoke,” said Richard von Glahn, policy director for Missouri Jobs with Justice, the organization that helped lead the November campaign.
A similar debate is making its way through Nebraska’s unicameral legislature this session.
Nebraska voters approved a ballot measure in November that mandates businesses with at least 20 employees provide employees up to seven days of paid sick leave, with smaller businesses require to provide five days a year.
Lawmakers have proposed several bills in Lincoln seeking to roll back some of those requirements. One bill would exempt owner-operators and independent contractors from the sick time rules. An amendment debated this week would exclude seasonal agricultural workers, workers under the age of 16 and employers with fewer than 10 employees.
Republican lawmakers argued that voters did not appreciate the negative consequences of the sick leave mandate, particularly for smaller employers.
“While I trust the will of the voters, I do believe that they did not understand the cost of this, and specifically the cost of this to a small employer,” state Sen. Tony Sorrentino, a Republican, said, according to a report from Nebraska Public Media. 
But Nebraska Democrats say the moves undermine the will of the voters and could endanger public health by forcing sick people to go into work.
“Why does the Legislature keep trying to change what the people voted for?” Democratic state Sen. George Dungan asked Wednesday.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps/For Utah News Dispatch)After more than four decades of calling Utah and Park City home, the Sundance Film Festival is leaving in 2027.
The Sundance Film Institute announced on Thursday that festival organizers have decided to move to Boulder, Colorado. Colorado lawmakers earlier this month advanced a bill that would create up to $34 million in tax credits over the next 10 years (or $3 million to $5 million per year) for the film festival.
Utah was one of three finalists bidding to host Sundance after its contract expires following the 2026 festival. Earlier Thursday, news broke that organizers did not choose Cincinnati, leaving just Utah and Colorado in the running. Sundance’s announcement later Thursday afternoon sealed the deal for Boulder.
“This decision was informed by a detailed evaluation of the key components essential to creating our Festival. During the process, it became clear that Boulder is the ideal location in which to build our Festival’s future, marking a key strategic step in its natural evolution,” said Ebs Burnough, Sundance Institute Board Chair.
The decision also comes after some final-hour drama added a wrinkle to Utah’s bid. The 2025 Utah Legislature approved a bill aimed at banning pride or LGBTQ+ flags in schools and all government buildings, which its supporters said is meant to promote “political neutrality” in government spaces.
Earlier this month, the Hollywood news site Deadline reported that bill, HB77, could pose “an eleventh-hour obstacle to the Beehive State’s hopes of keeping” Sundance. The outlet quoted an unnamed “Sundance insider” expressing frustrations with the bill and calling it a “terrible law, a terrible look for the state.”
“No matter what they say, we all know who it’s aimed at — the LGBTQ+ community, and that’s unacceptable,” the outlet quoted that insider saying.
The announcement came after Utah’s bid committee — made up of officials from Park City, Visit Park City, Summit County, Salt Lake County, Visit Salt Lake, the state of Utah, Salt Lake City and Utah’s philanthropic community — spent nearly an entire year forming a bid package that included tens of millions in in-kind and cash public funding, plus even more in private commitments.
Park City and Salt Lake City are both Democratic strongholds in an otherwise deeply conservative state.
In total, Utah’s bid included more than $54.1 million in public cash commitments over 10 years. That included an additional $24.9 million in new cash commitments over the life of a 10-year contract, on top of about $29.2 million that had already been committed to Sundance over 10 years, according to bid committee officials. That would have equaled nearly $2.8 million in new annual public funding committed to the film festival, on top of about $2.7 million that was already committed, bringing the total annual public cash that was on the table to more than $5.5 million a year for 10 years.
The 2025 Utah Legislature appropriated $3.5 million in their budget this year for the film festival, upping the state’s annual commitment by about $1.62 million a year.
But it wasn’t enough to entice Sundance to stay.

While state leaders committed millions in funding for Sundance, other Republican lawmakers balked at the decision and were vocal about letting the film festival leave.
“Bye Felicia,” the Senate sponsor of the flag ban bill, Sen. Dan McCay, R-Riverton, posted on X in response to the Deadline article. “Sundance promotes porn. Sundance promotes alternative lifestyles. Sundance promotes anti-lds themes. Sundance does not fit in Utah anymore.”
It’s not clear how much the pride flag ban factored into festival organizers’ decision to leave Utah. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox has yet to sign or veto that bill, though Thursday is his deadline to act. He told reporters in a news conference last week Sundance organizers told leaders “very clearly that political issues have nothing to do with the decision.”
But Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall, who was involved along with other city and state leaders on Utah’s bid, told reporters Friday she worried that the flag ban could indeed jeopardize efforts to keep Sundance.
“I think there’s a strong track record of bills that have changed the outcome of locations of major sporting events and major conventions,” she said. “I think it would be harmful to our effort to retain Sundance.”
She also reiterated calls for Cox to stop the bill in its tracks.
“My encouragement from my lips to God’s ears is that Gov. Cox will veto HB77,” she said. “It is not reflective of the values of this community, of our capital city, and I think of many of the businesses who choose to locate here because of the welcoming and inclusive culture of Salt Lake City. We are an asset to the state of Utah because of our welcoming position to diversity and LGBTQIA rights.”

Insurance industry and medical lobbyists oppose the bill, HB 1181 arguing the change in law would increase automobile insurance costs for so-called “street legal” drivers, or those who carry the minimum coverage required by law. The increases could cause some to drop coverage, meaning more uninsured drivers and more strain on Florida’s health care delivery system.
  Danny Alvarez via Florida House
But bill sponsor Rep. Daniel Alvarez says the existing system, which bans injured parties from bringing lawsuits against at-fault parties to recover noneconomic damages (although there are exceptions if a person suffers a permanent loss of an important bodily function; a permanent injury; a permanent scar or disfigurement; or death) is not fair to Florida residents who are injured in car accidents that are not their fault.
Florida drivers are required to carry $10,000 in PIP coverage plus $10,000 in property damage liability insurance. Those are minimum requirements and drivers can purchase additional coverage. According to the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, just under 6% of drivers on Florida roads were uninsured as of February.
HB 1181 would drop the PIP mandate and increase the minimum bodily injury liability coverage limits from $10,000 per person and $20,000 per incident to $25,000 per person and $50,000 per incident.
“This is an insurance that affects every single person. And if something goes up, it will be temporary in my mind’s eye,” Alvarez said. 
“The doctors are not the enemy. The medical providers are not the enemy. Their concerns are real. There will be a learning curve and some growing pains. But you can’t ask me to forgo your growing pains to continue to allow Floridians to be subject to the pain. I won’t do it and I’m asking you not to.”

Tampa Bay attorney Joshua Lipton argued that PIP discriminates against motorcycle drivers, who are precluded from purchasing PIP policies because no-fault statutes apply to motor vehicles with “four wheels or more.”
“Not a single motorcyclist in here can purchase a PIP policy on his motorcycle,” he said, referring to the many motorcyclists who trekked to Tallahassee to attend the committee meeting. 
The situation is exacerbated if a motorcyclist gets involved in a wreck with “street legal drivers.”
“There’s nothing there for their lost wages, there’s nothing there for their pain and suffering, there ‘s nothing there for their medical expenses. They are thrown onto the public dole because they are hoping for emergency Medicaid. They are hoping for a charitable write-off of a hospital. None of those things are working for bikers,” Lipton said.
 What about the rates?

A  Forbes analysis of automobile insurance rates shows that Florida is the most expensive state for car insurance in the nation. But insurance lobbyists testified that rates are going down.
State Farm lobbyist Mark Delegal said PIP has been a recurring debate in the Florida Legislature. 
“For years, around this building there was a fix PIP or flush it. And there were efforts to flush it. But guess what, members? Under your leadership you have finally fixed PIP,” he said, referring to sweeping changes made by the Legislature in 2022 to how lawsuits are filed and litigated and the elimination of one-way attorney fees.
Delegal said that State Farm has in the last six months lowered its automobile insurance rates by 8%. “That’s a fact. That’s a fact,” he said.
 Been there done that

The Legislature agreed in 2021 to repeal the no-fault system and the minimum mandated coverages and return to a fault-based system, but Gov. DeSantis vetoed the bill (SB 54). In his veto letter, DeSantis that although the “PIP system has flaws,” repeal could have unintended consequences for the market and the consumer.
The 2021 bill would have  required insurers to offer medical payments coverage, known as “MedPay,” at limits of $5,000 and $10,000, but the 2025 legislation does not, so it’s not clear how by how much auto rates could increase.
Nevertheless, DeSantis earlier this month indicated he doesn’t support repeal, in part because it is supported by the Florida Justice Association, which represents trial attorneys.
“If they have a reform where we can show that it’s going to lower rates, it’s fine. But let’s just be clear. I mean, you know, we know that’s something that people from the legal and the trial bar have wanted to do,” DeSantis told reporters on the opening day of the 2025 session. 
“And so, why would they want to do that? Obviously, they see that there’s opportunities for them to make money off of it.” He added, “I don’t want to do anything that’s going to raise the rates.”
Sen. Erin Grall, sponsor of SB 1256, (the Senate companion bill) isn’t dissuaded by the governor’s comments.
“I think there are different things that have happened since the last time he vetoed it.” Grall told the Florida Phoenix. “A responsibility-based system to me is just consistent with many of the principles that he stands for. And so, I’m hopeful that we can figure out how to have an open conversation about it this session.”
HB 1181 heads to the House Insurance and Banking Subcommittee next and then onto the House Judiciary Committee. Its Senate counterpart, SB 1256, has been referred to three Senate committees but heard by none.

Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer.A bipartisan group of Minnesota lawmakers from the House Ways and Means Committee and a fraud prevention committee asked their fellow legislators to refrain from earmarking funds directly to nonprofits without a competitive grant process this year.
Legislators from both parties for years have been giving taxpayer funds directly to nonprofits to complete government work, such as preventing violence or providing food to needy families.
State agencies typically award a grant to a nonprofit after performing background checks and analyzing numerous proposals, ultimately giving it to the applicant that best meets their criteria. But Minnesota lawmakers can also go around that competitive process and directly name a nonprofit, granting funds in a budget bill through what are known as legislatively named grants.
Those grants have been fraught with problems over the years.
The letter to budget-writing lawmakers requests they stop granting money to organizations through legislatively named grants as they draft budget bills for their respective committees in the weeks ahead. The Legislature must pass a two-year budget by June 30, though the Legislature is scheduled to adjourn May 19.
“When you appropriate funds to private entities, we urge you to strongly consider having agencies use a competitive process to select those entities, rather than directly naming them in law,” lawmakers wrote.
Legislators are able to propose whatever bills they like, so there’s little stopping them from continuing to name nonprofits in bills and granting them funds — other than asking them nicely like in the Wednesday letter.
In 2023, the Democratic-Farmer-Labor-led Legislature approved over $1.1 billion in legislatively named grants to nonprofits, with some receiving more money from lawmakers than they normally get in other grants and donations in an entire year.
According to a 2023 audit, Minnesota struggles to oversee money it sends out the door. The Office of the Legislative Auditor found “pervasive noncompliance” with grant management policies, “signaling issues with accountability and oversight” of the $500 million the state sends out in a typical year.
Both competitive and legislatively named grants are supposed to go through the same type of oversight by state agencies, but the Office of the Legislative Auditor has found that agencies have failed to provide the same oversight of legislatively named grants that they do for competitive grants.
The OLA has recommended lawmakers stop using legislatively named grants since 2007, or the year the first iPhone was released.
Proponents of legislatively named grants say the practice allows smaller, less-established nonprofits an opportunity to receive state funding, as they may be disregarded in a competitive process. A competitive process can also be unnecessary if, for example, a nonprofit is the only organization in an area of Minnesota that provides a particular service, proponents say.
“Direct appropriations may be the best fit for some circumstances, such as where there is only one private entity that can meet the identified need,” the lawmakers wrote. “But this should be the rare exception, rather than a general process. Additionally, the entity should be specified by name rather than using a session-law description for which only one entity could qualify.”
Last year, Democratic lawmakers passed a bill requiring companies like Uber and Lyft to contract with a nonprofit advocacy organization to provide driver services. The bill appeared tailored to describe the Minnesota Uber/Lyft Drivers Association.

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)As federal immigration officials are eyeing New Jersey as a site to expand detention capacity, immigration advocates say they fear Union County’s proposal to sell its jail could result in the facility becoming a new migrant detention center.
The Union County Board of Commissioners will vote Thursday night on two measures that would allow the county to take steps to sell the jail property because it is “no longer needed for public use.” The county closed most operations at the jail in 2021.
While the agenda for Thursday’s meeting doesn’t explicitly say anything about immigration detention, Amy Torres, director of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, said it’s “hard to think of anyone who would want to buy a facility of that size, nor renovate a facility of that size, except for a private prison corporation.”
Union County Manager Edward Oatman said in a statement to the New Jersey Monitor that the resolution proposing the sale of the county lock-up “generated important discussion — and unfortunately, some misunderstanding — about its purpose.” Oatman stressed the resolution would merely authorize the county to issue a request for proposals — the first step in a lengthy process that includes public input. 
“While we cannot control who submits proposals, we will limit acceptable uses, in accordance with state law. If any proposals involve continued use as a correctional facility, it will be strictly confined to housing individuals involved in the criminal justice system — such as those facing charges. No other uses of that nature will be permitted,” he said. 
Torres said the Laken Riley Act — which requires federal officers to detain migrants accused but not yet convicted of crimes ranging from shoplifting to assault — could lead to some immigrants being labeled criminals without any due process. Congress approved the bill in January, and President Donald Trump signed it into law.

“I don’t want to hear that this is only for criminals because we know that ICE has been profiling people, labeling them violent criminals when they’re not and when they’ve proven not to be, and deporting them anyway or detaining them indefinitely,” she said. 
The news of the jail’s potential sale comes on the heels of federal officials announcing plans for a massive, privately run immigrant detention center at Delaney Hall in Newark. Last year, the American Civil Liberties Union obtained documents that showed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was eyeing another location in Trenton as a potential detention center. 
Federal officials under both the Trump and Biden administrations have said North Jersey is a prime location to house immigrant detainees because of its proximity to Newark’s airport and immigration courts in Manhattan.
Immigration enforcement efforts have ramped up across the country as Trump moves to carry out his campaign promise of mass deportation of undocumented immigrants. According to ICE, officials made more than 32,000 enforcement-related arrests between Trump’s second inauguration and March 13.
The Union County jail is a roughly 1,000-bed facility located in the heart of Elizabeth. It has been largely empty since 2021, when the county approved closing it as a cost-saving move (it said savings would amount to $103 million over five years).
A 2021 state law bars public entities from entering into contracts to house immigrant detainees, but a provision of the law that also barred private entities from doing so has been ruled unconstitutional. The state has appealed the ruling, and the appeal is scheduled to be heard by an appellate court in about a month.
Oatman said that as county manager, he’s looking for ways to generate “meaningful tax relief — potentially upwards of $100 million — while ensuring any future use of the property aligns with the needs and values of our community.” 
He said he hopes the request attracts a diverse group of bidders from a variety of industries. He also noted that demolishing the facility would cost tens of millions of dollars, and repurposing it could cost millions per floor. 
Torres said it’s unlikely that a non-prison operator would be interested in buying the Union County jail. Commissioners should be looking at how to repurpose it for the community instead of “rolling out the red carpet for private prison corporations,” she said. 
“In an imaginary world, it can be bought by anyone and turned into anything, but we don’t live in an imaginary world, we live in reality. And the reality is that ICE and private prison companies are looking to score additional sites for immigration detention,” she said.
Torres said the possible unveiling of yet another new detention center in New Jersey — there’s an existing immigrant jail in Elizabeth — would be detrimental to the diverse community, where over a third of residents are immigrants. The city doesn’t want to be known as the immigrant detention capital of America, she added.
“This isn’t deep south Florida. This is New Jersey, and I feel like that is not something that is reflective of our values of the state,” Torres said. “I hope it’s not something that’s reflective of the values of Union County, but I guess maybe it is.”
The state Attorney General’s Office did not return a request for comment. It has previously said that private detention centers “threaten the public health and safety of New Jerseyans, including when used for immigration purposes.”",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_9585-1024x716.jpg,,,2025-03-27 16:04:13.533572

(File photo by Getty Images)COLUMBIA — A U.S. Army veteran from South Carolina was shot and injured in combat while serving in Afghanistan, earning the man a Purple Heart medal.
But war took its toll. When he came home to Columbia, to his wife and twin daughters, he was a different man. Doctors diagnosed him with post-traumatic stress disorder.
The effects of the disease ultimately broke up the marriage. The soldier broke contact with his family and moved out of the state.
In leaving, he took the one remaining thing he could impart to children — a free college education at one of South Carolina’s public universities.
SC colleges have frozen tuition for several years. University presidents say that’s not sustainable.

State Rep. Seth Rose wants to change that.
“We’re trying to close a loophole,” the Columbia Democrat said.
Under state law, South Carolina waives tuition at its 33 public colleges and universities for the children of veterans who are missing or killed in action, die from injuries related to service, are a prisoner of war, are permanently or totally disabled by their service, or are awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor or a Purple Heart.
But for their children to qualify, that veteran and their kids must currently live in South Carolina and have been a resident for at least one year. In the case of a soldier who dies in combat, they must have deployed from and been a resident of the state at the time of their death.
The two girls Rose spoke of Wednesday are currently high school sophomores in Columbia. They’re not yet sure what they want to study but they’re considering attending Clemson University, Lander University or the College of Charleston.
Their father’s move means they will now have to cover their own tuition costs, unless the law changes.
“It’s not just the veteran who suffers when they have a mental injury from serving in the armed forces and they’re wounded in action, it’s the entire family,” Rose said. “These two young girls, their relationship with their father, was forever changed because of his service and his post-traumatic stress syndrome.”
Last school semester, the state Department of Veterans Affairs received 3,643 requests for tuition waivers from the children of South Carolina veterans, agency Secretary Todd McCaffrey told a House panel considering the bill Wednesday. Those waivers are worth about $36 million annually.
Changing the residency requirements is not expected to change those numbers significantly.
But it would make a big difference for those two girls, Rose said.

“It’s a very valued program to the veteran community,” McCaffrey said. “What makes South Carolina such a great state for veterans is a program like this.”
Other members of the House panel — Republican Rep. Bobby Cox, who is a former U.S. Army Ranger from Greer, and Repbulican Rep. Joe White, who is a U.S. Air Force veteran from Prosperity — agreed with Rose and said they’d like to find ways to expand the program even further.

But Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita claims that the two entities deceived Hoosiers by “secretly collecting and selling Indiana drivers’ personal data to third parties,” a practice he says led to higher insurance rates that benefitted the companies.
“Everyone deserves transparency and honesty from the companies they do business with, especially when it comes to having their data protected,” Rokita said in a Thursday release. “General Motors and OnStar turned a supposed safety feature into a way to make money, profiting off Indiana drivers without their knowledge. We’re taking action to hold them accountable and protect our consumers from these deceptive practices.”

OnStar LLC, a subsidiary of General Motors LLC, offers a “Smart Driver” system that the companies said would maximize vehicle performance and reduce wear and tear, according to an archived webpage cited in the lawsuit. 
Rokita filed a civil case with the Marion Superior Court on March 19. A docket from MyCase shows that while a subpoena and summons have been filed, the company hasn’t yet responded to the claims. 
The tracking software documents the following, according to the complaint: geolocation, route history, driving schedule, fuel or charging levels, hard braking events, hard acceleration events, tailgating, time spent idle, speeds over 80 mph, average speed, late-night driving and driver attention.
Rokita asserts that the above information is sold to data brokers, who then create risk profiles and driving scores to sell to insurers, which charge higher premiums or even cancel policies.
Additionally, the complaint alleges that General Motors “coerced” Hoosiers into activating OnStar without informing customers of its data practices. Doing so could be a violation of the Indiana Deceptive Consumer Sales Act. 
According to its website, GM operated 124 dealerships statewide as of Jan. 1, 2024 and sold more than 61,000 vehicles in Indiana in 2023. 
The office’s release goes on to say that Rokita is seeking a permanent injunction and civil penalties alongside consumer restitution and “other relief.”
“Hoosiers were secretly misled and used,” Rokita said. “Their actions are unacceptable and we’re fighting back to ensure this type of behavior never happens again.”

Angel Charley, D-Acoma, and Rep. Michelle Paulene Abeyta, D-To’hajiilee, prepare to introduce Senate Bill 41, creating a Turquoise Alert system, on Feb. 7, 2025. (Bella Davis/New Mexico In Depth)New Mexico is set to become the fourth state to create an alert system meant to help find Native Americans who have gone missing. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham plans to sign Senate Bill 41 into law, establishing a Turquoise Alert system, according to her office, after the bill passed both chambers of the Legislature unanimously.
Operating much like the state’s Amber Alert system for abducted children, Turquoise Alerts would be issued for people who are enrolled in or eligible for enrollment in a federally or state-recognized tribe and are missing under unexplained or suspicious circumstances or are at heightened risk due to health concerns or disabilities.
Colorado, California and Washington have established similar alerts. Since Washington’s system was created in 2022, 114 alerts had gone out as of August last year, and 111 of those people were located, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported.

Lawmakers in New Mexico have passed a couple other bills in recent years responding to a national crisis of Indigenous people disproportionately going missing and being killed. There are 186 Indigenous people missing from the state, according to the state Department of Justice, and the average number of days missing is 1,662, or about four and a half years.
The alert is especially needed on reservations, where jurisdictional confusion and understaffed law enforcement agencies are major obstacles to public safety, said Rep. Michelle Paulene Abeyta (Diné), a Democrat from To’hajiilee and one of the bill’s sponsors.
“When someone goes missing, we’re combining our own resources outside of law enforcement and any actual government-run entity to try to locate our missing loved ones,” Abeyta said Monday in an interview. “We know how important this is and how the lack of resources just isn’t fair for us and the jurisdictional issues that get in the way. It’s not right.”
In the ‘90s, when she was a child, Abeyta’s mother went missing. She was taken to a remote area and “beaten and left to die,” Abeyta said, before being found a few days later by a person who happened to be in the area. She was brought to a hospital and survived, but her recovery was difficult.
Abeyta and her co-sponsor Sen. Angel Charley (Laguna/Zuni/Diné), D-Acoma, are “excited to see how this is going to help improve the lives of so many families that for a long time needed some type of solution, some type of resource to go to,” Abeyta said.
While helping solve logistical barriers, the alert system would also raise awareness about the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous people, Charley said in an interview Friday.
Charley, who used to be the executive director of the Coalition to Stop Violence Against Native Women, referenced Ashlynne Mike, an 11-year-old Diné girl who was kidnapped and murdered in northwestern New Mexico, on the Navajo Nation, in 2016. Law enforcement didn’t issue an Amber Alert until the day after she went missing due to “misunderstandings and jurisdictional hurdles,” according to the Justice Department.
“You never know if coordination would have happened in a way that was quick and efficient” if there had been greater awareness at the time, Charley said. After lawmakers passed the bill last week, Ashlynne’s father contacted Charley, telling her he was going to write to Lujan Grisham and urge her to sign it.
“We do not want other families to go through the trauma we felt,” he wrote in a message Charley shared with New Mexico In Depth with his permission.
Indigenous advocates, tribal leaders and police, and lobbyists representing several pueblos also spoke in support of the bill during the session.
The bill requires the Department of Public Safety to develop a plan for getting alerts out as quickly as possible and keeping records on each alert, with information including the municipality where the missing person report was made, the date the alert was issued and the date the missing person is recovered.
“Too many Native American families have faced crisis and the heartbreak of a loved one disappearing without the swift response they deserve,” Indian Affairs Secretary Josett Monette, whose agency developed the bill, said in a statement. “The Turquoise Alert system is a critical step forward in ensuring that missing Native American people are prioritized in the same way as other emergency alerts.”
The alert aligns with a state response plan issued by a task force in 2022, Monette told lawmakers last month.
That now-defunct task force discussed an alert system for missing Indigenous people, said Darlene Gomez, a task force member and attorney who represents affected families. Gomez suggested that New Mexico should create such an alert during public comment at a December meeting of a new state task force focused on the crisis.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7783-1-1920x1280-1-1024x683.webp,,,2025-03-27 16:04:13.533572

They said they’ve changed their training to emphasize that reporters should stop confusing poverty with “neglect.” 
Substantively, this will change little, since professionals still will be afraid not to report anything and everything. But the statement is a tacit admission of what research has shown about laws put in place decades ago with no studies to see if they would work: Mandatory reporting backfires. It drives families away from seeking help, and overloads the system with false reports, making it harder to find the relatively few children in real danger. Many one-time proponents have had second thoughts.
But instead of heeding the research and replacing mandatory reporting with permissive reporting, in which professionals are free to exercise their professional judgment, many Washington state lawmakers want to careen full-speed backward. They want to expand mandatory reporting even further, to one of the few fields where it doesn’t apply now: the clergy, including anything heard in confession. Legislation to do this has passed the state Senate and emerged from committee in the House.
But that, too, would backfire. 
The reason expanding mandatory reporting to clergy has support in some quarters is obvious: What comes to mind when you hear the words clergy and child abuse? Likely, the sprawling sexual abuse scandal and cover-up within the Catholic Church.  But with expanded mandatory reporting, pedophile priests either will stop confessing or go to a church where their voices won’t be recognized.
It can also harm survivors, who sometimes first disclose their abuse in confession.  
“The Seal offers victims a safe, secure and watertight place where they can be listened to without cost, where they can remain anonymous, and can decide what they’re ready, and not ready, to share – and all of this in complete confidence,” said a spokesman for a group representing survivors of abuse in Australia, where there’ve been similar campaigns to end the exemption for the confessional.“The Confessional Seal as it presently stands literally saves lives and offers every abuse victim the chance to begin to heal.”
Now consider some hypotheticals about others who might be affected.

 A mother is terrified. She’s being beaten by her husband. But when she threatened to go to the police, he said: “Go ahead, call the cops! They’ll just call DCYF, and they’ll take away the kids.” She turns to her priest/minister/rabbi/imam and says: “Please help me to escape. Where can I turn to protect myself and my children?” The clergyman replies: “I’m so sorry. I’m now a mandated reporter, and you may have allowed your child to ‘witness domestic violence’ if he saw or heard you being beaten. So I have to call DCYF.”


 A single mother enters the confessional: “Forgive me, father, for I have sinned,” she says. She says she’s guilt-ridden for having left her child home alone when she went to work and her regular child care arrangement fell through. She didn’t know what else to do. Her boss said he’d fire her if she didn’t show up; then she wouldn’t be able to afford the rent and the family would be evicted. After the priest prescribes the appropriate acts of contrition, the mother asks a question: Might the priest know someone in the congregation who could volunteer to provide child care if this ever happened again? “As a matter of fact, I do,” the priest replies. “But it’s too late to do only that. You see, I am now a mandated reporter of child abuse. What you did can be considered ‘lack of supervision.’ So I have to report you to DCYF.”

The fact that the current Washington state bill doesn’t require priests to say who confessed changes none of this.
As it stands now, clergy are among the only helpers to whom impoverished families can turn with less fear that they will be turned in to DCYF. Once the word gets around that even the confessional isn’t safe, you can bet that parents like those in the hypotheticals above won’t come forward and ask for help. Children at risk from pedophile clergy won’t get any safer, and children whose families’ “crime” is poverty will be cut off from a potential source of support. 
Of course, it’s not a crime for lawmakers to rush into endorsing bad policy that doesn’t have a prayer of stopping actual child abuse because it sounds good in a press release. But it sure seems like a sin.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/church-windows-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-03-27 15:03:31.042549

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)A bill to loosen defamation lawsuit restrictions advanced in the Florida House Thursday, with support from Democrats who said they’d been targets of false information spread online.
For three years, the Florida Legislature has considered GOP-backed bills making it easier to sue news organizations for defamation, but this proposal is drawing wider support from Democrats, with Tallahassee Democratic Rep. Allison Tant co-sponsoring the House measure.
The Senate and House proposals (SB 752 and HB 667) would compel news outlets to take down content from their websites within days of notification that the published information is false or outdated. Failure to remove the content would open them to defamation suits.
St. Petersburg Democratic Rep. Michele Rayner supports the bill, saying she didn’t understand why the media would want to keep false information on the internet.
“I’ve had people get on the internet and say atrocious things about me, things that are actually not true, and I’ve had to sit here and say, ‘Well, can’t do anything about it,'” Rayner said. “And I’m a state representative lawyer. I could file my own motion and do what I needed to do.”
The House Civil Justice & Claims Subcommittee advanced the bill unanimously, with four Democrats in support, despite warnings it amounts to censorship.
The bill was inspired by the case of a Miami man who’d been accused of molesting a child only to see the charges dropped. A TV station refused his request to scrub the story from its website.
“Sometimes innocence doesn’t erase the fact that an arrest and charge occurred,” said Bobby Block, executive director of the First Amendment Foundation. “They may be inconvenient facts, but they are true. If we were to buy into this bill’s logic, we would have to erase the OJ Simpson car chases and every report on Casey Anthony from history.”
Barry Richard, a prominent Tallahassee lawyer who represented that Miami man, said the change is necessary because of the permanence of the internet. Richard is married to Tant, the House co-sponsor. The proposal would allow suits for up to 20 years after the publication of an article.
“If you now have reason to know it’s not true, you can’t keep it up. What is the public interest in keeping this story up for seven years and ruining a person’s life?” Barry asked the panel Thursday.
Democrats’ support for the bill has been more limited in the Senate, where only Rosalind Osgood, of Broward County, has supported it in committee.

S.B. 1 would set rules around classroom discussion, create post-tenure reviews, put diversity scholarships at risk, create a retrenchment provision that blocks unions from negotiating on tenure, shorten university board of trustees terms from nine years down to six years, and require students take an American history course, among other things.
For classroom discussion, the bill would set rules around topics involving “controversial beliefs” such as climate policies, electoral politics, foreign policy, diversity and inclusion programs, immigration policy, marriage, or abortion, and forbid “indoctrination,” though that remains undefined. S.B. 1 would only affect Ohio’s public universities.
“Republicans showed us they’d rather gamble with our economic future than solve real problems in our state,” Ohio Democratic Party Chair Elizabeth Walters said in a statement. “Instead of growing our state, Republicans are driving students, young adults, and business away from Ohio. We’re urging Governor DeWine to do the right thing and veto this legislation.”
Students say they will leave Ohio if lawmakers go forward with massive higher education overhaul

The Ohio Senate Democratic Caucus sent a letter to DeWine urging him to veto S.B. 1.
“This legislation is a misguided attempt by overreaching legislators to impose their ideological beliefs on our public universities,” the letter said. “The bill undermines academic freedom, attacks collective bargaining rights, and jeopardizes the future of higher education in our state.”
The Ohio House Minority Caucus also sent a letter to DeWine asking him to veto the bill. 
“You have an opportunity to protect the future of Ohio’s institutions of higher education, and your legacy as Ohio’s governor, by vetoing this bill and requiring the legislature to negate terms that are more amenable to the will of Ohioans,” the letter read.
The ACLU of Ohio wants DeWine to veto S.B. 1 and protect free speech on campus.
“By dismantling DEI structures, Senate Bill 1 sends a clear, harmful message to students that their unique backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives are not welcome in Ohio,” ACLU of Ohio Policy Director Jocelyn Rosnick said in a statement.
Anticipating S.B. 1 would pass during Wednesday’s Senate session, members of the Ohio Legislative Black Caucus urged DeWine to veto S.B. 1 during a press conference earlier that day.
“This is one of the worst government overhauls that I’ve seen to date,” said state Rep. Terrence Upchurch, D-Cleveland. “It will not only limit our First Amendment right to free speech, ban strikes and collective bargaining rights for professors, it threatens opportunities for our students, undermines workforce development and disproportionately harms black and minority communities.”
State Rep. Desiree Tims, D-Dayton, said S.B. 1 is toxic, racist and a threat to free speech and academic freedom.
“Since when is diversity, equity and inclusion a bad thing?” she asked. “Why is this necessary? The only answer is, so that we can move backwards, pre-civil rights … progress that this country and this nation has stood for. … Senate Bill 1 turns the ugly page back in history, somewhere we do not want to go, where we should not go.”
Ohio University Journalism School Director Eddith Dashiell talked about how the university’s journalism school did not give out 12 race-based scholarships totaling $46,000 last year after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against race-conscious admissions in 2023.
More than 800 people submit testimony against Ohio’s massive higher education overhaul bill

“The diversity scholarships weren’t designed to discriminate against white students,” she said. “The diversity scholarships were designed to encourage more students of color to come to little old, white Athens, Ohio and get a quality education.”
S.B. 1 will be detrimental to Ohio’s higher education, Dashiell said.
“If it hadn’t been for an extra effort at Ohio University to diversify the faculty, I would still be in Tennessee,” she said. “We also urge that Governor DeWine veto this bill because it’s going to hurt our students. It’s going to hurt those who will benefit from diversity programs and benefit from these diversity scholarships.”
Ohio State University’s Chair of the Undergraduate Black Caucus Jessica Asante-Tutu said this bill runs the risk of forcing Ohioans to move out of state.
“Students learn best in environments that encourage exchanges, where ideas flow freely and where differences are respected,” she said. “This bill stifles all of that.”
As an Olentangy Liberty High School student in Delaware County, Michelle Huang said S.B. 1 hangs over her head as she thinks about applying for colleges this fall.
“The threat of this bill passing is a deterrent from us attending Ohio State in the first place,” she said. “What DEI is actually doing is actually promoting more discourse and promoting more intellectual diversity.”

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source New Mexico)Sponsors and advocates who had hoped to see reforms for New Mexico’s board governing parole continue to question the rationale behind Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s Saturday veto.
Senate Bill 17 would have enacted a series of changes to professionalize the New Mexico Parole Board, and change how its members consider incarcerated people’s requests for release.
At the all-volunteer board’s quarterly public meeting on Tuesday, Chair Abram Anaya said SB17 would have allowed its members “to do some really wonderful things” like receive payment for their work and require the governor to have cause to remove them “like every other board.”
“We’re one of the only ones at the whim of the governor,” said Anaya, who has been on the board for 13 years.
Not only did the bill aim to change the board, it also sought to reform the larger system of parole.
Parole Board Director Roberta Cohen said Tuesday the veto isn’t the outcome members hoped for, but added, “Maybe we’ll take a look at it if there’s a special session or next year in the 30-day session.”
Lujan Grisham wrote in the veto message that she believes the parole board should be a state agency so members can be paid for their work and have their positions protected as state employees. She wrote that to accomplish this, she commits to submitting a special message authorizing lawmakers to debate the proposal during next year’s 30-day session.
Protections ‘mirrored standard language,’ sponsor says
Lujan Grisham wrote in her veto message that while she supports modernizing the board’s metrics for hearing parole requests, she disagreed with part of the legislation that would have made it harder for the executive branch to remove members of the Parole Board.
Currently, state law allows the governor to remove members at will. She wrote that SB17 would have made it “virtually impossible” to remove them.
In a written statement to Source NM, SB17 co-sponsor Rep. Andrea Romero (D-Santa Fe) called Lujan Grisham’s veto “especially perplexing” because it disregarded the broad consensus on the bill and “misrepresented a key provision” about board member removal.
Romero said the Legislature has long protected members of boards and commissions from arbitrary removal and SB17 “simply mirrored standard language already present in numerous New Mexico board and commission statutes.”
“These due process protections were not only reasonable; they were consistent with existing law and the fundamental fairness that our parole board members deserve,” she said.
Indeed, the language the governor characterized as unworkable in her veto message already protects members of the Ethics Commission, the Nursing Board, the Pharmacy Board, the Optometry Board, the Lottery Authority, the Architects Board, the Engineering and Surveying Board, the Landscape Architects Board, the Social Work Board and the Physical Therapy Board.
Romero told Source NM that SB17’s sponsors spent a lot of time and energy before the session talking with stakeholders to ensure the bill was based on evidence, responsive to crime victims’ needs and bipartisan in nature.
“We were proud to bring such a well-vetted bill to the 60-day session, particularly in a time of deep political polarization around public safety,” she said.
Romero, Sen. Leo Jaramillo (D-Española) and Rep. Nicole Chavez (R-Albuquerque) carried the bill, which the House of Representatives unanimously passed on Feb. 19 and the Senate pas passed on March 17.
Romero pointed out that SB17 “brought together advocates, agencies, and stakeholders who are often on opposing sides of these issues.”
Before voters sent Chavez to the Roundhouse, she often testified on bills as a victims’ rights advocate. She told Source NM in a text message on Thursday that as a lawmaker and a victim of crime, she is deeply disheartened by the veto.
“I remain committed to working across party lines to get this done because public safety and justice should never be partisan issues,” she said.

Parole politics
The protection offered by SB17 would have shielded board members from arbitrary or politically motivated removal while maintaining their accountability to professional standards and legal obligations, the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico said in a news release reacting to the veto on Saturday.
When Source NM sent the Parole Board an email seeking an interview with either Cohen or Anaya about the veto, a spokesperson for the New Mexico Corrections Department sent a statement on the board’s behalf that directed Source NM to the governor’s veto message.
“The New Mexico Parole Board fully stands by the contents of this message,” said Corrections Department Public Information Officer Brittany Roembach.
Lena Weber, ACLU-NM’s interim policy director, said Lujan Grisham’s veto message “embodies the very kind of executive attitude we hoped to protect the parole board from in passing SB17.”
“To now have the governor defend her power to remove public officers without cause by vetoing legislation that received overwhelming support is deeply disappointing,” ACLU-NM staff attorney Denali Wilson, who helped draft SB17, said in the statement.
Sheila Lewis, a former Parole Board chair whom Lujan Grisham removed in 2020, told Source NM she thinks it’s a mistake to have board members fearful of losing their appointment because they make difficult decisions, even when they’re the right one.
“It does put a damper on the decision-making process,” Lewis said.
SB17 wasn’t the only bill dealing with the governor’s power to remove public officials that was affected by Lujan Grisham’s veto this session. She also struck part of Senate Bill 5, which would have enacted similar protections for members of the New Mexico Game Commission.
Brittany Fallon, a policy manager with Western Resource Advocates, told Source NM on Thursday both pieces of legislation were bipartisan, instituted a public removal process for public officials, were negotiated with the governor’s office and the relevant state agencies and accepted amendments from the governor’s office.
“She had ample opportunity to weigh in and didn’t in both cases,” Fallon said. “It’s not really about the Game Commission, it’s about executive power, which is the same with the Parole Board bill.”
Punishment versus rehabilitation
Aside from the board member provisions, SB17 would have updated the factors board members consider when making a parole decision and ensured more considerate scheduling of hearings for victims’ families, ACLU-NM said on Saturday.
Weber said for New Mexico’s parole system to function, it’s critical for board members to not fear losing their position “simply because they aren’t politically aligned with the governor.”
“By vetoing SB17, the governor has chosen to reject common-sense reforms and insisted on preserving her unilateral removal authority, forcing our parole system to continue operating under antiquated standards that fail to properly consider evidence of rehabilitation and readiness for reentry,” she said.
Lewis told Source NM the reforms proposed in SB17 were more important than the board member protections but have been “lost in the shuffle” because of the veto. New Mexico law on this issue originally intended for the punishment phase of a prison sentence to end after three decades, “but it was never clearly articulated,” said Lewis, a former public defender.
The bill would have clearly told the parole board to stop looking back at someone’s crime and instead consider whether they’re ready to reenter society, she said.
“I’ve been doing this my whole life, for over 40 years, and there are lots of people I don’t want to see out of prison but the people who I’ve been dealing with who’ve served life in prison, are really kind of extraordinary people,” Lewis said. “They’ve made tremendous changes, and they’ve done tremendous work within the institution.”

(UMaine photo)As graduate student enrollment reaches record highs, the University of Maine is pausing financial offers to those seeking advanced degrees for the next academic year, including paid research and teaching assistantships.
That decision was made because of federal funding cuts to research and universities, and no increases budgeted in the biennial budget to the state’s public universities, according to a statement the university system released Thursday.
Hundreds of students rely on financial support throughout their graduate education, including stipends, tuition waivers and health care benefits. In exchange, graduate students teach undergraduates and conduct research. Nearly one in four UMaine graduate students this year receive paid assistantships, based on this year’s data.
While UMaine will continue to offer admissions to new students and honor current financial awards, the latter is contingent on continued availability of federal funding.
UMaine is not alone in facing financial challenges because of the Trump administration’s attempted cuts to research budgets. Universities nationwide are implementing cost-cutting measures amid federal funding uncertainties. For instance, Columbia University and Johns Hopkins University have experienced significant funding withdrawals, leading to hiring freezes, mass layoffs and policy changes. 
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has proposed reducing reimbursements for research-related costs, leading many universities to scale back or in some uncommon cases, cut their Ph.D. programs. System spokesperson Samantha Warren clarified that UMaine’s pause is on financial offers, not admissions. About half of the assistantships at UMaine are held by Ph.D. students.
It is unclear how the freeze on paid assistantships at UMaine will impact systemwide graduate student enrollment, which has been on the rise in recent years, increasing by 17% over the past five years to 6,999 students pursuing master’s degrees and doctorates this year. 
Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Agriculture temporarily paused almost $30 million in funding to the university system while evaluating its compliance with federal laws that ban race and sex-based discrimination. Although that funding was restored and the system was deemed to be in compliance, that indicated the precarious nature of higher education funding, as even a temporary pause was expected to affect numerous research and extension projects that benefit Maine’s natural resource economy and communities, according to a previous statement.
UMaine plans to provide an update on the financial offer pause in early April, ahead of the traditional April 15 “decision day” when graduate students must decide whether to enroll in a graduate program.

Titled the “College Affordability Act,” House File 440 would require the Iowa Board of Regents to complete a feasibility study on the potential of locking in a resident student’s tuition price in their first year, ensuring they won’t see increases in the next three years of their undergraduate study.
The bill would also require the board of regents to approve any tuition increases as April 30 of the previous fiscal year. State universities also would have to develop at least one three-year bachelor’s degree program and one work study program for students to work part time while attending school, paid for by their employer.

Iowa Board of Regents State Relations Officer Carolann Jensen said the board has already or will complete the directives set in the bill without it needing to be passed into law.
“The board supports the bill, but we don’t think it’s necessary,” Jensen said.
A previous version of the legislation included language that would have capped tuition increases at 3% and required universities to lock in a student’s tuition in their first year of study so it wouldn’t increase in later years, rather than having universities conduct a study on the topic. However, an amendment adopted during House debate took out these provisions.
Senate File 243, the companion to House File 440, still includes sections on capping and freezing tuition. It was recommended for passage by a subcommittee Feb. 19.
Sen. Herman Quirmbach, D-Ames, said he would sign off on the bill, but added he’d like to see an amendment to allow an exception to the April 30 deadline to set tuition increases if state allocations to universities have not been determined by that time.
Quirmbach said he was happy to see the legislation back off from setting tuition caps and freezes, as setting tuition in a way that will ensure university budgets are balanced would become more complicated, and could result in front-loaded, higher prices.
Trying to set a tuition price for the next four years rather than just the next year would be difficult, Quirmbach said, with institutions not knowing projected enrollment, changing costs and markets and what state appropriations will look like in the future.
“I think that there are serious problems trying to achieve that,” Quirmbach said.
Sen. Doug Campbell, R-Mason City, said he thinks House File 440 is a great piece of legislation for Iowa.
“I like to see this coming forward for the students in the state of Iowa,” Campbell said.

State Treasurer Brad Briner said the department is using the OpenAI product to identify businesses with unclaimed property and analyze local government financial data.
The office is a repository for unclaimed money from bank accounts, insurance policies and other sources, and seeks to find the people and institutions who own it. The department’s State and Local Government Finance Division monitors the fiscal health of local governments and government entities and approves their requests to borrow money. 
ChatGPT won’t replace employees, Briner said, and the agency is using OpenAI’s product at no cost. 
“Imagine the time saved when ChatGPT can help summarize reports, identify warning signs in local government financial audits, or do deep data searches for unclaimed property,” he said. “This allows our team of dedicated professionals to focus on higher-level strategic decision making and financial stewardship. ChatGPT is not replacing human expertise. It is augmenting our capabilities and enabling us to make more informed data-driven decisions.”
ChatGPT won’t have access to private, personal data, Briner said. His office oversees the health plan for state employees. 
Briner made the announcement at NC Central University, which has an Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Equity Research. 
Chan Park, head of U.S. and Canada Policy and Partnerships at OpenAI, Ronnie Chatterji, OpenAI’s chief economist, and NCCU Provost Ontario Wooden joined Briner at the announcement. Chatterji was once a candidate for state Treasurer and worked for former President Barack Obama. 
Pennsylvania announced a ChatGPT Enterprise pilot program last year, and Minnesota is using ChatGPT in its translation office.
The treasurer and people working at the department have important jobs serving the public, Chatterji said.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)The Ohio House has voted to repeal aspects of scandal-ridden legislation that force ratepayers to spend hundreds of millions per year on two unprofitable coal plants, one of which is out-of-state.
The largest scandal in state history revolved around bribery legislation from 2019 called Ohio House Bill 6.
Part of it provided subsidies that require ratepayers to fund two Ohio Valley Electric Coalition (OVEC) coal plants — one that is in Indiana. The main beneficiaries for OVEC are American Electric Power Company (AEP), Duke Energy, and AES Ohio. FirstEnergy collects payment.
Lawmakers on Wedesday passed bipartisan H.B. 15, which, in part, would revoke those subsidies. The bill passed nearly unanimously.
Ohio House approves sweeping energy generation bill

“I have spent my entire time in this building, for the last almost five years, working in the shadow of House Bill 6… House Bill 6 was a tax then. It’s a tax now and we can finally put this entire ridiculous episode behind us by voting yes today on House Bill 15,” said House Finance Chair Brian Stewart, R-Ashville.
He was joined by several Democrats and state Rep. Josh Williams in their argument against the taxes on Ohioans and corruption.
“The band-aid needs to be ripped off; the state of Ohio needs to recover,” Williams said. “We need to survive past this scandal, and this is the last pillar of the largest scandal in our state’s history, and this industry should understand that when you go behind closed doors and bribe a member of this chamber, including the speaker, that any deal you got as a result is gonna be null and void when that bribe is discovered.”
Only three voted against it — former Speaker Jason Stephens, R-Kitts Hill, and state Reps. Don Jones, R-Freeport, and Latyna Humphrey, D-Columbus.
“I understand and respect your— the corruption that everyone wants to attach to House Bill 6,” Jones said. “I was here for House Bill 6 — it’s the lens in which you look at it through.”
He continued that his county has about 700 coal miners who rely on these plants.
Some lawmakers, like Stewart and state Rep. Ron Ferguson, R-Wintersville, had been trying to eliminate the subsidies but were blocked by then-Speaker Stephens. With Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, in leadership, it was created and then passed.
Stephens spoke on the floor arguing against the repeal, noting that one of the OVEC plants is in his district.
“To say we have not looked at this since House Bill 6 is simply not true,” he said. “When Ohio makes a promise, whether we like the promise or not… We should honor that.”
He explained that in the previous General Assembly, part of H.B. 6 was repealed, but the lawmakers chose to keep the coal plant money. Then in the 134th G.A., lawmakers passed H.B. 128 — which took out funding for nuclear power plants.
But this is Huffman’s time now.
“This money doesn’t go to Lawrence County to help that plant,” the speaker told reporters after the vote, referencing Stephens’ comments. “It goes in Duke’s checking account in Charlotte, North Carolina, and they decide over many states, not necessarily to spend any money.”
These taxpayer hikes need to be gone immediately, he added earlier in the day.
“These companies are getting billions and billions of dollars of rates paid to them by many ratepayers over states,” Huffman said.
How we got here
Back in 2019, former House Speaker Larry Householder, now a convicted felon, funneled $61 million worth of bribes in exchange for legislation to give FirstEnergy a $1 billion bailout at taxpayer expense.
Attorney: ex-Ohio Speaker Larry Householder using Trump ‘connections’ to try to get out of prison

In March 2023, a jury found that Householder and former GOP leader Matt Borges, beyond a reasonable doubt, participated in the racketeering scheme.
In late June that year, federal judge Timothy Black sentenced Householder to 20 years in prison. Borges got five years. The two surviving defendants — Jeff Longstreth and Juan Cespedes — took plea agreements early on, helping the FBI, and are still awaiting their sentencing. The feds are asking for zero to six months for them.
Former FirstEnergy CEO Chuck Jones, former FirstEnergy Senior Vice President Michael Dowling, and former Public Utilities Commission Chair Sam Randazzo were all hit with state bribery charges. Each pleaded not guilty during their joint arraignment in mid-February 2024. They are accused of masterminding the corruption scheme.
In April 2024, Randazzo would become the second defendant accused in the scandal to die by suicide. Neil Clark, a lobbyist accused of bribery, killed himself after pleading not guilty in 2021.
Recently, Householder’s attorney said that his team plans to use their connection to President-elect Donald Trump to try to get out of prison.
A study commissioned by the Ohio Manufacturers’ Association found that in 2024 alone, these subsidies cost ratepayers roughly $200 million. The company lost more than $100 million the same year, so consumers are paying for plants that aren’t profitable.
“HB 6’s OVEC subsidies currently require Ohio’s residential utility customers to pay between $1.30 and $1.50 per month, depending on whether their utility is owned by AEP, AES Ohio, Duke Energy or FirstEnergy,” according to the Energy News Network.
This has been happening for years, with no change from the Statehouse until now.
In the summer of 2024, we discovered and reported on more texts alleging that the governor and lieutenant governor helped push forward H.B. 6 and got a playbook from FirstEnergy on how to convince others, according to FirstEnergy executives.
“When you’re dealing with any issue in regard to utilities, any issue in regard to energy — there’s always the question, ‘Who pays?’ and the goal, of course, is always to be as fair as as you can,” DeWine told reporters in January.
Questioned about fairness as it relates to the coal subsidies, DeWine responded, “Yeah… I’m fine if that is certainly taken out.”

An agenda for the meeting was posted online 19 minutes late Wednesday, though it was physically posted on time at the Oklahoma State Department of Education, where the meeting would have taken place at 1 p.m. Thursday, state Superintendent Ryan Walters confirmed. 
The Oklahoma Open Meeting Act requires public meeting agendas to be posted online and at the meeting location at least 24 hours in advance.
Some members of the Oklahoma State Board of Education “expressed reservation due to a potential Open Meetings Act violation,” though their attorney advised the meeting could continue, Walters said in a statement through a spokesperson.

“Out of an abundance of caution the board meeting for March will be scheduled for April 24th, 2025, which is the next scheduled board meeting date,” Walters said.
Walters’ statement appears to point blame at another state agency. He said the agenda was sent to the Office of Management and Enterprise Services for posting ahead of the deadline.
It is “dishonest and misleading” to characterize this as an OMES error, agency spokesperson Christa Helfrey said.
The OMES employee responsible for posting agendas for the state Board of Education is embedded within the state Department of Education and “is managed by OSDE daily,” Helfrey said.
Education Department staff emailed this employee only six minutes before the final deadline for the agenda to be posted, Helfrey said. The employee posted the agenda 20 minutes later.
“It’s important to note, OSDE is responsible for the development of its meetings and agendas and allowing enough reasonable time to post those agendas so that the public may receive notice and attend the open meeting,” Helfrey said.
Canceling a public meeting over concerns of an untimely posted agenda is in compliance with state law, the Oklahoma Attorney General’s Office said through its spokesperson, Phil Bacharach.
The state superintendent serves as chairperson of the state Board of Education and decides which matters the board will discuss during meetings. His control of meeting agendas caused friction with recent appointees to the board and prompted legislation that could affect all school boards in Oklahoma.
The state House passed a bill on Wednesday allowing two members of the state board, and on any district school board with five or more members, to place an item on a meeting agenda by submitting a written request.
The state board’s March meeting agenda included potential votes on waiving regulations to allow six districts to have under the minimum number of 165 school days next school year. Another two districts requested permission to employ substitute teachers for an extra number of school days.
Among other administrative matters, the board would have considered whether to suspend multiple teacher certifications, the agenda shows.
  Oklahoma State Board of Education member Chris Vandenhende proposed during a Feb. 27 meeting that the board schedule a vote on suspending “all activity related to immigration.” (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)
But, the agenda doesn’t include any items new board members requested. Chris Vandenhende, who took office in February, said at the board’s Feb. 27 meeting he wanted to schedule a vote to “suspend all activity related to immigration.”
Vandenhende made the request in response to Walters’ and the board’s proposal of a rule that would require schools to report students’ immigration status. Gov. Kevin Stitt vocally opposed the suggested rule, calling for Walters to be held accountable, and replaced three board members with Vandenhende, Ryan Deatherage and Mike Tinney.
The Oklahoman reported Vandenhende, Deatherage and Tinney had requested numerous other items for the board to discuss on Thursday, which Walters didn’t include in the meeting agenda. Deatherage didn’t immediately return a request for comment from Oklahoma Voice, and attempts to reach Vandenhende and Tinney were unsuccessful.
The newspaper reported board members emailed Walters to ask for another review of the academic standards for social studies that they approved on Feb. 27.
Without publicly posting or acknowledging any changes, Walters’ administration added language to the new social studies standards that suggest there were “discrepancies” in the 2020 presidential election. The new standards are now in the hands of the state Legislature for review.

So far, the three new board members have shown a willingness to question and contend with the state superintendent that no other members have displayed in public since Walters took office in January 2023. 
Deatherage cast the board’s first “no” vote in over two years against an item Walters proposed. He did so when voting against the social studies standards, saying he hadn’t had enough time to review them fully.
The governor said he didn’t give the new appointees specific marching orders as they joined the board, which he shook up over complaints of poor academic results and too much “political drama.”
“There’s no instructions on what we’re going to do,” Stitt said during a media briefing Wednesday. “But it’s like, hey, let Washington, D.C., play politics. Let’s just focus on making Oklahoma the best state for education. So that’s really my only direction to these folks.”

Filed Tuesday, Senate Bill 516, entitled the “Women’s Safety and Protection Act,” would bar trans people from using unisex restrooms, changing facilities, and sleeping quarters that correspond to their gender identities. It would also define “male” and “female” in state law strictly according to assigned sex at birth and prohibit the modification of sex markers on birth certificates and driver’s licenses.

  Sen. Brad Overcash (R-Gaston) (Photo: ncleg.gov)
Introduced by lead sponsors Sen. Vickie Sawyer (R-Iredell) and Sen. Brad Overcash (R-Gaston), the bill states its purpose as twofold: “to clarify and reconcile the meaning of the terms biological sex, gender, and any other related terms in State law” and to “provide protections for women against sexual assault, harassment, and violence” and other “acts of abuse committed by biological men.”
Joining Sawyer and Overcash in sponsoring the bill are Republican state senators Lisa Barnes, Warren Daniel, Bobby Hanig, and Ralph Hise. Hise and Daniel voted in favor of the House Bill 2 bathroom ban in 2016, while the other sponsors were not yet serving in the legislature. None of the bill’s sponsors responded to a request for comment.
A clash over public safety
Unlike the 2016 ban, Senate Bill 516 takes aim at a smaller scope of facilities — prisons and other confinement facilities, domestic violence and rape crisis centers, and public schools — and specifically those that receive state funds.
But where that bill’s scope was limited to bathrooms and changing rooms, this proposal also specifies sleeping quarters, and its emphasis on shelters has prompted concerns from civil rights advocates that trans women seeking protection from domestic violence and sexual abuse could be placed at risk for further violence.

“Transgender people already face higher rates of harassment and violence than cisgender peers,” said Reighlah Collins, policy counsel at the ACLU of North Carolina. “This is just setting up trans people for further attacks and further vulnerability in these places where people are supposed to be safe.”
The bill includes exemptions for family use of facilities, rendering medical or emergency aid, performing custodial work, inspections, and maintenance, and law enforcement activities. It also excludes policies at domestic violence and rape crisis centers to accommodate minors and individuals who require physical assistance.
The legislation would require that all bathrooms, changing facilities, and sleeping quarters at the facilities it covers be used by individuals of one sex at a time, not including those exemptions. And it prohibits public schools from hosting events where students share sleeping quarters from grouping together students of different sexes unless they have received permission from parents or guardians.
Jazmynne Cruz, a spokesperson for the LGBTQ+ rights organization Equality NC, wrote in an emailed statement that the group was “disheartened” by a bill they view as “yet another attack on our transgender community.”
“As we continue to learn more about the implications of this bill, we remain committed to keeping you informed and sharing meaningful ways to support our transgender neighbors,” Cruz wrote. “Our fight for equality continues, and we are stronger together.”
Advocates for the bill framed the issue in terms of protecting women. Ashley Vaughan, the press director for the North Carolina Values Coalition — a religious right advocacy organization — wrote in a statement in response to the bill that “men are men, women are women, and men should not be allowed to rob women of their safety and privacy.”
“Defining male and female by biology in North Carolina law is important because when men can identify as women it invalidates hundreds of laws and policies designed to protect women,” Vaughan wrote. “We need to protect women and girls in private spaces where they are vulnerable.”
Collins argued that such framing is disingenuous, and that the bill’s enforcement mechanism — which opens up facilities and state agencies that do not comply to lawsuits — risks exposing all women to the use of invasive techniques to determine individuals’ birth sex, such as physical searches and examinations.
“Senate Bill 516 would leave all women — transgender or not — vulnerable to accusations and discrimination based on how well they conform to someone else’s standard for their gender,” Collins said. “If they don’t look like what people expect people to look like in that bathroom, they are likely to face pushback and really setting them up for danger.”
‘There will be backlash’
Less than a decade ago, North Carolina experienced an enormous national and international backlash after the implementation of HB 2, the “bathroom bill” that barred trans people from using public restrooms corresponding to their gender identity throughout the state.
The bill prompted business leaders around the country to pull projects from North Carolina in a show of protest, costing the state an estimated $3.76 billion according to the Associated Press. The state also lost out on major sporting events, including the 2017 NBA All-Star Game, which was set to be played in Charlotte but ultimately moved to New Orleans.

Chris Cooper, a political scientist at Western Carolina University, said that context makes him “surprised” that senators would broach another bathroom bill, even as national sentiment has moved right on some trans issues in the intervening decade.
“I expected the General Assembly to lean into bills around gender-affirming care for minors and about trans women in sports — two parts of the trans issue where they seem to be on the side of public opinion,” he said. “I was a little bit surprised to see a bill get introduced that seems to go back in time, to sort of give away the rhetorical advantage they seem to have on this issue.”
Cooper noted that top Republican leaders — like Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger, whose support, he said, would give “a golden highway to passage” for almost any bill — had not joined onto SB 516 as a sponsor, suggesting there may not be an appetite among leadership for such a far-reaching measure.
“The bathroom issue, the driver’s license issue — those seem to be places where the public might be a little bit more on the trans rights side,” Cooper said. “I could see that kind of backlash [that occurred after HB 2]. I can almost guarantee, if this becomes law, there will be lawsuits, there will be backlash.”
But President Donald Trump won reelection in part by launching broad attacks on Vice President Kamala Harris for her support of transgender rights, with campaign ads castigating her for being “for they/them” while Trump was “for you” and for stating during the 2020 campaign that she would support government-funded gender-affirming surgery for undocumented immigrants.
“Trump got this right, and now North Carolina got this right,” wrote Vaughan, the North Carolina Values Coalition spokesperson.
And other Republican legislatures states have passed laws restricting trans rights with far less pushback than North Carolina received in 2016. Should SB 516 become law, North Carolina would be the fourth states to codify “male” and “female” by assigned sex at birth, the seventh state forbidding the change of sex markers on birth certificates, and the 15th to bar trans people from at least some single-sex spaces aligning with their gender identity.
A broader anti-trans agenda
SB 516 comes amid a wave of legislation in North Carolina seeking to curtail the rights of trans people to express their gender identity and restrict their access to gender-affirming healthcare.
In 2023, North Carolina banned gender-affirming care for minors and barred trans student athletes from participating in women’s sports at most schools, two issues that Trump championed on the campaign trail the following year.
“This is part of a coordinated, larger strategy across the country to push transgender people out of public and civic life, despite the clear signs that this is discriminatory and doesn’t work,” said Collins, the ACLU policy counsel.
A group of GOP lawmakers also introduced a bill Wednesday that would seek to expand parents’ access to their kids’ medical records, examinations and treatment, including discussions of gender identity. House Bill 519, labeled the “Parents’ Medical Bill of Rights” by its sponsors, would grant parents the right “to access and review all medical records” of their child.
It was prompted, lawmakers say, by constituent complaints that common medical practice allowed children starting at 12 to opt out of sharing information with their parents.
“We must stop operating under a system that sidelines parents and assumes institutions knows better,” said Rep. Jennifer Balkcom (R-Henderson), who said her son had just turned 12 and had seen medical professionals asking for his consent to share information.
“I’m paying for the insurance,” added Rep. Brian Biggs (R-Randolph). “I want to be involved.”
At the core of that medical practice is a 50-year-old law created to allow minors to discuss sensitive medical topics, including pregnancy and venereal disease, with a doctor. But the bill sponsors say it’s led to conversations and decisions they don’t support — such as being vaccinated for COVID-19 or having discussions about sexuality.
“This has to stop,” Biggs said.
If the bill were to become law, it would likely have wide-ranging impacts on sensitive medical discussions for children — including those dealing with pregnancy, sexuality and gender-affirming care. (In North Carolina, gender-affirming care is banned until age 18; abortion is banned after 12 weeks of pregnancy.)
Neither bill has yet to be scheduled for a committee hearing.

After more than four decades of calling Utah and Park City home, the Sundance Film Festival is leaving in 2027.
The Sundance Film Institute announced on Thursday that festival organizers have decided to move to Boulder. The Colorado Senate gave preliminary approval Thursday to a bill that would offer the film festival up to $34 million in tax credits over 10 years. The House already approved the bill, and the Senate will need to vote on it again before it goes to Gov. Jared Polis’ desk for a signature.
Utah was one of three finalists bidding to host Sundance after its contract expires following the 2026 festival. Earlier Thursday, news broke that organizers did not choose Cincinnati, leaving just Utah and Colorado in the running. Sundance’s announcement later Thursday afternoon sealed the deal for Boulder.
“This decision was informed by a detailed evaluation of the key components essential to creating our Festival. During the process, it became clear that Boulder is the ideal location in which to build our Festival’s future, marking a key strategic step in its natural evolution,” said Ebs Burnough, Sundance Institute Board Chair.
Drama over Utah’s bid to keep Sundance heats up over LGBTQ+ flag ban bill

The decision also comes after some final-hour drama added a wrinkle to Utah’s bid. The 2025 Utah Legislature approved a bill aimed at banning pride or LGBTQ+ flags in schools and all government buildings, which its supporters said is meant to promote “political neutrality” in government spaces.
Earlier this month, the Hollywood news site Deadline reported that bill, HB77, could pose “an eleventh-hour obstacle to the Beehive State’s hopes of keeping” Sundance. The outlet quoted an unnamed “Sundance insider” expressing frustrations with the bill and calling it a “terrible law, a terrible look for the state.”
“No matter what they say, we all know who it’s aimed at — the LGBTQ+ community, and that’s unacceptable,” the outlet quoted that insider saying.
Colorado’s Democratic governor, Jared Polis, a longtime Boulder resident, welcomed the announcement and highlighted the economic boost the festival is expected to bring to the state.
“I’m beyond excited to welcome the Sundance Film Festival to Colorado starting in 2027,” Polis said in a statement. “Here in Colorado we also celebrate the arts and film industry as a key economic driver, job creator, and important contributor to our thriving culture. Now, with the addition of the iconic Sundance Film Festival, we can expect even more jobs, a huge benefit for our small businesses including stores and restaurants, and to help the festival achieve even greater success.”
John Tayer, president and CEO of the Boulder Chamber, also noted the festival’s economic promise, and he acknowledged the city’s new role as a steward for a cherished arts institution.
“The Boulder Chamber and the business community we represent understand what an immense responsibility we will be assuming with the selection of Boulder as the new host city for the Sundance Film Festival,” Tayer said in a statement. “The Sundance Film Festival is an international cultural asset with global expectations for a successful transition that builds toward an exciting future vision of growth and impact.”
‘Bye Felicia’
The announcement came after Utah’s bid committee — made up of officials from Park City, Visit Park City, Summit County, Salt Lake County, Visit Salt Lake, the state of Utah, Salt Lake City and Utah’s philanthropic community — spent nearly an entire year forming a bid package that included tens of millions in in-kind and cash public funding, plus even more in private commitments.
Park City and Salt Lake City are both Democratic strongholds in an otherwise deeply conservative state.
In total, Utah’s bid included more than $54.1 million in public cash commitments over 10 years. That included an additional $24.9 million in new cash commitments over the life of a 10-year contract, on top of about $29.2 million that had already been committed to Sundance over 10 years, according to bid committee officials. That would have equaled nearly $2.8 million in new annual public funding committed to the film festival, on top of about $2.7 million that was already committed, bringing the total annual public cash that was on the table to more than $5.5 million a year for 10 years.
The 2025 Utah Legislature appropriated $3.5 million in their budget this year for the film festival, upping the state’s annual commitment by about $1.62 million a year.
But it wasn’t enough to entice Sundance to stay.
“Bye Felicia,” the Senate sponsor of the flag ban bill, Sen. Dan McCay, R-Riverton, posted on X in response to the Deadline article. “Sundance promotes porn. Sundance promotes alternative lifestyles. Sundance promotes anti-lds themes. Sundance does not fit in Utah anymore.”
It’s not clear how much the pride flag ban factored into festival organizers’ decision to leave Utah. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox has yet to sign or veto that bill, though Thursday is his deadline to act. He told reporters in a news conference last week Sundance organizers told leaders “very clearly that political issues have nothing to do with the decision.”
But Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall, who was involved along with other city and state leaders on Utah’s bid, told reporters Friday she worried that the flag ban could indeed jeopardize efforts to keep Sundance.
“I think there’s a strong track record of bills that have changed the outcome of locations of major sporting events and major conventions,” she said. “I think it would be harmful to our effort to retain Sundance.”
She also reiterated calls for Cox to stop the bill in its tracks.
“My encouragement from my lips to God’s ears is that Gov. Cox will veto HB77,” she said. “It is not reflective of the values of this community, of our capital city, and I think of many of the businesses who choose to locate here because of the welcoming and inclusive culture of Salt Lake City. We are an asset to the state of Utah because of our welcoming position to diversity and LGBTQIA rights.”

Ron DeSantis' appointee to the University of West Florida Board of Trustees. (Photos via UWF website)A committee of Florida senators has recommended against confirmation of one of Gov. Ron DeSantis’ nominees for the University of West Florida Board of Trustees.
He is Adam Kissell, a Heritage Foundation fellow who lives in West Virginia and has faced criticism for advocating defunding of public universities and suggesting the GI bill led to over-enrolled four-year colleges.
Earlier this year, DeSantis placed him among eight new members on the 13-member board of trustees at UWF, where they are serving pending confirmation by the Florida Senate. None call Pensacola home or graduated from UWF and two are from out of the state. 
The DeSantis administration has indicated it intends a more conservative governance model for UWF, similar to that he  imposed two years ago on the New College of Florida in Sarasota, which purged programs in womens’- and gender studies in favor of a more conservative curriculum.
For most of DeSantis’ tenure, the Legislature has gone along with his proposals with little pushback. This session has provided more conflict between the Legislature and term-limited governor. On Wednesday, only one Republican on the committee voted to recommend confirmation for Kissel — Danny Burgess of Pasco County. The final vote was 1-6.
The recommendation against confirmation is advisory, only. His confirmation will be considered by the Ethics and Elections Committee next.  
Kissel told the panel he agreed with “probably everything” in the education section of Project 2025, a nearly 1,000-page document released last year led by Heritage detailing conservative ideas for the incoming U.S. president. It recommends dismantling  federal student aid programs, eliminating diversity efforts, and expanded public funding for private and home schools.
Not from here
Committee members complained Kissel is a stranger to Pensacola and the surrounding  West Florida region.
“I think that it’s unfortunate when you look at the number of trustees that that are on our slate for confirmation, and you look at where a lot of them are from, and you look at one individual, particularly, who is not even from our state,” said Sen. Jay Trumbull, who represents the area. 
“I know we have another one coming before us, potentially, that is also not from our state. And I think that there’s a concern there. You know, Pensacola is unique. Northwest Florida is unique. UWF is unique.”
“Obviously, as a board member and trustee of a public university, I don’t think that it’s appropriate to have him serving there,” Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith, a Democrat from the Orlando area. “It’s important we also have folks from the community, certainly in the Panhandle, represented in what is very much a community public university.”
Sen. Gayle Harrell, chair of the committee, warned that trustees should keep in mind the local interests of Pensacola and to maintain “independence as board members, thinking about the community that is northwest Florida.”
 “We will be watching,” she said.
Harrell said she has received several emails concerning Kissel’s nomination, going on to ask Kissel his thoughts on privatizing public universities and the GI bill.
However, Kissel told committee members that he does not believe any of the public universities in Florida should be defunded.

The “another one” to whom Trumbull referred for the UWF board is Scott Yenor, a professor in Idaho who has faced backlash for proclaiming that LGBTQ+ practices bring “dreaded diseases” and labeling career-oriented women as “medicated, meddlesome, and quarrelsome.” The bipartisan Jewish legislative caucus has called Yenor “antisemitic.”
DeSantis has defended Yenor, who now serves as board chairman although the administration has not yet forwarded his nomination to the Senate.
Former UWF President Judith Bense appeared at the meeting, expressing concern about the direction the university is heading. Donations have “come to a screeching halt,” she said, and students have reversed decisions to attend the school. Uncertainty about the future has swept campus since the shakeup on the board of trustees. 
“There’s nothing wrong — we don’t need to be reconstructed,” Bense said, adding, “The community is very upset — it’s all that people are talking about.”
The committee recommended confirmation of three other UWF nominees — Ashley Ross and Rebecca Matthews, both from Tallahasee, and Rachel Moya from Ponte Vedra, although Democratic Sen. Tracie Davis and Smith voted in opposition. 
The committee approved about a dozen additional trustees across other state institutions on unanimous votes.

U.S. Reps. Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City) and John James (R-Shelby Township) are two of four sponsors on the bill. U.S. Reps. Buddy Carter, a Republican from Georgia, and Rob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, also signed on.
The legislation would require Pharmacy Benefit Managers and others who serve as intermediaries between insurers, drug manufacturers and pharmacies to disclose financial transactions related to prescription drug pricing, including rebates and discounts intended to be passed on to patients.
“With this bill, we’re bringing much-needed transparency to how drugs are priced in this country, which will ultimately push prices down and make things easier for consumers,” McDonald Rivet said.
Organizations that fail to report the required information could face fines of up to $100,000 per violation.
The Department of Health and Human Services, which on Thursday announced it would be eliminating about 10,000 full-time jobs and closing half its regional offices, would be responsible for ensuring all reports are publicly available.
“The days of Big Pharma profiting from your pain are over,” James said. “Americans deserve quality and affordable health care of their choosing. The Prescription Drug Transparency and Affordability Act is a market-based approach that returns the power to you.”
Similar legislation introduced during a previous Congress would save consumers approximately $2.3 billion over 10 years, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office.
Last year, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel joined a bipartisan coalition of 39 attorneys general in urging Congress to reform the current practices of pharmacy benefit managers.

(Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)An address earlier this month by Energy Secretary Chris Wright at a gathering of fossil fuel industry heavyweights offered a detailed view of this key Trump administration official’s position on the climate crisis.
It was bleak.
Anyone who cares about maintaining a habitable planet for humanity must conclude after Wright’s remarks that administration policies jeopardize the well-being of future generations throughout the world. Officials like Wright, a Denver oil and gas business magnate, aren’t just hostile to climate solutions, they’re positively in favor of accelerating polluting activities.
And they’re wrong on the facts. The address, as well as previous statements by Wright, reveals the Cabinet member to be a source of misinformation at the highest levels of government.
He calls himself a “climate realist.” But, given that his version of reality could only lead to a scorched environment, he’s better described as a climate arsonist.

Wright has been a fossil fuel entrepreneur since the early 1990s. He founded the Denver-based fracking company Liberty Energy, which Forbes recently reported makes $4 billion a year in revenues. When he delivered keynote remarks March 10 during CERAWeek, an annual conference of corporate leaders, he stood before an audience of colleagues and friends.
“The Trump administration will treat climate change for what it is, a global physical phenomenon that is a side effect of building the modern world,” Wright said. “We have indeed raised global atmospheric CO2 concentration by 50% in the process of more than doubling human life expectancy … lifting almost all of the world’s citizens out of grinding poverty, launching modern medicine, telecommunications, planes, trains and automobiles too. Everything in life involves trade-offs.”
That was his main point: Yes, there’s climate change, and, yes, humans are causing it. But it’s totally worth it.
He pointed to the billions of people throughout the world, particularly in Africa, who lack the energy-dependent advantages that Americans enjoy, and, cloaking profit-making interests in a moral defense of air pollution, asserted that “they want what we have.”
But the glaring flaw in Wright’s reasoning is that his calculation of trade-offs omits the most consequential factor, as would be obvious to anyone who takes the scientific consensus on climate change seriously. Sure, carbon-based energy sources have made the modern world so far, but they also threaten to undo it. Less affluent nations might want inexpensive and reliable heating and cooling for their homes, but they don’t want extinction.
Wright’s whole pitch withers before the science. The latest comprehensive report from the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change highlights the urgency of immediate climate action.
“Climate change is a threat to human well-being and planetary health,” the report says. “There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all.”
A 2023 State of the Climate report, authored by scientists from around the world and published in the peer-reviewed journal BioScience, said climate change is putting whole regions of Earth at risk of being uninhabitable.
“The effects of global warming are progressively more severe, and possibilities such as a worldwide societal breakdown are feasible and dangerously underexplored,” the report says. By the end of the century up to half the global population “might find themselves confined beyond the livable region.”
Some trade-off.
In his attempt to promote the virtues of fossil fuels, Wright is forced to downplay the promise of renewable energy. But his disdain for wind and solar sources is misleading. For example, in his CERAWeek remarks, he claimed that wind and solar supply only 3% of global energy. That’s much lower than figures cited in other sources. The climate think tank Ember estimated that wind and solar accounted for more than 13% of global electricity generation in 2023.
Scientific reports adhere to principles of transparency, verifiability and disinterest, but Wright’s perspective on its face lacks credibility, because his career in the fossil fuel industry is impossible to detangle from his advocacy for it. His net worth is estimated at $171 million. Might that fortune influence his judgment?
Wright has leveraged his wealth to influence environmental policy in Colorado. State records indicate that he has regularly donated money to Colorado Concern, a conservative alliance of business executives that has opposed state climate solution policies. In 2020, he gave $25,000 to the Colorado chapter of Americans for Prosperity, a Koch brothers-founded free-market advocacy group that fuels climate change denial.
2024 was the warmest year on record. The previous warmest year was 2023. In Colorado, 8 of the 10 warmest years in state history have occurred since 2012. A hotter, drier climate in Colorado has already contributed to crippling drought, stressed water resources and ferocious wildfires.
This is what Wright calls “a side effect,” and he is eager to promote policies that would cause more such devastation across the globe. His efforts to accelerate fossil fuel consumption is akin to setting the world on fire.

“This bill gives the infant a fighting chance,” Republican state Rep. Brian Seitz of Branson, who co-sponsored the legislation, said Thursday morning.
He accused any lawmakers planning to vote against the measure of supporting infanticide, which is already illegal. Republicans have said the bill, which is the first anti-abortion proposal to clear a legislative chamber in Missouri this year, was made necessary after voters overturned the state’s abortion ban last year. 
The bill passed 109 to 32, with four Democrats joining Republicans in a yes vote, and nine Democrats voting “present.”

Dubbed the “born alive abortion survivors act” and sponsored by Seitz and state Rep. Holly Jones, a Republican from Eureka, the bill would require any health care providers present at the time of an unsuccessful abortion to “exercise the same degree of professional skill, care, and diligence to preserve the life and health of the child as a reasonably diligent and conscientious health care provider would render to any other child born alive at the same gestational age.” 
​​Medical professionals say this is already the standard of care. 
Perhaps more notably, the bill also opens the door for civil liabilities for those involved in “self-induced abortions,” raising questions about potential implications on medication abortions.
The type of abortions targeted by the House bill are rare, in part because abortions after fetal viability remain illegal in Missouri even after voters enshrined reproductive rights in the state constitution last fall.
State Rep. LaDonna Appelbaum, a Democrat from St. Louis, called the bill a waste of taxpayers’ money.
“Murder is already against the law, so what are we doing here?” she asked on the House floor. 
The Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002, which was approved by Congress and signed into law by then-President George W. Bush, grants personhood to any child born after an unsuccessful abortion. But Seitz and Jones have argued that federal law doesn’t go far enough. 
“In federal law, they’re not provided health care,” Seitz said Monday during House debate. “In Missouri law we will give that infant a chance. I’d buy that infant a house. I think that infant should be given an award.”
Many Democrats have said the legislation is more nefarious, and have taken issue with this characterization of federal law, pointing to existing laws around infanticide — defined as causing the death of an infant “when the infant is partially born or born.” 
Republicans disagreed. 
“This bill isn’t an attack,” state Rep. Ben Baker, a Republican from Neosho, said Thursday. “It’s a shield for the innocent.” 
State Rep. Gregg Bush, a Democrat from Columbia and a registered nurse, said he continued to worry the bill would unfairly criminalize health care providers who help families navigate complicated medical diagnoses.
Missouri’s revamped ‘eHarmony for babies’ bill criticized as government overreach

The legislation would require any medical professionals with knowledge of a violation of the “born alive” law to report it to the state. Those who fail to report a violation could face up to five years in prison and up to $10,000 in fines. It goes on to say that anyone who “intentionally performs or attempts to perform an overt act that kills a child born alive” could be charged with first-degree murder. 
The class A felony the bill would establish under Missouri law excludes anyone attempting to perform a legal abortion “if the act that causes the death is performed prior to the child being partially born, even though the death of the child occurs as a result of the abortion after the child is partially born.”
There were previously questions about whether the bill would apply to miscarriages, known in medical terms as “spontaneous abortions.” An amendment was added to the bill clarifying the law would not apply to “the natural and spontaneous loss of an unborn child before fetal viability.” 
The amended version also revised a provision creating civil liabilities for anyone who assists in a self-induced or illegal abortion.
Missouri’s bill mirrors some of the language in a federal bill filed by U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner, a Republican from Missouri — though the civil liability provisions in the state proposal are much more expansive.
The revised language approved Thursday applies the civil liability to someone who “recklessly, or negligently supplies or makes available any instrument, device, medicine, drug, or any other means or substance” for a self-induced or unlawful abortion. 
Sam Lee, a longtime anti-abortion lobbyist, previously told The Independent the civil liabilities language could apply to self-induced medication abortions, whether the fetus is born alive or not. It could also open the door to litigation against those who assist another person in obtaining a “self-managed” abortion — no matter how early in the pregnancy. 
Seitz said his intention was to give a tool for a civil cause of action if there’s a poor health outcome for the woman attempting the abortion, but to exclude from civil liabilities any physician who was to legally prescribe abortion medication.
Under the Missouri proposal, anyone related to the woman, infant or fetus can seek damages. Lee previously said the legislation would not criminalize a woman who took abortion medication unless the child was born outside a clinical setting and the mother then “knowingly, recklessly or negligently” caused the death of the child.
Michael Wolff, a former chief justice of the Missouri Supreme Court and dean emeritus at the St. Louis University School of Law, previously told The Independent that the bill raises many questions about how such a law would be interpreted with the constitutional right to abortion now in place. 
The lack of definition for “self-induced abortions” in state statute also contributes to the confusion, Wolff said, and could lead to attempts to target medication abortions. 
Concerns were also previously raised about the bill’s requirement that an infant born during an attempted abortion be immediately transported and admitted to a hospital. 
Mallory Schwarz, executive director of Abortion Action Missouri, testified before the House committee earlier this year that this could conflict with best practices for palliative care, especially if hospitals determined this law required any infant be resuscitated. 
An example would be cases where a family chooses to induce an abortion following the diagnosis of a fatal fetal anomaly. That family may decide to end the pregnancy before reaching full gestational age but still want to meet their child before they pass away. 
“Resuscitation would require CPR, which could break that tiny infant’s ribs,” Schwarz told the committee. “It would require aggressive medical care that is not in line with what the families and providers have already decided is best for that unique pregnancy, that unique circumstance.”

(Photo from SOS' official X account)Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales, who went on an unannounced “economic development trip” in India and missed obligations back home, publicly shared a release about his time abroad on Thursday — but only after he returned.  
A Thursday press release from the office emphasized, in bold, that the ten-day trip was privately funded and that “no agency or taxpayer funds were used.” The release didn’t include dates, saying only that Morales had “recently concluded” the visit. 
“Visiting India is an invaluable opportunity to strengthen Indiana’s economic ties with one of the world’s fastest-growing economies. By fostering deeper partnerships, we can unlock new avenues for trade, innovation, and collaborations, ensuring that both Indiana and India continue to thrive on the international stage. I look forward to seeing the long-term impact of our discussions on Indiana’s economic growth and international influence,” Morales said in the release.
Posts on his social media earlier in the month include visits to local ice cream shops and videos of him meeting county-level public officials, but not India. The Thursday press release he tweeted is his first mention of India since October. 
But Morales wasn’t present for a March 18 meeting before lawmakers to justify his budget request for the 2025 cycle. State Affairs Indiana reported that his deputy told lawmakers Morales was on an economic development trip. However, the absence was subject to bipartisan criticism. 
At least one Indiana official demurred about the trip on Thursday when asked if it was appropriate.

“To be fair, I have no idea what is taking place right now outside of this chamber,” said House Speaker Todd Huston, R-Fishers. “I’ve heard the rumor that he isn’t in the country. I’d need to know the specifics.” 
House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta, on the other hand, poked fun at the trip and Morales’ absence. 
“Well, I was told he was somewhere and thought he’d booked a flight back to Indiana and apparently didn’t type all the way and he went to India,” said the Fort Wayne Democrat. 
And while he acknowledged that the agency had duties with regards to corporations, he decisively said, “No,” when asked if the officeholder should take economic development trips. 
“I hear a lot of this talking out of both sides: We want to cut budgets, but we also want to allow folks to take trips to India. It’s pretty ridiculous,” GiaQuinta continued.
Tweets from others put Morales in India as early as March 20, when he apparently addressed an audience at the National Association of Software and Service Companies Global Conference in New Delhi about “forging international alliances for tech leadership.”
According to Morales’ press release, he also “promoted Indiana as an ideal base for North American industry” before the India Electronics & Computer Software Export Promotion Council INDIASOFT 2025 Conference. 
Economic development doesn’t typically fall under the purview of the Office of the Secretary of State, which oversees processes like business licensing and elections. Instead, the Indiana Economic Development Corp. usually coordinates international trips for state officials, including a 2017 India visit for former Gov. Eric Holcomb.

Roger Wicker and Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Jack Reed wrote that the group chat, which somehow inadvertently included Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, warranted further inquiry.“This chat was alleged to have included classified information pertaining to sensitive military actions in Yemen,” the two wrote in the one-page letter. “If true, this reporting raises questions as to the use of unclassified networks to discuss sensitive and classified information, as well as the sharing of such information with those who do not have proper clearance and need to know.”They asked the inspector general to include an “assessment of DOD classification and declassification policies and processes and whether these policies and processes were adhered to” as well as a determination of whether anyone “transferred classified information, including operational details, from classified systems to unclassified systems, and if so, how.”The senators called on the inspector general to figure out if “the policies of the White House, Department of Defense, the intelligence community, and other Departments and agencies represented on the National Security Council on this subject differ.”The letter requests the inspector general make recommendations to address any issues that might be identified by an investigation.Signalgate, as it’s become known, began Monday when The Atlantic published excerpts of the group chat that included Vice President J.D. Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz and others.President Donald Trump and numerous White House officials have repeatedly tried to downplay the use of a commercial communications app to discuss plans to bomb Houthi rebels inside Yemen.Hegseth has said publicly that no classified information was shared in the group chat, but Wicker told reporters on Wednesday that the “information as published recently appears to me to be of such a sensitive nature that, based on my knowledge, I would have wanted to classify it.”A spokesperson for the Defense Department Inspector General said the office “received the request yesterday and we are reviewing the letter. We have no further comment at this time.”",,,,2025-03-27 15:03:31.042549

House Bill 270 updates Idaho’s indecent exposure law, which already bans public exposure of genitals, to include female breasts, male breasts altered to look like female breasts, artificial breasts and toys or products that resemble genitals. 
Breastfeeding is exempt. 
The bill takes effect immediately — through an emergency clause. Little signed the bill Wednesday, according to the governor’s office legislation tracker. 
Supporters say the bill will protect decency and modernize Idaho’s indecent exposure law. Opponents say it could unduly punish transgender Idahoans and males experiencing hormonal conditions that enlarge breasts. 
The Republican-supermajority controlled Legislature widely passed the bill, with support from 87 Republican state lawmakers and opposition from 14 Democratic state lawmakers.

The bill was cosponsored by Rep. Jeff Cornilles, R-Nampa, and Sens. Brian Lenney, R-Nampa, and Ben Toews, R-Coeur d’Alene. 
Debating the bill in the Senate this week, Lenney said the bill deals with a real problem of people exposing themselves. 
“I’ve heard arguments … on this bill that said this somehow sexualizes breasts. I don’t think we need a bill to do that,” he said. “I think that’s been happening since the Garden of Eden, and it’s going to continue to happen forever.”
Idaho Senate Minority Leader Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, argued the bill violates the First Amendment by criminalizing expression that “we don’t like.” 
And she said the bill would allow people to call police over dangling faux scrotums hung on truck hitches, commonly called truck nuts.

“They’re gross, they’re offensive, and kids on the road see them. So why wouldn’t the police get a call and say, ‘That offends me, pull it off the truck?’” Wintrow said. “Because now this bill will allow it. And I talked to police and they said, ‘Indeed it would.’
Nampa City Councilmember Sebastian Griffin helped craft the bill, telling lawmakers that the bill stemmed from him seeing a topless woman at an event at Lakeview Park in Nampa, where Canyon County Pride was held. He testified a police officer he approached at the time said the person wasn’t engaging in illegal behavior. 
That’s because it is not illegal for a man with breast enhancements to walk around topless, the officer said, according to Griffin. 
A first violation of Idaho’s indecent exposure law is a misdemeanor crime. A second offense within five years is a felony.

House Bill 380 will allow the death penalty in a new criminal charge the bill creates: aggravated lewd conduct with children age 12 and younger.
The bill also would add mandatory minimum prison sentences for cases of aggravated lewd conduct with minors that don’t meet the bill’s proposed criteria for death penalty eligibility. The new crime would only apply to abuse of children age 16 and below. 
Little signed the bill Wednesday morning, according to the governor’s office legislation tracker. He told the Idaho Capital Sun in a written statement that he signed the bill “because heinous sex crimes against children destroy lives, and the perpetrators deserve the ultimate punishment.”
The Idaho Legislature widely passed the bill, with only five votes against in the Senate and none in the House.
The bill was cosponsored by Rep. Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa, House Assistant Majority Leader Josh Tanner, R-Eagle, and over a half dozen other Idaho lawmakers.  
Skaug has told lawmakers Idaho has some of the nation’s most lenient child rape laws. 
The bill takes effect July 1.

 U.S. Supreme Court already struck down death penalties for child rape. Idaho lawmakers expect a legal challenge.

The U.S. Supreme Court in 2008 blocked death penalties for child rape in Kennedy v. Louisiana. 
Florida passed a child rape death penantly law two years ago. Last year, Tennesee passed a child rape death penalty law. 
Idaho will be only state with firing squad as main execution method, after governor signs bill

Bracing for a legal challenge to the bill, Skaug told lawmakers he expects the U.S. Supreme Court would rule differently. 
“You can say, ‘Well, that’s unconstitutional, Bruce. Why would you bring that?’ Well, it was — according to a 5-4 decision in 2008. I don’t think that would be the case today,” Skaug, an attorney, told lawmakers in a House committee hearing. “That’s my professional opinion. That’s the opinion of many other attorneys.”
The American Civil Liberties Union of Idaho, or ACLU, strongly opposes the bill. 
“Choosing to make this bill law not only demonstrates an arrogant disregard for legal precedent from our country’s highest court, but it would also have devastating consequences that victims, their families, and wrongfully convicted people would be unable to reverse,” ACLU of Idaho spokesperson Rebecca De León told the Idaho Capital Sun in a prepared statement. “This law will vastly increase death penalty prosecutions in Idaho, burdening an already flawed criminal legal system prone to wrongful convictions, inadequate public defense, and racial disparities.”
Skaug has said the death penalty would be rarely sought under his bill. Nine people are on death row in Idaho, according to the Idaho Department of Correction.
Idaho law only allows the death penalty in first-degree murder cases with aggravating circumstances. 
Little also recently signed a bill into law that will make the Gem State the only state to use firing squads as its main execution method. Skaug also cosponsored that bill.

 How the bill works: Three aggravating factors required to seek death penalty

This year’s child sex abuse death penalty bill is Skaug and Tanner’s second attempt at such a bill. Last year, another bill they brought widely passed the House but never received a Senate committee hearing. 
Their new bill that passed will establish the new crime, and mandatory minimums criminal sentences. For instance, the bill’s proposed mandatory minimum sentence for aggravated lewd conduct with minors under age 16 would carry at least 25 years in prison. 
Under the bill, lewd conduct with a minor would include but is not limited to “genital-genital contact, oral-genital contact, anal-genital contact, oral-anal contact, manual-anal contact, or manual-genital contact” when such acts are meant to arouse, appeal to or gratify “lust or passions or sexual desires.”

The bill outlines more than a dozen aggravating factors under which prosecutors can seek the death penalty. Only three are required to seek the death penalty, which would only be available in cases of aggravated lewd conduct against minors age 12 and younger.
Public testimony has been largely supportive of the bill. 
But in a Senate committee hearing on the bill, David Martinez of the Idaho Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers testified against the bill, saying at least three of the bill’s aggravating factors were already present in almost every lewd conduct case he has handled or supervised.
He also argued the bill doesn’t focus on “the worst of the worst,” could potentially expose victims of decades of reliving trauma, and fails to account for Idaho’s shortage of qualified death penalty defense attorneys.
Holly Rebholtz, representing the Idaho Prosecuting Attorneys Association, said she disagreed, saying the new aggravated lewd conduct crime wouldn’t be charged very often.
“I don’t think these crimes are going to come into play very often. But when they do, they are the most serious crimes we see. And again, the prosecutors believe that the most serious crimes against children deserve a serious punishment,” she testified.

The Missouri House on Wednesday advanced a bill that would enact new regulations on kratom products, which the National Institute on Drug Abuse defines as “an herbal substance that can produce opioid- and stimulant-like effects.”
Kratom products are currently legal both federally and in Missouri, and the legislation that received initial approval Wednesday would put an age restriction on who can buy the products at 21, along with limitations on ingredients.
The bill needs a final vote in the House before going to the Senate. 
“It’s usually used to get people off opioid addictions,” state Rep. Tricia Byrnes, a Republican from Wentzville, said during Wednesday’s debate, “and it’s a pain reliever, instead of getting people hooked to opioids.” 
The American Kratom Association, which provided the language for the original legislation, opposes a change made before Wednesday’s vote, said Mac Haddow, senior policy fellow with the association. 
In the version approved in a committee earlier this month, he said, products containing a synthetic form of a substance called 7-hydroxymitragynine – which he called “very dangerous” and as addictive as herion – would continue to be sold in Missouri without any regulation.
The amended version of the bill instead takes aim at “any product marketed or sold as kratom” that contains more than 2% of the substance, also known as 7-OH.
  CBD Kratom is among several companies selling kratom products that’s supportive of a House bill to regulate kratom in Missouri. (Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent).
That allows for these products to be sold under a different name, Haddow said, and doesn’t take them off store shelves as the bill intended.   
“We oppose the addition of the language that would allow for 7-OH products to be sold in the state, not calling them kratom,” he said, though he still supports the bill. “But that’s at least a better compromise than 7-OH products being sold as kratom, which misleads consumers.” 
While kratom leaves contain many chemical compounds that may influence the human body, the most-studied is mitragynine, according to the institute. When ingested, mitragynine breaks down into another chemical, 7-hydroxymitragynine. There are also very small amounts of 7-hydroxymitragynine occurring naturally in kratom.
Missouri-based American Shaman is the first company to bring 7-OH to market, said company owner Vince Sanders told The Independent in an interview Wednesday, and is a leader in these products nationwide. 
Sanders argues his products, which come in pill form, are safe and “far superior” to kratom products on the market. Byrnes’ original bill would have banned a number of the products the company manufactures, he said, because they’re made with a higher percentage of 7-OH. 
Sanders said his products start with the kratom leaf and then their production process replicates what happens naturally with the plant itself. 
“We just do it outside the plant, so that we can do it at scale,” he said. 
He supports the bill because it creates some separation between his products and regular kratom.
“People have been taking normal kratom for, you know, decades plus,” Sanders said. “We don’t want you to confuse this product with that product.”
People often take several hundred milligrams of kratom, he said, and his 7-OH products are much more potent. Sanders doesn’t believe the bill applies to his products, because they’re already not marketed as kratom. 
“We want to make it real clear that this shouldn’t be marketed as kratom,” he said, “and then kratom rules should apply to kratom, not to this because they’re different.”
American Shaman originally opposed Byrnes’ legislation. After the group asked for the change and it was added, the company now supports the bill. Sanders said the bill was a “legislative attempt” brought forth by the kratom industry “to get rid of a superior product, which is a shame.”
Byrnes said she doesn’t believe the amendment exempts any products that originate from the kratom leaf. 
“I don’t know how saying, ‘Oh, we’re just going to call it tomatoes,’ make it not kratom,” Byrnes told The Independent Wednesday. “I’m not picking winners or losers. I’m not trying to do anything except that if you’re selling kratom that’s from this plant, then it needs to have these requirements.”
Matthew Lowe, executive director of the Global Kratom Coalition, is opposed to 7-OH products because, like Haddow, he said they are highly addictive and can seriously injure people if they’re not aware of what they’re taking. 
Also like Haddow, Lowe supports the bill because it prevents them from being marketed as kratom. And there are other dangerous chemicals the bill prevents from being added to kratom products, they both said.
“I find it strange that you’ve got individuals who’ve got a synthetic single alkaloid product that’s more potent than morphine… even having a seat at the table of a kratom regulatory bill,” Lowe said. “Because they’re not kratom. They’re not dietary ingredients. They’re unapproved drugs.”

The money is part of $12 billion in cuts nationwide this week to funding for infectious disease tracking, mental health services and drug addiction treatment that could cost thousands of jobs in public health departments nationwide, according to news reports.
Most of the money is congressionally approved COVID-era funding from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In Washington state, the cuts will mean over $130 million in discontinued grants to the state Department of Health.
The canceled money funds disease monitoring, reporting and work on vaccines for COVID-19 and other viruses, Department of Health spokesperson Marisol Mata Somarribas said. It also supports DOH computer systems related to these efforts.
One of the programs impacted is Care Connect, which the department launched early in the pandemic to provide food and other needs to people with COVID so they could isolate. The program later shifted to meet long-term needs of those suffering from long COVID, among other things.
The funding cut impacts work carried out by more than 200 full-time department employees, as well as staff at local health departments, tribal health clinics and community-based organizations, Mata Somarribas said. 
She added the department was still assessing the funding loss Thursday.
The Trump administration terminated another $34 million in Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration funding for the Washington State Health Care Authority, according to U.S. Sen. Patty Murray’s office.
Those dollars fund grants to local organizations working to provide mental health assistance and combat the opioid crisis.
In a statement, Murray said the news “could mean cuts to essential health services and layoffs of staff on the frontlines working to keep communities healthy, address public health threats and outbreaks, tackle the opioid epidemic and mental health crisis, and so much else.”
This is the latest in the Trump administration’s two-month siege of federal funding that has resulted in preliminary rebukes from judges telling the administration to reverse course. Meanwhile, on Thursday, the federal Department of Health and Human Services announced the layoff of 10,000 employees, including about 2,400 at the CDC.
“The reality is that, when we take funding away from public health systems, the systems just do not have the capacity, because they’re chronically underfunded over the decades,” Dr. Umair Shah, Washington state’s health secretary from late 2020 to January of this year, told The New York Times.
In their operating budget proposal released this week, Washington state Senate Democrats included a reduction of 230 full-time employees in the Department of Health, which is currently budgeted for about 2,350 employees. 
Many of those are tied to the loss of federal COVID-era funding, said state Sen. June Robinson, D-Everett. 
“It’s a rough time,” Robinson said over the weekend. “Public health always is funded in cycles of, you know, epidemics, and this is the downturn now.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/nihphoto-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-03-27 14:05:02.474887

The bill would also impose stricter punishment for districts that defy the law. Senate Bill 754, titled “School Calendar Flexibility: A New Alternative,” was filed by Senate Leader Phil Berger, R-Rockingham, [&#8230;]","Students work in a classroom at a Wake County public school. (Photo: Galen Bacharier) North Carolina Senate leaders introduced a bill earlier this week aimed at providing more flexibility to local school districts in setting their school calendars. The bill would also impose stricter punishment for districts that defy the law.
Senate Bill 754, titled “School Calendar Flexibility: A New Alternative,” was filed by Senate Leader Phil Berger, R-Rockingham, and Sens. Amy Galey, R-Alamance, and Michael Lee, R-New Hanover.    
The bill offers school districts two options for setting their academic calendars. One follows the current law, which requires a start date no earlier than Monday closest to Aug. 26 and end date no later than the Friday closest to June. The new options allow schools to start as early as the Monday closest to Aug. 19, with the school year ending no later than the Friday before Memorial Day.
The bill also outlines consequences for school boards that violate the law. The superintendent of public instruction would investigate violations and report to the State Board of Education. Districts that violate the law would lose funding for central office staff and supplies if they do not take corrective actions.
Residents and business owners of the district would also be able to sue their local school boards.
“This balances the desire of some school districts to start the school year earlier while still supporting our local businesses dependent on summer tourism,” Berger said in a release announcing the bill. “We must take the appropriate steps to hold school districts that break the law accountable.”
This marks a shift for Berger, who has long maintained that districts should stick to the current law.
Many school districts argue that an earlier start date allows them to complete a full semester of instruction and final exams before winter break, preventing learning loss during the recess. 
Supporters also point out that the flexibility would allow school districts to better align high school and community college schedules, making it easier for high school students to earn college credit while still in high school. 
The North Carolina tourism industry has long opposed granting school districts more control over their calendars, arguing that earlier start date hurts family vacations and summer tourism revenue. The state’s current school calendar law aligns with the industry’s preference for a break that includes most of August and was chiefly the result of industry lobbying effort when it was enacted in 2004.
Legislative efforts to grant local school districts more control over school calendars have stalled over the years. Multiple bills have already been introduced this year to grant local school boards greater authority to set academic calendars.
Many school districts have in the past defied the state’s Aug. 26 academic start date. Last year, a judge voided Carteret County’s proposed calendar, which had students starting nine weekdays earlier, on Aug. 13, after a group of parents and business owners sued the school board.
“Finding compromises like this isn’t always easy, but this bill is the culmination of good-faith efforts from stakeholders and legislators,” Sen. Galey said in the same release. “With the evolution of the school choice landscape, as well as North Carolina becoming the fifth most popular state for travel and tourism, it’s time to update and adapt our school calendar law.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_7318-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-27 14:05:02.474887

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Legislation legalizing sports betting, which gives tribal governments the exclusive right to operate it, has made its way through the House despite the governor’s opposition.
House Bills 1047 and 1101, authored by Rep. Ken Luttrell, R-Ponca City, would allow tribal gaming compacts to be amended to include sports betting. In exchange for exclusivity, the state would receive 10% of the revenue. 
But House Bill 1101 would send the decision of whether or not to legalize sports betting to the ballot box, bypassing Gov. Kevin Stitt who said he will veto any legislation giving tribes exclusivity. 
Rather than negotiating new gaming compacts, these bills add sports betting to the existing agreements. Rep. Steve Bashore, R-Miami, said Wednesday that negotiating new compacts could open the door to violating the exclusivity provision. The voter-approved compacts between the state and tribal governments give tribes the exclusive right to operate gaming in exchange for paying the state a portion of the revenues generated.
Luttrell said the language of these bills has gone through negotiations with Oklahoma’s tribes, the Oklahoma Indian Gaming Association and leaders of the Legislature. The tribes could choose to offer mobile betting and the Legislature would leave regulation up to the consensus of the tribes as it does with other forms of gaming, he said. 
“For the last three years, I’ve been in negotiations with the tribes and trying to get OIGA to take a stance and take a position and let us know what they really wanted,” he said. “They finally reached out to me last Friday with language that they wanted to see in the bill, things they thought were important. I’ve met with our leadership, we’ve come up with the cleanest, simplest possible sports betting bill that we can send to the Senate.”
He said millions of dollars leave Oklahoma every day with people taking their sports betting out of state.
Fiscal analyses of both bills estimate the revenue is about $140 million per year if sports betting is limited to “on-location betting”, but could reach $420 million annually if “mobile betting” is allowed. The state could receive between $14 million to $42 million annually. Luttrell said he thinks these are low estimates. 
Stitt has taken a strong stance against legislation that would give tribes exclusivity over sports betting. He said he wants a “free market solution” and will veto any legislation giving tribal exclusivity that comes to his desk. 
“Matter of fact, they’ve (lawmakers) excluded the governor of the state of Oklahoma from these discussions,” Stitt said Wednesday. “So when they say that all stakeholders have come to the table and agree on something … the governor has not weighed in on those things.”
House Bill 1101, which bypasses Stitt’s desk by sending the matter to the ballot, would only go into effect if House Bill 1047 is not signed into law. The governor would be able to set the date for when the question would go before voters. 
“If you have a moral obligation against gaming, if your Sunday school class doesn’t like gaming, if your constituency in your district doesn’t like gaming, by voting for this bill, this gives you cover,” Luttrell said. “You’re not going to have to vote to override a governor’s veto on gaming, you’re not gonna have to answer to your constituents why you voted for gaming because you’re gonna vote to give it to a vote of the people and let your constituents make the decision.”
At a meeting of the United Indian Nations of Oklahoma March 20, tribal leaders said Oklahoma is different from other states trying to legalize sports betting because there are 38 tribes who must come to an agreement. The head of OIGA said tribes shouldn’t rush into a “bad deal” with the state.
House Bill 1101 passed with a vote of 66-29, and 1047 passed 62-31. Both can be considered by the Senate. 
The Senate has advanced its own sports betting bill that would give the Oklahoma City Thunder, the state’s NBA team, a stake in sports betting. This bill is now eligible to be heard in the House.

(Courtesy Rhode Island General Assembly and Paul Santucci for State Representative)The state ethics panel has given the OK for one state representative to vote on the fiscal 2026 budget, but put the kibosh on another lawmaker’s ability to advocate for his landlord’s development plans.
The pair of advisory opinions issued by the Rhode Island Ethics Commission on Tuesday address inquiries regarding potential personal or professional conflicts by state legislators.
Rep. Arthur Corvese, a North Providence Democrat, sought the commission’s opinion regarding his son-in-law’s job with Meta. Gov. Dan McKee as part of his fiscal 2026 budget has proposed taxing global companies on the income they derive from digital advertisements in Rhode Island, which directly relates to Corvese’s son-in-law’s job as Meta policy director. Corvese already pledged in his written submission to recuse himself from any committee hearings at which his son-in-law, or one of his supervisees, testifies. But Corvese was unsure whether he could vote on the fiscal 2026 budget as a whole, should the final version include the proposed 10% digital advertising tax. The commission’s opinion gives Corvese permission to vote on the budget as a whole — though not individual line items pertaining to the tax — noting that Meta and his son-in-lawr’s financial standing is unchanged by the state’s tax proposal.
However, the commission did not give a similar rubber stamp to another state representative’s inquiry regarding his business landlord’s development plans. 
In a separate advisory opinion, the commission concluded that Rep. Paul Santucci, a Smithfield Republican, could not comment on or vote on any legislation related to his company landlord’s plans to develop a 300-acre industrial park in his district because the pair are business associates. No legislation regarding the planned development has been introduced, so the question for now remains hypothetical. Should a bill be submitted, Santucci should recuse himself from the vote or seek further input from the commission.
Neither Corvese nor Santucci immediately returned inquiries for comment on Thursday.

This story was originally published by The 19th. 
State legislatures craft most of the laws passed in the United States and serve as the main pipeline for higher office. But sexual harassment in state politics “remains a systemic and ongoing issue affecting both parties,” according to a recent report from the nonpartisan National Women’s Defense League (NWDL), first shared with The 19th.
“Our latest research reinforces what we already knew: the problem of sexual harassment in statehouses is pervasive, damaging and covered up,” said Emma Davidson Tribbs, the NWDL’s co-founder and director. “These abuses of power that not only inflict trauma, but impede policy making, waste taxpayer resources, and disproportionately impact the leadership of women and minorities in government.”
NWDL published its inaugural report, “Abuse of Power: Uncovering a Decade of Sexual Harassment in State Government,” which tracked allegations over a 10-year period beginning in 2013, in November 2023. The updated report, released earlier this month, identified 400 allegations of sexual harassment against 145 sitting state lawmakers between 2013 and 2024. The report tracked 11 new public allegations against lawmakers in 10 states in 2024 and included four allegations inadvertently omitted from the 2023 report. The number of actual incidents is likely three times higher due to underreporting, the report said.
Public allegations of sexual misconduct against state lawmakers peaked at the height of the #MeToo movement in 2017 and 2018, leading to new protections and policy changes in some states. NWDL was founded in 2022 to track, research and develop solutions to the pervasive problem of sexual misconduct in the halls of power.
There are over 7,300 state lawmakers serving in 99 state legislative chambers throughout the United States. State legislatures are largely self-governing bodies, and even after a spate of post-#MeToo reforms, many lawmakers surveyed said the mechanisms for reporting misconduct in their states are lacking.
While the NWDL report did not track allegations against staff, sexual misconduct allegations against high-ranking staff members in the Pennsylvania governor’s office, Los Angeles mayor’s and Indianapolis mayor’s office also shed light on the issue in 2024.
As part of the updated 2024 report, NWDL commissioned a survey of state legislators, designed with perspective and input from other advocacy groups and conducted by Understory, a research and policy consulting firm. Out of the  207 lawmakers who responded, 57% were women, 40.6% were men and 2.4% identified another way. Roughly a third of all state lawmakers are women.
One in 3 state lawmakers surveyed said they experienced or witnessed sexual harassment in their state capitol, with 62% saying they personally experienced harassment.
The most common kinds of harassment they reported were verbal (88%), physical (42%) and unwanted sexual advances (40%). A little over a third, 35%, said they did not report the harassment. Of those who did report, 53% said the incident was investigated, a quarter said it was not and 22% said they didn’t know the outcome.
Of the incidents that were investigated, 42% led to consequences for the accused perpetrator, 36% said the accused perpetrator faced no consequences and 21% said they didn’t know the outcome.
About two-thirds of respondents, 64%, said their state had an official process for reporting sexual misconduct, and 40% said they didn’t receive sexual harassment training and didn’t know if it was required in their state.
State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Nebraska said in a statement that she “experienced various forms of harassment almost from my first day in office.”
“One particularly notable incident occurred during a livestream of a floor debate when a colleague mentioned my name while reading a scene that described a rape, demanding a sex act,” the Democrat said. “The response from leadership in the legislature highlighted how inadequately we have addressed the issue of harassment, failing to protect staff, lobbyists, citizens, and elected officials within our government.”
State Rep. Abby Major of Pennsylvania said she’d “experienced harassment in the very halls where our laws are made.”
“In Harrisburg, it’s all too common — the governor’s top adviser, sitting lawmakers, lobbyists — and it’s all unacceptable,” the Republican said. “That’s why I’ve continued to sponsor legislation that would help prevent harassment, support survivors, and ensure that we hold everyone in the Commonwealth’s statehouse accountable.”
Across 88 bills relating to sexual harassment passed in 24 states in 2024,  NWDL identified six bills in five states that focused on tackling sexual misconduct, which included state legislatures and other “political workspaces.” “This progress, while important, barely makes a dent in the work needed to address the problem of sexual harassment in legislatures,” the report said.
“Most legislatures have failed to enact laws, policies, and oversight mechanisms that establish safe workplace standards, protections for employees, and safeguards to prevent political and partisan self-interest from undermining the process,” the report found.
In some cases, political party organizations like the Nebraska Senate Republicans, Kentucky House Democrats and Indiana Senate Democrats took action to address reports of sexual misconduct in their ranks, and implemented internal rules and procedures to address sexual misconduct.
In Indiana, several Democratic officials faced public sexual misconduct allegations in 2024, prompting 40 women in Indiana politics to send a letter to the state Democratic Party demanding accountability. The accusations and surrounding outcry led to state Senate Minority Leader Greg Taylor’s ouster from leadership, the state Democratic Party instituting new ethics reforms, and state Democratic Party chair Mike Schmuhl announcing he wouldn’t seek another term.
Elise Shrock, an Indiana political strategist, said in a statement she was “appalled by the ongoing pattern of sexual harassment and the lack of appetite to make the substantive, common sense changes necessary to fix it.”
“A lack of basic professionalism and respect will continue to drain our political bench,” she added. “We must fix this now.”
Sexual harassment in state capitols has a damaging effect of further marginalizing women, and especially women of color, out of political spaces, influencing whose voices are heard and what policies get passed, NWDL said. State legislatures also cultivate the bench of talent for higher offices.
The report’s release comes amid a cultural and political backlash to the #MeToo movement with some men who have been accused of sexual misconduct returning to political power.
President Donald Trump was elected to a second term in November after a jury found him liable for sexually abusing and defaming advice columnist E. Jean Carroll. He subsequently appointed several people accused of sexual misconduct to his Cabinet, including former Rep. Matt Gaetz, who began his career in the Florida state legislature. Gaetz withdrew his nomination ahead of the release of a House Ethics Committee report finding substantial evidence he had sex with a minor and paid women for sex. Gaetz was never criminally charged and denied all of the allegations.
And Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat who resigned as governor of New York in 2021 after a damning investigation found he sexually harassed 11 women while in office, is attempting a political comeback with a campaign for mayor of New York City.
Cuomo, a onetime Democratic power player, resigned as governor of New York in 2021 after a five-month investigation commissioned by the New York attorney general’s office produced a damning 165-page report outlining evidence he had sexually harassed 11 women while in office. A separate investigation from the Department of Justice found Cuomo harassed 13 women who worked for the state over the course of eight years. Cuomo has denied the allegations of sexual harassment, but he has publicly apologized for overfamiliar contact and off-color jokes that made women uncomfortable.
“Addressing sexual harassment in state government could prevent serial sexual harassers — and research shows that most are repeat offenders — from causing more harm from greater positions of influence,” the report said. “In short, action at the state legislative level is an opportunity to clean up higher levels of government as well.”",https://stateline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Cuomo.jpg,,,2025-03-27 14:05:02.474887

(Photo by Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)An attempt to censure Maine House Speaker Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford) failed despite frustration from the minority party about the enforcement of House rules. 
Rep. Shelley Rudnicki (R-Fairfield) introduced the order, arguing that the Democrat had violated two House rules: one that states business cannot be conducted after 9 p.m. and another that requires the agreement of two-thirds of members present to dispense House rules. 
The censure — an official statement of condemnation by the Legislature — failed 24-119, after House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor) and other Republicans said they understand the frustration felt by some members of their party, but that it didn’t rise to the level of revoking Fecteau’s ability to vote or speak on the floor.
Rudnicki claims Feacteau violated these rules on March 20 when both chambers held lengthy sessions to pass the two-year budget. She also claimed the choice to work late into the night put members at risk of harm given that many had to drive home after the day’s work. 
That evening, Fecteau determined that the rule that business cannot be conducted after 9 p.m. had been suspended by implication of a majority of representatives returning to work after that time. A majority of the House also voted that evening to sustain that determination. Republicans pointed back to the rules, which state a two-thirds majority of members present is needed to dispense a rule.
“The censure of a member of this body should not be taken lightly,” said Assistant Majority Leader Lori Gramlich of Old Orchard Beach, whose comment was met with scoffs from across the aisle. 
Gramlich argued that the censure order failed to recognize decades of precedent with work extending past 9 p.m. under an implication and not by a vote. She specifically mentioned the 125th Legislature, during which the House worked past 9 p.m. without taking a vote to do so at least five times under Republican Speaker Bob Nutting. 
A few Republicans questioned why the 9 p.m. rule is in place if it isn’t going to be followed, including some freshman representatives who said it has been confusing trying to understand which rules are actually adhered to. Some felt that if the rule is on the books, it’s the speaker’s job to follow it or it should be updated. 
Despite not supporting Rudnicki’s order, Faulkingham said Democrats have “made a mockery of the censure process.” He pointed out that there have only been four censures in the Maine Legislature since 1820 and three of them — including the ongoing censure of Rep. Laurel Libby (R-Auburn) — have come in the past year and a half under Democratic majorities. The first censure was an independent from Auburn in 2001. 
“Frankly, we need to focus on our work and not focus on censures, which I think has been a huge distraction of this body for the last three months,” said Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport), expressing concern also voiced by Faulkingham that the body should be using its time more productively. 
Before the vote, Rep. Will Tuell (R-East Machias) suggested that other representatives reject the censure of Fecteau, rescind the censure of Libby and revisit the rule governing the process. He proposed requiring a two-thirds vote, rather than just a majority, to censure a lawmaker. 
Libby was censured in late February for posting on her legislative Facebook page photographs and personal details about a transgender high school athlete. Last April, Rudnicki and Rep. Michael Lemelin (R-Chelsea) were censured for comments they made that implied that the Legislature’s enactment of an abortion bill caused the mass shooting in Lewiston by invoking God’s wrath.

Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer.Legislation at the Minnesota Capitol aims to end 140 years of squabbling over legislative district boundaries by removing lawmakers from the redistricting process and putting it under the control of a bipartisan commission instead. 
Bills in both chambers (HF550/SF824) would create an eight-member panel to oversee the redistricting process, with an equal number of panel members selected by each of the two major political parties. 
The bill’s supporters say the panel would ensure that the state’s districts are drawn in the spirit of compromise, rather than the ferocious partisan brinkmanship that characterizes the redistricting process in some other states, including Wisconsin.
“It creates a transparent framework where political biases are exposed, rather than hidden, giving Minnesotans meaningful insight into how district lines are drawn,” Brian Cook of the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce said last month in support of the bill.
But the bill has run into opposition from a seemingly unusual quarter: good governance groups that have been pushing for redistricting reform for years. 
“This legislative session started with unacceptable levels of partisanship and gridlock and this bill will accelerate it,” said Annastacia Belladonna-Carrera, executive director of Common Cause Minnesota. “If Minnesota wants true redistricting reform that puts the people first, HF550 is not getting us there.”
The opponents fear that a bipartisan commission will fall prey to the same partisan disagreements that have derailed the existing legislative redistricting process over the years. 
Consider what happened in New York.
In 2014, voters there approved the creation of a bipartisan commission almost identical to the one under consideration in Minnesota. Then-Governor Andrew Cuomo boasted at the time that the bill would “permanently reform the redistricting process in New York to once and for all end self-interested partisan gerrymandering.” 
The committee faceplanted right out of the gate by failing to agree on a plan. Instead, each party’s representatives on the commission presented their own competing proposals to the state legislature.
The legislature rejected both proposals and told the commission to draw up a new one. It deadlocked again. The legislature went ahead and drew up its own plan, which was signed into law by the governor. 
Less than a month later, state courts invalidated the entire process and struck down the congressional maps as an illegal partisan gerrymander.
The state Supreme Court ordered a special master to draw up temporary maps in time for the 2022 midterms, and then in 2023 it ordered the original redistricting commission to go back to the drawing board and give the whole thing another go.
That second independent redistricting attempt went marginally better: The proposed maps for state legislative districts were approved by April 2023. But legislators didn’t like the congressional district maps. The Democratic supermajority threw them out and eventually drew their own, which were signed into law a little over a year ago.
The whole process took twice as long as the previous round of redistricting under the old rules.
HF550 is different from New York’s setup in one critical respect: The Minnesota bill does not require state legislators to sign off on the new maps created by the commission. 
And while the bill provides for judicial review of any legal challenges to a commission plan, it is silent regarding what might happen if the commission members can’t agree on one to begin with.
Common Cause Minnesota and allied groups like the League of Women Voters want to see a bill more along the lines of one proposed last year. That bill would allow members of the public to apply to serve on the redistricting commission, with the state Legislative Coordinating Commission ultimately selecting a 15-member panel: Five Democrats, five Republicans, and five people who are politically independent or affiliated with a third party.
“Our goal is to advance grassroots, people-centered reforms by establishing a citizen-led independent redistricting commission,” Belladonna-Carrera said. “This commission will focus on the needs and voices of the people, rather than political parties, incumbents or candidates.”
It’s unclear whether anything will pass this legislative term, and the clock is ticking.

Free.,Appeals court turns down Trump administration on reinstating OMB funding freeze,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/appeals-court-turns-down-trump-administration-reinstating-omb-funding-freeze,,"WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court on Wednesday denied a request from the Trump administration to overturn a lower court’s preliminary injunction, which has so far blocked the White House budget office from implementing a freeze on trillions in grants and loans.The 48-page opinion from the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals’ three-judge panel said the Department of Justice failed to show that the federal government would “be irreparably injured absent a stay,” or that a stay of the lower court’s ruling pending appeal would serve the “public interest.”The ruling came from Chief Judge David Barron, Judge Lara Montecalvo and Judge Julie Rikelman.

McIntyre of Clarinda, who has been charged by the board [&#8230;]","The Iowa Board of Medicine regulates the state's medical profession as part of the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing. (Photo by Getty Images, board seal courtesy the State of Iowa) In four separate disciplinary cases, the state Board of Medicine has charged Iowa physicians with several regulatory violations, including incompetence, removing the wrong ovary from a patient, sexual harassment and failure to meet professional standards.
One of the four cases pertains to Dr. Carol L. McIntyre of Clarinda, who has been charged by the board with performing surgery at the anatomically incorrect site, engaging in unethical or unprofessional conduct, and indiscriminately or promiscuously prescribing drugs to a member of her immediate family.
The board alleges that in May 2022, McIntyre performed surgery on a patient at Clarinda Regional Health Center, intending to remove the woman’s left ovary where a cyst had been found. According to the board, McIntyre later confirmed that while in surgery she mistakenly removed the patient’s right ovary instead of the left one, stating that she “just got confused.”
The board also alleges McIntyre has been “dismissive and condescending to her patients and (has) lacked compassion in treating her patients.” The board claims McIntyre was once “loud and disrespectful” toward a patient, telling the patient to reschedule an appointment because she was late when, in fact, the patient was 15 minutes early for her scheduled appointment.
The board also alleges that while working at Clarinda Regional Health Center, McIntyre saw her daughter and prescribed controlled substances for her.
The board has fined McIntyre $5,000 and issued her a warning indicating future violations could result in additional sanctions. The board has imposed no restrictions on McIntyre’s ability to practice.
Court records indicate the patient in the ovary-removal case is Sarah Kurz of Missouri. In 2024, Kurz sued McIntyre and Clarinda Regional Health Center for alleged negligence. In response, McIntyre admitted removing Kurz’s right ovary, but denied any wrongdoing and asserted that any of the damages claimed by Kurz were the result of a preexisting medical condition.
A trial is scheduled for September 2026.
Sanctions against other physicians
The other Iowa physicians recently sanctioned by the board include:
— Dr. Jose Figueroa of Des Moines, who was charged by the board with sexual harassment and unprofessional conduct based on allegations that date back 12 years. The board alleges that in 2013, while performing “a manipulation technique” on a patient, Figueroa made contact that the patient that was perceived to be of a sexual nature, and his employer directed him to stop using that specific technique.
In 2017, Figueroa allegedly made comments about a student’s appearance that made the student – whom Figueroa was also treating as a patient — feel uncomfortable. Also in 2017, a patient complained about Figueroa’s use of a technique that was similar to that used in the 2013 incident.
In 2021, a female coworker reported that Figueroa crossed personal and professional boundaries through close physical proximity, gestures and inappropriate comments regarding her physical appearance. The board has placed Figueroa’s license on probation for two years and required him to have a chaperone present for all female patient examinations, treatment, procedures, or consultations. Figueroa has also been fined $5,000.
— Dr. Case Everett of Ottumwa, who has been charged by the board with professional incompetence for failure to exercise in a substantial respect that degree of care which is ordinarily exercised by the average physician. According to the board, Everett was proctoring another physician in September 2021 when he failed to “determine or otherwise push the proctored physician to determine” that a patient needed a C-section due to the fetal heart tones displayed on a heart-rate monitor. The publicly available board documents give no indication as to the outcome of the patient’s case.
Everett and the board recently settled the case with the board stipulating that Everett “may not engage in the practice of obstetrics under his Iowa medical license.” The restriction does not prohibit him from treating patients during pregnancy or post-partum as part of his family medicine practice, and it does not prohibit him from assisting an obstetrician with deliveries or providing obstetric services in “emergency situations.”  Everett can apply to have the restriction lifted after completing a one-year obstetrics fellowship at a program recognized by the Board of Certification in Family Medicine Obstetrics.
— Dr. Andrew Epstein, who is licensed to practice in Iowa and 21 other states and has worked as a telehealth provider in recent years. According to the board, North Carolina concluded more than a year ago that Epstein had inappropriately prescribed ketamine to telehealth patients in contravention of acceptable, standard medical practices.
Specifically, the North Carolina Board of Medicine concluded that for four separate telehealth patients, Epstein failed to conduct urine drug screens or physical examinations before prescribing ketamine, and failed to ensure protocols were in place regarding patient monitoring. On Jan. 4, 2024, the North Carolina board reprimanded Epstein and restricted him from prescribing ketamine to patients. On Dec. 1, 2024, the North Carolina board reinstated Epstein’s ability to prescribe ketamine. Earlier this month, the Iowa board issued Epstein a warning that any future violations could result in sanctions.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DOCTOR.jpg,,,2025-03-27 13:08:12.061016

HHS overall will be downsized from a full-time workforce of 82,000 to 62,000, including those who took early retirement or a buyout offer.HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. released a written statement along with the announcement, saying the changes would benefit Americans.""We aren't just reducing bureaucratic sprawl. We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic,” Kennedy said. “This Department will do more — a lot more — at a lower cost to the taxpayer.""  The U.S. Senate voted to confirm Kennedy as the nation’s top public health official in mid-February.Democrats immediately reacted with deep concern.Senate Appropriations Committee ranking member Patty Murray, D-Wash., said that she was “stunned at the lack of thought about what they are doing to the American public and their health.”Murray said the committee, which controls about one-third of all federal spending, ""absolutely"" has an oversight role to play in tracking HHS actions.Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, the top Democrat on the Appropriations subcommittee that funds HHS, said she believes HHS has overstepped its authority and expects the panel will look into its actions.“These individuals who are going to be terminated under this plan play vital roles in the health of Wisconsinites and people nationally,” Baldwin said. “And I believe that they do not have the authority, the Trump administration does not have the authority to do this wholesale reorganization without working with Congress.”Maryland Democratic Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, whose constituents in suburban Washington likely hold many of the jobs in question, wrote in a statement the HHS’ restructuring plans are “dangerous and deadly.”“I warned America that confirming RFK Jr. would be a mistake,” Alsobrooks wrote. “His blatant distrust of science and disregard for research and advancement makes him completely unqualified.”Cuts across departmentThe announcement says reorganizing HHS will cut its $1.7 trillion annual budget by about $1.8 billion, in part, by lowering overall staff levels.Staffing cuts will be spread out over HHS and several of the agencies it oversees. The restructuring plans to eliminate 3,500 full-time workers at the FDA, 2,400 employees at the CDC, 1,200 staff at the NIH and 300 workers at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

“The consolidation and cuts are designed not only to save money, but to make the organization more efficient and more responsive to Americans’ needs, and to implement the Make America Healthy Again goal of ending the chronic disease epidemic,” according to a fact sheet.Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, or HELP, Committee Chairman Bill Cassidy, R-La., wrote in a statement that he looks ""forward to hearing how this reorganization furthers these goals.""“I am interested in HHS working better, such as lifesaving drug approval more rapidly, and Medicare service improved,"" Cassidy wrote.Regional offices, divisions affectedHHS did not immediately respond to a request from States Newsroom about which five of its 10 regional offices would shutter or when those closures would take effect.Its website shows the offices are located in Boston; New York City; Philadelphia; Atlanta; Chicago; Dallas; Kansas City, Missouri; Denver; San Francisco; and Seattle.HHS plans to reduce its divisions from 28 to 15 while also establishing the Administration for a Healthy America, or AHA.That new entity will combine the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, Health Resources and Services Administration, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.That change will “improve coordination of health resources for low-income Americans and will focus on areas including, Primary Care, Maternal and Child Health, Mental Health, Environmental Health, HIV/AIDS, and Workforce development. Transferring SAMHSA to AHA will increase operational efficiency and assure programs are carried out because it will break down artificial divisions between similar programs,” according to the announcement.HHS will roll the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response into the CDC.The department plans to create a new assistant secretary for enforcement, who will be responsible for work within the Departmental Appeals Board, Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals and Office for Civil Rights.House speaker says HHS is ‘bloated’U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., posted on social media that he fully backed the changes in store for HHS.​​”HHS is one of the most bureaucratic and bloated government agencies,” Johnson wrote. “@SecKennedy is bringing new, much-needed ideas to the department by returning HHS to its core mission while maintaining the critical programs it provides Americans.”Advocates shared Democrats’ concern about the staff cutbacks.Stella Dantas, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, released a statement saying the organization was ""alarmed by the sudden termination of thousands of dedicated HHS employees, whose absence compounds the loss of thousands of fellow employees who have already been forced to leave U.S. health agencies.""“Thanks to collaboration with HHS, ACOG has been able to contribute to advances in the provision of maternal health care, broadened coverage of critical preventive care, increased adoption of vaccines, raised awareness of fetal alcohol syndrome, strengthened STI prevention efforts, and more,"" Dantas wrote.

(Photo courtesy of Drake University)As the president, governors and legislators elevate the stress and anxiety in higher education in the United States by seeking to change how colleges and universities operate and what they teach, the contrast between how an Ivy League school and an Iowa university responded shows the courage gap among college leaders.
Columbia University, the 270-year-old private, non-profit institution in New York City, garnered intense governmental attention and public criticism last week.
The Trump administration canceled $400 million in federal grants for medical and scientific research because of what the president thought was the school’s inadequate response to pro-Palestinian protests on campus growing out of Israel’s war in Gaza. The president demanded the school make a series of substantive changes as preconditions for the feds’ restoration of the grants — including banning protesters from wearing masks, thereby making it easier to identify them.
Robert Reich, a University of California professor of public policy and former member of the Clinton cabinet, wrote last week about the Trump administration’s actions: “Don’t fool yourself into thinking this is just about Trump wanting to protect Jewish students from expressions of antisemitism. It’s about the Trump regime wanting to impose all sorts of values on American higher education. … It’s all about intimidation.”

Drake stands firm
While the Ivy League school withered in the spotlight and gave in to the pressure, Drake University, the largest private school in Iowa, stood firm against the tide of federal and state mandates to end diversity, equity and inclusivity initiatives in a way few institutions have in recent weeks.
Marty Martin has led Drake as its president for the past 10 years. On March 3, he offered a blunt defense to Drake’s faculty, staff and students of what opponents to diversity, equality, and inclusiveness label simply as DEI.
In an email titled “A Welcoming Place for All,” Martin wrote:
“A great strength of Drake University is the ever-increasing diversity of the individuals who make up this wonderful place. That diversity is essential to our mission promise to prepare our students for meaningful personal lives, professional accomplishment, and responsible global citizenship.
“It creates opportunities for life-changing relationships. It makes our campus more interesting and vibrant. It broadens perspectives and enriches the learning experience. It ultimately makes our University stronger and more resilient.”
Martin continued: “When we open ourselves up to the wide array of individuals and communities around us, our lives become more grounded, joyful, and fulfilling. We learn that our differences are not weaknesses, they are strengths. We discover that exploring those differences with open minds and hearts, with empathy and love, is one of the most meaningful experiences we can have in life.”
Martin has a message for Iowa officials
Martin then directed his attention to Iowa state government:
“On Friday, Governor Reynolds signed a bill ending eighteen years of civil rights protection for transgender and nonbinary Iowans. This action is one among many current state and federal efforts that seek to turn our differences into division. Instead of working to find a shared path grounded in respect for the basic human dignity possessed by every person, too many public officials are seeking to marginalize and isolate our colleagues, neighbors, friends, and loved ones.
“This is a moral failure against which we stand in opposition. It is our duty to respect, support, and affirm anyone in our community targeted by these actions.”
Gov. Kim Reynolds signs bill repealing civil rights protections for gender identity

Martin concluded, “The road ahead is going to present many challenges to the values that define this institution. … My hope is that we travel this road together grounded in a shared commitment to be there for each other every step of the way. You have my unwavering commitment to remain steadfast in fostering a welcoming, inclusive, and safe community for all.”
Martin’s message was not written in a vacuum. And effective and courageous leadership does not occur in a vacuum, either.
At a time when academic freedom and First Amendment rights get pushback from federal and state government officials, Marty Martin elevated Drake University above a concerning number of other colleges and universities that have bowed to outside political pressure and legalized extortion.
Federal research grants are not some form of reward or incentive available only to government’s “friends.” Nor should these grants — and the promise they hold for healthier lives — become a tool for intimidation.
Outside money shouldn’t be intimidation tool
Government never should have the power to condition benefits, funding or support on a waiver of constitutional rights or civil liberties.
Presumably, the medical research grants the Trump administration is cutting originated because government saw important societal benefits from the breakthroughs these institutions’ scientists have achieved — breakthroughs that have improved survival rates and new treatments for breast cancer, for heart disease, for leukemia, diabetes and other health disorders.
Martin’s letter also comes at a time when a bill moving through the Iowa Legislature would withhold Iowa Tuition Grants from private colleges and universities in the state if a school refuses to end its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. (The bill has cleared the Iowa House and is awaiting debate in the Senate.)
The tuition grant program was created in 1972 and has made higher education more affordable for qualifying students who choose to attend an Iowa private, not-for-profit college or university. The state spends about $50 million this year on these need-based scholarships.
A bit of irony
That the Legislature is considering conditioning college tuition support on how private colleges run their internal operations — their diversity and equality initiatives — stands in sharp contrast with the hands-off position the state takes with private K-12 schools and their acceptance of education savings account money. These voucher accounts provide $7,800 in tax money for each student to assist with their private school tuition.
The question now is whether state and federal government officials take a similar hands-off attitude toward the pledge by Marty Martin and Drake University to keep its campus welcoming, nurturing and supportive of all students, all faculty and all staff.

“It is with sadness that I remove you as a member of the University of Virginia Board of Visitors,” the governor wrote in a Wednesday letter to Ellis, who has a history of making controversial statements and whose 2022 appointment to the board was protested by UVA “faculty senate, student council and campus newspaper, the Cavalier Daily,” according to VPM News.
Youngkin thanked Ellis for his “hard work,” but also wrote that Ellis’ conduct “on many occasions” has violated the state’s Code of Conduct for state boards and commissions, and the Board of Visitors Statement of Visitor Responsibilities.
Youngkin’s letter stopped short of expanding on Ellis’ alleged violations.
Ellis’ future on the board came into question after the Washington Post reported on Tuesday that the governor wanted to remove his appointee, despite the two sharing a common goal to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. 
On March 8, the board voted to dissolve UVA’s DEI office to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order that threatened to strip federal funding from colleges and universities that didn’t comply. DEI opponents believe that hiring and promoting people should be based on merit and not on someone’s race or gender, while supporters say DEI initiatives are meant to address systematic bias that historically stalled the progress of Americans of color and women.
“This board unanimously voted to rip out the entire DEI infrastructure and everybody who works in the DEI infrastructure,” Ellis told The Daily Progress March 20. “Absolutely every aspect of it, every aspect of every program. Every aspect of DEI is to be ripped out, shredded and terminated.”
But that wasn’t the first time the outspoken Ellis has expressed his opinion on other controversial matters, including social issues and pro-Gaza demonstrations.
He has been recorded criticizing law enforcement for how they do their jobs on UVA’s campus and reportedly confronted a student about a sign posted on her dorm room door referencing the university’s ties to slavery. 
Ellis is a 1975 UVA graduate and the former president of the Jefferson Council. He is a  serial entrepreneur and investor who has founded and operated numerous companies including Ellis Capital, a consulting and investment firm focused on media, technology, healthcare, and fintech. He also serves as the Lead Director of Johnson Energy Storage in Atlanta, which is developing next-generation solid-state batteries for electric vehicles.
Shortly after dismissing Ellis, the governor announced that Cuccinelli, a 1991 UVA graduate, would join the board.
“Ken’s legal and policy expertise will be incredibly valuable to ensure swift action with the ongoing changes and challenges in higher education,” Youngkin said in a statement. “I have full confidence he will help ensure Mr. Jefferson’s University remains a place of opportunity, merit, and academic freedom.”",https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/UVA-Rotunda-II-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-27 13:08:12.061016

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)Superintendent of Public Instruction Ryan Walters awarded nearly $600,000 in end-of-year bonuses to Department of Education staff in 2024.
Most employees received an amount equal to 2.5% of their annual salary, an average of $1,700.
A few received significantly higher amounts, payroll data shows. They include the department’s chief academic officer, Walters’ executive assistant, the director of social studies and the open records coordinator.

Chief Policy Advisor Matt Langston received nearly $45,000 in January, $34,000 more than a typical paycheck, according to payroll data on the state’s transparency website. It’s unclear whether that reflects a raise, a bonus, or both. It’s coded as regular pay. A spokeswoman for Walters, Grace Kim, would not answer questions.
“The press office does not comment on personnel matters,” Kim said.
Langston is one of the agency’s highest-paid employees, earning approximately $130,000 in 2024, which is estimated because three months of the agency’s payroll data are missing from the website.
Langston ran Walters’ 2022 campaign for superintendent and is CEO of the Austin, Texas, based political consulting firm, Engage Right. The firm last year worked with Texas House candidate Stormy Bradley, public ethics reports show. Bradley was defeated in the Republican primary in March.
Langston is registered to vote in Texas, records show, indicating he’s not an Oklahoma resident. Governor Kevin Stitt ended remote work for state employees as of February 1, and Walters did so for his staff in early 2023.
In June, a group of lawmakers asked Attorney General Gentner Drummond to investigate whether Langston was a so-called ghost employee. Republican and former House member Mark McBride, who initiated the request, defined a ghost employee as “an individual who is listed on the payroll but does not actually perform the duties associated with their position.” That, he said, would constitute a misuse of public funds and undermine public trust.
Drummond declined to pursue the investigation.
Langston did not respond to an email or phone call seeking comment. Kim, a spokeswoman for the department, said the press office would not comment on personnel matters. Questions sent to general counsel Michael Beason and program manager Kellie Keefe were referred back to Kim.
Public employees’ gross pay, dates of employment and title or position are public record under Oklahoma law.
The department paid more than $600,000 in bonuses to staff in December, payroll records show. Walters did not receive one; the superintendent’s salary is set in statute at $124,373.
Chief Academic Officer Todd Loftin received an additional $18,000 in December; the records show he received an additional $15,000 in July as well. Loftin earns $120,000 a year.
The records show that Lexi Flanagan, Walters’ executive assistant, and Brenda Beymer-Chapman, the agency’s director of social studies, each received just over $9,000, about 13% of their respective salaries. Flanagan graduated from McAlester High School in 2016, where Walters was a history and U.S. government teacher.
Marley Billingsley, the agency’s open records coordinator, received a bonus of just under $9,000.
In addition to the agency-wide end-of-year bonuses, Walters intends to implement a performance-based bonus program at the agency this month, according to an email dated December 12. In the email, he told staff those bonuses would be paid this month and tied to annual performance evaluations.
We asked Kim to provide details of this initiative but did not receive a response before publication.
Walters, in his agency’s budget request to the Legislature, requested an additional $2.3 million to cover a 6% cost-of-living salary increase for Education Department staff and an increase in benefit costs. Senators in an appropriations committee meeting in February questioned the need to fund a cost-of-living increase, considering the department has decreased its employee count.
He told the committee the agency employed 520 people when he took office in January 2023. There were 387 on the payroll as of January 31, according to the state’s transparency website.

Pete Hegseth (right) (Hegseth photo credit: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images. Tillis photo via Senate.gov) Earlier this year, I penned an essay for NC Newsline entitled “Trump cabinet nominee Pete Hegseth is completely unfit to lead.”
I wish I had been wrong. But given the stunning and maddening revelations about the now infamous Signal chat in which Secretary Hegseth discussed operational attack plans on the Houthi rebel group in Yemen, the accuracy of the piece has been confirmed faster than even I had imagined.
The main point of the essay was that Hegseth was arguably the least qualified cabinet secretary nominee in U.S. history, and that if he was confirmed it could have real and dangerous consequences for our troops in the field and for our country’s national security. At the time, I was pleading with North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis and his colleagues to take their job of voting on Hegseth’s nomination seriously and to recognize that such a character should never be allowed anywhere near a position of authority in the Pentagon. I have to confess though that I didn’t think that Hegseth would prove me right so quickly and in such an egregious way.
The remarkable revelation that Secretary Hegseth and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz inadvertently invited journalist, Jeffrey Goldberg from The Atlantic, to a text chain that also included Director of National Intelligence Chief Tulsi Gabbard and Vice President JD Vance sounds like the beginning of a bad Saturday Night Live skit. It would be hilarious if the potential consequences hadn’t been so dangerous.
Tragically, however, this disaster took place in real life, and because of the gross incompetence and complete lack of judgment by the Trump administration’s entire national security team, the troops carrying out this mission could have been killed. The fact that the “Bad News Bears” of national security officials were openly discussing specific target locations, time and date of the strike, and the specific ammunitions that would be used is beyond unforgiveable. This would be like if in World War II General Eisenhower was openly discussing the exact war plans for the D-Day invasion so the Germans could find out and prepare their defenses.
At a bare minimum, Pete Hegseth and Mike Waltz should be fired. Everyone that was on that chat should be held accountable because discussions like that must be held in what’s known as a “sensitive compartmented information facility,” and they all know that.
If it is even remotely possible to accidentally invite a journalist into a conversation about detailed attack plans, such a conversation should never take place on an app of that kind. It’s common sense that even a fifth grader could understand. Unfortunately, Hegseth and crew are either too lazy or just don’t care and think that they are all above the law. It is probably a combination of both.
Any military veteran can tell you that if we were ever caught being this incompetent in handling sensitive operational plans that could compromise our fellow soldiers in the field then we would almost certainly be kicked out of the military with a dishonorable discharge and face possible imprisonment at Fort Leavenworth.
Pete Hegseth likes to brag about how he removed DEI from the military and that soldiers will be judged only on their performance and nothing else. Well, now is the time for him to put up or shut up because he fouled up in a monumental way and made it crystal clear that he is completely unfit to lead our brave men and women in uniform. They deserve so much better than him and his lack of leadership.
And speaking of foul-ups, we must not forget Senator Tillis.
Tillis had the chance to show some real courage and backbone by doing the right thing and being the deciding vote to sink Hegseth’s nomination. Sadly, and predictably, he chose the coward’s way out because he thought it would help him in the Republican primary for next year’s Senate election.
And maybe he is right that it will help him in the primary, but it is absolutely going to hurt him in the general election. If the Democrats are smart, then they will repeatedly remind voters that Hegseth’s dangerously incompetent performance was only made possible by Tillis’s cowardice.

Tillis assured Danielle Hegseth that if she came forward that it would be enough to sway his vote and the votes of other senators and sink the nomination.

(Courtesy of DFL)With some polls showing the special congressional election race in Florida’s 6th District next week is actually competitive, Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin announced Thursday that he will join Florida Democratic Party chair Nikki Fried this weekend for two get-out-the-vote events there.
Orlando schoolteacher Josh Weil is running as a Democrat against Republican state Sen. Randy Fine next Tuesday in the special election called after the former U.S. representative from the district, Mike Waltz, joined the Trump administration as national security adviser.
The district encompasses St. John’s, Flagler, Volusia, and Lake counties, and it voted for Waltz by more than 30 percentage points in November over his Democratic opponent. However, Weil has raised more than $9 million in the race, dwarfing the amount collected by Fine as of earlier this week.
A St. Pete Polls survey conducted for Florida Politics this week showed Fine leading Weil by just four percentage points, 48%-44%.
Martin, who was elected to lead the DNC in January, will join Fried for press availabilities in Daytona Beach on Saturday and St. Augustine on Sunday, according to a press release issued by the FDP on Thursday.
Another special congressional election will take place in Florida next Tuesday. That’s in the 1st Congressional District, the seat Republican Matt Gaetz held for eight years until he resigned in November to serve as Trump’s attorney general (he later withdrew from consideration).
Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis won a contested Republican primary election for the seat in January and now faces Democrat Gay Valimont. Congressional District 1 includes the far northwestern part of the state — Escambia, Okaloosa, Santa Rosa, and parts of Walton counties. Valimont raised $6.3 million from Jan. 9 through March 12, compared to Patronis, who raised $1.1 million.

Kurtis Gregory shakes hands following his introduction to the Missouri Senate (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).The Missouri Farm Bureau would be allowed to sell health benefits plans that exclude people with pre-existing medical conditions and limit benefits to less than what’s permitted by federal law for health insurers, under legislation that passed the state Senate Thursday.
Sponsored by Republican state Sen. Kurtis Gregory of Marshall, the bill would give the farm bureau a carveout to skirt the consumer protection requirements set by the Affordable Care Act, in an effort to provide affordable coverage options to members.
The bill was passed by the Senate by a vote of 24 to 6 on Thursday.
“This is not something where this organization is asking for government dollars to put this program into effect,” Gregory said during debate Tuesday. “They want to put this on themselves. They want to help cover their members’ lives.”
The Farm Bureau is a nonprofit agricultural membership organization which partners with for-profit companies to sell various kinds of insurance to its members. Anyone can join — the fee is $30 per year. Historically the group has been primarily made up of people in farming communities.
Missouri Democrats and patient advocates have staunchly opposed the proposal, raising concerns that consumers could be left with inadequate coverage and without proper protections. 
“These insurance companies are for-profit companies,” state Sen. Tracy McCreery of Olivette said during Tuesday’s debate. “And I think that there needs to be some basic guardrails to make sure that there’s some parameters that are consistent amongst providers.”
Ten other states have passed similar laws. This is the third year the proposal has been pursued in Missouri. 
The bill characterizes the plans the Farm Bureau would offer as a “health benefit plan” or “contracts for health care benefits” rather than “insurance,” to skirt state and federal regulations on insurance.
Democrats won some concessions, including requiring a written disclaimer in contracts that states the contract “is not health insurance and is not subject to federal or state laws relating to health insurance.”
The disclaimer also states that the contract offers fewer benefits than a federally-compliant plan and may exclude coverage for preexisting conditions. It adds that the individual may qualify for federal insurance subsidies. Under the latest version of the bill, the state’s Department of Commerce and Insurance must receive and review complaints from Farm Bureau members.
After hours of negotiation earlier this week, Senate Democrats finally allowed the bill to move forward, with several of their health-related priorities added as amendments as well.
Those additions include provisions that require Missouri Medicaid to cover hearing aids, which is also a freestanding bill passed by the House, expand access to treatment for sexually transmitted infections, and require insurance companies that provide birth control to provide extended supplies.
The bill now heads to the Missouri House, which has passed its own versions of the bill in recent years.

Gregory has estimated around 15,000 Farm Bureau members lack health insurance and would be the target audience to enroll in the benefit plan.
Many farmers and other members of the Farm Bureau, proponents say, are uninsured because they can’t afford to buy an individual plan on the Affordable Care Act marketplace or make too much money to qualify for subsidies.
Republican state Sen. Sandy Crawford of Buffalo, who sponsored the legislation in previous years, said she’s heard from farmer constituents who can’t afford health insurance for several years in support of the bill.
“It’s hard for them to get coverage, and health insurance costs are through the roof,” Crawford said Tuesday. 
“And I think anything that we can do to help…anytime we can give them one more tool for their tool box to at least help them get covered, I think that it’s a good thing,” she said.
Several farmers and agricultural organizations testified in support of the legislation at the public hearing in January.
Missouri Farm Bureau lobbyist Emily LeRoy called the bill “simply another option to provide coverage for more people.”
The Farm Bureau would offer lower prices by reverting to the pre-ACA practice of what’s called medical underwriting, carefully evaluating applicants’ medical history and risk, to determine whether to cover them and at what price. 
Tennessee enacted a version of the law exempting the Farm Bureau from regulation in 1993
Benjamin Sanders, representing the Farm Bureau of Tennessee, said enrollees in states with the program report high levels of satisfaction. The Farm Bureau in other states doesn’t need to abide by data transparency requirements of regulated insurance companies. But the organization says internal numbers show a high retention rate.
“We are not asking for any kind of subsidies or asking to sell subsidized plans. We manage cost on the front end,” he said, referring to the practice of medical underwriting.
Emily Kalmer, a lobbyist for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, raised concern in January that the bill “authorizes the sale of products that could discriminate against Missourians with pre-existing conditions like cancer.”
The bill “would leave Missourians, including cancer patients, exposed to medical and financial harms,” Kalmer said.
Experts have said it could lead to insurance companies siphoning off healthy people and driving up the cost of coverage for others, while offering limited coverage plans.
Bill would exempt Missouri Farm Bureau health insurance plans from federal rules

Other insurance companies oppose the legislation for allowing just one group to be exempt from federal rules, which they say gives the Farm Bureau an advantage over its regulated competitors.
“I don’t believe it should be the policy of the state to give a market advantage to companies selling unregulated products,”Hampton Williams, general counsel for the Missouri Insurance Coalition, said in January, “over those who are offering existing health insurance products and who are have been lawfully operating within the state statutes and regulations.”
Shannon Cooper, lobbyist for Blue Cross Blue Shield, told lawmakers at a hearing in January that insurance companies would adopt similar policies to the bill en masse if allowed, to save costs, but federal and state regulations forbid that. 
“It is a rare day when the insurance industry sides with the advocate community, but we all have the same concern here,” Cooper said. “And that is: These products sound like insurance, but they don’t follow the same rules that we have to play by. “

The New Hampshire House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly, 342-1, to table House Bill 553, which was co-sponsored by both Democrats and Republicans. By tabling the bill, the House has decided not to advance it, but it can still pick up the bill for reconsideration later.
The bill would have updated the legal definitions of abuse and neglect, and created instructions for officials on dealing with both situations. For example, the bill would have added, “Evidence of serious injury, broken bones, or unexplained injury to any non-ambulatory child, or frequent illnesses that are not being adequately addressed or controlled,” to the list of factors that constitute evidence of child abuse. The bill also sought other changes that would’ve made the language more “trauma informed.”
Rep. Alicia Gregg, the Nashua Democrat who introduced the bill, said the legislation ran into opposition from Republicans who were concerned it would infringe upon parental rights.
“They don’t trust how the updated definitions will be interpreted,” she wrote in a message to the Bulletin. “Unfortunately, there have been some extreme misconceptions on what definitions do (versus) ramifications that you find in subsequent statutes.”
Gregg said she met with Republican leadership Tuesday ahead of the vote and they agreed to table it and work on amendments. If they hadn’t tabled it, she believes it would’ve been voted down entirely.
“We will continue to work on the language to strike a balance that protects children and the due process of parents,” she continued. “It’s important to work cooperatively with stakeholders to ensure the definitions represent best practices and prioritize balancing the need for safety with the importance of keeping families together.”
Among other things, the bill would have designated “exposure of a child to … physical violence, verbal abuse, or psychological maltreatment directed at the child, a sibling, the other parent or significant other, or another person living in the home” as reason to suspect a child is being harmed.
The bill also would have changed the statutory instructions on removing a child from the home from “determine if the preservation of family unity is in the best interest of the child” to “presume that family unity is in the best interest of the child; but, if it is determined to not be in the child’s best interest, to secure placement in the least restrictive setting.” The bill also called for “frequent” reviews of any child removed from the home with the goal of returning that child to the home as quickly as possible.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dometrafficking-1024x640.jpeg,,,2025-03-27 13:08:12.061016

The university did not name the student because “federal privacy laws [that] limit what can be shared about an individual student.” Alex House, a spokesperson for UA, said in the statement that international students are “valued members” of the university, but that UA will continue to cooperate with immigration officials. 
House did not respond to questions about whether the university is assisting the student or the family with legal assistance.
“UA has and will continue to follow all immigration laws and cooperate with federal authorities,” House said in a media statement.
The student’s identity was not shared by the university, but Crimson White, the university’s student-run newspaper, reported Wednesday evening that Alireza Doroudi was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) early Tuesday morning.
According to ICE detainee locator as of Thursday morning, Doroudi is “in ICE custody,” but it does not list the current detention facility. House also did not respond to whether UA is trying to locate the student but a person at the Pickens County Jail confirmed late Thursday morning that he was being held at the facility and should be transported to an ICE facility in the next couple of days, though they declined to provide their identity. 
International students across the country have been detained by ICE in recent weeks. Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia student, was detained by immigration officials in early March for his role in negotiations with the university over protests due to the war in Gaza. Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student, was taken Tuesday night by immigration officials who had their faces covered. One resident who witnessed Ozturk said it looked like a “kidnapping.” Barnard College student Yunseo Chung was also detained after she participated in the protests against the war. Chung has sued to prevent deportation.
According to the Alabama Commission on Higher Education, 1,207 international students enrolled Alabama universities and colleges in Fall 2024.

(File art/Getty Images)A bill that would make it much easier for individuals wrongfully incarcerated to receive compensation has cleared the Florida Senate, and needs just one final vote in the House before going to Gov. Ron DeSantis’ desk.
The measure sponsored by Northeast Florida Republican Sen. Jennifer Bradley (SB 130) makes changes to a 2008 state law that was designed to provide financial compensation for individuals wrongfully convicted of a crimes.
That legislation called for eligible exonerees to receive $50,000 for each year they were wrongfully incarcerated, capped at $2 million. However, since its passage, only five exonerees have actually received such compensation, due to a “clean hands” provision that bans people who have had earlier, unrelated felonies from filing compensation claims — the only such restriction of its type in the country.
Bradley’s bill would remove the clean-hands provision. It also would extend the filing deadline for those who have been exonerated from 90 days to two years, and allow a wrongfully incarcerated person both to bring a civil lawsuit and file for compensation under the 2008 law.
However, a claimant would have to repay the state if he or she receives monetary awards both under the 2008 law and through a civil lawsuit.
Eighteen exonerees have been denied compensation because of the clean-hands provision — “totally, 300 plus years of lost liberty,” Bradley told her colleagues on Thursday.
Since 1989, 90 people in Florida have been exonerated or released from incarceration as a result of post-conviction DNA testing, according to the National Registry of Exonerations.
“Each of us has an incredible honor to represent our constituents, and part of that privilege of being able to come up here and represent our constituents is the duty that comes with that to be able to right wrongs,” Bradley said. “To be able to stand up for the people of the state of Florida who have been wronged, and this is that bill.”
Bradley thanked to two former state senators who worked on the bill nearly a decade ago — GOP Sen. Rob Bradley, her husband, and Tampa Democrat Arthenia Joyner.
“Sometimes the wheels of justice roll slowly, but nevertheless they arrive at a destination of justice,” said Tampa Bay area Democratic Sen. Darryl Rouson. “This bill speaks of that to those 18 who have been denied.”
The measure’s companion in the House (HB 59), filed by Tampa Bay Republican Traci Koster, passed unanimously in its third and final committee stop on Wednesday and will soon go to the full House for a vote.

Researchers Sarah Winchell Lenhoff and Jeremy Singer have been studying chronic absenteeism in Detroit for years, talking to scores of parents, students, educators, and school administrators along the way, and keeping track of many school efforts to reduce absenteeism.
One thing they’ve learned during that time is that no matter how much passion schools put into solving the chronic absenteeism problem, they may be fighting a losing battle. That’s because while chronic absenteeism “is a problem for schools,” it’s not a problem that can be solved by schools.
Their new book, “Rethinking Chronic Absenteeism: Why Schools Can’t Solve it Alone,” which was released Tuesday by Harvard Education Press, explains why and provides a road map for what they describe as an “ecological” instead of an “educational” approach to addressing chronic absenteeism.
Why? Because poverty weighs heavily into the reasons students miss school, particularly in communities like Detroit where the overwhelming majority of students come from low-income homes.
Chronic absenteeism has been a problem in Detroit for years and is also affecting school districts across Michigan. Statewide, nearly 30% of students were considered chronically absent, meaning they missed 10 or more days of school, during the 2023-24 school year, according to state data. In the Detroit Public Schools Community District, the rate was nearly 66%. Many charter schools in the city also have high rates of chronic absenteeism.
The pandemic fueled a surge in chronic absenteeism, though rates have since decreased.
The book has a number of recommendations for policymakers, school and district leaders, and community-based organizations and coalitions.
“I hope that folks outside of education pick up the book and think yes, there’s a role for me in health, or for me in housing, for me in transportation, or for me as a lawmaker,” said Singer, an assistant professor of educational leadership and policy studies at Wayne State University.
For policymakers, who have the power to legislate change, the authors recommend they substantially increasing efforts to reduce poverty, eliminate punishments for schools and students for chronic absenteeism, invest in systems to ensure students have the resources they need, and reduce the emphasis on chronic absenteeism within school accountability systems.
Lenhoff said she hopes the book will shatter stereotypes people may have that children who are chronically absent aren’t motivated to attend school and that their parents don’t care.
“Detroit parents want their kids in school,” said Lenhoff, the Leonard Kaplan Endowed Professor and an associate professor of educational leadership and policy studies at Wayne State. “Many parents, even parents who have kids with really good attendance, are going to extremely great lengths to get their children to school, coordinating all kinds of different resources and backup transportation.”
Lenhoff and Singer lead the Detroit Partnership for Education Equity & Research, or Detroit PEER, with Lenhoff as its director and Singer as its associate director.
Chalkbeat talked with Lenhoff and Singer in a wide-ranging interview about chronic absenteeism.
The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Stay tuned for more later this week.
Your book makes the argument that an ecological approach to chronic absenteeism is needed. Why is there such a need to rethink the way communities approach this problem?
Lenhoff: That’s a big reason why we wrote this book was feeling a real need to have an intervention on the current discourse around chronic absenteeism and attendance in schools. In Michigan, and the majority of states around the country, chronic absence is counted against schools when they have many students who are missing lots of school. We have observed how that has seeped into the everyday practices of schools, such that lots of people are thinking about chronic absence, lots of people are trying to do something about it. They’re spending a lot of time on things that may not have a lot of benefit for students, may not be able to improve attendance, which means that they’re not spending time on other things that might be more within their scope of influence.
The second big thing is we really wanted to expand the table of people and institutions who are thinking about student attendance as part of their scope of work. Primarily schools are like the only institutions where we look to solve this issue. Lots of other institutions are maybe even in a better position to solve some of the root causes that are keeping kids from school … things like housing instability, things like transportation inequity, health inequity, you know, a lot of these things are really far outside what schools can do, and so looking to other institutions to see what they can do to improve conditions for student attendance seems like a really important move.
What will it take for school districts, Detroit in particular, or communities, to pull off what you’re recommending?
Lenhoff: It’s all the more difficult in the current political climate where schools are likely to have less funding, not more. There’s going to be a deemphasis on things like social welfare programs and affordable housing, and equitable transportation. Things we think can make a difference are in this current federal political climate going to be really challenging to pull off. What I would say now is that working closely with the nonprofit community, with the kind of local government agencies that you already have connections with that are maybe already trying to do things around youth programming or supportive work with families, and just trying to connect the dots with attendance. A lot of groups are already thinking about kids. They’re thinking about families with kids — how to better support them, how to increase employment opportunities, increase extracurricular engagement. All these things, we think could have a positive effect on attendance, and they might require a little bit of coordination on the school side.
Singer: If there are policymakers who are thinking, ‘What could we do now, knowing that we have an important role to play,’ it could make sense to even just try small block grants or pilot programs that can help schools try some creative things in partnership with community organizations or other state agencies. The same goes for philanthropy. Foundations might be able to play a role in just helping to pilot something that might be otherwise unattainable financially, like giving rideshare credits or experimenting with some new form of … transportation, or some kind of new health intervention or providing health services. If there’s a way to try them at a smaller scale and start to identify promising models that we could then expand to other places that would be a great opportunity.
There’s no lack of advocacy around tackling these issues in Detroit. But what role should or can the City of Detroit mayor’s office play, and how pivotal that involvement would be?
Singer: We have a mayoral race coming up, and I’d love to see the next mayor of Detroit both acknowledge this as an issue but acknowledge the roots of this issue in the right way. We’ve heard Detroit Superintendent [Nikolai] Vitti speak to this issue in terms of identifying the root causes of poverty and inequality and the long history of that. Public figures can play a really great role in helping to set the tone for how we think about these problems. And so hearing the mayor speak to the fact that the city and departments within the city need to play a role in the solution — because the problem lies in things like transportation challenges, health problems, financial strain on families, housing issues —would be a really great place to start.
Lenhoff: it’s likely to be a priority for any new administration focused on economic and neighborhood development, right, and trying to increase the population of Detroit, or at least stabilize it, those conversations by and large, you know, to the extent that I’m aware of them, largely don’t have have much to do about schools. Schools are not often at the table in those conversations about which neighborhoods we’re going to invest in, where we’re going to cite affordable housing, where we’re going to invest in new commercial activity. if you’re trying to make a walkable neighborhood, a school should be part of that calculus, that you should be able to walk to a local public school, and because it’s an important resource. The affordable housing piece is essential. You know, investing in affordable housing that is big enough for families and that’s near schools, right? I’ve heard folks talk about building affordable housing for families, and they’re like, one-bedroom units. What does a family actually need to live in a home over the long term and stay there?
Sarah, you mentioned that you know that there are some things that that schools have done that aren’t necessarily beneficial? What are some of those methods?
Lenhoff: Some of the big ones have to do with the punitive approaches to student attendance. We’ve seen some move to deficit thinking about family … leads to this dynamic where the school is maybe not trying to build a trusting relationship with a family so that they can (learn) what barriers they face. The book shows that it’s really time consuming to build strong relationships with families. But that can be the root of figuring out what’s going on and solving those issues. Instead, schools are spending a lot of time on things that maybe take less time, and maybe are less costly, but maybe don’t have the weight of building those strong relationships. One example is we see a lot of short-term, incentive-based approaches. Schools love incentives. They love, you know, they love to celebrate the kids, and they should. But there’s very little evidence that those sorts of things actually improve attendance.
What do you say to those who feel very strongly that there needs to be some kind of punitive consequence for chronic absenteeism?
Lenhoff: It’s ultimately a reflection of schools and districts getting to the end of their rope and feeling like they’re not able to fully solve this issue alone. But these are counterintuitive ways of solving the problem, because they erode the very things that are at the core of good attendance. So punitive approaches like court prosecution can erode school family relationships and weaken families, parents and students, ties to the district, that sense of belonging or engagement. You know, taking away social services is getting rid of resources that are crucial to actually enabling regular participation in school if a family has financial issues or some, some host of problems relating to those that cause them to miss school.

(Stock photo by Thianchai Sitthikongsak via Getty Images)It is no secret that South Carolina has become a magnet for business, industry, and people.
Since 2007, our population has grown by over one million, and the U-Hauls keep coming.
The in-migration boom includes manufacturing and high-tech industries as well. This generational change has ramped up electricity demand, stressed the grid, and led to urgent public policy conversations about how to meet our future energy challenges.
With apologies to Robert Frost, when it comes to our electricity market, two paths diverge in the Palmetto State wood. Will we choose “more of the same” or reform?
The most predictable incarnation of the “more of the same” path would be for the General Assembly to simply survey the monopoly utilities, ask them what they want, and enact that.
The result would be more generation and transmission capacity, but no change to the system.
But our goals should not be just to keep the lights on — it should be about saving consumers money and fostering economic growth through modernization.
Because the Southeast is a place where each utility has a defined territory and no wholesale or retail competition to speak of exists, to take the road most traveled would be easy, but unfortunate.
So, what opportunities present themselves on the reform path?
There are many, but in this space, we offer just two options. Each option is anchored in a fresh comprehensive study of the potential impacts.
First, there is the establishment of an Energy Imbalance Market, or an EIM. The key study here is known as The Brattle Report (2023), prepared for the General Assembly’s Market Reform Study Committee.
An Energy Imbalance Market can be defined as a real-time market that actively manages and corrects discrepancies between the planned energy supply and actual demand.
Put simply, the current market is about scheduled, planned electricity distribution, while an Energy Imbalance Market is a real-time correction mechanism that optimizes last-minute supply-demand mismatches.
It enables energy providers to buy and sell electricity in five-minute settlement intervals, ensuring that energy supply matches demand as closely as possible at any given moment.
According to Brattle, creating a regional or state wholesale energy market could save ratepayers up to $300 million annually by increasing efficiency, reducing operational costs, and improving energy distribution.
Currently, two-thirds of the U.S. benefits from these competitive energy markets, but the Southeast is one of the last regions in the country without a regional wholesale energy market.
By taking the lead in energy reform, South Carolina has the opportunity to set the standard for the region — delivering cost savings to residents, attracting new businesses, and ensuring a stable energy future.
Secondly, the Palmetto State could allow limited retail competition. The key study here was conducted by Daymark (2024).
On July 1, 1969, on the basis of the Territorial Assignment Act, the South Carolina Public Service Commission assigned territories to each utility.
Choice of power provider was very limited. A customer located “within 300 feet of certain lines of an electric supplier and partially within a service area assigned to another electric supplier” could choose.
A football field’s worth of choice is not much choice. We have been governed by this statute’s framework ever since.
In 1973, Georgia passed its Territorial Electric Service Act.
It was more market driven. A large load exception allows a customer with a load of 900 kilowatts or greater to select its electric supplier on a one-time basis. (A 900-kW load would be approximately that needed by a Kroger, Publix, Home Depot, Lowe’s or Target shopping center.)
Power systems in Georgia compete for large customers all over the state. For example, a small Electric Membership Corporation (a co-op) in South Georgia may bid to provide service to a new industrial or commercial facility being built in North Georgia.
The rivalry for new customers is intense, with the competing utilities offering potential customers lower rates and other amenities.
The Georgia model, a “willing buy through,” while not perfect, provides another option for implementing a competitive system in South Carolina.
It has been said that “there is no heavier burden than a great opportunity.”
The energy debate we are in is a burden, but an Energy Imbalance Market and a large-load limited retail choice system are opportunities.
Each is worthy of consideration in the crafting of broad energy reform for South Carolina.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/transmission-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Photo: Jennifer Solis/Nevada Current)Donald Trump has declared he, and not Nevada, will be in charge of elections in the state.
So is Nevada Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo happy now?
Lombardo won’t say.
Asked about Trump’s executive order, by which states will lose federal funding for elections unless they require all voters to prove their citizenship, Lombardo once again found himself struggling to sound sensible without sparking a Trump hissy fit.
Lombardo “supports President Trump’s efforts to make our elections more secure, timely, and efficient, and he hopes both Congress and the Nevada State Legislature will take similar steps to secure our elections,” reads the statement from his office.
Yes, but that’s not really the question.
The question is whether Lombardo supports the specific details in Trump’s EO — Nevadans must prove citizenship to vote, and DOGE must be allowed to rummage around in Nevada voter registration files, or Nevada loses federal funding for elections.
Asked to clarify, Lombardo’s office didn’t respond. 
Oh, and yes, you read that right. DOGE.
Part of Trump’s order decrees that states must allow Elon Musk to stick his snout into states’ voter registration information. No doubt part of Musk’s mission in his new capacity as elections expert will be to do what Musk does best: tweet wild allegations that sound way too shocking to be true because they’re not.
But more importantly, Musk, according to Trump’s order, will be nosing around “in coordination with” the Department of Homeland Security, the end goal presumably being blanket disenfranchisements of people who might not vote Republican.
Since becoming governor, Lombardo has demonstrated an avid eagerness to complain about the federal government imposing heavy-handed policy on Nevada.
By one widely cited estimate, requiring proof of citizenship could disenfranchise more than 20 million people in the U.S. — nearly one out of ten voters. 
That’s some heavy-handed federal intrusion, no, governor?
Meanwhile, noncitizens voting — the act ostensibly motivating Trump’s order — is astonishingly rare. No instances of it have been proven in Nevada in recent times. But for the sake of argument let’s assume it is happening, and its frequency in Nevada mirrors that found in national studies. The six Nevadans who were indicted for being fake presidential electors in 2020 would still far outnumber noncitizens voting in Nevada.
Like Trump’s unsuccessful and bogus suit against Nevada over noncitizen voting last year, his election edict this week has nothing to do with noncitizens voting, and everything to do with rendering democracy irrelevant.
Signpost on the road to competitive authoritarianism
Nevada Democratic Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar, whose office administers elections in Nevada, called Trump’s order a “federal overreach.” 
Overreach?
Understatement.
The SOS office is “working with counsel to research our options and will determine how to proceed with the interest of Nevada’s voters and their civil rights in mind,” Aguilar said.
Nevada Democratic Attorney General Aaron Ford, who just the other day was energetically telling everyone how proud he’s been to sue Trump early and often, likewise sounded a note of overly generous caution. Asked about Trump’s order, Ford’s office replied, “We are examining the executive order and evaluating potential legal options.” (Don’t be surprised if by the time you read this the cadre of Democratic state AGs with which Ford rides have sued over the EO.)
At least state Democratic Assembly Majority Leader Steve Yeager was a bit more animated, describing Trump’s threat to deprive Nevada of federal funds as “blackmail.”
Close, although extortion sounds more accurate.
“The Legislature,” Yeager continued, “will not consider any of the demands” Trump made in his order, “because Nevada’s elections are the responsibility of Nevadans, their representatives, and their hard-working election workers. I urge Governor Lombardo to affirm that Nevada’s elections won’t be held hostage to Donald Trump’s threats.” 
That’s not happening. Lombardo, like nearly every remaining elected Republican in the U.S., already suffers from Stockholm syndrome, brought on by Trump’s aforementioned hissy fits.
If it is up to the Legislature to accede to Trump’s blatant attempt to disenfranchise voters, Yeager’s right, and Democrats in control of both chambers won’t be going along.
But is it up to them? 
The offices of both the governor and the SOS were asked who will determine whether Nevada complies with Trump’s order. Neither provided an answer.
Meanwhile, as threats go, Trump vowing to hold back federal financing for elections isn’t what you’d call existential. In his statement Wednesday, Aguilar noted federal funding in support of local elections is notoriously skimpy. 
With the exception of uniquely generous, and temporary, federal funding for elections during the pandemic, Aguilar’s right. The budget for the main program providing federal funds to state and local governments for elections was $55 million nationally in 2024. In Clark County alone, the budget for the fiscal year that included the 2024 election was nearly half that, at more than $26 million.
Trump’s election order is a signpost on the road to competitive authoritarianism, a system in which there will still be “elections” — the appearance of candidates competing for voter approval — even though the rules are hard-wired to favor one side. Think of, as Trump would say, Russia Russia Russia.
The U.S. is a backsliding democracy. Whether the descent into a venal autocracy with a creepy klepto-tech flavor spike — but with “elections” — can be halted remains to be seen.
But if it is halted, and if democracy, the rule of law, and all the other nice things Trump and Musk are out to destroy are saved, it will be the result of countless little things. Like Nevada refusing to let itself be bullied by a thug running an extortion racket, and instead telling Trump to take his executive order, and the federal money too if it comes to that,  and shove it.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DSC04996-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-27 13:08:12.061016

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa House approved a bill Wednesday that would stop pipelines carrying liquified carbon dioxide from using eminent domain.
Six other bills related to carbon sequestration pipelines, eminent domain and the Iowa Utilities Commission were combined into one bill, which also advanced.
The bills were directed at an ongoing fight between landowners and the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline, which would stretch more than 1,000 miles in Iowa connecting to biofuel refineries and transporting the sequestered carbon dioxide to underground storage in North Dakota.
House File 943 is similar to a law recently passed in South Dakota, another state crossed by the pipeline’s proposed route.
Summit recently asked South Dakota regulators to pause proceedings on its pipeline permit due to the new law.
South Dakota governor signs eminent domain ban on carbon pipelines

The Iowa bill would take effect in May and apply to any eminent domain filings made on or after that date.
Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, R-Wilton, said businesses should “expect the unexpected” if they plan to use eminent domain in Iowa.
“Expect that we’re going to make changes when eminent domain is involved, and expect that we’re going to make changes in favor of landowners,” Kaufmann said.
Pipeline opponents advocated for the bill March 18 during a rally at the Capitol and again on Monday at a press conference with a group of Republican lawmakers opposed to the pipeline project.
The bill passed 82-12.
Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw said in a press release the decision by the House was “hardly surprising, but it is still disappointing.”
“IRFA members have been saying for three years that (carbon capture and sequestration) is the most important tool available to grow ethanol demand into new markets both here at home and around the world,” Shaw said in the statement.
Shaw said he believes “cooler heads will prevail in the Senate” and said the opposition to the project has been led by a “small, though loud, minority.”
“IRFA calls on the Iowa Senate to stand with the majority of impacted landowners, farmers, ethanol producers, and Iowa’s economic future to ensure the state has the tools it needs to meet the brewing economic disaster in the heartland,” Shaw said.
‘No eminent domain for private gain bill’ 
House File 639 would increase the insurance requirements for liquid hazardous pipeline operators.
The five amendments to the bill would also update the definition of a common carrier, require IUC commissioners to be present at all hearings, expand who is allowed to intervene in an IUC docket, limit the pipeline permits to one term not longer than 25 years and stop the IUC from imposing sanctions on intervenors.
These were all bills that had already advanced from House committees, but Rep. Steven Holt combined into HF 639.
Holt, R-Denison, said with all of the amendments, the bill should be called the “no eminent domain for private gain” bill.
The bill passed 85-10.
A spokesperson for Summit said the company has signed easements with more than 1,320 Iowa landowners and has “adjusted the route based on feedback from stakeholders and regulatory agencies.”
“Regulatory certainty is crucial for maintaining Iowa’s competitive edge in business, fostering long-term opportunities for farmers, ethanol producers, and rural communities,” the spokesperson said in a statement.
Concern about Senate opposition
Some representatives voiced concern because of historic opposition in the Senate.
Rep. Brian Meyer spoke in support of the bills but said he wondered if lawmakers were “wasting our time here today.”
“We’ve done this now several years in a row, and the Senate has not acted,” Meyer, D-Des Moines, said. “As far as I can tell, they have not even tried to negotiate … Do something. Do something about this important issue.”
Rep. Charley Thomson, R-Charles City, said he appreciated the concerns about the Senate on the issue and said he believes the House will “do the right thing without regard for what others may do.”
Holt said the issue is not partisan and that in both the House and the Senate, the two parties disagree with one another on the issue. He disagreed with a claim that he and other lawmakers fighting for the issue are doing so performatively.
“We’re doing it because it’s the right thing to do,” Holt said. “And regardless of whether the Senate is going to pass it or not, we’re going to fight for it here because it’s the right thing to do.”

Project critics are concerned it would increase groundwater pollution with animal waste and add to persistent odor and dust challenges. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)LARNED — John Blackwell left his farmhouse on a dusty, rural road in an area of Pawnee County with more cattle than people to speak his mind at the public hearing hosted by state regulators evaluating a controversial water permit application for a proposed 88,000-head feed yard.
Blackwell, joined by 225 people at Larned Community Center, offered a rebuttal to a battery of complaints shared during the Kansas Department of Health and Environment hearing about ghastly stench, clouds of dust, endless truck traffic and groundwater pollution often attributed to concentrated animal operations.
He recommended approval of the business expansion plan submitted by Innovative Livestock Services, one of the state’s leading cattle feeding and farming enterprises. The plan was developed by an environmental services arm of the Kansas Livestock Association.
Skeptics of the ILS project — given the estimated 60 or 70 new jobs it would create — ought to consider the package in context of Larned’s future as a viable place to live, he said.
“We need people. People bring business to this town, and Larned is dying,” Blackwell said. “I think it’s a good deal. We’ve got to do this if we want our community to survive and grow. If you take away the feedlots in this town, and the state hospital, Larned would be a ghost town.”
Kansas feedlots with at least 1,000 head held 2.3 million cattle on feed in January, which suggested expanding capacity by 88,000 would be noteworthy.
Felix Ravelle, an outspoken Larned critic of the project, told KDHE it was fantasy to believe ILS would keep animal sewage contained in artificial ponds and applied without incident on hundreds of acres of fields surrounding a feedlot generating millions of gallons of waste daily. He said it was a certainty the manure and urine cocktail from a new ILS complex south of Larned would contribute to pollution of the aquifer just as two smaller ILS feed yards closer to Larned had done.
“KDHE’s attempts to stop pollution from existing feedlots over the past quarter century have failed,” Ravelle said. “We’re in the same sensitive groundwater, highly porous soils and shallow aquifer. Now, there’s going to be a platform for an even larger and more dangerous feedlot.”
Ravelle said the 6,000 residents of Pawnee County shouldn’t resign themselves to more air and water pollution.
“Rural Kansans’ rights to healthy lives and enjoyment of their homes are being sacrificed to produce enormous wealth for distant owners. These poisonous industrialized operations would not be profitable without destroying the environment of rural Kansas. Our urban counterparts would not tolerate or even expect such environmental justice,” he said.
The conflict between Blackwell and Ravelle illustrated the challenge of balancing history with the future of CAFOs in Kansas.
The community meeting Tuesday night in Larned marked conclusion of the public comment period in a process that began with the November 2024 submission of an application from ILS Feeders. KDHE said the water pollution permit for a 640-acre ILS feedlot approximately 10 miles from Larned received preliminary approval.
KDHE staff will compile a summary of questions, complaints and suggestions regarding the project before submitting a final permit to KDHE Secretary Janet Stanek. It could take more than a month for KDHE to render a decision.

Sign of the times
Jon Skelton, chief financial officer of ILS headquartered in Great Bend, addressed the community center crowd before KDHE opened up the meeting for a question-and-answer session and the formal public comment segment. He counted himself among 116 shareholders of the company, which included 78 Kansans and 40 residents of the Pawnee, Barton and Stafford tri-county region. He said 48 co-owners were employees of ILS.
Skelton sought to dispel public apprehension that was evident as regulatory examination of the feed-yard project unfolded. He suggested ILS was inaccurately derided as an economic bully.
“One thing I keep hearing in the comments is ‘Big Ag,'” he said. “I know everything is a matter of perspective, but we don’t see ourselves as Big Ag. When I think Big Ag, I think Cargill. I think Tyson. I think of global, publicly traded, billions and billions of dollars. That’s not us.”
Skelton addressed anxiety the 88,000-head beef operation would place a greater burden on an aquifer system in crisis. In Pawnee County, he said, the transition from irrigation to stock usage of water required a 12.5% reduction in a user’s allocation.
In terms of waste management, Skelton said ISL collaborated with engineers to meet KDHE’s construction and operating requirements.
“The fact that we’re here tonight, ending the public comment period, means that we have met the requirements that they set for us,” he said.
Richard Josefiak, a Rosedale area farmer with land near ILS facilities, said he was compelled by the wave of negative reaction to the project to endorse both ILS and Skelton.
“ILS is a tremendous steward of the ground,” Josefiak said. “I feel very, very confident that if this new feed yard goes in that all the safeguards will be put into use. I realize I’m maybe at the minority tonight, but I am a farmer. I am a rancher. I would hate to think that if I wanted to do something that a lot of townspeople would be against it.”
  Larned resident Merrill Cauble, pointing at the map, said the Kansas Department of Health and Environment should reject an application from Innovative Livestock Solutions to build a feedlot south of town. He doesn’t believe touted job benefits outweigh air and water pollution likely to result from the 88,000-head facility. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)
 
Nitrate concentration
A few blocks from the community center, at the intersection of Broadway and Sixth streets, a temporary middle-of-the-street sign announced the KDHE hearing on the water permit sought by ILS. It was bracketed on four corners by the Masonic Temple building, ACE Hardware, Heart of Kansas Family Health Care and the Farmers Bank and Trust — and summarized without words a sentiment about the feed yard project.
The sign included a coiled piece of dung adorned with a stylized Ghostbusters red slash. It represented the view of Merrill Cauble, who grew up on a farm about 1 mile from the proposed feed yard and had worked as his father did in the cattle industry.
In an interview and during the meeting, Cauble said he wanted KDHE to reject the ILS permit application. He sounded an alarm about high concentrations of nitrate — measured as nitrogen — in groundwater samples from two ILS feedlots near Larned. The region is known for its fine sandy loam soil with a high potential for leaching into the aquifer cattle waste stored in runoff lagoons and disposed of on nearby crop fields.
He said KDHE testing of well water for nitrates showed one ILS feedlot ranged from a low of 14 parts per million to a high of 51 ppm, while the other feedlot ranged from 33 ppm to 51 ppm. East of those feedlots on the downslope the readings were above 20 ppm, but upslope to the west the readings were 0.06 ppm to 12.8 ppm.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says the maximum contaminant level for nitrate in drinking water was 10 ppm. High levels in drinking water could prove dangerous, especially to infants, because it might interfere with the blood’s ability to carry oxygen.
“The nitrate levels at the two existing yards are out of control. South of Larned is already a dumping ground for the animal waste from the other two yards,” Cauble said. “It’s unbelievable the nitrate levels that’s underneath. The biggest problem is the sandy soils from Larned south. Everything goes right through. It’s not built for feedlots.”
He said the pair of existing ILS feed yards produced an estimated 3.8 million pounds of manure and urine daily. The proposed facility could generate an additional 5.7 million pounds of animal waste per day, he said.
Cauble said the groundwater management plan submitted by ILS wasn’t “worth the paper it’s written on.” Problems at the current ILS facilities should be addressed before the state government gave the company opportunities to repeat environmental mistakes at a new ILS facility, he said.
“Does this concern the Kansas Department of Health and Environment?” Cauble said.

‘KDHE is concerned’
Erich Glave, an engineer with KDHE who answered questions from attendees at the forum, said high nitrate readings in water were a concern to the state agency. He said research was being conducted to better determine whether the source of nitrate was commercial fertilizers or animal material from feedlots.
“KDHE is concerned about rising nitrates in groundwater,” Glave said. “This new yard will be more protective under our new design standards.”
One participant in the forum asked KDHE why ILS chose Larned rather than Overland Park, Manhattan or some other urban center.
“Western Kansas is home to many feedlots,” said Glave, who pointed to the region’s lower humidity and summer breezes as attraction points. “The availability of grain. The availability of space. Those are all issues that go into how you would decide to site a feedlot.”
In response to a question, KDHE said the draft water permit for the ILS complex didn’t include additional groundwater monitoring. However, KDHE has had conversations with ISL about putting a testing requirement for groundwater, including upgradient and downgradient wells, in the final water permit.
C.T. Taylor, who lives on nine acres south of Larned, said there was a feedlot north of his property and the new ILS facility would be to the south. That would put his property in a “big clamp,” he said.
He expressed concern about the future health of his 9-year-old son, but Taylor also said water contamination had become personally challenging since he received a heart transplant Dec. 5, 2024.
“Currently, I cannot shower in my own house because of the water problem,” he said. “I cannot drink my water. I cannot wash dishes without bringing bottled water home.”
The owner of land 2 miles from the proposed confined feeding operation — echoing Taylor’s angst — asked whether KDHE could guarantee his groundwater would be drinkable in 15 years.
“I’d like to be up here to give you a few guarantees,” said Casey Guccione, chief of KDHE’s livestock waste management division. “But, frankly, that’s not necessarily what we’re here to do.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Jon-Skelton-ILS-cfo-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Getty Images)Amid a yearslong debate over how to make sure ambulance patients aren’t surprised with massive bills even when they have health insurance, the New Hampshire House of Representatives approved a bill aimed at solving the issue.
The House voted, 250-85, to approve House Bill 316, which seeks to end balance billing — the practice of patients being charged the difference between what an ambulance ride costs and what their insurance company agrees to cover — and establish a mandatory rate at which insurers must pay ambulance providers. If enacted, the bill will direct the state Insurance Department to establish a rate every two years based on the work of an independent actuarial and accounting expert, and ambulance providers would be bound to that rate. It would also prohibit the insurer covering the ambulance ride from passing any of the cost onto patients outside what their policy specifies.
The bill had the support of Insurance Commissioner D.J. Bettencourt who, in January, said it was “fundamentally unfair to stick the consumers in the middle of this dispute and give them a bill that they don’t understand, that they didn’t know was coming and for many of them, they can’t afford.” He called the bill “not perfect,” but “the most viable solution to a very, very difficult problem.”
Earlier this year, the Insurance Department and Public Consulting Group LLC released a report on what the initial rate would be. It recommends a base rate of 202% of the federal Medicare rate for an ambulance or 209% of the Medicare rate per mile the ambulance travels. After two years, the state would update that rate.
Opposition to the bill pointed to that rate as too low. Rep. Jerry Stringham, a Lincoln Democrat, argued the bill “would be devastating to our ambulance providers.” He said there was a “key flaw” in how the department and its consulting firm derived that number. He argued it shouldn’t have factored in the property tax funds ambulance providers receive due to differences in how much localities provide their ambulance providers.
In debates over the bill taking place since January, Rindge Republican Rep. John Hunt has argued ambulance services should be viewed as a community service to be paid for by local taxes in the same way fire and police departments are. He reiterated that on the House floor Wednesday.
“I hate to break the news to you everybody, but your town taxes, every one of you, has ambulance service as a line item in their budgets,” Hunt said. “And that ain’t gonna change.”
The bill will have to be approved by the Senate and governor before it can become law.
The bill beat out an alternative proposal introduced by Rep. Mark Proulx, a Manchester Republican. That bill, House Bill 185, would’ve had insurers and ambulance providers negotiate a rate among themselves and required insurers covering ambulance rides to directly reimburse the providers. In the event of a rate dispute, this bill would’ve had the Insurance Department review rates to determine if they are reasonable. The Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee unanimously voted to reject that bill. Then, the full House killed it earlier this month on a voice vote.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ambulance911-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Alaska foster youth are admitted to acute psychiatric facilities an average of 90 times per year, according to the state. Lawmakers want to make sure they don’t have unnecessarily long stays.
The Alaska House of Representatives passed House Bill 36 unanimously on Wednesday. The bill would require foster youth hospitalized in psychiatric facilities to have a court hearing within seven days, a reduction from the current requirement of 30 days.
As the state is the legal guardian for foster youth, requiring the time for a court hearing to be within a week aims to prevent youth from unnecessarily long stays in psychiatric facilities – after reports of foster youth having to stay for weeks and even years. 
“This is closing such a dark chapter,” said Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage, who sponsored the bill, in an interview after the vote. “And there’s just so many kids that we don’t even know about that were held there for too long, with no one coming to get them.” 
Gray said the Legislature is required to take action after an Alaska Supreme Court ruling last year, “that we must do this, that not having any guidance in our statutes for what should happen to foster kids admitted to acute psychiatric facilities was enabling these tragic stories to happen,” Gray said. “Where foster kids, through no fault of their own, were ending up in facilities for long periods of time with no intervention. So it was incumbent upon the Legislature to act.”
The House voted 39 to 0 passing the bill, with Rep. Sarah Vance, R-Homer, absent.
The issue was the focus of a 2024 Alaska Supreme Court ruling in the case of Kwinhagak v. State. The case related to a 14-year-old girl in foster care, who was first hospitalized in Sitka and then placed in a private Anchorage youth psychiatric hospital, North Star Behavioral Health. She went 46 days before the court held a hearing on her hospitalization.  
Her Tribe, the Native Village of Kwinhagak filed a lawsuit against the state, and the Alaska Supreme Court agreed that the 46 days “was far too long to satisfy due process,” according to the ruling. 
The bill would require interested parties to be notified within 24 hours of a child being admitted to acute psychiatric facilities. The state Office of Children’s Services must notify the court, the child’s parents, and any other parties involved in their foster care case, or “child-in-need-of-aid” case. 
Under the bill, the court would require a court-appointed attorney for the child, and a hearing before a judge within a week — with two-way video for the child to access the hearing. At the hearing, the judge would review the need for hospitalization and consider options for placement in a less restrictive environment. It would also require a follow-up every 30 days after the initial hearing. 











This is huge for us, as a state.


– Amanda Metivier, co-founder, Facing Foster Care in Alaska



	Time in acute psychiatric care is for emergencies, for someone in a mental health crisis to stabilize, and should be very short, Gray added. “If a child needs ongoing psychiatric care, in-patient for months, then they need to be in a residential psychiatric facility,” Gray said. “This is a very, very rare occurrence in which a child would be in this type of facility for longer than a month. But if it happens, then yes, at the 30-day mark, it has to be reevaluated.”
The conditions and practices of the Alaska foster care system, including psychiatric hospitalization, have been the focus of high-profile investigative journalism, a class action lawsuit, federal investigation of North Star Behavioral Health System, and a civil rights investigation by the Department of Justice, in recent years.
“This is huge for us, as a state,” said Amanda Metivier in an interview after the vote. She is the co-founder of the advocacy nonprofit Facing Foster Care in Alaska, a social worker, foster parent, and former foster youth herself. She said former foster youth, some with their own experiences of being hospitalized for long stays, were watching Wednesday and cheered the House vote. 
“So a win for them, too,” she said. “To be able to give back to those youth that come next, who don’t have to have those same experiences of being in an acute psych hospital.”
Metivier said the state has a history of overreliance on hospitals and out-of-state facilities for care of foster youth, and work has been done to improve community-based, behavioral health care. But there is also a significant lack of foster home options.
“Today there are youth who are sleeping in hotels for lack of foster homes, with security guards, or who are sleeping in offices for lack of foster homes,” she said. “And so if a young person lands in an acute psych hospital, I think for the caseworker, there’s probably this initial sense of relief, right, in that they’re safe right now, but are easily forgotten.”
Metivier said that OCS caseworkers, courts, tribes, family attorneys, parents and guardians can all be involved already in a foster case, and acting in the interest of the child, and so the seven-day timeline should be appropriate. “It shouldn’t be burdensome for the state, because it offers an opportunity to create this sense of urgency for everyone to start thinking about what happens next,” she said. It can reduce days of hospitalization, which has the effect of “compounding trauma, to be in a facility, you know, for a young person, where they don’t need to be. And it’s more cost effective for the state too,” she said.
She said the state’s estimate of foster youth being hospitalized 90 times each year is high, and a reason to have protocols in place to assess youth for ongoing care, or a supportive foster placement. 
Metivier emphasized that reducing time in psychiatric hospitals can also limit further psychological harms. 
“They’re witnessing physical and chemical restraints, or maybe experiencing those themselves, or put in isolation,” she said. “So there is a lot they see and experience around them that can be to the detriment of their own mental health too, definitely.”
The bill now moves to the Alaska Senate. While the court system notified the Legislature that more frequent hearings would not incur any additional costs, OCS submitted a fiscal note estimating that the cost for the department would be $18,700 annually. 
Gray, who is also a parent and adopted a former foster youth, became emotional talking about the legacy of children left in psychiatric facilities with no intervention. 
“They were the state’s responsibility. They were the Legislature’s responsibility,” he said. “So the fact that we didn’t act on this sooner kills me inside, and there’s no way we can ever make it up to those kids who suffered profound harm. It’s our fault. I’m grateful that nothing like that will happen again, if this bill makes it through both bodies and gets signed by the governor.”

A $75 million Public Safety Trust Fund allocation in the state budget to fund local law enforcement initiatives and community violence prevention programming gained bipartisan support in the Michigan legislature last session, but the bills that would have created the fund itself were left behind in the chaos of the final days of the previous session in 2024.
House Reps. introduce plan to finalize boost to public safety spending

Public safety is a priority of the new Republican majority of the Michigan state House, Hall said during a news conference Wednesday and that safety is ensuring roads and other infrastructure are properly maintained and local communities have the funds to support tailored approaches to safety. When the House returns from its spring break in April, Hall says the Public Safety Trust Fund will be the body’s top priority.
“We can invest more in our local communities by, for the first time in the history of Michigan, investing state dollars in our local communities for public safety,” Hall said.
House Bills 4260 and 4261, introduced earlier this month, would create the fund, dedicating $75 million to local safety efforts, along with additional funds coming from sales tax revenue to support grant programs for community violence prevention resources. The bills have bipartisan sponsorship.
Lawmakers are working with community leaders to ensure the formula for distributing funds works well for communities where the need is greatest, Hall said, noting that legislators have engaged with Detroit’s Mayor Mike Duggan, who was a vocal supporter of the fund last session.
In Detroit, one arena where the city had planned to use the fund is the ShotStoppers program as federal dollars expire after the city reported drops in violent crime up to 83% where programs were implemented. Created through a $10 million investment from the Biden administration’s American Rescue Plan Act, ShotStoppers utilizes performance grants to community organizations to develop and implement violence reduction initiatives.

The case dealt with eminent domain and other related issues. (Dave Bordewyk/South Dakota NewsMedia Association)A carbon dioxide pipeline company has asked courts to pause or dismiss its pending legal fights against landowners and a state regulator in South Dakota after the state’s adoption of a law that prevents the company from using eminent domain.
Eminent domain is a legal process for acquiring access to land for projects that have a public benefit, with compensation for landowners determined by a court. It’s commonly used for projects such as electrical power lines, water pipelines, oil pipelines and highways.
Some South Dakota landowners who oppose the Summit Carbon Solutions project sued to stop the company from surveying their property. They argued that doing so without just compensation was unconstitutional because soil sampling and other invasive practices would occur.
Summit said it had a right to survey the land because it had eminent domain authority. The company sued some landowners as well.
The disputes ultimately reached the South Dakota Supreme Court, which determined Summit had not yet proven it meets the legal qualification for using eminent domain, and sent the cases back to lower courts. Lawsuits in which Summit no longer needed to survey the land in question – because an agreement was reached or the route was changed – were then dismissed, leaving four cases remaining.
Summit filed a motion to dismiss those cases on March 20, two weeks after Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden signed the bill barring carbon pipeline projects from using eminent domain.
Regulator case paused
Meanwhile, a judge has paused Summit’s legal effort to remove an elected state regulator from its pipeline permitting case. Summit alleged the regulator has a conflict of interest. The company cited the eminent domain ban as part of its rationale for seeking a stay in the case.
South Dakota Public Utilities Commissioner Kristie Fiegen’s sister-in-law is part of a trust that owns land on the proposed pipeline route. Fiegen declined to recuse herself from Summit’s permit application, and Summit sued to disqualify her from considering the permit.
Both Summit and the state agreed to indefinitely stay the case, and a judge entered the stay on March 14.
Permit pause sought
Summit has also requested a pause for “review and adjustment” of its permit proceedings with the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission. The commission rejected Summit’s first application in 2023, largely due to the route’s conflicts with local ordinances that mandate minimum distances between pipelines and existing features. Summit later adjusted its route and reapplied.
The eminent domain ban has been hailed as a victory by some landowners who have resisted Iowa-based Summit’s proposed $9 billion project. The pipeline would transport carbon dioxide emissions from dozens of ethanol plants in five states to an underground storage site in North Dakota. It would qualify for billions in federal tax credits incentivizing the sequestration of heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions.
The project has permits in North Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa, although some permits are being challenged in court. Nebraska does not have a permitting process.
Summit has said it is not giving up on the project.
“In South Dakota, recent legislative changes have temporarily slowed our timeline, but they have not altered our vision or our determination,” said Summit CEO Lee Blank in a press release. “We remain confident that our project is moving forward in a way that benefits farmers, ethanol producers, and rural communities.”

In February, longtime Bossier Parish Sheriff Julian Whittington signed an agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement under the federal 287(g) program, which deputizes local law enforcement officials to engage in federal immigration enforcement.
Last week, the Kenner Police Department — which presides over a large Hispanic and foreign-born population — entered into a similar agreement, according to an ICE spreadsheet of law enforcement agencies currently participating in the program. BPSO and Kenner PD are the only two Louisiana agencies that appeared as of Wednesday.
Trump began his second term as president promising an unprecedented clampdown on immigration. As he had done in the early days of his first term in 2017, Trump in January ordered the Department of Homeland Security to ink more immigration enforcement agreements with local agencies.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Trump’s rhetoric was welcomed by powerful allies in Louisiana, where immigration hardliner Gov. Jeff Landry and Republican legislators have worked together on legislation aimed at ramping up local-federal immigration enforcement partnerships in the state.
Supporters of collaborations like 287(g) say they are needed to remove non-citizens with violent criminal histories, although studies show that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than U.S. citizens.
But critics of such partnerships say 287(g) agreements strain the resources of local agencies and leave them open to costly lawsuits.
“These laws are telling them that they have to do these things, even though, if anybody’s gonna be liable, it’s likely to be the sheriffs,” Matt Vogel, supervising attorney for the National Immigration Project, said in a phone interview on Tuesday.
A representative for BPSO did not grant an interview request. And Kenner Police Chief Keith Conley was not available to answer questions by publication time, according to a spokesperson.
The first 287(g) agreement went into effect in 2002, following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. But the framework for the agreements had been in place since the Clinton administration through a section of an immigration law passed in 1996. The provision allows federal agencies like ICE to authorize local law enforcement officers to take specific immigration enforcement actions under the guidance of the agency. Different “models” of the program come with different authorized tasks.
The 287(g) agreements that both the Bossier Parish Sheriff’s Office and Kenner Police Department have entered into are under a part of the program called a “jail enforcement model,” which calls for investigating potential immigration violations among people already in the custody of local jails.
The agreements authorize trained deputies to investigate the immigration statuses of people in custody, place them into immigration proceedings, and issue immigration detainers – requests to hold immigrants, who would otherwise be released from jail — until ICE agents can take them into federal custody.
According to Vogel these detainers have a “questionable legal status.”
“If somebody has been arrested and they’re in jail and the judge throws out the case, they ought to be released,” Vogel said.  “But the immigration detainer asks the jail to hold them anyway. The problem is from a legal perspective that immigration detainer doesn’t have any legal authority to require additional detention.”
Representatives for ICE did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday.
Will more sheriffs and police departments join 287(g)?
The new 287(g) agreements in Louisiana come as the state is pushing for increased action on immigration from local law enforcement agencies. Last year, Landry signed a bill banning local law enforcement policies that discouraged cooperation with federal immigration agencies. Later that year, he signed a law that empowers local and state law enforcement to arrest people on the suspicion of being in the country unlawfully.
“They’re all part of a piece to push the sheriffs, whether they want to or not, to engage in certain kinds of immigration enforcement,” Vogel said.
In February, Attorney General Liz Murrill sought to enforce that law, taking legal action against the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office. Longstanding OPSO policy prevents the agency from investigating immigration violations and detaining immigrants for ICE without a court order, except in certain cases where they are facing charges for a small number of serious violent crimes. The policy was established in a 2013 federal court settlement over a case in which two men said they were illegally held in the city’s jail for months at ICE’s request.
Murrill’s legal challenge seeks to end the consent judgement in that case and contends that OPSO’s current policy violates the new law.
In an emailed statement, OPSO spokesperson Casey McGee declined to comment on the pending litigation, but said that the agency honors ICE holds “when doing so aligns with the legal obligations set forth in [the consent judgement].”
A representative from Murrill’s office did not respond to emailed requests for interviews or comments from Verite News and Gulf States Newsroom.
The Trump administration has now expanded the scope of the 287(g) agreements beyond local jails, allowing law enforcement officers to perform immigration enforcement duties on the streets. ICE recently revived a type of 287(g) partnership, called the “task force model” that authorizes trained local law enforcement officers to interrogate people they encounter during their normal duties about their immigration statuses and conduct arrests for immigration violations, which are considered civil matters. That model had been discontinued under the Obama administration due in part to allegations of racial profiling.
“The task force model is now the most full-throated model out there,” Vogel said.
The 287(g) agreements have been in place in a few parishes in the state in the past, including in the East Baton Rouge Sheriff’s Office, which appeared on a list of agencies participating in the program as recently as June 2024, according to a cached version of the government website.
The East Baton Rouge agreement drew concern from some community members, who worried that fears over interactions with law enforcement would cause reluctance from immigrants who were crime victims to be reluctant to report incidents or cooperate in investigations. The agency no longer appears on ICE’s list of partners for the program.
Elsewhere in the country, 287(g) agreements have received pushback, with civil rights groups claiming they empower sheriffs to target immigrant communities. In 2015, Los Angeles County ended its 287(g) contract. According to ICE documents, there currently are no agreements in California. And in Maryland, a bill that would block counties from participating in the 287(g) program is advancing in the state’s legislature. The bill’s sponsor has reportedly cited high costs and low returns for local sheriffs as one reason why the program should be banned.
In Louisiana, Vogel said, jail operators who enter into 287(g) agreements would also be stretching their resources, like bed space, to accommodate the program. But, he acknowledged, the pressure from state and federal governments might be too strong for sheriffs to push against.
“So far we’ve only seen these two,” Vogel said of the new Louisiana agreements. “And hopefully it stays there.”

(Nevada Assembly Democrats photo)Upon returning home to Las Vegas from a trip from Los Angeles, Lousetta Keyes found a 7-day “pay rent or quit” paper eviction notice taped to her apartment front door.
There wasn’t anything Keyes could do since it was late at night, she told state lawmakers at  Wednesday’s Assembly Judiciary Committee hearing as she recounted the recent experience.   
After a restless night spent worrying about why she was facing eviction, she went to her rental office first thing in the morning. That’s when she was told the notices stemmed from being short $32 on rent. Keyes said because of surprise “junk fees” attached to her monthly rental payment, she had no idea she had an outstanding amount. Let alone a number so little.
Instead of going through a court process to seek an eviction for unpaid rent, Nevada’s summary eviction process requires tenants be the first to file with the court after a 7-day notice is placed on their door. 
The basic notice template is easily accessible online to landlords and “all they have to do is hit print,” Keyes said. 
“They put a 7-day notice on my door for $32,” she said. “That’s not fair. If they had to file with the court they would have had to call me and ask why my rent was short.”
Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoed legislation in 2023 that would have reformed Nevada’s eviction laws, considered some of the nation’s most tenant-hostile. The bill was among numerous tenant protection and eviction protection bills he vetoed. 
Assembly Bill 283 would once again seek to restructure the process for filing an eviction. 
Democratic Assemblymember Max Carter, the bill’s sponsor, said he not only wanted to give eviction reform another chance. He also wants to give Lombardo a “second chance to do what’s right for Nevadans, all Nevadans, not just corporate landlords.”
Nevada has a “summary” eviction process that allows landlords to evict tenants within days unless the tenant files a challenge to the eviction in court. That is the opposite of most states, where landlords must first file with a court to execute an eviction.
Lombardo’s veto message on the summary eviction bill said the legislation would “impose additional and unnecessary delays” and costs “make our summary eviction process more time-consuming” on property owners.
The bill is about rebalanding a lopsided system, Carter said while presenting his legislation to the committee Wednesday.
“If you’ve ever attended eviction court, and Las Vegas Justice Court in particular, it is so tilted against tenants that it’s ridiculous,” Carter said. “It’s shameful to watch. We need to do something to restore the balance.”
AB 283 was one of two bills heard Wednesday by the Assembly Judiciary Committee seeking to address the impact of Nevada’s eviction system.  
Assembly Bill 201 seeks to expand efforts to automatically seal eviction records. 
“These records can negatively impact credit scores making it difficult to secure rental housing, employment and even access to loans,” said Democratic Assemblymember Erica Roth, the bill’s sponsor. “Even when the outcome of an eviction favors a tenant, a single eviction record can severely limit a person’s ability to find safe and affordable housing, trapping them in a cycle of homelessness or substandard living conditions.”
Members of the Housing Justice Alliance, which include organizations such as Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada, Make the Road Nevada and ACLU of Nevada, called on lawmakers to support both bills. 
“With our cost of living crisis and lack of tenant protections, we have an eviction-to-unhoused pipeline,” said Ben Iness. These bills are “an important step to remedy that.”
Real estate and property management groups opposed both bills. 
“I think changing the process is not going to stop evictions from happening,” John Sande, a lobbyist for the Nevada State Apartment Association said in opposition to AB 283. “The cause of eviction is the cost of housing.” 
  Shifting to the landlord 

There were at least 85,000 summary eviction cases filed last year in Nevada, said Jonathan Norman, the advocacy, outreach and policy director for the Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers.
But that figure  “does not account for the number of cases where somebody receives a notice but the case does not proceed,” he said.
The current law requiring tenants to file an answer to an eviction notice with the court — instead of having the landlords file with the court first —  not only creates a burdensome process for renters. It also prevents the state from assessing the full scope of the eviction crisis.
AB 283 would require landlords to file with the court after giving tenants a 7-day notice. Once the landlord filed with the court, the tenant would then have 7 judicial days – days the court is open – to respond. 
If a tenant responds to the notice before those 7 days are up, a court hearing is scheduled. But if the tenant doesn’t respond to the court notice, an eviction is granted. 
“The big shifts are when the landlord files a complaint and the tenant has a period to respond,” Norman said. 
The bill, he added, would bring the state in accordance with “every civil process in the United States of America.”
“This is the only process where a tenant has to initiate the lawsuit against themselves,” he said. “I just think of how absurd that sounds.”
Republican Assemblyman Toby Yurek asked whether the bill would create unintended consequences by driving small landlords out of the housing market. 
“You mentioned corporate rights landlords that certainly could absorb some of these costs that are going to be and delays that are going to incur with this process or this policy choice,” he said. “My concern is for smaller landlords.”
Carter said that in the states where landlords, not tenants, have to make the eviction filing, “this isn’t an onerous burden on small landlords.”
  ‘Equal footing’ 

Though an eviction happens in a single moment, “the consequences last for years,” said Norman with the Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers. 
Nevada law already allows tenants to petition a court to seal an eviction record. AB 201 would seek to further protect renters from the economic onus of having a Nevada eviction on their record.
The bill allows for court records to be automatically sealed one year after the eviction is granted or when a case is dismissed. 
“If someone has been unlawfully evicted, they shouldn’t have to face barriers to getting back on their feet and into housing,” Roth said. “We are in a housing crisis and experiencing record numbers of people facing homelessness. We are seeing families on the verge of eviction every single month.”
Experiencing an eviction and facing homelessness is already traumatic enough for people, Roth said.
Landlords could oppose the records being sealed. If they don’t, the record would be automatically sealed, Norman said. 
Landlords still have other tools, such as income requirements, to determine whether to rent to a tenant, he added. 
Republican Assemblymember Lisa Cole asked about how the bill would address tenants who receive more than one eviction over several years. She proposed amending the bill to include “a limit where no more than two times can a record be sealed in five years.”
Norman said they have had clients who have faced nine evictions in less than two years simply because “landlords will (issue) multiple evictions within the same month.”

Mike Johnson, R-Tega Cay, outlines a compromise in a lawsuit overhaul bill passed by the Senate on Wednesday, March 26, 2025. (Screenshot courtesy of SCETV)COLUMBIA — Senators passed legislation late Wednesday that changes the rules on personal injury lawsuits in South Carolina in hopes of driving down insurance rates that business owners say they simply can’t afford.
The agreement that senators passed after 10 p.m. wrapped up four weeks of floor debate that pitted Republicans against Republicans in the supermajority GOP chamber and resulted in a barrage of campaigning by advocates and opponents.
The 35-7 vote followed a 2½-hour recess as senators hammered out the details of what the majority could accept. Three Democrats joined Republicans in passing it. All seven “no” votes came from Democrats.
“I’m not sure compromise is the word. This is an understanding,” said Sen. Mike Johnson, R-Tega Cay, who characterized the deal as “the best result.”
Under existing law, a business that plays any role in someone’s injury or death can be forced to pay the entirety of court-awarded damages.
Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey, the lead sponsor, sought to change that to businesses paying for their part. Backing his effort have been various business associations as well as the state Chamber of Commerce, which argued that possibility put businesses at perpetual risk of bankruptcy.
“I think I should pay what I cause, not what somebody else causes,” the Edgefield Republican said repeatedly during debate.
Under the compromise, all damages would be doled out proportionally — unless the business is mostly at fault.
In other words, if a business is deemed 15% responsible, it would have to pay 15% of the verdict’s total award. However, if a business is found more than 50% responsible, it can be held fully liable for economic damages, such as medical expenses, lost wages and property damage. It would still pay proportionally for emotional and punitive damages — essentially, the jury’s award for punishing those at fault.
 “The goal is to make a plaintiff whole,” Johnson, who led the subcommittee that handled the bill, said on the floor while explaining the agreement.
The wide-ranging bill also cuts in half the mandated insurance coverage for bars and restaurants that serve alcohol.
Restaurant owners and advocates say their insurance bills have skyrocketed since legislators passed a law in 2017 requiring businesses serving alcohol after 5 p.m. to carry so-called liquor liability policies with at least $1 million in coverage.
That law increased the insurance payout if a claim is filed after someone gets drunk and winds up injuring or killing someone, and the business is at all to blame for whatever happened.
Insurance crisis is stopping new restaurants from opening, restaurateurs say

As a result, premiums in South Carolina have continually increased as insurers stopped writing those policies.
The compromise would lower the minimum coverage to $500,000.
“It’s a win for restaurants and bars. I think this absolutely will have an effect of reducing their liability insurance cost,” Massey said.
The final hurdle to the deal involved how to handle lawsuits for asbestos or so-called “forever chemicals” in water supplies.
Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency put a cap on the amount of potentially cancer-causing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, known as PFAS, allowed in drinking water.
Environmentalists called it a win for clean water, but the cost to utilities could be staggering — creating the possibility that water bills could soar. To pay for the upgrades, utilities could sue the businesses responsible for putting the chemicals in the water.
They may want to move quickly if they want a big payout.
SC water bills could rise under ‘long overdue’ federal regulations for ‘forever chemicals’

Under the compromise, lawsuits involving asbestos or PFAS wouldn’t be subject to the new rules if they’re filed before the bill becomes law.
“It was a big issue. We knew that was going to be one of the big issues. That was the reason we held it ’til last,” Massey said.
Up next
Whether it becomes law is up to the House.
Senators are expected Thursday to give the perfunctory vote needed to send the bill across the lobby.
The House unanimously passed legislation earlier this month aimed specifically at reducing insurance costs for restaurants and bars. House GOP leaders said the other issues needed further study.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Among the gun legislation before the Maine Legislature this session are proposals to amend constitutional and concealed carry laws that drew concerns from the business and law enforcement communities. 
The Legislature’s Judiciary Committee held public hearings Wednesday for eight gun bills that were broken into two groups to make public input more efficient. While half of the bills related to various aspects of concealed carry law, the other four dealt with the definition of machine guns, magazine capacity and serial numbers on firearms.
Laura Whitcomb, president of Gun Owners of Maine, said the group supported the four that would help standardize the laws around carrying firearms in the state, including the differences between having a permit to carry a concealed weapon and not having one. 
“If you are not a person who generally carries a firearm, it might be difficult to understand that most people who carry a firearm do so on a regular basis,” she said to explain why consistency in statute is important for those individuals. 
Maine residents can carry a handgun without a permit if they are 21 years old and not otherwise prohibited from possessing a firearm — what’s colloquially referred to as constitutional carry. There are exceptions allowing people who are 18 to 20 years old to carry without a permit if they are active duty military or have been honorably discharged. 
Rep. Alicia Collins (R-Sidney) is seeking to lower the constitutional carry age to 18 with LD 424 on the grounds that someone is considered a legal adult at that age and entrusted with other decisions,such as voting or enlisting in the military. 
Maine Legislature weighs updates to machine gun definition, ghost gun regulations

Under current law, an employer can’t prohibit an employee from storing a firearm in their vehicle if the employee has a valid permit to carry a concealed firearm, so long as the vehicle is locked and the firearm is stored out of sight. However, Collins is looking to remove the requirement that an employee have a valid concealed carry permit with LD 998.
The Maine State Chamber of Commerce opposed this bill citing concerns over employer choice and workplace safety. 
Additionally, Rep. Jennifer Poirier (R-Skowhegan) introduced LD 1049, which would repeal a requirement that someone carrying a concealed handgun without a permit must inform a law enforcement officer immediately that they have a firearm during a traffic stop or other such encounters. 
Maine State Police and the Maine Department of Public Safety opposed this proposal over safety concerns for both the officers and other individuals involved in those encounters. 
The final carry-related proposal came from Sen. David Haggan (R-Penobscot). He said LD 829 would clean up confusion in existing law by making it clear that someone can carry a concealed firearm in a state park, so long as they are not otherwise prohibited from possessing one. It removes the ambiguity that someone must have a permit to carry in a state park or Acadia National Park, he said. 
The bill includes an emergency preamble so it could take effect immediately upon passage with a two-thirds vote. This means it could be in place for the summer recreation season. 
Justin Davis, state director for the National Rifle Association, argued LD 829 is important not only for protection against wildlife in the Maine woods, but a security measure for females hiking alone. 
However, Friends of Acadia, an organization dedicated to protecting and preserving the park, opposed the proposal for the sake of the millions of visitors who come to the park each year for tranquility. 
The Gun Safety Coalition of Maine opposed all four proposals, which they characterized as “very dangerous.”

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)  Doctors, high school students, religious leaders, hunters, a law professor and dozens more showed up in Augusta Wednesday to give their input on a new slate of gun legislation before the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee. 
Given the public interest in gun legislation, the committee broke the eight bills into two groups to help make the public hearing and testimony more efficient. The first group of bills dealt with the definition of machine guns, magazine capacity and serial numbers on firearms. The other proposals were about constitutional rights and concealed carry laws. 
While gun rights advocates saw most of that first group of bills as infringements on Second Amendment rights, proponents characterized them as common sense protections against mass shootings and other such tragedies. 
Around this time last year, lawmakers were working through multiple gun safety reforms with the state’s deadliest mass shooting less than six months in the rearview. Though it’s been more than a year since the October 2023 tragedy in Lewiston, it still shaped Wednesday’s conversation.
“I know that you know the capacity for destruction that high-capacity weapons have in our society,” said Margaret Craven, who represented Lewiston in the Maine House of Representatives at the time of the shooting, testifying at the hearing Wednesday. 
Rather than focusing on the details of how those firearms work, Craven told the story of what happened in her hometown on the day 18 people were killed, explaining that she doesn’t want “this to be swept under the Second Amendment mat just because some time has passed.” 
At Schemengees Bar & Grille, one of the scenes of the shooting, Robert Card II fired 36 rounds that killed 10 people and injured 10 others in just 78 seconds, Craven said. 
“If anybody thinks that a machine gun is a weapon that any Tom, Dick or Harry should just have access to, they are highly mistaken,” Craven said. “They are a threat to our safety, our society, our children, our grandchildren, our neighbors.”
Last session, Gov. Janet Mills vetoed a bill that would change the definition of machine gun to limit their use and required that firearms used in a crime would have to be destroyed. That proposal from Sen. Anne Carney (D-Cumberland) would also have banned conversion devices, like bump stocks, that make semi-automatic weapons operate like machine guns. 










I know that you know the capacity for destruction that high-capacity weapons have in our society.


– Margaret Craven, who represented Lewiston in the Maine House of Representatives at the time of the mass shooting


Carney went to work drafting a new bill that she said addresses Mills’ concern about overly sweeping language. LD 677 changes the definition of machine gun to account for new technology that can convert a semiautomatic firearm into a machine gun. It also prohibits the possession of a rapid-fire device, which the bill defines as something that increases the rate of fire of a semi-automatic firearm.
LD 953 introduced by Sen. David Haggan (R-Penobscot) similarly seeks to amend the state’s definition of “machine gun.” Haggan said the language in his bill offers a more accurate definition by changing the use of “projectile” to “shot.” 
Rep. Matthew Beck (D-South Portland) introduced LD 1109, which would make it illegal to possess a “large-capacity ammunition feeding device,” defined as having more than 10 rounds of ammunition. The bill includes exceptions for active duty members of the U.S. Armed Forces and law enforcement officers. 
Beck said he had conversations with people who participate in shooting competitions who fear they could be negatively affected by the legislation, and he would be open to amending the bill to exempt them — if he could do so without undermining the intent of the bill. The intent is to get at what Beck described as a “common denominator” among some of the deadliest mass shootings: large-capacity magazines. 
Opponents to LD 1109 said the vast majority of guns have magazines larger than 10 rounds and questioned the logic behind the prohibition when someone could still have multiple small magazines. 
Proposals to amend concealed carry laws saw pushback from business community, law enforcement

Rep. Sam Zager (D-Portland) introduced LD 1126, which would require serial numbers for so-called ghost guns that are assembled at home or those made with a 3D printer. It would also prohibit undetectable firearms, meaning those that can’t be spotted with a metal detector — as is true with many 3D printed guns, he noted.
Zager clarified that Mainers would still be allowed to craft their own firearms at home if this were to pass, they would just need to go to a Federal Firearms License holder to obtain a serial number. 
He argued this wouldn’t create a gun registry, which is a common concern for gun rights advocates, but could be useful to law enforcement in tracking down weapons used unlawfully. However, critics argued that people intending to use the firearms for crime would not follow the law to first have their gun serialized. 
In July, Portland Police reported increased gun violence and activity, including a two-week period where three ghost guns were recovered. 
Zager’s bill comes on the same day the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a regulation from the Biden administration in a 7-2 opinion that found existing gun laws allow for certain regulation of ghost guns such as serial numbers and background checks. 
Justin Davis, state director for the National Rifle Association, said certain language in LD 1126 could be a “backdoor” to universal background checks, a concept that was voted down in a 2016 ballot referendum question. 
In general, people were either for or against all of the bills, except LD 953. Gun safety advocates, as well as the Maine Medical Association, the Maine chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics and multiple retired healthcare professionals spoke in favor of the other three bills, seeing them as solutions to what they described as the public health crisis of gun violence. 
However, a number of gun owners and advocates including the Gun Owners of Maine pushed back on those reforms, arguing that regulations limit people’s ability to protect themselves without actually deterring bad actors. They claimed that guns are not to blame for violence, but rather underresourced mental health services.

The bill, [&#8230;]","A conceptual rendering depicts what state leaders envision for a new ""transformative campus"" meant to house and rehabilitate people experiencing homelessness. (Courtesy of the Utah Office of Homeless Services)Utah Gov. Spencer Cox officially signed a bill on Tuesday that not only cemented Salt Lake City’s partnership with the state to improve “public safety” within the capital city, but also one that could carry major implications for what comes next in the effort to dramatically expand the state’s emergency shelter bed capacity.
The bill, HB465, started out as a punitive measure — one that would have forced Salt Lake City to formally partner with the state to police camping and drugs or else risk losing state funds. The version ultimately passed by the Utah Legislature and signed by Cox, however, no longer includes those penalties — though it still requires Salt Lake City police to enter into an agreement with the Department of Public Safety by July 1. 
To Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall, who faced demands from state leaders ahead of the 2025 legislative session to better police camping, drugs and lawlessness in her city, the final version of HB465 is much more palatable than its original. 
State leaders call SLC police ‘ineffective,’ urge mayor to act — or state will step in 

“We went into this session with a goal of preventing a state takeover of our public safety,” Mendenhall told reporters during a media roundtable on Friday. “We succeeded in maintaining that core municipal function of Salt Lake City.“
But there’s another important provision in the bill that grants the state the power to “use eminent domain to condemn” a very specific type of parcel — “unincorporated land” owned by Salt Lake City “for the public use of constructing a new facility on the land for homeless services.” 
That’s a tool that state leaders could potentially use in their ongoing secret search for a 30-acre property meant to host what’s envisioned as a “transformative campus” to increase Utah’s homeless shelter capacity by somewhere in the ballpark of 1,200 to 1,600 beds.  
“We’re supportive of (the eminent domain provision) because we know the legal landscape surrounding the property options that we’re looking at, and this is a tool that we support in this bill,” said Mendenhall, who also serves on the Utah Homeless Services Board, the body that will make the final decision where to site the proposed homeless campus. 
Finding that site has proven difficult, State Homeless Coordinator Wayne Niederhauser has said. He told Utah News Dispatch on the final night of the 2025 session that the eminent domain provision of HB465 is an optional tool to help site a “permanent” facility — though he also said no decisions have been made. 
“We’re still looking at properties. This is one of the options,” Niederhauser said. “In order for that to be an option, eminent domain is required.” 
Utah lawmakers look to use eminent domain to help SLC site new homeless shelter

The mayor supported that eminent domain provision — which came about through negotiations with lawmakers — as a way to advance an effort that Mendenhall has long been urging state leaders to move on sooner rather than later: increase the number of emergency homeless shelter beds in the state’s homeless system. 
“Normally we would never agree to eminent domain,” Mendenhall said, but she added Salt Lake’s “highest priority in this conversation” was creating more homeless shelter space “as soon as possible.” 
That could allow the state to potentially use that city-owned property — which has not yet been publicly identified — for not just a temporary facility that Mendenhall offered in her public safety plan that she unveiled in December in response to state demands to improve “public safety” in Salt Lake City, but it could also eventually be a permanent home for the envisioned “homeless campus.”
When asked to clarify whether HB465 could be used to site the homeless campus, Mendenhall told reporters, “or a transitional facility until that point.” 
In order to immediately address what her plan described as a “shortage of 1,000 to 1,600 year-round emergency shelter beds,” Mendenhall previously said in her plan that Salt Lake City would be prepared to use a “city-owned property for a campus facility for up to 24 months if capital and operational costs can be allocated by the state and philanthropic partners” while state officials work to site a permanent property.
But as HB465 took shape, she indicated that she would be open to that property also hosting a permanent shelter.
“I’ve long said that the system needs more shelter. This is a humanitarian crisis that will not be resolved quickly,” Mendenhall said in a prepared statement to Utah News Dispatch last month when the new version of HB465 was first adopted. “As much as I would prefer to have more shelter and housing in all counties across the state, I also recognize the acute needs here. Specifically, we know how difficult it is to open winter beds every year that close and leave people outside all summer. That being said, we are willing to explore permanent shelter if it is fully funded by the state and philanthropic partners.”
Where is this city-owned property?
Details are scant on exactly where and when that city-owned property is located other than it’s on “unincorporated” land. HB465’s sponsor, House Majority Assistant Whip Casey Snider, R-Paradise, also gave another hint in a Senate committee hearing that it has an “easement against it for conservation.” 
However, at least one lawmaker — Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City — said she voted against HB465 out of concern that its eminent domain provision could impact west-side Salt Lake City. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
On the Senate floor, Escamilla worried it will lead state and city leaders to place “a very large building in the west side of Salt Lake City, and (it’s) very problematic because they won’t have a process for the community to engage.” 
When asked about Escamilla’s concerns about the property being near west-side Salt Lake City, a spokesperson for Mendenhall told Utah News Dispatch to contact the Office of Homeless Services about location specifics. A spokesperson for that office declined to comment. 
Previously, Mendenhall has advocated for other cities to do more to host homeless facilities since Salt Lake City already hosts many. Pressed on why she’s agreed to use city-owned land for the effort, Mendenhall said she would answer that question at a later date. 
“When we identify the site of the facility, we can talk about that,” she said. 
Asked when that site will be announced, Mendenhall also didn’t give an answer. 
“If I knew I probably couldn’t tell you, but I don’t even know just yet,” she said. 
When will we know more?
The bill has an effective date of May 7, so state leaders could potentially exercise their new eminent domain powers at any point after that date. However, it’s not clear exactly when the public will know more about that property, whether state leaders actually move to exercise their eminent domain power, or any other developments around the state’s search for a homeless campus. 
Utah homeless board OKs search for up to 1,200-bed ‘centralized campus.’ What now?

In response to questions about HB465’s eminent domain provision, state officials referred to a newly created website that lists a loose timeline for the “transformative campus.” 
A “final site announcement” isn’t expected until at least “summer 2025,” but no hard dates have been set, according to the website. After that announcement, state officials expect “community engagement to share plans, gather input and answer questions.” 
The first phase of the project isn’t expected to open until at least November 2025. 
But between now and then, many more details need to be hashed out. And lack of funding continues to be a major issue. 
Homeless board faces multimillion-dollar gap left unfunded by lawmakers
Last week, the Utah Homeless Services Board — the body that oversees and funds the state’s homeless system — held its first meeting since the conclusion of the 2025 Utah Legislature. 
In that meeting, Niederhauser updated board members on what lawmakers did and didn’t fund. 
 “This is a big challenge for our office,” Niederhauser warned. “The board needs to be aware of it.”
Cox recommended lawmakers spend at least $18.8 million on efforts to alleviate homelessness, including about $5.8 million in ongoing funds for a new family shelter that’s already been approved in South Salt Lake and about $13 million in one-time funding to keep temporary emergency shelter beds open through next winter and into spring 2026. 
Faith groups, advocates urge Utah Legislature to fund operations for new family shelter

However, the Legislature only funded $3.9 million for the family shelter and $5.5 million in one-time money for emergency shelter, Niederhauser said. 
“That does leave us short $1.9 million ongoing” for the family shelter, he said. 
The new family shelter is still expected to open within the next month, as it’s currently funded to stay open at least until the end of June, Niederhauser said, but it’s not yet clear what will happen to it unless state and local leaders scrape together more money for the shelter. 
“We met with The Road Home and Shelter the Homeless today, brainstorming how we might get more creative to fill that gap of $1.9 million,” Niederhauser said. “So we’re all going to be participating in that, looking to potentially the private sector and maybe also some more public sector money to fill that gap.” 
As for the money for winter and summer overflow beds — which helped house more than 900 people this year — Niederhauser said “we have a serious worry” that if state leaders don’t find more money to keep those beds open beyond April 30, 2026, there could be hundreds of people “looking for a place to sleep at night in and around probably Salt Lake City, the Jordan River, creeping into other communities nearby.” 
“I think we’re going to be about $5 million short to get us through next fiscal year,” Niederhauser said. 
He added that his office will be searching for solutions. “But unless we get some money, other public funds maybe through some other public entities and maybe some help from the private sector, it’s going to be a big challenge.” 
“My guess is we’ll be able to get through next winter without having to close beds,” he said. “But on April 30 (2026), without some additional money, I think we’re going to have a lot of beds close.” 
Mendenhall, in her public safety plan, urged the 2025 Utah legislature to allocate a “stable, dedicated funding source” for homeless services. That didn’t happen. She told reporters Friday that was the No. 1 thing lacking from this year’s legislative session. 
Meanwhile, there’s an even bigger hurdle that lawmakers haven’t yet taken on. There’s no ongoing funding yet identified to fully fund operations for the homeless campus, “which we really, desperately need,” Niederhauser. 
Last year, the Utah Legislature appropriated $25 million for a new large homeless shelter, but officials have not yet spent that cash while they continue to look for a site for the homeless campus. But ongoing funding is a much bigger problem. 
Lawmakers fund $25 million toward new 600-800 bed homeless shelter

“That’s going to have to be a big discussion that we have this summer and into next legislative session,” Niederhauser said. 
He noted Haven For Hope in San Antonio — which Utah leaders visited last year as they shaped their vision for Utah’s homeless campus — costs an estimated $30 million a year to operate. 
“So that’s a big nut to crack,” he said. “That’s going to be a big nut for the Legislature to consider. So we are going to have to come together and figure this out as a whole community. That’s the state, county, cities, and the private sector, to figure out how that’s going to work.” 
Despite the challenges, Niederhauser said he’s “bullish” that leaders will find a way to make the campus a reality. 
But in the meantime, if homeless service providers have to cut back on case management in order to fill the funding gaps the 2025 Legislature left, that could create more issues that run contrary to the Homeless Service Board’s goal to not just warehouse people, but help them get back on their feet. 
Jim Behunin, a former legislative auditor who now serves on the Homeless Services Board, said “we cannot be asking our providers to come up with any more efficiencies.” 
“I’ve seen how short they are in their funding already,” he said. “We are already underfunding for supportive services.” 
However, Behunin also said as he’s spoken with legislators, “there is a lack of confidence” in the state’s homeless system to support added investment, especially “new funds” through a tax that would likely be needed to support operations of the new campus. 
“They’re not ready to bite on that offer,” he said. “There’s still a lot of concern about whether the funds would be spent effectively. And how we bridge that gap is something that we all need to be grappling with somehow.”

What's left of her priorities for the 2025 Legislative Session?(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Legislature is just over halfway through the 2024 Legislative Session with Tuesday marking the 17th day of session. 
Gov. Kay Ivey laid out her priorities for the session in her State of the State address in February. Some have already been signed into law, like the What is a Woman Act and the Glock switch ban. But what is still moving through the legislative process?

To the governor

• SB 97, sponsored by Sen. April Weaver, R-Alabaster, also known as the What is a Woman Act, was one of the first pieces of legislation to make it to Ivey’s desk this session. Critics say the law is discriminatory and that passage was rushed. It received final passage on the fifth legislative day, which is the minimum number of days it takes to pass a bill. 
The law defines “sex” as the “state of being male or female as observed or clinically verified at birth” and provides further definitions for male, female, man, woman, boy, girl, mother and father. It also prohibits males, as defined by the law, from being in female spaces, as defined by the law, and vice versa. 
• Ivey signed a ban on Glock switches, which turn semi-automatic firearms into automatic firearms, on March 19. 
SB 116, sponsored by Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, makes it a Class C felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $15,000 fine, for a person to own or sell the combination of parts that create a Glock switch. The bill was the first firearm restriction legislation to pass the Legislature since 2010. Rep. Phillip Ensler, D-Montgomery, carried the legislation in the House and had done so for the past two sessions.
• The Legislature also passed a bill altering the Veterans Affairs Board to give Ivey control over its commissioner and policies. SB 67, sponsored by Sen. Andrew Jones, R-Centre, the board will retain its current size of 17 members, but the governor will appoint the commissioner. The bill also removes the board’s ability to enact policies and rules on veterans’ issues, reducing them to an advisory role in the governor’s office.
Ivey appointed Jeffrey Newton, a retired brigadier general, as commissioner of the Alabama Department of Veterans Affairs last week. 
“We will use this new structure to focus on what matters most — serving those who sacrificed so much for our freedoms — our veterans and their families,” Ivey said in a statement after signing the bill.
• Ivey supported paid parental leave for educators in her February speech. Sen. Vivian Figures, D-Mobile, tried to pass the legislation last year, but it did not get a House vote. This year, Figures and Rep. Ginny Shaver, R-Leesburg, teamed up to pass SB 199 on March 20. 
The law allows women who give birth, have a stillbirth, or a miscarriage after 12 weeks to receive eight weeks of paid leave. It also allows a father to take two weeks of paid leave under those circumstances. If a couple adopts a child under 3 years old, either parent may have eight weeks of leave.  
It awaits a signature from Ivey, which she said last week in a social media post she would sign it. 
“Thank you to Rep. Ginny Shaver and Sen. Vivian Figures for carrying this important legislation. I look forward to receiving the bill and getting my signature on it,” she wrote.

To the floor

• On the education front, Ivey called for a ban on cell phones in classrooms. HB 166, sponsored by Rep. Leigh Hulsey, R-Helena, and SB 92, sponsored by Sen. Donnie Chesteen, R-Geneva, bans cell phone use in public schools from bell-to-bell with few exceptions. 
According to the legislation, cell phones could be used in emergency situations, by students with Individualized Education Plans and Section 504 plans, and when necessary for instructional purposes. 
Both bills are waiting on floor votes in their respective chambers of origin. 
• SB 55, sponsored by Sen. Chris Elliot, R-Josephine, attempts to invalidate out-of-state driver’s licenses issued without legal presence verification. It passed the Senate in February and the House Public Safety and Homeland Security Committee in early March. It awaits a vote on the House floor. 
• HB 297, sponsored by Rep. Jennifer Fidler, R-Silverhill, would impose a 4% fee on international transfers, often used by immigrants to support family overseas. It is similar to SB 77, sponsored by April Weaver, R-Alabaster, but the House version does not impose as much of a fee that Weaver’s bill proposed. It passed a House committee last week and awaits a vote from the full House. 
• HB 7, sponsored by Rep. Ernie Yarbrough, R-Trinity, would give sheriff’s deputies and police officers authority to arrest and detain people without citizenship and to transfer them to the custody of federal law enforcement. It passed a House committee in February and awaits a floor vote in the House. It is not on the agenda for April 1, when the Legislature returns from a weeklong break. 

Committee conversations

• A bill that would allow felons convicted under the Habitual Offender Act before 2000 to have their sentences reviewed passed the Alabama Senate last week and moves to the House Judiciary Committee. As of Wednesday afternoon, that committee has not posted its agenda.
SB 156, sponsored by Barfoot, also known as the Second Chance Act, got support from Ivey. The criminal justice reform measure is designed to ensure state prison space is used for the most serious offenders.
• SB 63, sponsored by Sen. Lance Bell, R-Pell City, would require fingerprinting and DNA collection from non-citizens in custody. The bill passed the Senate in February and is awaiting a vote in the House Ways and Means General Fund Committee. 
• SB 53, sponsored by Sen. Wes Kitchens, R-Arab, establishes a process to determine immigration status detained by law enforcement and creates a new crime of harboring or concealing a person without legal immigration status. The bill received a lot of criticism for containing language that mirrored the Fugitive Slave Act. That language has been removed from the bill. It passed the Senate in February and is awaiting approval from the House Judiciary Committee. 
• HB 3, sponsored by Rep. Chip Brown, R-Hollingers Island, enhances penalties for people without legal status when they are charged with a felony where the victim is a minor. It passed the House last week and awaits approval from the Senate Judiciary Committee, which does not have its agenda published yet. 
Studies have repeatedly found that immigrants without legal status commit significantly less crime than the U.S. population as a whole. 
• HB 302, sponsored by Rep. Ben Robbins, R-Sylacauga, requires companies that hire people without legal status to register their employees with the Department of Workforce. The sponsor said the bill aims to cut down on human trafficking. It passed the House last week and awaits consideration from the Senate Fiscal Responsibility and Economic Development Committee, which does not have its agenda published yet. 
• Ivey also called for the Ten Commandments to be displayed in all public schools, including colleges and universities, despite a federal court ruling on a similar Louisiana law deeming the display unconstitutional. 
SB 166, sponsored by Sen. Keith Kelley, R-Anniston, received opposition and support in a March committee meeting. Opposition primarily came from religious leaders from across the state, while support stemmed from Western civilization’s foundation. The legislation has yet to be moved out of the Senate Education Policy Committee, and it is not on the committee’s agenda for next week.
• On public educator benefits, a bill giving public educators workmen’s compensation was stalled last week in the House Ways and Means Education Committee. SB 1, sponsored by Sen. Sam Givhan, was carried over without a vote due to Republican committee members’ concerns about how the legislation mirrors the benefit given to state employees. 
• HB 202, sponsored by Rep. Rex Reynolds, R-Huntsville, raises the bar for prosecuting law enforcement by creating a round of hearings on a law enforcement officer’s immunity prior to trials or hearings. The bill passed the House along party lines in early March and awaits approval from the Senate Judiciary Committee.
• A bipartisan supported public safety bill, HB 287, sponsored by Rep. Juandalynn Givan, D-Birmingham, requires law enforcement agencies to report their staff numbers annually. It passed the House in February and awaits a vote from the Senate Judiciary Committee.
• The House Judiciary Committee last week approved a constitutional amendment expanding Aniah’s Law, which was approved by voters in 2022. The expansion would make more charges subject to bond denial, including having a firearm or firing a gun into places with people, or soliciting, attempting or engaging in a conspiracy to commit murder. SB 118, sponsored by Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, awaits a vote from the full House.

Money, money, money

• The General Fund and Education Trust Fund (ETF) budgets are not usually considered until the back half of the session. This year is no different. Ivey submitted her recommendations for the ETF and General Fund, which total at $9.2 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. 
House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter supports an overhaul on the funding formula for the ETF. Legislators approved a hybrid model in February. 
“It’s time to get something different,” Ledbetter said on Feb. 4. “They’re looking at a weighted funding which, you know, the areas which are more poverty stricken, it certainly would help them, as well as ESL students. I certainly believe it’s positive.”
Lawmakers previously outlined three options: maintaining the existing system, which allocates money based on daily attendance; overhauling it entirely, or adopting a hybrid with additional funding for specific student populations, such as special education and English language learners.
Members decided to go with the hybrid approach, which would maintain the current foundation program while introducing additional funding based on student needs. As of Wednesday, no bills had been filed to make the change. 
• The House passed five tax cuts that mostly affect the ETF. The cuts take $205 million from the ETF, which is less than the $230 million hole left by the overtime tax exemption that is set to expire this summer. 
Ledbetter said he likes the overtime tax exemption, but the five bill package would impact more Alabamians. 
“I think those are the largest tax cuts that’s ever been passed in this state, and it affects everybody, not just a small segment of the population,” Ledbetter said last week. 
House Minority Leader Anthony Daniels, D-Huntsville, filed a bill that would extend the overtime tax exemption and commission a study on its economic impact. There is not a fiscal note attached to HB 467. 
• Lawmakers said in February they are prioritizing essential services as federal COVID funds disappear. COVID funding and historically high income and sales tax revenues left state coffers flush over the last several years, allowing legislators to pass supplemental funding bills near the start of the legislative sessions. 
Alabama Medicaid requested $1.2 billion in state funding at its budget hearing in February. While that is a $229 million increase from last year, Medicaid gets $8.9 billion from the federal government. 
The General Fund will start in the House this year and the ETF will start in the Senate. Ledbetter said last week that he expects to see the budgets in committee next week.
“We’ll probably see them the first week of April, but a lot of work’s already been done behind the scenes going into that,” Ledbetter said last week. “Committees have met, they’ve met with agencies, and so I think we’re in a place where we start moving those through.”
Gov. Ivey said in a statement Thursday morning that she looks forward to getting the rest of the public safety package and the cell phone ban to her desk.
“The governor is confident her other legislative priorities will make their way to her desk, including the remainder of the Safe Alabama public safety package, the bill to get cell phones out of the classroom during instructional time, among other items,” the statement read. “We are pressing full speed ahead!”

The Walker River Paiute Tribe was notified March 7 that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) suspended — and [&#8230;]","Walker Lake outside Walker River Paiute Tribe reservation. (Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)Reliable drinking water, new homes, and community solar power are now further out of reach for members of the Walker River Paiute Tribe after the Trump administration froze $20 million in federal funding awarded to the Tribe.
The Walker River Paiute Tribe was notified March 7 that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) suspended — and may soon terminate — a contractually obligated $20 million Community Change Grant awarded in October. 
Tribal leaders say the move will likely kill a critical water infrastructure project a decade in the making  that would bring drinking water to more than 100 reservation homes and businesses currently rely on a dwindling well water supply. Without the funding, the construction of a planned community solar project that would provide energy upgrades for 150 homes on the reservation and community resilience hub would also be eliminated.
Joseph Frank, project manager for Walker River Paiute Tribe, said the grant freeze was just the latest in a series of funding setbacks brought on by the Trump administration. 
“With a lot of these cuts that have come down, we are definitely feeling strained,” Frank told the U.S. Economic Development Administration’s Indigenous Economic Development Community of Practice last week.
Funds from the EPA grant were frozen for a week in January when the Nevada Clean Energy Fund — a nonprofit bank that administers the funds — lost access to the EPA’s online grant management portal, before they were unfrozen, then frozen again this month.
“The uncertainty to the grant is the ever changing status, it becomes active, then suspended and this makes it impossible to continue with our projects,” said Walker River Paiute Tribe Chair Melanie McFalls in a press release Monday. 
Termination of the EPA grant would “definitely be a nail in the coffin, or, you know, one of many,” said Frank.
Between aging pipes, pollutants and regional drought, the Tribe’s existing water infrastructure has been stretched to its limits — compromising both public health and economic development, said McFalls.
Before Trump took office,  the Tribe had an ambitious plan to complete the project by May 2027, according to McFalls.
The “Water Looping Project” secured about $8 million in funding from several other federal agencies — including the Economic Development Administration, Bureau of Reclamation, and Indian Health Services — and nearly $3 million in state matching funds. But without the EPA grant, the Tribe will not be able to fully complete the project. 
Kirsten Stasio, CEO of the Nevada Clean Energy Fund, said the Walker River Paiute Tribe has only used about $70,000 of the $20 million EPA grant, but has “already made significant investments in the engineering and design” of the project. 
Stasio said the EPA has offered no explanation for why the funds were frozen on March 7, and whether they will be reinstated: “We’re not getting a lot of information from the EPA or communication.”
Funding for water infrastructure would allow the Walker River Paiute Tribe to build more homes and businesses on the reservation. Frank, the project manager for the tribe, said there is a strong demand for homes on the reservation, but without the right infrastructure they can’t be built.
“That project is definitely a cornerstone for the community, because if we don’t get that done, we’re not going to be able to build more homes,” Frank said. “We definitely do not have enough housing, and we cannot add more houses into the structures that we have currently, because the system is already being taxed as it is.”
Lack of adequate water infrastructure on the reservation also means much of the reservation lacks the water pressure needed for fire hydrants, putting homes on the reservation at severe risk of fire damage. A study by the Department of the Interior found that existing water storage capacity on the reservation falls short of meeting current codes for fire suppression.
Additionally, insurance companies will not insure buildings without proper water infrastructure which hinders housing and commercial development.
“A lot of insurance companies will not come to the reservation because the fire department does not have the capability” to sustain the water pressure needed to fight fires, Frank said.
“They require you to be able to run so much water, gallonage per minute, per hour,” Frank said. “We don’t have the capacity in our infrastructure to run that at this time.”
Funding from the EPA Community Change Grant would also allow the Tribe to fund a community solar project that would provide energy upgrades for 150 homes on the Walker River reservation.
“Because we live in a more rural area, electricity out here fluctuates. Some days we may have electricity. Other times it’s the power bumps that really raise Cain with the system,” Frank said.
Funding from the frozen EPA grant was also earmarked to fund the construction of a new nutritional wellness building on the Walker River reservation, that would serve as a community resilience hub during heat waves and other natural disasters. 
Tribal leaders said the cascade of federal funding cuts from the Trump administration this month has already impacted the Tribe’s current food pantry, which serves tribal and nontribal customers alike. Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Agriculture axed the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program that provided three tribes in Nevada with more than $1 million in fresh produce and meats from local farmers and ranchers.
 No reason given

Stasio, the CEO of the Nevada Clean Energy Fund, said she fears the EPA grant for the Walker River Paiute Tribe has been caught up in a sweep of anti-DEI — diversity, equity and inclusion — efforts at the federal level, despite the grant’s focus on vital infrastructure. 
Funding for the EPA Community Change Grant was provided through the Environmental and Climate Justice Program, a $2.8 billion financial assistance program created by the Inflation Reduction Act. EPA Administrator Zeldin cancelled grants and contracts related to DEI and environmental justice in his first round of spending cuts.
“This is just investing in critical infrastructure in our community, in our Tribal communities. It’s attracting much needed investment, jobs, and economic development in that region,” Stasio said.
The federal government is required by law to uphold its trust responsibility to tribes — a legal obligation under which the United States must protect tribal sovereignty and provide basic social services for tribal nations.
“Tribes are sovereign nations. It’s not about DEI or environmental justice,” Stasio continued.
More than 400 EPA grants were terminated by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin this month, with the assistance of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) led by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.
“As with any change in Administration, the agency is reviewing its grant funding to ensure it is appropriate use of taxpayer dollars and to understand how those programs align with Administration priorities,” an EPA spokesperson said in response to questions about why the contractually obligated funding was cut.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/DSC01983-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaska has long had the distinction of having the nation’s highest or nearly highest rates of gonorrhea.
Now there is another troublesome trend among those who contract the sexually transmitted infection. Cases of a rare but severe complication of gonorrhea have spiked in Alaska for reasons that are not yet fully understood, according to state health officials.
The Alaska Department of Health received 27 reports of patients with what is known as “disseminated gonococcal infection” last year, said a bulletin released by the department’s epidemiology section. Those are infections in which the pathogen that causes gonorrhea passes beyond normally infected sites – the genital, rectal or mouth areas — into the bloodstream and other parts of the body.
Disseminated gonococcal infection, or DGI, can harm joints, tendons or body organs. The most serious potential effects, according to the bulletin, include endocarditis, a life-threatening infection of the heart’s inner linings and valves, and meningitis, a potentially fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord.
The 27 cases of DGC reported last year represented 1.3% of the 2,079 reported cases of gonorrhea in Alaska in 2024, the bulletin said. That percentage is more than triple the rate in 2023, when eight DGI cases were reported among the 2,289 reported gonorrhea cases, and it is 10 times the rate in 2022, when only three DGI cases were reported out of the 2,304 reported gonorrhea cases that year, resulting in a rate of 0.13%, the bulletin said.
Additionally, Alaska’s rate of DGI is far higher than the most recently reported national rates, the bulletin said.
While Alaska’s rates of gonorrhea are high, that does not account for the increasing rates of the serious infections that go beyond the parts of the body usually infected by the disease, said Julia Rogers, an epidemiologist who co-authored the new bulletin.
The number of gonorrhea cases in Alaska actually decreased in recent years, dropping from 2,304 cases in 2022 to 2,079 last year, Rogers pointed out.
Rather, what might be happening is that a particular type of gonorrhea that makes patients more prone to these severe complications is spreading in Alaska, she said.
“Though the exact reason for this increase in disseminated cases is unclear at this time, several factors are likely contributing to the increase, including that certain characteristics of the new gonorrhea sequence types circulating in Alaska’s population are more likely to result in disseminated infection and more likely to be asymptomatic upon initial infection (meaning they aren’t detected and treated in a timely manner, allowing for severe manifestations like DGI in patients),” she said by email.
Sequences in epidemiology terms refer to genetic patterns, and different strains of pathogens have their own genetic sequences.
State health officials have been working since last fall to boost monitoring and have looked for a possible link between these cases, but they have not identified one yet, the bulletin said.
Of the 35 DGI patients identified in 2023 and 2024, most were in Anchorage, according to the epidemiology bulletin. The most common medical complication was septic arthritis, an infection of joint fluids and joint tissues, the bulletin said. Thirty-one patients were hospitalized, and most of those had to have invasive treatments, including two valve replacements, the bulletin said.

The House Public Safety and Homeland Security Committee approved HB 403, sponsored by Rep. Russell Bedsole, R-Alabaster, at a March 19 meeting. It requires the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency to create and manage a database of people that law enforcement identify as part of a criminal enterprise or gang.
“The bill includes rolling out the database after five years of no activity so there is no collection of information that is dated and no longer timely and relevant,” Bedsole said during the committee meeting.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The legislation authorizes ALEA to create and maintain the criminal enterprise database based on information by criminal justice agencies. The database would include information about people that law enforcement agencies believe are engaged in criminal conduct.
People can be designated as part of a criminal enterprise or gang if they meet at least three criteria listed in statute. Some of the conditions include getting identified by an informant or family member, or if suspects admit to be part of a gang.
Other criteria include adopting “the style of dress of a criminal enterprise.” Law enforcement can also label someone as a member of a gang by adopting “the use of a hand sign identified as used by a criminal enterprise,” or if a person has  “a tattoo identified as used by a criminal enterprise.”
Chris Melde, professor of criminal justice at Michigan State University. said the criteria makes it possible for someone who is not part of a gang to be identified as such.
“You can get a tattoo in the heat of the moment, and they are everlasting unless you go in for a tattoo removal,” he said. “There are some types of signs and signals that are characteristic of gangs, but they also make their way into popular media.”
The association becomes especially problematic when law enforcement rely on one indicator.
“You want to be able to do what is called triangulation of information,” Melde said. “Multiple sources of information are all identifying the person as a person who is gang involved.”
He also said one aspect of the list is collection but there are other considerations.
“You have to have a mechanism in place that either automatically purges that information, or people on the list if there is no more intelligence coming in that they are continuing in gang activity, or people have to go in and manually purge those lists if they become stale,” Melde said.
“It has a list of parameters and safeguards, if you will, that are placed in there,” Bedsole said.
The database would not be public, and ALEA may only grant criminal justice agencies access to the information contained in the database. People will be granted access only as part of a court order; for discovery in lawsuit, or if a subpoena is issued.
The Alabama Legislature in 2023 approved a bill that created harsher penalties for people who commit specific crimes as part of a network, such as a criminal enterprise or member of a gang.
SB 143, sponsored by Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road,made Class C felonies committed by gang members a Class B felony, raising the maximum punishment from 10 years in prison to 20 years in prison. Class B felonies are enhanced to Class A felonies, punishable by up to 99 years in prison.
People convicted of a Class A felony and who are part of a criminal enterprise, face a minimum of 25 years in prison.
Lists have consistently been challenged in court because membership in a criminal enterprise, such as a gang, is fluid. There are some core members, but others on the periphery may remove themselves or join over time. Melde said databases need to be purged to keep lists current.
“There have been cases in other states where people just linger on the list and might get caught up in the system where they have had no gang involvement for quite a while,” Melde said.
Civil rights groups expressed reservations with the legislation, concerned that people who are not involved in a gang may be given harsher penalties because they are suspected to be associated with gang activity.
“As the Legislature now considers the companion bills HB403 and SB241, which would authorize ALEA to develop a database that would track and share these identifiers with agencies throughout the state, I’d like to see them include information relating to the statute’s enforcement, such as how many times has it been utilized?” said Jerome Dees, policy director for the Southern Poverty Law Center. “What was the disposition of the case? And what are the demographics of the folks being tracked and prosecuted by this statute? Of course, public safety and privacy of sensitive information is incredibly important. But we also want to make sure that enforcement is fair and just.”

The recommendations, presented Wednesday during an Alabama Veterans Mental Health Steering Committee meeting in Montgomery, focused on four primary goals: suicide prevention; enhancing crisis care and care transitions; increasing access to treatment, and addressing risk factors that contribute to mental health issues among veterans.
“[We’re] really trying to figure out, based on all the data and documents we’ve produced, where the gaps in services, and how can we best build those gaps,” said Alabama Department of Mental Health Commissioner Kimberly Boswell, who chairs the committee.

Alabama’s veterans experienced suicide at a rate of 35.4 per 100,000 in 2021, exceeding both the national veteran average and the state’s general population rate. A significant number of Alabamians, including veterans, suffer from traumatic brain injuries (TBI), a condition linked to increased mental health challenges. Research indicates veterans in Alabama face higher rates of mental illness and substance abuse compared to their non-veteran counterparts.
The committee recommended establishing an Alabama Veterans Resources Center (AVRC), a partnership between the state and Alabama Power designed to serve as a centralized hub for veterans’ services. SB 70, sponsored by Sen. Andrew Jones, R-Centre, which provides for its creation, was signed by Gov. Kay Ivey in February.
“We’re very, very excited about that Veterans Resource Center and looking forward to getting it up and running,” Boswell said.
The committee also recommended expanding programs for traumatic brain injuries, citing a $2.5 million allocation in the state’s Education Trust Fund budget. The funding would allow veterans with TBIs to receive care beyond the current two-year post-injury eligibility limit.
“The combination of traumatic brain injury and substance use disorder put veterans at the greatest risk of suicide, and addressing TBI is a really important goal of the group,” Boswell said.
Another recommendation is to implement the Storing Ammunition and Firearms to Enhance Resilience (SAFER) Together Program, an initiative promoting secure firearm and ammunition storage to reduce suicide risk. SB 40, sponsored by Sen. Keith Kelley, R-Anniston, which would allow people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer, passed the Senate in February and is in position to be voted on in the House.
The committee also called for a formal partnership between the Alabama Department of Mental Health and the Alabama Department of Veterans Affairs to improve coordination of behavioral health services as well as organizing a summit on veterans’ mental health to focus on improving awareness and education among service providers.
“We’re really excited about the partnership with ADVA and really working together to figure out how to truly address the behavioral health needs of veterans,” Boswell said. “They’re kind of the expert on the veterans and we’re kind of the expert on behavioral health, and we really feel very strongly about that partnership.”
The committee will finalize a final draft Friday to present to the Legislature and Gov. Kay Ivey.

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images)For the Day Eagle Hope Project, federal money has helped volunteers deliver fresh produce and meat to families in need across the remote Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in northern Montana — while putting cash into the hands of farmers, ranchers and meat processors.
The nonprofit generally has less than $300,000 to spend per year. So the $200,000 from a U.S. Department of Agriculture local food buying program drastically raised both the quantity and quality of the food it could distribute.
“They were a major, major contributor to our food,” said Tescha Hawley, who directs the organization, which aims to improve physical, mental and spiritual health.
The USDA recently nixed more than $1 billion from two programs that helped food banks and school meal programs buy local foods, including $660 million for schoolchildren. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins recently described the programs as “nonessential.”
But the move has left hundreds of school systems and food banks reeling. They already face rising food prices and are struggling to help community members with growing food insecurity.
Created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs aimed to build more resilient supply chains of domestic food by connecting schools and food pantries with small ranches, farms and dairies. The program was initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but later expanded by the Biden administration.
The federal programs stimulated the purchase of locally grown fruits, vegetables, dairy and meats — benefiting both the smaller farmers who received fair market pay for their products and the organizations granted funds to buy high quality foods.
The noncompetitive grants sent hundreds of millions of dollars to all 50 states, the District of Columbia and 84 tribal governments, boosting business for more than 8,000 farmers and providing local food to almost as many food banks. The Trump administration is killing the programs, despite Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s campaign against processed food, which he says is “poisoning” Americans.
Without ongoing funding, Hawley said, she would have to rely on cheaper, less nutritious food.
“It’s simple, right? I can get a truck … in here with all highly processed food, no problem,” she said.
Schools are facing a similar challenge: While officials running breakfast and lunch programs would prefer to buy more local products, those are often expensive. And with underfunding, high food costs and labor struggles, school lunch programs are already stretched thin.
In Milan, Tennessee, the federal funds allowed the local school system to buy minimally processed beef from a local stockyard, and broccoli, purple hull peas, tomatoes and melons from local growers.
Vickie Dunaway, who supervises the school system’s food services, told the Tennessee Lookout the federal cuts mean “going backwards” on purchasing healthier foods.
“That will obviously have to be cut out, because our budget will not withstand being able to purchase local,” she said. “Purchasing local, minimally processed food is way more expensive than buying from a distributor.”
 A ‘devastating’ cut to food banks

Late last year, USDA said the programs had already spent more than $1 billion on local foods, and announced an expansion of the two programs with an additional $1.13 billion. USDA has killed that $1.13 billion expansion; it is still reimbursing the previously committed funds.
The Trump administration, which has sought to dramatically slash the size of the federal government, told recipients earlier this month that the programs “no longer effectuate the goals of the agency.”
In a statement to Stateline, the USDA said the current administration is “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
“The COVID era is over — USDA’s approach to nutrition programs will reflect that reality moving forward,” the statement said.












The only thing we’ll be able to do is just ration what little we have — to spread it as thinly as possible over the number of households we provide food to.


– Eric Cooper, president and CEO of the San Antonio Food Bank




The nonpartisan National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, which represents the ag department leaders of all 50 states, last month lobbied the federal government to continue the local foods program with permanent funding and ease procurement regulations for school meal programs. Arkansas Secretary of Agriculture Wes Ward, president of the association, said in a statement that the local food programs aid both producers and consumers.
“Investing in local and regional food systems not only strengthens the connections between farmers and their local communities, it bolsters supply chain resiliency as well,” his statement read.
In New Mexico, the program allowed food banks to buy some 900,000 pounds of locally grown food from more than 200 farmers since 2023. Before the program was terminated, the state was expecting close to $3 million in additional funding, Source New Mexico reported.
Jill Dixon, executive director of The Food Depot in northern New Mexico, called the cuts “devastating.”
In Texas, the San Antonio Food Bank counted on USDA’s local food program to help round out the food boxes it provides to families in need. The food bank, which serves more than 100,000 people across 29 Texas counties, largely relies on donated foods from hotels, restaurants and grocery stores.
“The challenge is I might get peanut butter donated, but I don’t have the jelly, or I might have pasta donated, but I don’t have the marinara,” said Eric Cooper, president and CEO of the food bank. “This program allowed us to purchase those items that we didn’t get that then helped round out the food box, or really complement the food that was being donated to give families the ability to make meals.”
The program initially provided the food bank nearly $3 million in grant funding — about 20% of what the organization spends each year on bulk food purchases. It expected a similar amount this year, before USDA’s announcement.
Cooper said cuts come even as the need for assistance rises. Food prices have squeezed families, and mass layoffs of federal workers portend more demand for food assistance in the coming months, he said.
“And we’ll be caught in the middle. And you know, that’s an incredibly uncomfortable place to be. The only thing we’ll be able to do is just ration what little we have — to spread it as thinly as possible over the number of households we provide food to.”

A boost for school lunches
For years, school meal programs have struggled with tight margins. Not only do they have to meet strict nutritional guidelines, but schools also face lagging reimbursement from the federal government and spend millions covering the cost of students’ unpaid meal debt.
At the 1,600-student Monticello School District in Arkansas, that debt is approaching $60,000.
So $50,000 from USDA’s local food program was a significant boost to the bottom line.
“That was such a help,” said Amanda West, the district’s child nutrition director.
The southeast Arkansas district used grant money to buy locally grown ground beef. The beef went into dishes including taco salad, meatloaf and spaghetti.
West said staff and students immediately noticed a difference in taste from conventionally purchased meats. And though the local product cost more, West said it also yielded more because it was not full of additives that cause the meat to shrink when cooked.
West, who is the president of the Arkansas School Nutrition Association, noted that her state is home to the nation’s highest rates of food insecurity.
West had hoped to see the local foods program help turn that tide by bringing more stability to school meal programs and growing the state economy by boosting local farmers, ranchers and distributors.
“We’re all upset about it. I hate that we’re not receiving it because grocery prices are 30, 40% higher than what they were a few years ago, and it really hurts our budget,” she said. “It helped a lot of districts, including mine, and it would be amazing if we could get it back.”
On top of the local foods program cuts, congressional Republicans are considering billions in potential cuts to free and reduced-price school meal programs — cuts the School Nutrition Association says could potentially affect millions of American students.
The federal government partially subsidizes breakfast, lunch and after-school snack programs at rates calculated by the income level of students’ families.
The School Nutrition Association, which represents 50,000 school meal providers across the country, said the school meals are the healthiest many American children receive. But that group says federal reimbursements are far from adequate, leaving members worried about the future of their meal programs.
In a recent association survey of more than 1,390 school meal directors, more than 90% reported serious or moderate concern over the financial sustainability of their school meal programs three years from now.

That means 150 lawmakers dashing from room to room to hear testimony, explain bills, broker compromises. Lobbyists, residents and staff also fill up the halls.
Add in caffeine and sugar from the snack shack, and you’ve got a typical Wednesday at the Statehouse.
8:30 — Committees kick off
It’s an early start for the House Education Committee, with a fairly full House chamber. In what has become a weekly ritual, committee chairman Rep. Bob Behning, R-Indianapolis, has to ask Rep. Vernon Smith, D-Gary, to “Please, speak into your mic!” as others chuckle. It’s not uncommon for other lawmakers to rib the grandfatherly Smith over microphone bloopers.
The committee quickly settles into what would be an hours-long meeting to amend and vote out three bills, and hear testimony on two others.
8:45 — A fast start
The House’s Family, Children and Human Affairs Committee starts 15 minutes late but is quick to get through two bills already heard last week.
Senate Bill 498, on child services, passes 12-0. That prompts Rep. Elizabeth Rowray, R-Yorktown, to joke, “I just want to know if we are going to hold hands and sing kumbaya?” 
But the consensus ends quickly, as Democrats oppose Senate Bill 463. It loosens child-staff ratios in licensed child care centers — mirroring laws in contiguous states instead.
Sen. Chris Garten, R-Charlestown, stays jovial, saying, “I’ve got a lot of friends who are Democrats.”
But Rep. Vanessa Summers, D-Indianapolis, says the ratios were previously tightened for a reason. She has served on the committee for much of her 34-year tenure.
“Our children were in danger,” she says. “When we did this, it wasn’t out of ignorance. It was out of need for the time and I can’t say that the time is better or worse than it was years ago.”
The meeting concludes within the hour, with members scattering to their other obligations.
9:20 — ‘Chairman Brad Barrett Day’
Richmond Republican Rep. Brad Barrett has three bills moving this session — and Sen. Ed Charbonneau, who chairs the Senate Health and Provider Services Committee, opts to hear all three at once. 
Charbonneau, a Valparaiso Republican, dubs the hearing “Chairman Brad Barrett Day,” which coincides with National Spinach Day, according to lobbyist Matt Bell. But testimony on Barrett’s first proposal, the wide-ranging House Bill 1003, drags for hours.

10:30 — If you’re not early, you’re late!
Sen. Linda Rogers, R-Granger, kicks off the Senate Pensions and Labor Committee’s meeting promptly at 10:30 a.m. and adjourns it in less than three minutes — so quickly one member votes before he can even sit down.
Lawmakers have long sought to offer former public servants guaranteed annual benefit boosts, with earlier retirees getting 13th checks and more recent retirees racking up cost-of-living adjustments. That hybrid system’s onset would be delayed to 2029 under changes Rogers brought to House Bill 1221 Wednesday. All retirees would get 13th checks annually until then.
Committee members accept the edits by consent within the meeting’s first minute, and complete a unanimous vote before the third — despite a late arrival. The attorney calling the roll pauses as Sen. Rodney Pol, D-Chesterton, dumps a bag and other belongings on the table and leans down to the microphone to vote.
10:48 — School transportation bill grinds traffic to a halt
The House Education Committee is still trudging along, but testimony gets heated for proposed amendments to Senate Bill 373. One would create an optional pilot for groups of traditional, charter and private schools to share facilities and transportation through a newly created local board. It would also establish an Indianapolis alliance to conduct a facilities study and create an implementation plan before 2026.
More than a dozen charter school families speak excitedly about efforts to expand busing, because most charters lack it. Among the supporters are several elementary schoolers, whose testimony — and fabulous reading skills — elicit compliments from lawmakers.
But Indiana School Boards Association leader Terry Spradlin diverges.
“This is an amendment that we’re struggling to understand the genesis of, the need of, the justification for,” he says. “We have clear lines of authority between the superintendent, the CFO and the school board. This is only going to blur the lines of local governance and lead to a lot of confusion about authority on tax levy dollars.”
The committee doesn’t vote on the final bill, leaving it on the agenda for next week.
10:40 — Partisan shots taken in elections committee
This time, we’re the ones late to the party — too many meetings to cover, and not enough Capital Chronicle reporters! The House’s Elections and Apportionment Committee members are debating changes to Senate Bill 10, which would end the use of public college and university identification cards at the voting box.
Fifteen amendments are filed, but committee members spare us. They accept — along party lines — one detailed, Republican amendment altering voter list maintenance and data-sharing. And they defeat three Democratic amendments along the same margins before consenting to one considering consular reports of births abroad proof of U.S. citizenship. The bill is approved on a 9-4 vote.
Lawmakers move on. Senate Bill 137 — intended to block people with only temporary credentials from registering to vote at the Bureau of Motor Vehicles — manages to draw bipartisan support from prominent state officials.
But Julia Vaughn, leader of elections watchdog Common Cause Indiana, testifies that the BMV’s data is outdated and could ensnare naturalized citizens. Rep. J.D. Prescott, R-Union City, criticizes Vaughn’s description of her group as “nonpartisan,” claiming that 99% of its 2024 donations were to Democrats.

Vaughn interrupts him, voice wavering.
“Excuse me, representative, we don’t make campaign contributions, so I’m not quite sure who you are referring to. … Please don’t say things that simply aren’t true,” she asserts, prompting Prescott to reply, “I’m sorry — the employees.” 
Vaughn calls his accusation “really unfair,” while Rep. Cherrish Pryor, D-Indianapolis, says it “was very inappropriate” and that the committee should focus on the legislation.
“Duly noted,” says chair Rep. Tim Wesco, R-Osceola.
The committee unanimously agrees to advance it, then speeds through proposals dealing with ballot counter oaths and absentee ballot retractions in 30 minutes. 
That involves the party-line defeat of edits from Rep. Sue Errington, D-Muncie, about names with special characters. The confused-looking committee is about to vote on the edits when the Election Division’s Democratic co-director walks to Errington and whispers in her ear.
Errington says she’s been informed that the Voting System Technical Oversight Program requested the changes.
“V-STOP has not contacted me at all about it,” Wesco remarks. “… Call the roll.”
11:02 — No limits on testimony in Health
Extensive committee questioning and lengthy testimony — 21 witnesses signed up — slows the Senate’s health committee to a crawl. Charbonneau urges self-imposed limits, saying he doesn’t want to set a timer. 
“I implore you to please make your point,” Charbonneau says just before 11:30 a.m., with more testimony ahead. 
The appeal doesn’t curb the drawn-out speeches and exchanges. Testimony doesn’t end until 12:19 p.m. and the committee still has three bills to go.
12:20 — A musical accompaniment
During a lunchtime worship hour, music from the adjoining meditation room bleeds into the ongoing Senate health committee meeting. Aides deliver water, coffee and soda to parched senators. 
After Barrett’s first bill is finally voted out, his second flies by in less than 10 minutes despite a flurry of revisions. Barrett’s third and final bill concludes at 1:05 p.m.
But committee members must stay for one more measure — though both people who signed up to testify have already left. Members amend the last bill and adjourn at last. Lawmakers and lobbyists alike leave the room wearily, with little time to rest before the next round of committees.

1:30 — No rest for Sen. Liz Brown
Just a few minutes after leaving the health meeting on the fourth floor, Sen. Liz Brown promptly starts the 1:30 p.m. committee she chairs down in the basement: Judiciary. Members hear one bill to potentially add judicial officers to counties depending on caseloads.
Brown, R-Fort Wayne, invites Rep. Chris Jeter, R-Fishers, to speak on House Bill 1144 — saying he’s “looking so sharp in his spring blazer.”
Six proposed amendments are added. It’s passed on a 10-0 vote in under 30 minutes.
But there is more work to be done. Brown warns of a plan that could reallocate judges around the state based on population shifts. Counties with low caseloads might lose judicial officers. Stay tuned.

1:32 — ‘Fight Club’ hits the Statehouse
Back up on the Statehouse’s fourth floor, Sen. Ron Alting, R-Lafayette, gavels the Senate Public Policy Committee meeting into order. House Bill 1272, dealing with inactive state groups and inter-state compacts, gets amendments and a vote in five minutes flat.
Sen. Scott Baldwin, R-Noblesville, settles into the witness chair to introduce House Bill 1073, which would let the Indiana Gaming Commission regulate bare-knuckle fighting, boxing, wrestling and more. It’s amended and unanimously voted out within another five minutes.
“In the spirit of the bill … I’d like to challenge Sens. (Justin) Busch and Walker to a bare-knuckle fight here on the floor of the committee (room),” Baldwin says, in jest. Committee members jokingly make a motion and second it, before someone quips that they’d like to finish the meeting first.
Baldwin starts, “This bill is pretty simple, besides what’s about to happen to Walker —,” 
“(Sen.) Kyle Walker!” interjects Sen. Greg Walker. Both “Walkers” are on the same committee.
1:35 — A bipartisan agreement
The House Ways and Means Committee gets off to a slightly late start, with Chair Jeff Thompson holding his glass “penalty jar” aloft. He uses it to ensure lawmakers and the public mute their cell phones. 
“We’re looking a little light, so feel free to leave your phones on,” the Lizton Republican wisecracks. The money is ultimately donated to charity.
Lawmakers speed through their seven-bill agenda, advancing four bills in just half an hour. Nearly every bill today is “amend and vote only” — no testimony.
Republicans traditionally bat down Democratic suggestions, but Thompson surprises some by accepting back-to-back amendments from Rep. Greg Porter on Senate Bill 516. One would require the Indiana Economic Development Corp. to notify the state budget committee before it buys land, while another would require that companies invite the entire committee on tours — not just GOP leadership.
Thompson asks if Porter will agree to incorporate the edits by consent.
“It gives my heart great joy,” the Indianapolis Democrat replies.  
The committee holds one bill back for another week, and zips through another legislative effort from Rogers. She heads back to the education panel in time for another vote. 
Thompson closes the meeting shortly after, but warns committee members, “Do not expect the meeting to be this short the next two weeks.”

2:40 p.m. — Party-line votes in education
“No” votes largely outweigh affirmative votes during the afternoon’s Senate education meeting.
Republican senators shoot down a slew of Democratic proposals offered on a school deregulation bill, including one requiring the Indiana education secretary to hold at least a bachelor’s degree. Another failed edit would have required the secretary to reside in Indiana.
Amendment discussion echoes a morning debate in the House Education Committee, when those members contemplated whether school superintendents should have to hold high-level academic degrees.
Senate committee amendments on a measure to bar transgender women from playing on collegiate women’s sports teams also fail along party lines.
Sen. Stacey Donato, R-Logansport, the bill’s sponsor, is polite — but brief — in the few remarks she makes in opposition to Democrats’ attempts to rollback the legislation.
“Thank you … but I just ask that this be defeated,” she says at multiple points in the discussion.
The ban moves on a party-line vote and heads for the Senate floor for further consideration.

(Photo courtesy of Katherine Sayler of Defenders of Wildlife)Let me first make it clear that I am a big fan of peanuts — the tasty legume favored by George Washington Carver, that is, and not the Charlie Brown cartoon.
At baseball games, I have eaten dry roasted peanuts a plenty. While driving across Florida, I have munched on soggy brown paper bagfuls of hot boiled peanuts. And of course, as a longtime journalist, I have for years worked for peanuts.
But I am most definitely NOT on the side of the peanuts in an ongoing rhubarb over some state forest land that’s important for several imperiled species.
A state agency, the Suwannee River Water Management District, owns some land known as the Ellaville Tract that’s part of Twin Rivers State Forest. Now there’s a proposed deal to hand over that land to a Georgia peanut farming company. Nearly 700 acres of prime sandhill habitat would be given away. 
In exchange, the company will give the state 543 acres of its farmland, which sure sounds like an unequal swap just in terms of general acreage.
The Tampa Bay Times broke the story of the swap last week, the same way it broke the story of another idiotic state forest land swap in Citrus County that involved a golf course developer. That one has now apparently stalled.
As for Ellaville, the newspaper reported that the peanut farm’s property has more than 400 acres in a floodplain and lies along a mile of the Withlacoochee River. That’s why water district officials say that gives the peanut farm property “significantly higher” value than the high-and-dry state forest uplands.
  Katherine Sayler via Defenders of Wildlife
One of the first people I talked to when I heard about all this was Katherine Sayler of Defenders of Wildlife. Almost as soon as she learned about the proposed property swap, Sayler pulled on her boots and accompanied a Florida Forest Service employee to look at the supposedly worthless property.
“As soon as we walked out there,” she told me, “we saw there were gopher tortoise burrows.”
She saw white-tailed deer tracks too and heard woodpeckers. She saw healthy wiregrass beds and plenty of longleaf pines, once the magnificent king of the Southern forest, now an embattled presence that’s still hanging on in spots.
But last week, when she told a water district committee about the magnificent bounty of the forest and why it still deserves to be protected, she said, it was as if they didn’t hear her. 
Perhaps someone was making too much noise shelling peanuts. 
Nature’s condo
The gopher tortoise is a legally protected species in Florida, but you might not know that from the way our state has treated them. Gophers always look like they’re ticked off at us humans, which is kind of understandable.
Gophers became known as “Hoover chickens” in the 1930s, when their plentiful numbers saved a multitude of starving Floridians during the Depression. Herbert Hoover’s Republican Party had promised a chicken in every pot, but there were no chickens to feed the poor, only the tortoises they could catch.
Now the tortoises save scores of other imperiled species from certain doom.  Their burrows — up to 40 feet long and 18 feet deep — provide a secluded place to live for about 300 kinds of animals, many of them classified as endangered or threatened. Think of these burrows as nature’s condo.
Unfortunately, the sandy soil where the gophers live is the preferred habitat of a predatory species, the Florida developer. 
For 16 years, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission allowed developers to write a check to the state and then run their bulldozers right over the tortoise burrows, sealing up all the wildlife inside to die.
The state handed out 105,000 of these licenses to kill known as “incidental take permits” before biologists reported a problem. Turns out Florida’s tortoise population was dropping like Florida congressman turned National Security Adviser Mike Waltz’s jaw when he found out he’d accidentally added a reporter onto the text chain about secret war plans. 
Now the developers are required to get permits to move the gophers before they start construction. This has produced a variety of new problems ranging from the spread of illness among the tortoises to developers who don’t bother to get a permit.
  M.C. Davis via Nokuse Plantation
One of the best sites for relocated gophers has been the Nokuse Plantation, a 55,000-acre Panhandle preserve. It was launched by a dirt-road philanthropist named M.C. Davis, whose skills in pool-hustling and poker-playing paid his way through college and law school and made him a tough opponent in negotiations.
The director of Nokuse, Matt Aresco, told me that the state forest property that water district officials want to trade away is an important spot for both gopher tortoises and their frequent tenants, indigo snakes.
Aresco sent me a copy of a 2017 study by the state wildlife commission that found some 440 tortoises on the state forest land. That means it’s like the tortoise equivalent of downtown Tampa. 
“For a relatively small property, I’d say 440 tortoises is … a lot of animals,” said Jeffrey Goessling, an Eckerd College biology professor who’s an expert on gopher tortoises and sits on the advocacy group Gopher Tortoise Council.
Aresco also told me this is the second time the water district has tried to give this land away. The first time, M.C. Davis was still alive and among the main opponents.
The old conceits
 As Elvis Costello once sang, “History repeats the old conceits, the glib replies, the same defeats.” That’s certainly true with Ellaville.
In 2012, a different peanut farmer cast his covetous eyes on the Ellaville Tract and proposed buying it outright. The water district governing board was keenly interested. However, Davis and other environmental activists, plus the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, all objected.
At Aresco’s suggestion, I contacted Eric Draper about what went down in 2012. Draper, a former Florida Park Service director, was then an official with Audubon Florida.
“This one really shocked us,” Draper recalled. “The deal was all worked out by the water management district to sell the land to the peanut farmer. They were going to declare it as surplus and then sell it.”
  The Ellaville Tract is home to lots of longleaf pines. (Photo courtesy of Eric Draper)
Under state law, any land bought for conservation must be officially declared to be no longer useful for conservation purposes before the state agency that owns it can get rid of it. The Ellaville Tract had been purchased by the water district as part of a 5,000-acre deal back in 1988. Since then, thousands of dollars in taxpayer money had been used in maintaining it and cultivating the longleaf pines.
Yet, in 2012, the water district board voted to declare the Ellaville Tract was no longer needed for conservation purposes. It was all set to sell it and let the farmer turn it into an ecologically sterile, heavily fertilized peanut production facility.
But then the deal died.
  Eric Draper. when he was Florida State Parks director, via Eric Draper
What happened? According to Draper, the opponents found someone to help them whose opinion carried a lot of weight with the gubernatorial appointees on the water board. It was a council of the state’s largest landowners, such as the timber company Rayonier and the cattle giant Lykes Brothers.
Their undeveloped property holds a lot of gopher tortoises as well, Draper told me. The savvy environmentalists pointed out to them that the loss of so many gophers on the Ellaville Tract would likely result in even more pressure for the remaining landowners to keep their own gopher populations intact.
“In a world full of endangered species,” Draper explained, “you don’t want to be the last one with endangered species on your land.”
What’s even more amazing is what happened next. Davis and the others persuaded the state to buy the peanut farm and turn it into conservation land. Instead of a big loss, they turned this into a gain for the environment.
  Julie Wraithmell via Audubon Florida
“We think the same should happen this time,” said Julie Wraithmell, executive director of Audubon Florida. “The parcel they want to pick up is definitely worthy, but so too is the Ellaville parcel. It’s an issue of ‘and’ not ‘or.’” 
‘A bona fide offer’
Given how this Ellaville-isn’t-needed idea went south last time, I was curious about how it came up again. What was the corporate farmer’s reason for diving into this morass?
“Lee Peanut has expressed interest in this surplus property for some time,” Troy Roberts, spokesman for the water district, told me. “The district received a bona fide offer … in February 2025 and prepared the item for Lands Committee consideration.”
  The “bona fide” offer for the Ellaville Tract, via SRWMD
At my request, he sent me a copy of the “bona fide offer” from Lee Peanut, which owns 1,400 acres and processes 5,000 pounds of peanuts per acre per year. But this document doesn’t explain the motivation either. It just says which parcels would be involved, then concludes with, “All of this is contingent on appraisals and negotiations.”
Sayler told me that a farmer representative showed up for the committee meeting where she testified and talked about what a “win-win” deal this would be. But she couldn’t recall him ever explaining why this would be a “win” for the taxpayers who now own the Ellaville Tract or for the nature that now rules over it.
Looking for clues, I checked their parent company Birdsong’s website, which boasted about how they’re “committed to a sustainable future.” I even watched a YouTube video about how they’re being more careful with their fertilizer now that they know it’s a pollutant.
But there was nothing about gopher tortoises, or rather about getting rid of them. That’s what will happen if this deal goes through. State law exempts agriculture from the requirement to move gophers. That means Birdsong/Lee can just plow right over those 440 burrows and bury every single animal inside.
Finally, after several attempts, I was able to get hold of Lee Peanuts manager Garland Brooks. But he made it clear that he didn’t want to answer my questions. He refused to comment for the record and warned me against quoting him. When I persisted in my questions he hung up on me.
I took that as a sign that he couldn’t tell me any good reason why a private company should get public property.
Not just gophers galore
Suwannee River’s spokesman, Roberts, said he didn’t know when this land swap would come up before the board for a final vote. I’m rooting for “never.”
In fact, I’m hopeful the Suwannee River governing board will reconsider its 2012 vote declaring that Ellaville land to be surplus. 
 Not only does it have gophers galore but also, according to a wildlife commission official quoted by the Times, “swallow-tailed kites, kestrels, eastern indigo snakes, gopher frogs, fox squirrels and the Florida black bear.”
And the Gopher Tortoise Council, in a letter sent to the water district board, pointed out other important species, such as “Florida pine snakes, Southern hognose snakes, Southern fox squirrel, Bachman’s sparrow, Northern bobwhite quail, and many other species. … It’s a popular wildlife-viewing site as a result, with over 95 bird species documented on eBird by visiting birders.”
The idea that the water district board could declare this naturally teeming forest unnecessary for conservation just based on water district goals turns out to be legally shaky. 
That’s according to Clay Henderson, a lawyer who has been involved in land conservation in Florida for so long he wrote a book about it called “Forces of Nature.” He told me the law says the water district board must consider more than just floodplains and river frontage in deciding whether the land is still valuable for conservation.
“Clearly this tract continues to have high biodiversity value and accordingly would still be required for conservation purposes,” Henderson told me. “That being the case, there is no reason to look further to determine whether it could be traded for something else. “
 Seems to me, then, that any further effort to push this land swap forward would be totally — oh, what’s a good word for it? Oh yeah. Nuts.

Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images.President Trump issued an executive order this week, “Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections.”
Many of its most far-reaching provisions are sure to be challenged in court. After all, an executive order is not a law. It’s an instruction to the executive branch of the federal government. Moreover, our election system is highly decentralized, with local units of government doing most of the work of election administration under state authority, with only limited congressional intrusion. Still, the outcome of any litigation will matter, in some states considerably so. 
But in Minnesota, voters will be able to keep right on registering to vote and voting as they are accustomed to, even if the order is upheld in full. 
Here are some questions, answered:  
Will Minnesotans need documentation of citizenship to register?
No. Minnesotans will still be able to register all the same ways as at present. Congress has not exercised its authority to change voter registration requirements for federal elections. Instead, the executive order tries to shoehorn a documentation requirement into the existing authority for federal mail voter registration forms and the special federal postcard application used by military voters and citizens abroad. That has no impact on other, more common, means of registration. And even if those two forms are changed, there’s no change to the standards by which Minnesota will accept them.
The section of Minnesota statute controlling the state’s voter registration application form also provides that “Voter registration forms authorized by the National Voter Registration Act must also be accepted as valid. The federal postcard application form must also be accepted as valid if it is not deficient and the voter is eligible to register in Minnesota.” These are alternatives to the state form, which can be completed either on paper or online, either in advance of an election or when voting.
The standards for acceptance of the federal mail form aren’t made explicit, beyond that it “must also be accepted as valid.” Thus, the same standards would apply as for the state’s own form, i.e., no documentation of citizenship is required. 
Minnesota law provides an explicit definition of what makes a voter registration application “deficient,” i.e., not acceptable. There is no requirement to substantiate citizenship with any particular documents. 
Although irrelevant to Minnesota, any change in the federal forms could make a big difference in the swing state of Arizona, where documentation of citizenship is already required for all registrations other than via the federal forms. There’s no evidence that noncitizens are voting in big numbers, so its necessity is dubious. But as the normally business-friendly Republican president knows, when you erect more regulatory and compliance hurdles — like a proof of citizenship — you typically get less business activity, or in this case, voting. Which may be the point.
Will Minnesotans need to change the voting systems they use?
No. Minnesotans will still be able to mark their ballots by hand or using any of the ballot-marking devices the state has approved to provide more universal accessibility. And they will still be able to cast their ballots via any of the optical-scan ballot counters the state has approved for use at polling places and central facilities. The executive order makes some changes in the federal certification process, even calling for the decertification of already certified voting systems. However, Minnesota law does not require continuous federal certification.
What Minnesota law does require from voting-system vendors is certification “at the time of submission of the application … to be in conformity with voluntary voting system guidelines.” In other words, any subsequent change to the voluntary voting system guidelines does not affect an already-certified system. 
Will Minnesotans face a new deadline for submitting ballots?
No. Minnesotans will continue needing to get their absentee and mail ballots in by 8:00 p.m. on Election Day — not just postmarked. The executive order has two paragraphs addressing states that accept “absentee or mail-in ballots received after Election Day.” One paragraph makes an exception for military and overseas ballots, the other doesn’t. But for Minnesota, that difference is irrelevant: State law already requires all ballots to be received by Election Day.
Minnesota’s deadline for absentee ballots specifies that any “received on election day after 8:00 p.m. shall be marked as received late by the county auditor or municipal clerk, and must not be delivered to the ballot board.” For precincts voting by mail, the same deadline is expressed in positive form: “any ballot received by 8:00 p.m. on the day of the election must be counted.”
In 2020, due to the COVID-19 public health emergency, the state entered into a consent decree to suspend enforcement of the ballot receipt deadline. However, that agreement’s own terms called for its termination after “certification of ballots for the November [2020] General Election,” so it is no longer at issue.
What about funding?
The executive order offers states a mix of promises of cooperation and threats of retribution, including potential loss of funding. It isn’t clear how any of these would apply to Minnesota, particularly given the state’s exemption from one of the underlying federal laws.
However, the president surely does have the power to inject even more uncertainty into Minnesota’s budgeting process. And he surely does have the power to occupy our attorney general’s time and money litigating the funding issues.
For the purposes of this article, though, that’s all beside the point. Whether or not the state loses any funding, whether or not the state’s lawyers spend more time in federal courtrooms, the impact won’t be on individual voters.

(Courtesy CT DEEP)They’ve been accused of raiding crops, ransacking trash cans and boldly breaking into homes to steal food out of the refrigerator. In at least two cases last year, black bears were even reported to have attacked people in Connecticut.
Alarmed by the steady stream of headlines documenting their run-ins with humans, some lawmakers say it’s past time for the state to open a hunting season on bears.
The debate over bear hunting has persisted for years between Connecticut farmers, wildlife advocates, hunters and, increasingly, suburban homeowners. On one side, supporters argue that a hunt will cull bears that roam closest to populated areas, while opponents reject that notion and say the animals should be left alone.
“I’ve encountered bears in the woods many other states. When they see you, they smell you, they run away,” said Chas Catania, a hunter from Sherman, said during a public hearing before the Environment Committee on Monday. “Connecticut bears are habituated to people. They are not afraid of us.”
Connecticut is home to between 1,000 and 1,200 black bears, according to estimates from the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. Though the population is mostly concentrated in the Litchfield Hills, sightings have been recorded in nearly every city and town across the state.
The idea of a limited hunt has gained the backing of a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers as well as Gov. Ned Lamont, though vocal opposition from conservation groups has so far kept the hunters at bay.
“They’re framing it as a public safety issue, but the science is very clear on that — in states that do allow hunting, it’s done for recreational purposes, not to manage human-bear conflicts,” said Annie Hornish, an animal rights activist and co-founder of CT Coalition to Protect Bears, after Monday’s hearing.
“The reason they can’t come out and say it is because the public doesn’t want it,” she added. “They don’t like trophy hunting of bears.”
This year’s legislation, Senate Bill 1523, would require DEEP to establish a bear hunting season, which officials say would likely take place in the fall. The bill would also give the agency the authority to prescribe the methods of hunting, the cost of fees and limits on the number of animals that could be killed.
The public hearing on the bill Monday drew testimony from hundreds of advocates and opponents of a hunt.
Jason Hawley, a wildlife biologist working on DEEP’s bear program, told lawmakers that data from Massachusetts — which manages an annual culling of a few hundred bears — offers clear evidence for the effectiveness of a hunt.
Over the last few years, Connecticut has averaged more than three times as many home entries by bears than its northern neighbor despite having many fewer bears, according to DEEP. Last year tied a record with 67 home entries, along with dozens of additional reports of unsuccessful attempts.
“Honestly, it’s getting dangerous,” Hawley said. “Someone’s going to get killed or severely hurt. We’re on that track if we stay where we are right now.”
In an effort to address the growing number of conflicts with bears, lawmakers in 2023 approved legislation clarifying when people may kill a bear in self-defense and authorizing DEEP to issue permits to farmers to kill nuisance animals that have damaged crops, livestock or bee hives. The law also prohibited the intentional feeding of bears.
A total of 15 bears were killed under those provisions last year, and DEEP officials say they anticipate demand to grow as more people become aware of the program.

State Sen. Henri Martin, R-Bristol, criticized opponents of the bill for what he said was an anthropomorphization of wild bears.
“We’re not talking about Winnie-the-Pooh, or Yogi Bear, or Smokey the Bear,” Martin said. “We’re talking about black bears that are becoming more and more dangerous as they get used to humans.”
Opponents, meanwhile, say that those pushing for the hunt are reacting to the public’s fear of bears rather than scientific data.
During the public hearing on Monday, they criticized a study from New Jersey showing that conflicts with humans rose sharply after the state ended its hunt in 2021, arguing that neighboring New York saw similar trends despite making no changes to its hunt.
The last complete census of the state’s bear population was conducted by the University of Connecticut in 2014, and officials have since updated their estimates each year based on their understanding the population’s growth rate. Hawley, the DEEP biologist, said that conducting another study would likely cost around $500,000 and take three years to complete.
“Until that happens, I don’t think that we have enough information to move forward with any sort of bear hunt,” said Tanya Bourgoin, the wildlife committee chair with Sierra Club Connecticut.
During this week’s hearings, several lawmakers also sought advice about non-lethal methods of managing the bear population, including educating people about how to avoid bears, fining them if they ignore the warnings and, some suggested, using birth control.
“Can that be tried? Has it been tried?” asked state Rep. Mike Demicco, D-Farmington. (Hawley responded that despite attempts in other states, the sizes and breeding habits of Connecticut’s black bears make birth control an ineffective option).
Advocates have also pushed for DEEP to step up its ongoing public relations campaign about steps people can take to avoid attracting bears, such as taking down bird feeders or moving garbage cans inside.
The last serious push to allow bear hunting, in 2023, failed to coalesce support among members of the legislature’s Environment Committee and resulted in the passage of the more limited measure focused on nuisance bears and feeding. The co-chair of the committee this year, state Sen. Rick Lopes, D-New Britain, said this week he is attempting to gauge if members will support a lottery-based hunt before a vote on the bill is held, possibly as soon as Friday.
Earlier this month, another measure, House Bill 7051, was advanced by the Committee on Public Safety and Security to require the state to develop a bear management strategy, though it does not address hunting specifically. That bill is currently awaiting a fiscal analysis.
Connecticut is in the minority of states without a managed bear hunt. Hunting is currently allowed everywhere else in New England, with the exception of Rhode Island.
While black bears are native to Connecticut, their numbers dwindled for more than a century due to the extensive clear-cutting of forests for farmland and other human endeavors.
Beginning in the 1980s, scientists began recording a comeback that has since spread to every corner of the state, even in dense cities such as New Haven and Hartford.
That recovery is now at risk of backsliding as a result of the public’s souring sentiment towards bears, according to Hawley, who explained that he has gotten a sense of that shift in the thousands of calls he fields each year from people reporting bear sightings.
“I have residents that would call me and say ‘I saw a bear, I’m excited,'” Hawley said. “Now they call me and they’re like, ‘I’m sick of it, get this bear out of my yard.’ It’s kind of sad to see that happening.”

Mark Mullet, when he was running for governor. He's now running to be mayor of Issaquah after retiring from the Legislature. (Photo courtesy of Mark Mullet gubernatorial campaign)Contributions started rolling in within days of Mark Mullet launching his campaign for Issaquah mayor last December. By the end of the month, his haul was nearly $5,000.
But Mullet may have to surrender that cash to the city because he violated an Issaquah law that says candidates can only fundraise in the same calendar year as the election for the office they seek. He jumped the gun.
Mullet, the ex-state senator who ran unsuccessfully for governor last year, needed to wait until Jan. 1 since the mayor’s race is on the November ballot. As a penalty, he may be ordered to hand over the entirety of those December contributions – $4,478.34 – to the city treasury.
A hearing on the matter is set for 9 a.m. April 11 in Issaquah Municipal Court.
“There’s no dispute of the facts. We’re going to do whatever the judge tells us,” said Mullet, who served on the Issaquah City Council from 2010 to 2013. “We weren’t hiding anything. We were not aware of any city in the state having a rule like this.”
Mullet and City Councilwoman Lindsey Walsh are the only announced mayoral candidates thus far. Walsh is the council president and has served on the nonpartisan body since 2019. Walsh, a Democrat, supported Bob Ferguson in the gubernatorial race but Ferguson has endorsed Mullet in the mayoral race.
The Issaquah City Council passed the ordinance in May 2009 and it took effect on June 1 of that year. In addition to restricting when contributions can be collected, it imposed a $500 cap on donations.
That same year, Mullet won his seat on the city council. He said he recalled the discussion on the city law focused on the contribution limit, not the timing for collections.
On Wednesday, Walsh said she knew the rule and had to explain to supporters in December why she was not soliciting contributions until the new year. 
“I think it’s important that if somebody is going to lead the city, they respect and follow the laws,” she said. “That is the way I am running my campaign.”
Waylon Menzia, a community activist, filed a complaint with the city on Feb. 4, listing the dates and amounts of 12 contributions made to Mullet in December. Menzia noted the timing violated provisions of Chapter 1.30 of Issaquah Municipal Code.
A police report says an officer reviewed campaign finance filings with the state Public Disclosure Commission and tallied $4,478 in contributions between Dec. 12 and 31.
On Feb. 13, Lynn Moberly, the city’s prosecuting attorney, filed a complaint in Issaquah Municipal Court accusing Mullet of “the civil violation of Collecting Election Contributions Before Election Cycle.”
“I was aware of the timeline in the code,” Menzia said this week. “Even though the monetary amount is not very much, it should be a reminder that you need to follow the rules and regulations of the place you hope to represent.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mark-mullet-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Illustration by Alex Cochran for New Jersey Monitor)The most recent addition to the Republican race to replace Gov. Phil Murphy next year says he is a staunch conservative driven to run because of his disgust over the decision-making of state lawmakers now in power.
Justin Barbera, 44, a contractor from Burlington County, joins four other Republicans hoping to land their party’s nomination in the June 10 primary.
“The reason I decided to run is just being so frustrated with how it was operating and how we’re being so heavily taxed, and yet we get nothing for it,” he said.
He’s on the further-right side of the party, as a Trump loyalist who cites his Christian faith and military upbringing as guiding principles. He attended military school and is the son of military careerists.
As a father of three young children, he says education is one of his top priorities. He accused schools of pushing agendas and fostering students’ reliance on artificial intelligence and digital tools rather than focusing on fundamentals and encouraging students to develop independent thinking.
“The children are learning how to operate all these AI devices, and they’re not being taught how to come up with the answer on their own without using the computer,” Barbera said. “The way we’re teaching the children is a lazier way to do it, a way we’ve never done it in the past.”
Parents also should “have the first say” on any issues that arise with their children at school, he added.
“There’s no way that we should be promoting these very left views of what they want to be with their gender,” he said. “That should never come up in the school.”
He also lists as campaign priorities protecting gun rights and strengthening government accountability, especially when it comes to corruption and misappropriation of public money.
He has long supported Trump, praising him as a patriot. He predicts a Republican will win the governor’s race in November.
“If you look historically, you’ll see that New Jersey has went left and right consistently,” he said. “So I do have a lot of faith in the red wave, and New Jersey, I believe, will be turning red this November cycle.”
This race is Barbera’s second run for public office.
He ran last year, under a third party called Join the Revolution, for a U.S. House seat in the 3rd Congressional District, coming in last in the six-person race with less than 1% of the vote. The winner, Rep. Herb Conaway Jr., won with 53%.
The other GOP gubernatorial candidates expected to be on the primary ballot are state Sen. Jon Bramnick, former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, former Englewood Cliffs Mayor Mario Kranjac, and former radio show host Bill Spadea.
Murphy, a two-term Democrat, is limited from seeking a third term in November.

The Senate had just defeated an amendment to the bill offered by state Sen. Nick Schroer, a Republican from Defiance, to make some records from peer review proceedings available for lawsuits alleging deliberate acts against patients.
The amendment was needed, he said, to open up records of sexual assaults and other criminal acts.

Defeat of the amendment offended Democratic state Sen. Tracy McCreery of Olivette, and she was discussing the defeat with state Sen. Stephen Webber of Columbia when he dropped the accusation.
“There are sexual predators who work in this building,” Webber said. “There are powerful people who know who those people are and are protecting them. That is happening right now.”
Webber said he could not reveal the identity of the person he was accusing nor could he reveal any details of where in the Capitol the person worked or the position of the person who told him of the problem.
He had promised the victims confidentiality, he said.
McCreery said she, too, was aware of the problem, and understood the desire of the victim to remain anonymous.
“I am respectful of that as well,” McCreery said. “But I’m also very careful with my group of people.”
Interviewed after the Senate adjourned, Webber said he could not give any more details. When lawmakers are in session, there are executive branch officials and staff, legislators and staff, lobbyists, contract cleaning crews and representatives of the media working in the Capitol Building.
“If the victims wanted me to say something, I would,” Webber said. “If they wanted me to name names, I would. The victims don’t want me to, so I’m not going to.”
The bill, sponsored by Sen. Rusty Black, a Republican from Chillicothe, would create new training requirements for ambulance district board members in addition to making emergency medical personnel subject to the peer review process.
Schroer said the peer review process, which is completely confidential under state law, is being used to hide sexual mistreatment of patients and the response of employers.
“They are using this old, archaic statute that was meant for good, and finding that if they put anything into the system they can conceal it,” Schroer said after the Senate adjourned for the day.
Schroer said he was not aware of the accusations discussed by McCreery and Webber.
In her discussion with Webber, McCreery noted that victims of sexual assault had been visiting with lawmakers during the day to advocate for stronger laws.
The review process is being used to conceal too much, she said.
“When this process, this formal peer review process, has been worked and twisted enough that it’s now being used to hide allegations of sexual assault and sexual abuse, that is wrong,” she said. “Why are we willing to protect abusers?”
Webber said he had no answer to that question. That is when he began discussing the problem in the Missouri Capitol.
“I will say there’s certainly people, powerful people in this building,” Webber said, “who, beyond any doubt, I’m not alleging, I know for a fact, of powerful people in this building who are currently protecting sexual predators.”

(Photo courtesy of Sen. Tammy Baldwin's office)Drastic funding cuts at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have disrupted biomedical research, potentially setting back projects that could advance treatment and prevention efforts for cancer, Alzheimer’s disease and other major causes of illness and death, researchers and patients told Democratic Senators Wednesday.
“We are hearing from researchers, research institutions, and patients about the ongoing attacks on NIH,” said Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin), at the start of a  two-and-a-half hour forum she chaired as the ranking Democrat on a Senate subcommittee that oversees NIH.
“Understandably, most are reluctant to publicly speak out because the Trump administration is actively extorting institutions of all types, including major research universities,” Baldwin said. “This administration is seeking to dismantle the NIH and destroy the hopes of millions of Americans who are counting on life-saving treatments and cures.”
Witnesses who testified Wednesday warned that with projects being canceled in midstream, years of research data would likely be wasted and the role of the NIH as the world’s leading funder of biomedical research was at risk of being displaced.
NIH-funded advances have contributed to reductions in death rates from cancer, heart attacks and stroke in the U.S., said Dr. Monica Bertagnolli, who was director of NIH in the Biden administration and stepped down in January.
“This progress would not have happened without taxpayer support,” Bertagnolli said.
But in the first two months of the Trump administration, she said, more than 300 grants have been terminated and $1.5 billion in funding has been delayed.
In the last year, Bertagnolli told Sen. Patty Murray (D-Washington), NIH identified women’s health as “a high priority area” and “launched many new programs to really begin to address the deficiencies that we’ve had in women’s health.” Since the change in administration, however, “nothing new has moved forward.”
Dr. Sterling Johnson, the associate director of the Wisconsin Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center and a professor at the University of Wisconsin, said NIH funding over the last two decades helped make it possible to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease through blood tests and brain imaging scans rather than having to wait until after the patient’s death to be certain.
The NIH also funded clinical trials on surgical procedures involving the brain that can slow symptoms of the condition, he said, as well as trials on potential preventive therapies.
“These discoveries are changing the way we diagnose and treat Alzheimer’s and related causes of dementia,” Johnson said, but there is growing concern about how to sustain those gains.
In the last few months, he said, there have been delays in peer review and funding approvals for some projects.
“There are proposed cuts that threaten major ongoing studies, including treatment trials, risking the loss of millions of dollars already invested and setting our patients back,” Johnson said. With cuts threatening to slow down studies, “we will lose ground on hard-won progress.”
Senators as well as witnesses recounted stories of research that was cut off that involved investigations of health disparities.
Poorer counties across the country have “a persistent problem with poorer outcomes for all kinds of health issues,” Bertagnolli said, with maternal and fetal health among the most visible. “And without targeting those particular populations to understand the reasons behind the disparities, how can we ever even begin to overcome them?”
Research that considered members of the LGBTQ+ community and how illness affects racial and ethnic groups differently have been recurring targets in the Trump administration NIH, several said.
Dr. Whitney Wharton, an Alzheimer’s researcher at Emory University, said the Trump administration’s NIH has canceled research projects that she and other colleagues were conducting on Alzheimer’s in racial and ethnic minority groups, including LGBTQ+ people.
Previous research by her lab found Black Americans were 64% more likely than non-Hispanic whites to get Alzheimer’s disease and are living with the disease longer, she said.
“The systematic elimination of these high-risk” groups of patients from research “will only serve to increase the total number of [Alzheimer’s] patients every year,” Wharton said. Understanding those disparities is especially important, she added, because with shifting demographics racial and ethnic minority groups will represent the majority of the population.
“These terminations will have very grave consequences for patients, for families, for communities, and for taxpayers,” Wharton said.
Wharton read from a letter she received Feb. 28 that canceled another project she was in the midst of.
“It cites transgender issues,” Wharton said. “And it says, ‘Research programs based on gender identity are often unscientific, have little identifiable return on investment and do nothing to enhance the health of many Americans. Many such studies ignore rather than seriously examine biological realities. It is a policy of NIH not to prioritize these research programs.’”
Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-Rhode Island) said the cancelation of grants, such as one on mental health therapies for LGBTQ people and other on LGBTQ cancer survivors, appear to violate a federal court order blocking the NIH from withholding grants that were already in progress.
He urged panelists to let the senators know if funds aren’t released when they’re supposed to be. “We need to know when they’re jammed because you can’t believe anything that the Trump administration tells you about the progress of the funds unless the funds are actually flowing,” Whitehouse said.
Wharton and Johnson both said the turmoil for NIH-funded research was at risk of driving away a generation of researchers.
“These cuts are very, very devastating and they’re very scary for young investigators, for students, whether they’ve been affected or not,” Wharton said. “These young scientists may leave research altogether because they’re nervous.”

,New Jersey Monitor,2025-03-27 10:44:42+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,New Jersey must do more to stop illegal vapes,Special to the New Jersey Monitor,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/03/27/new-jersey-must-do-more-to-stop-illegal-vapes/,We cannot continue to allow the children of New Jersey to be the casualties of regulatory indifference to the sale of illegal flavored vapes.,"A box of confiscated vaping and tobacco products confiscated from middle-school students. (Photo by Darrell Ehrlick of the Daily Montanan).In 2020, federal officials and the state of New Jersey banned flavored vapes, a move meant to curb youth addiction to nicotine. But if you take a walk in one of our cities, step into a corner store, or glance at the discarded vape cartridges littering our streets, you’d find it hard to believe those bans exist.
The scent of cotton candy, blue raspberry, and fruit punch drifts across our streets, a telltale sign that these products are still everywhere, still easily accessible, and still hooking an entire generation on nicotine.
Even more alarming is that because these products are illegal, they exist almost entirely on the black market. That means there is no regulation, no oversight, and no quality control. We have no idea what toxic chemicals are inside these products. We have no way of knowing what our children are inhaling into their lungs. And yet, flavored vapes continue to flood our neighborhoods, especially in low-income and underserved communities, where oversight is weakest and enforcement is lax.
Corporate retailers — large chains that sell tobacco and vape products — face regular inspections to ensure compliance with the law. But the same can’t be said for the independent stores, often found in communities of color, where enforcement is sporadic at best. This isn’t just negligence, it’s targeted neglect. We know where these products are being sold. We know who they are being marketed to. And yet, enforcement remains an afterthought.
We cannot continue to allow the children of New Jersey to be the casualties of regulatory indifference. In January, Attorney General Matthew Platkin issued a letter to the 11,000 businesses licensed to sell tobacco and vaping products in the state, reminding them of the flavored vape ban and warning them to stop illegal sales immediately. That warning came four months after New Jersey fined 19 retailers $4,500 each for selling these illegal products. While this is a step in the right direction, it is not nearly enough. A slap-on-the-wrist fine will not deter businesses that are raking in cash from under-the-table vape sales. A strongly worded letter will not make black-market manufacturers stop targeting our kids.
If we want real change, we need real action. Just across the river in New York, Attorney General Letitia James is taking an aggressive stand. She is suing 13 major manufacturers, distributors, and retailers, demanding hundreds of millions of dollars in financial penalties for violating local and state law. Her lawsuit seeks not only to punish these bad actors but to hold them accountable for the public health crisis they have created. She is demanding damages, the recovery of profits made from illegal sales, and the establishment of an abatement fund to address the epidemic of youth vaping in New York. That is what serious action looks like. That is what we need in New Jersey.
The Attorney General’s Office must go beyond letters and fines. They should be actively investigating and prosecuting the manufacturers and distributors responsible for flooding our streets with these dangerous products. They should be directing law enforcement to inspect vape shops in our cities, where children pass these stores every day on their way to school.
This is a public health crisis. We know it. We see it. And yet, we are not treating it with the urgency it demands. Every flavored vape sold is another child at risk of addiction. Every store that continues to sell these products is making a mockery of the law. And every day that we fail to act, we put our youth at risk.
We need stronger enforcement, greater accountability, and a commitment to protecting our children. It is time to stop looking the other way. It is time for our state to take action. The health of our youth depends on it.

“Could you please send some illegal immigration raids to the businesses owned by Idaho state Rep. Stephanie Mickelson?” he wrote in an X post, misspelling Mickelsen’s last name and tagging Trump’s border czar Tom Homan. “She has been bragging about how many illegals her businesses employ.”
As his social media posts about contacting ICE began to rack up more than 2,000 shares, Spoon stressed that simply sharing on social media wasn’t enough. He was officially reporting Mickelsen’s farming businesses to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement tip line and website. 
“You can report her, too!” he wrote in a post festooned with flexing muscle and American flag emojis. 
Three days later, Mickelsen said, ICE agents appeared at Mickelsen Farms, where a slew of varieties of commercial and seed potatoes grow across thousands of acres in southeastern Idaho. 
“They just showed up out of the blue Friday morning,” said Mickelsen, a moderate Republican legislator and the former director for the Idaho Farm Bureau, a lobbying group for the agriculture industry.  
 Mickelsen Farms employee arrested by ICE

By Jan. 27, just one week into the second Trump administration, a Mickelsen Farms employee had been arrested by ICE. Records reviewed by InvestigateWest show that a Mexican immigrant who listed his employer as Mickelsen Farms on his Facebook page was being held at a Nevada Southern Detention Center in Las Vegas.
As the Trump administration attempts to carry out its campaign promise of mass deportations, it’s promoted the official ICE tip line as a vital part of its strategy. The phone tip line was so overwhelmed the day after Trump’s inauguration, Spoon wrote on X, that he hung up and submitted a tip on the ICE website instead. 
Some on the right have wielded threats of ICE reports as kind of a gloating taunt — a way of rubbing Trump’s election in the faces of illegal immigrants and anyone who supports them. A postcard sent to a Californian immigration nonprofit, for example, touted the ICE tip line with the words “Have your bags packed — Trump’s coming” written on the return address line.

But Spoon targeting a Republican state legislator by calling up ICE is particularly noteworthy – and all the more so because ICE responded within days. 
“It’s so ripe for abuse,” Chris Thomas, a Colorado-based attorney with 28 years of experience practicing immigration law, said about the use of the federal tip line.  “We’ve got the government under enormous pressure to respond to every tip they receive. … It’s just very clear that at all levels, this is a full assault on undocumented people in the country.”
Spoon, who moved to Boise from San Francisco in 2019 to work remotely as a loss prevention specialist, and Mickelson, a state legislator who is one of the biggest potato producers in southeast Idaho, are on opposite ends of the state’s Republican Party. And immigration is a particularly incendiary flashpoint: Mickelsen argues migrants are an essential part of the agricultural economy, while Spoon portrays both illegal immigrants and legal refugees as a sinister foreign invasion force.
Mickelsen had beaten back attempts by the hard right to defeat her in a primary — and even strip her of the Republican label. But Spoon’s tactics represented a new avenue of attack. For farm owners, it raises the possibility that speaking out — or running for office or backing the wrong bill — could trigger a political enemy to try to call down an ICE raid. 
Mickelsen knows who the employee is, that he’s a father of three and that his criminal record was what got him deported. But even now, she said, she doesn’t exactly know the exact nature of the man’s immigration status during the time he worked for her family business. Employers of migrants can face legal risks if they inquire too aggressively into the immigration statuses of their employees.
Immigration is a complicated topic, Mickelsen wrote in a statement to InvestigateWest, but using the issue to “bully individuals and businesses trying to navigate complicated and often competing employee documentation laws is a disgusting and reprehensible way to act and should not be tolerated by anyone.”
She’s unsettled. She removed the names of her businesses from her campaign site, believing it would be unfair to subject her family to the same level of nastiness that politicians have come to expect. 
“I’m being way more cautious in the bills that I’m standing up against, because I’m afraid of being targeted,” Mickelsen said. “Which makes me a less effective legislator for my community right now.” 
 ICE arrests increase during second Trump administration

In early January, Homan, Trump’s pick for border czar, floated the immigration tip line as a “fresh idea.” 
“I want a place where American citizens can call and report,” he told NBC News. “We need to take care of the American people.” 
ICE, to be clear, has had a tip line for over two decades. 
“The difference is, in many ways, the tip line in the past was a black hole,” Thomas said. “People would make tips and usually nothing would ever come of it.” 
Thomas said immigration tips are always prone to be taken advantage by those with scores to settle — abused by bitter exes and business rivals. In the past, he’s defended at least three companies — a janitorial service, an agricultural company and a bakery — who were reported to ICE by competitors. But after Trump’s second inauguration, he said, the entire framework of the federal government was refocused on immigration-related offensives. 
“They have to arrest certain numbers of undocumented people each week,” Thomas said. “They need to serve employers each week with notices of inspection. … They’re even under pressure to conduct raids.”
Effectively, Thomas said, ICE was being forced to rely on the tip line and the online tip website to fill its quotas. ICE tips had been transformed from mostly inert to a live weapon. 
While overall deportations have fallen due to fewer border crossings, Reuters reported, ICE arrests surged during the first week of Trump’s administration. In the weeks since, the agency indicated there’s been so much ICE activity that it’s too busy to provide many specifics about ICE activity. 
Asked about Mickelsen, an ICE spokesperson said that because of their “operational tempo” and increased interest in their agency, they were not able to respond to queries about rumors or routine operations. 
The news of actual ICE raids, along with the string of false reports and hoaxes, have made migrant farmworkers afraid. No matter their immigration status, many don’t want to come to work, much less attend protests or share their stories publicly.

“Nobody’s wanting to raise their head and speak up,” said Ben Tindall, executive director of Save Family Farming, a group representing farmers in neighboring Washington state.  “Regardless of whether they’re here legally or not, they’re afraid they’re going to get a target on their back and ICE is going to come knocking on their door.”
Freddy Cruz, who tracks extremists with the Western States Center, said he’s seen a surge of white nationalist groups like the White Lives Matter Montana chapter encouraging people to report unauthorized immigrants to ICE.
“The ICE information tip line has come up more and more as a tactic,” Cruz said. “Almost like weaponizing a government agency to try to intimidate not just undocumented immigrants, but also organizations that might be providing immigrant-rights services to folks.” 
Along with the Californian nonprofit, three offices of the United Farm Workers union were anonymously sent postcards featuring the phrases “Report Illegal Aliens” and “There is nowhere to hide,” along with the ICE tip line. 
At Arizona State University, the College Republicans United club teamed up with a Hitler-saluting neo-Nazi to sell club T-shirts with the phrase “ICE Volunteer” and began urging students to report “their criminal classmates to ICE for deportation.”
But Spoon represents a more influential and mainstream example of this trend. Last year, Spoon was the chairman of the Idaho Freedom PAC, the political action committee linked to the political machine of the Idaho Freedom Foundation, a historically influential think tank that purports to separate true conservatives from “Republicans in Name Only” — or “RINOS.”
In the last two decades, more radical Republicans like Spoon immigrated to Idaho from left-leaning states like California, flooding the local Republican parties. Many of them cared less about the bottom line of Idaho’s big businesses than culture wars and conservative purity — and immigration was a topic they were willing to drench with invective.
On X, Spoon accused those who argue that migrant workers are necessary for the region’s agriculture of being willing to pay anything “for cheaper blueberries” — “their daughters raped by illegals, their young people unemployed, foreign slaves exploited, drugs & crime flooding their communities.” 
When Idaho Congressman Mike Simpson co-sponsored a bipartisan bill to expand the temporary farmworker visa program and give migrants a path to permanent legal status, Spoon accused Simpson of a “literal act of treason against the U.S., facilitating a foreign invasion.” Spoon argues he’s not anti-immigrant — his wife is a legal immigrant from Germany — just anti illegal-immigration. 
“Americans across a broad spectrum of politics are really fed up with the illegal immigration issue,” he said. “The tone has definitely changed there, and people’s willingness to confront that issue has changed.”
The reactions he’s received for calling ICE on Mickelsen’s businesses, Spoon claimed, have been “overwhelmingly positive.”
But Mickelsen said she’s heard from a lot of legislators who were “completely disgusted” by his tactics.  
“It’s probably very disturbing for them to see this kind of treatment of a fellow legislator,” Mickelsen said. 
 Unauthorized immigrants are likely working for Idaho businesses

Spoon has repeatedly accused Mickelsen of being a “Plantation Mistress,” taunting her that “we’re gonna take your farm slaves away from you.”
But he told InvestigateWest that it’s a “mischaracterization” to accuse him of going after Mickelsen. She’s the one to blame for the reports, he argued. 
“Her own testimony drew attention to herself,” he said.

Last March, during the debate about Idaho House Bill 753, intended to give local law enforcement and judges the ability to enforce immigration laws, Mickelsen bristled at what she felt was the denigration of the foreign-born workforce by her fellow legislators. 
Pointing to the production chain involving everyone from construction companies to the hospitality industry, and “every food processor, probably, in the state,” Mickelsen declared that “if you think that you haven’t been touched by an illegal immigrant’s hands in some way … you are kidding yourself.” 
To Spoon, it was practically a signed confession. 
“While it is not reasonable to think that she is able to speak for every food processor, it is reasonable to think that she can speak for the food processor that she owns,” Spoon said. 
To Mickelson, she wasn’t saying anything that hasn’t been widely discussed: There likely are many unauthorized immigrants working for Idaho businesses. The Center for Migration Studies, a New York-based think tank focused on immigration issues, estimated that in 2021 there were roughly 10,000 unauthorized immigrants working in Idaho agriculture alone.
Mickelsen told InvestigateWest that their farming operation relies on the legal temporary seasonal guest worker program to hire migrant laborers — a program that has grown by nearly two-thirds since 2016. 
“It would be wonderful if you could hire a domestic workforce. But the problem is, people don’t like to do farming jobs,” Mickelsen said. 
Her son, Andrew, Mickelsen Farms’ chief operations manager, said in a statement that “we would never knowingly employ an undocumented worker” and that “our business cooperates with all authorities and supports our government’s efforts to secure the border and keep Americans safe.”
“We follow all applicable federal and state laws to stay in compliance,” Rep. Mickelsen said. “We want to be good neighbors.”
Farm owners like Mickelsen are caught in a pincer between two federal agencies, said Thomas, the immigration attorney: Either accept documents at face value — some of which may be fakes from unauthorized immigrants — and risk punishment by Homeland Security, or question documents too closely and risk being sued by the “wildly aggressive” Immigrant and Employee Rights division of the Department of Justice.
Ultimately, Mickelsen voted for HB 753. But that did little to appease her critics. 
“Should we post RINO Stephanie Mickelsen’s (District 32) pro-illegal alien video every week until she is voted out of office?” asked the Stop Idaho Rino’s X account.
After Spoon bragged on X about reporting Mickelsen to ICE, one conservative Idaho commenter mockingly envisioned ICE listening to the “passion-filled speech she said on the House floor.”
“Bet once she talks they drop their badges and quit on the spot,” he snarked.
Spoon replied with wink and grin emojis. 
Mickelsen is not the only legislator Spoon has gone after. 
In September, Spoon targeted Rep. Jack Nelsen for the family dairy he’d worked on for decades, claiming on X that “Plantation slaves at the Nelsen Dairy  in Jerome, ID are ILLEGAL immigrants.” (Nelsen no longer personally has a stake in the business.)
Spoon said he’s reported only Mickelsen’s businesses to ICE “so far,” but pressed about whether he planned to report others, would only say “I’m going to hold onto that for now.” 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
 Serving in the Idaho Legislature at what cost? 

For Mickelsen, Spoon’s actions spurred restless nights.
“I laid in bed at night for two nights in a row, and I said to myself, ‘Am I willing to jump on this same bandwagon in the name of political theater, and not say anything? Not say ‘wait a minute, this is wrong?’” Mickelsen said. “Or am I just going to be silent?”
In her interviews with InvestigateWest, Mickelsen sounded energetically defiant at moments — floating the possibility of taking legal action. 
Just a few days after being publicly reported to ICE, Mickelsen took another risky political stand on immigration: opposing a bill to require businesses to use E-Verify, a federal website intending to verify whether workers are legal. Mickelsen says that the program is plagued by inaccuracy, inconsistency and delays. 
But at other moments, her frustration and exhaustion shone through. 
“You have to say to yourself, as this rancor gets worse, at what point is it worth it for me to serve in the Legislature?” Mickelsen said. “If my family and everybody around me is at risk?”
On social media, Spoon has often relished the idea of making Idaho so miserable for “leftists” that they leave the state entirely. 
That strategy sounds familiar to Mike Colson, chair of the GOP Central Committee in southeastern Idaho’s Bonneville County. Mickelsen helped Colson lead a wave of moderates last year to take back their local Republican party from hardliners with a similar approach to Spoon.
“That’s part of their playbook for these legislators, to make it so miserable and so uncomfortable for them that hopefully they won’t run again next time,” Colson said. “That’s what they’re hoping for. That’s what they want. They want us to quit.”
Mickelsen’s concern goes beyond any risk to her family’s business — it’s the worry that someone reading the vitriol online could do something drastic. She’s been reading a lot about white nationalists lately. 
“I have to actually think about my physical safety in a way that I probably haven’t the entire time I’ve been in the Legislature,” Mickelsen said. 
She said she was advised to carry a gun — she has a concealed carry permit. But she worried that if the gun was wrested away from her by a larger attacker, it could ultimately put her at more risk.
Today, Colson suspects Spoon’s ICE reports were part of  “a coordinated attempt to send a chilling message to a number of persons that may not see eye-to-eye with some of their political allies,” he said. 
But the immigrant ICE arrested from Mickelsen Farms was vulnerable for another reason as well. The Trump administration had been touting its focus on arresting “criminal aliens,” unauthorized immigrants with criminal records. 
In November 2022, the Mickelsen Farms employee, Sajid Soto, had previously been charged with battery and drug possession. According to the Bonneville County Sheriff’s Office, he admitted to choking his wife during an argument and then, while being booked in the local jail, officers found a tiny amount of methamphetamine in his wallet. 
Even a migrant with permanent resident status can lose that status as a consequence of a domestic violence conviction, Thomas said. 
Soto had served his jail time, the restraining order had been lifted, and his felony possession conviction — which can cause a temporary agricultural visa to be revoked — had been dismissed after the farmworker completed probation. 
“Now you have three children that are American citizens who are entitled to social benefits because their dad was supporting them and will not be any longer,” Mickelsen said. 
“Works at Mickelsen Farms,” remains on the dad’s Facebook page. Scroll down, and his cover photo from six years ago, taken through the rain-flecked windshield of his truck, shows a long row of green-and-gold John Deere tractors and combines lined up on a stretch of farm soil.
“Listos para sacar papas,” he wrote. 
Ready to pull out potatoes.

(Photo by GracedBytheLight/Getty Images)In the 1990s and 2000s, as industrial poultry production grew in eastern Oklahoma, chicken litter became increasingly used as fertilizer on area crop farms, leading to complaints that key water systems were being polluted by poultry litter.
The waste leached into nearby waterways, elevating phosphorus levels that then depleted oxygen, caused algae growth, damaged the fish population and strained the nearly 20 utility systems that rely on the Illinois River Watershed for drinking water, according to news outlet Investigate Midwest.
To remediate this now chronic problem, then-Attorney General Drew Edmondson sued in 2005 several large agricultural producers, including Tyson, Cargill, and Simmons Foods, that commonly contract with Oklahoma’s poultry farms. A trial was held in 2009, but it took 14 more years before U.S. District Judge Gregory Frizzell ruled for the state, agreeing that the poultry companies and more specifically, the litter on poultry farms or litter removed and used for fertilizer on nearby crop farms, were to blame for the high contaminate levels. He also criticized Oklahoma lawmakers for not doing enough to protect rivers and lakes from poultry litter pollution. Subsequently, a court-ordered mediation failed.
A hearing was held in December to assess whether the environmental conditions in the watershed have changed since the original trial and whether the companies’ practices continue to contribute to pollution.
At that hearing multiple witnesses testified that water pollution from chicken litter remains a problem.
“To help reverse the phosphorus pollution in the waters of the (Illinois River Watershed), we have to stop making the problem worse. That means we need to stop the land application of poultry waste,” wrote Gregory Scott, a scientist with the Oklahoma Conservation Commission, in testimony presented to Frizzell. A final order from the judge is still pending.
Rather than taking steps to reign in the clout of the growing poultry industry and protect the public, Oklahoma lawmakers have chosen to further deregulate and shield it from legal attacks. The state now allows large poultry farms to avoid a more restrictive registration process and construct buildings that house thousands of chickens closer to homes and neighborhoods.
In 2023, Oklahoma’s Republican-majority Legislature and governor passed House Bill 2053, which would dismiss a protest against a water-use permit for a farm if the protest is “based solely on the industry or entity applying to use the water.” The legislation’s clear intent, to which even the bill’s author, Republican state Sen. Brent Howard admitted, was to make it harder for people to oppose large poultry operations. Senate Bill 136, which was introduced in the 2025 session and called for a moratorium on these mega factory farms, was killed in committee.
Senate Bill 1424, which was signed into law in 2024, has been the most significant step toward protecting poultry corporations. That legislation now forbids property owners in the Illinois River Watershed, whose lands and surface waterways have been polluted by runoff from poultry litter, from pursuing legal action against contracted poultry growers unless an enforcement action has been taken by the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food, and Forestry. The law also provides legal immunity to poultry corporations – the same ones targeted in the 2005 suit – from future lawsuits over pollution caused by chicken waste.
The measure gives Big Ag and its corporate lobbyists license to despoil our natural resources and wreak havoc on our region’s air and waterways. This has the potential to threaten the public health of our communities and the safety of their drinking water. Where water has been contaminated it will require cities and towns that use it to spend more on treatments or seek other water sources.
Critics of this legislation have noted that it only benefits out-of-state companies who profit at the expense of Oklahoma’s rivers and lakes and does not protect Oklahoma farmers.
Nearly all chickens raised in the United States are under production contracts between poultry processors and farmers. Big Ag contracts with farmers can be problematic, potentially leading to unfair terms, reduced farmer autonomy, and increased financial risk for farmers. Over the length of a contract, the buying power of a contract farmer’s wages may shrink by more than 20%.
Lax regulations against industrial poultry farms are a gift to big agribusiness. Since our state lawmakers seem unwilling to serve as a bulwark for our environment and the economic and public health of our rural communities, we may have to depend on the courts.
Judge Frizzell has said he is weighing pollution-control requirements. Since our legislators seem loath to hold Big Ag to account, let’s hope the judge comes through.

The Trump administration has eliminated more than $1 billion for local foods programs, which has left food banks and school systems scrambling. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)For the Day Eagle Hope Project, federal money has helped volunteers deliver fresh produce and meat to families in need across the remote Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in northern Montana — while putting cash into the hands of farmers, ranchers and meat processors.
The nonprofit generally has less than $300,000 to spend per year. So the $200,000 from a U.S. Department of Agriculture local food buying program significantly raised both the quantity and quality of the food it could distribute.
“They were a major, major contributor to our food,” said Tescha Hawley, who directs the organization, which aims to improve physical, mental and spiritual health.
The USDA recently nixed more than $1 billion from two programs that helped food banks and school meal programs buy local foods, including $660 million for schoolchildren. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins recently described the programs as “nonessential.”
But the move has left hundreds of school systems and food banks reeling. They already face rising food prices and are struggling to help community members with growing food insecurity.

Created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs aimed to build more resilient supply chains of domestic food by connecting schools and food pantries with small ranches, farms and dairies. The program was initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but later expanded by the Biden administration.
The federal programs stimulated the purchase of locally grown fruits, vegetables, dairy and meats — benefiting both the smaller farmers who received fair market pay for their products and the organizations granted funds to buy high quality foods.
The noncompetitive grants sent hundreds of millions of dollars to all 50 states, the District of Columbia and 84 tribal governments, boosting business for more than 8,000 farmers and providing local food to almost as many food banks. The Trump administration is killing the programs, despite Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s campaign against processed food, which he says is “poisoning” Americans.
Without ongoing funding, Hawley said, she would have to rely on cheaper, less nutritious food.
“It’s simple, right? I can get a truck … in here with all highly processed food, no problem,” she said.
Schools are facing a similar challenge: While officials running breakfast and lunch programs would prefer to buy more local products, those are often expensive. And with underfunding, high food costs and labor struggles, school lunch programs are already stretched thin.
In Milan, Tennessee, the federal funds allowed the local school system to buy minimally processed beef from a local stockyard, and broccoli, purple hull peas, tomatoes and melons from local growers.
Vickie Dunaway, who supervises the school system’s food services, told the Tennessee Lookout the federal cuts mean “going backwards” on purchasing healthier foods.
“That will obviously have to be cut out, because our budget will not withstand being able to purchase local,” she said. “Purchasing local, minimally processed food is way more expensive than buying from a distributor.”
 A ‘devastating’ cut to food banks

Late last year, USDA said the programs had already spent more than $1 billion on local foods, and announced an expansion of the two programs with an additional $1.13 billion. USDA has killed that $1.13 billion expansion; it is still reimbursing the previously committed funds.
The Trump administration, which has sought to dramatically slash the size of the federal government, told recipients earlier this month that the programs “no longer effectuate the goals of the agency.”
In a statement to Stateline, the USDA said the current administration is “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
“The COVID era is over — USDA’s approach to nutrition programs will reflect that reality moving forward,” the statement said.










The only thing we’ll be able to do is just ration what little we have — to spread it as thinly as possible over the number of households we provide food to.


– Eric Cooper, president and CEO, San Antonio Food Bank


The nonpartisan National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, which represents the ag department leaders of all 50 states, last month lobbied the federal government to continue the local foods program with permanent funding and ease procurement regulations for school meal programs. Arkansas Secretary of Agriculture Wes Ward, president of the association, said in a statement that the local food programs aid both producers and consumers.

“Investing in local and regional food systems not only strengthens the connections between farmers and their local communities, it bolsters supply chain resiliency as well,” his statement read.
In New Mexico, the program allowed food banks to buy some 900,000 pounds of locally grown food from more than 200 farmers since 2023. Before the program was terminated, the state was expecting close to $3 million in additional funding, Source New Mexico reported.

Jill Dixon, executive director of The Food Depot in northern New Mexico, called the cuts “devastating.”
In Texas, the San Antonio Food Bank counted on USDA’s local food program to help round out the food boxes it provides to families in need. The food bank, which serves more than 100,000 people across 29 Texas counties, largely relies on donated foods from hotels, restaurants and grocery stores.
“The challenge is I might get peanut butter donated, but I don’t have the jelly, or I might have pasta donated, but I don’t have the marinara,” said Eric Cooper, president and CEO of the food bank. “This program allowed us to purchase those items that we didn’t get that then helped round out the food box, or really complement the food that was being donated to give families the ability to make meals.”
The program initially provided the food bank nearly $3 million in grant funding — about 20% of what the organization spends each year on bulk food purchases. It expected a similar amount this year, before USDA’s announcement.
Cooper said cuts come even as the need for assistance rises. Food prices have squeezed families, and mass layoffs of federal workers portend more demand for food assistance in the coming months, he said.
“And we’ll be caught in the middle. And you know, that’s an incredibly uncomfortable place to be. The only thing we’ll be able to do is just ration what little we have — to spread it as thinly as possible over the number of households we provide food to.”

 A boost for school lunches

For years, school meal programs have struggled with tight margins. Not only do they have to meet strict nutritional guidelines, but schools also face lagging reimbursement from the federal government and spend millions covering the cost of students’ unpaid meal debt.
At the 1,600-student Monticello School District in Arkansas, that debt is approaching $60,000.
So $50,000 from USDA’s local food program was a significant boost to the bottom line.
“That was such a help,” said Amanda West, the district’s child nutrition director.
The southeast Arkansas district used grant money to buy locally grown ground beef. The beef went into dishes including taco salad, meatloaf and spaghetti.
West said staff and students immediately noticed a difference in taste from conventionally purchased meats. And though the local product cost more, West said it also yielded more because it was not full of additives that cause the meat to shrink when cooked.
West, who is the president of the Arkansas School Nutrition Association, noted that her state is home to the nation’s highest rates of food insecurity.

West had hoped to see the local foods program help turn that tide by bringing more stability to school meal programs and growing the state economy by boosting local farmers, ranchers and distributors.
“We’re all upset about it. I hate that we’re not receiving it because grocery prices are 30, 40% higher than what they were a few years ago, and it really hurts our budget,” she said. “It helped a lot of districts, including mine, and it would be amazing if we could get it back.”
On top of the local foods program cuts, congressional Republicans are considering billions in potential cuts to free and reduced-price school meal programs — cuts the School Nutrition Association says could potentially affect millions of American students.
The federal government partially subsidizes breakfast, lunch and after-school snack programs at rates calculated by the income level of students’ families.
The School Nutrition Association, which represents 50,000 school meal providers across the country, said the school meals are the healthiest many American children receive. But that group says federal reimbursements are far from adequate, leaving members worried about the future of their meal programs.
In a recent association survey of more than 1,390 school meal directors, more than 90% reported serious or moderate concern over the financial sustainability of their school meal programs three years from now.

By establishing clear standards, WPD aims to “bring about an equitable balance between the civil rights and liberties of citizens and the needs of law enforcement to collect and disseminate Criminal Intelligence on the conduct of persons and groups who may be planning, engaged in, or about to be engaged in criminal activity,” the policy states. Versions of the policy, as well as emails detailing its creation, were obtained by Wisconsin Examiner through open records requests.
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The eight-page policy defines the difference between “information” and “criminal intelligence,” outlines appropriate channels for sharing that information, and establishes clear boundaries protecting individuals and groups. “Information” is defined as “raw unprocessed data that is unverified and unevaluated,” and only becomes “intelligence” once it’s been “systematically planned, collected, analyzed, and disseminated in an effort to anticipate, prevent, or monitor potential criminal activity for public safety purposes,” according to the policy. 
It stresses that such efforts must meet the threshold of “reasonable suspicion,” where a sworn law enforcement officer or investigator believes there is a “reasonable possibility” that a person or group is involved in “a definable criminal activity or enterprise.” Individuals or groups which become the focus of WPD’s intel-gathering activities must be those suspected of being involved in the planning, financing or organization of criminal acts, those suspected of being involved in criminal acts with “known or suspected crime figures,” or be the victims of those acts. 
The policy highlights that intelligence may not be gathered on individuals or groups based solely on:


An individual or group’s support of “unpopular causes”
Any membership of a protected class including race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, gender, pregnancy status, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, physical or mental disabilities, veteran status, genetic information or citizenship
Political affiliations
“Non-criminal personal habits” 

Any information gathered from confidential sources or electronic surveillance devices “shall be performed in a legally acceptable manner and in accordance with procedures,” the policy states. The policy also requires periodic review of intelligence by appropriate WPD staff to ensure the information is accurate, current, and remains relevant to the department’s goals. If it’s not, the policy states, the information should be purged. 
Lessons learned, and a new day
The intelligence policy was created with input from several key personnel within WPD including Lt. Joseph Roy, crime analyst Dominick Ratkowski, and Capt. Shane Wrucke. WPD Chief James MacGillis — who was formerly a Milwaukee PD drug intelligence and High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) officer — also had input in crafting the policy.
A WPD spokesperson wrote in an email statement that the city’s Police and Fire Commission, which oversees appointments, promotions and discipline of police and fire personnel, was not involved in establishing the policy. In April 2024, Ratkowski shared a final draft of the policy with Robert Bechtold, from the Madison Police Department. “Thanks for the SOP [Standard Operating Procedure],” emailed Bechtold, who was apparently looking for guidance on how to create such a policy. “I’m not looking forward to us building one,” he added. The Madison Police Department didn’t respond to a request for comment. 
Roy, Ratkowski, and Wrucke all have ties to WPD’s investigative division. Roy supervised the division’s dayshift and also serves as commander of the Milwaukee Area Investigative Team (MAIT), which focuses on officer-involved shootings and deaths. Ratkowski has worked at WPD since 2018, and was hired as the department’s first ever civilian crime analyst. Wrucke, like Roy, has past ties to both MAIT and WPD’s Special Operations Group (SOG), which focuses on covert surveillance, accessing phones, and drug investigations.

A WPD spokesperson explained in an email statement that the intel policy was created “to incorporate lessons learned, enhance transparency, and provide clear guidelines for intelligence gathering.” Those lessons likely stemmed from the protests of 2020, and the decisions made by investigators when WPD was still headed by former Chief Barry Weber. 
Following the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officers, marches against police abuse began in Milwaukee and Wauwatosa, where a former police officer had killed three people over a five-year period. Wauwatosa experienced months of daily non-violent protests which occasionally ended in standoffs with officers. In October 2020, Wauwatosa declared a curfew after the district attorney’s office announced that officer Joseph Mensah wouldn’t be charged in his third fatal shooting. Protesters were confronted by riot police, the National Guard and militarized federal law enforcement during the curfew. 
Journalists, protesters and lawyers later learned that WPD had created a list of nearly 200 people during the summer of protest. Ratkowski had called it a “target list” in an email to assisting agencies. WPD publicly stated that the list — which included dozens of protesters, members of the Cole family, their attorneys, elected officials, and the author of this story — included  witnesses, victims and  suspects in possible crimes that occurred at the protests. 
 
5.3.4 Criminal Intelligence Collection Analysis Distribution Policy – 24-18 (2)
 
Civil lawsuits revealed more about use of the list under Weber, who retired in 2021. Ratkowski in depositions explained that he began creating the list around June 2020, after Capt. Luke Vetter asked him to begin identifying active participants in the protests. Ratkowski gathered information from confidential law enforcement databases with access to drivers license information, home addresses, arrest records, and more. He combed social media accounts on Facebook and Tinder, sometimes using fake Facebook accounts registered as “confidential informants.”
Simply being tagged in a protest-related social media post could get someone on the list, Ratkowski said in a deposition. He agreed with attorneys when asked whether “mere affiliation with a protest” was enough, and confirmed that threatening violence or committing a crime was not required. Ratkowski said that if a superior asked him to make a list of every member of the Socialist Party he would, “because I would assume that he [Capt. Vetter] would have asked me to do something that wasn’t useless.” The attorney questioning Ratkowski responded, “I’m not asking whether it’s useful or useless, I’m asking whether it’s constitutional or not,” to which Ratkowski replied, “I can’t make that determination.”

The federal lawsuit eventually went to trial, where a jury ruled that WPD had not violated specific privacy laws related to obtaining and sharing drivers license information. 
In an emailed statement, WPD said that “a key objective” of the new intelligence policy “was to clearly define the distinction between information and intelligence, ensuring officers understand when data becomes actionable. It applies to all WPD staff involved in intelligence creation and upholds protections against intelligence gathering based on legally protected characteristics.” The department added that, “though journalists are not explicitly mentioned, the department remains committed to safeguarding First Amendment rights for all individuals. Above all, the Wauwatosa Police Department prioritizes transparency and strengthening trust within the community.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_6657-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Photo: John Partipilo)A bill giving public school districts the right to refuse enrollment to children without legal immigration status advanced in the Tennessee House Wednesday as a packed audience disrupted debate by standing and singing spiritual music in protest.
The panel of lawmakers swiftly cast their votes 11-7 in favor of the measure and exited the room as people rose to sing “Jesus Loves the Little Children,” ending a contentious hour-and-a-half hearing.  Three Republicans joined the committee’s four Democrats in casting a “no” vote.
The bill (HB793/SB836) by Sen. Bo Watson of Hixson and House Majority Leader William Lamberth of Portland — both Republicans — would give public school districts the option of verifying student immigration status and charging tuition of students who cannot prove they are legal residents. 
Alternatively, school districts could refuse to enroll children without proof of legal residency.
The bill has drawn large protests for weeks as it has wound through the legislative process. It was significantly amended Wednesday, stripping an initial requirement that all Tennessee public schools must verify the immigration status of every student and, instead, making checks optional for public school districts. The amended version of the bill would also exempt students refused admission by their local public school as a result of their immigration status from the state’s truancy laws.

Both of the bill’s sponsors have said they hope the measure could serve as a test case for the Supreme Court to revisit its 1982 Plyler v. Doe decision that established that all children in the United States have the right to a public education regardless of their immigration status.
“What we’re allowing (schools) to do is what Plyler prohibited them from doing,” Lamberth said Wednesday. 
Citing increasing numbers of English language learners in Tennessee schools, Lamberth said the measure is necessary due to years of federal inaction in controlling the nation’s borders, leaving states to bear the burden of educating children whose parents “skipped the line.”
“The families that we are talking about, the parents we are talking about have absolutely gone around that process,” he said. 
The bill drew fierce pushback from Democrats on the House Education panel.
“I think we all heard it here today, what this bill is really about,” said Rep. Sam McKenzie, a Knoxville Democrat, who called the legislation a “bully bill to try to undo the law of the land.”
“We have for over 40 years abided by this decision… because it’s the right thing,” he said. “We should not put our children — the least of us, those that cannot do for themselves — in the middle of an adult battle.”
A fiscal analysis of the bill noted it could jeopardize over $1 billion in federal education funding to the state. The bill will next be heard April 1 in the Senate Finance, Ways and Means Committee. 
A separate bill that would have similarly required children without legal immigration status to pay public school tuition, and financial institutions to check immigration status of customers seeking to wire funds overseas, failed Wednesday in a House Banking and Consumer Affairs committee.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMMIGRATION-VOTE003-1024x665.jpeg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

“These accounts used fake pictures that showed my face on someone else’s semi-nude body. They also made fake videos that used my face and my name to try to convince people it was the real me,” Smith testified in the Tennessee House Criminal Justice Subcommittee Wednesday. 
Smith is now pushing lawmakers to outlaw non-consensual “deepfakes” — videos, photographs and audio files created by artificial intelligence that depict things that did not occur without consent from the people depicted.
In the last several months, Smith said dozens — if not hundreds — of imposter accounts have posed as her, posting about fake contests and direct-messaging fans and friends asking for help, promising sexual acts and soliciting money for hotel stays.
“I felt humiliated and scared,” Smith said. “I didn’t know what to do or how to fight it, and I didn’t know how to protect the viewers and the people that trusted me online from being subject to this kind of extortion.”
A bill brought by Nashville Democratic Rep. Jason Powell would make it a felony to publish, or threaten to publish, fake AI-images with the intent to damage a person’s reputation or cause them harm. If the images are deemed likely to facilitate violence or interfere with governmental conduct, the creator would face additional jail time. 
The bill would also allow victims to file civil suits against the deepfake creator and seek a restraining order or injunction to prevent the continued display of the images or videos.
Smith left her job of nine years at NewsChannel 5 in January. The station told The Tennessean in January that it tried to negotiate to renew Smith’s contract, but those negotiations were not successful.
The 43-year-old mother of two said she has tried without much success to report the accounts to various social media platforms, but “it’s like whack-a-mole.”
“As a public servant, this has devastated my life’s work,” Smith said. “I have been a meteorologist in Middle Tennessee for nine years, and it is not a glamorous job. I did what I did because I believed that I could help people. I believed that when severe weather was happening, I could save people’s lives, and so then to have my face, my reputation, the trust that this community put in me now being weaponized to hurt the very people that I spent my entire career trying to protect — I mean, it essentially stole what I’ve worked so hard to create.”

(Photo: John Partipilo)Republican senators are putting Tennessee school board and superintendent associations in their cross-hairs after a bruising fight this year over the governor’s private-school voucher bill.
Sen. Adam Lowe, a Calhoun Republican, is sponsoring Senate Bill 2017, which would prohibit school districts from joining organizations that use public funds or dues to pay lobbyists. The bill, which Lowe postponed Tuesday for discussion until 2026, clearly targets Tennessee’s school board and superintendent associations.
In addition to the legislation, Republican members of the Senate Education Committee notified the Tennessee School Boards Association last week that it’s asking the group to voluntarily provide all communications between the association and its members regarding private-school vouchers by April 5.
A letter signed by Senate Education Chairman Dawn White and several other Republican members of the committee on March 19 says the discussion surrounding Gov. Bill Lee’s plan “created a situation where a great deal of information concerning the bill’s purpose, provisions, and elements were misrepresented to local communities, boards, councils and commissions… we understand that opinions may vary in these contentious moments, facts do not.”

The Republican lawmakers want to know how the association communicated with its members to cut through “any speculation and misunderstanding that might have occurred during the public discourse” on the bill.
The voucher bill narrowly passed the House and Senate during a February special session called by Gov. Bill Lee, enabling the state to set up a program to give $7,000 scholarships to students statewide to enroll in private schools, costing about $220 million annually. Roughly two-thirds of the students who are expected to receive the state money are enrolled in private schools already.
Part of the bill, which Lee signed into law a month ago, contains a provision to give teachers a $2,000 bonus.
White said Wednesday the school boards association might have told its members wrongly that boards had to approve a resolution saying they support the voucher program to receive the bonus.
“We just want to get to the bottom of this and see what really was told, what wasn’t told,” White said. 
Lowe’s companion bill, which is sponsored by Republican Rep. Mary Littleton of Dickson, passed the House Education Committee Tuesday but now is on hold.
Lowe said he didn’t want associations whose members paid dues using public funds to use “taxpayer dollars to lobby against taxpayer interests.”
“They’re using general fund money paid for by taxpayers, and they’d be lobbying against the interests of the very people who gave them the money,” Lowe said. 
Lowe denied that his bill targets the school boards association, though he said it was “apparent” the group opposed the governor’s bill.
“I don’t think it’s punitive at all, but it is revelatory,” he added.
Tennessee has dozens of government-affiliated groups that lobby the legislature, ranging from cities that hire their own lobbyists to associations representing mayors and sheriffs. 
Republicans have long complained about government-affiliated groups using public funds for lobbying, including state departments. But these groups have argued that without the ability to lobby, business interests would have the upper hand in dealing with lawmakers.
Lowe said under his bill that the school board and superintendent associations would need private funds or some other “pot of money” to continue lobbying the legislature.
Representatives of the Tennessee School Boards Association and Tennessee Organization of School Superintendents could not be reached for immediate comment Wednesday.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Adam-Lowe-1-1024x678.jpeg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The ongoing legislative fight to allow lawsuits against Nebraska schools for alleged negligence in cases of child sexual assault faces a tough road in 2025, as indicated by a Wednesday hearing.
Legislative Bill 156, by State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, was the result of months of work to find “the most narrow approach possible” to revive a successful measure that passed 28-17 on the last day of the 2024 legislative session. Gov. Jim Pillen vetoed the bill after lawmakers had adjourned, arguing the measure was too broad and would unfairly burden taxpayers. Lawmakers had no opportunity to respond.
Conrad said LB 156, and a second proposal that mirrors the 2024 bill, represent a “promise” to a Lincoln family to keep fighting for the issue: Loree, Roger and Taylor Woods.

Taylor Woods was sexually assaulted in 2016 while in a program through the Lincoln Public Schools. Her mother, Loree, had frequently testified urging letting families sue, even though it wouldn’t have affected the Woods family. Loree and her husband, Roger, died in a September accident.
“We shouldn’t afford special favors and protection because little kids are getting raped or sexually assaulted at schools … on public grounds or in a public institution,” Conrad said. “I think if there was ever a need to have a waiver for sovereign immunity, it’s for cases like Taylor.”
A narrower approach
The issue revolves around “sovereign immunity” and tort claims, or the idea that the government should be insulated from certain lawsuits and liabilities, in effect guarding taxpayer dollars.
Pillen said he vetoed the measure, stating it would “substantially erode” decades-old sovereign immunity protections and was too broad.
“We must hold perpetrators accountable and protect children from abuse by enforcing the criminal laws that exist and by targeting the wrongdoer,” Pillen said in his veto letter. “Taxpayers should not bear this burden.”
Conrad said LB 156 is in direct response to Pillen’s veto.
The Nebraska Supreme Court, in contentious rulings in 2020 regarding the death of an inmate and 2024 regarding foster care youths, the latter just after Pillen’s veto, has ruled that the prohibition on civil tort claims includes any claim where an “assault” has occurred, barring most litigants from even getting in the courthouse doors, Conrad and other senators have said.
Conrad’s bills, and the legislation from 2024 spearheaded by former State Sen. Justin Wayne of Omaha would create a narrow exception to sovereign immunity for crimes against children. Wayne helped usher through that bill as chair of the Judiciary Committee.
‘We were so close’: Nebraska mother responds to veto of child sexual assault and abuse bill

LB 156 would allow negligence lawsuits in cases of sexual assault of a child that occurred: 

On school grounds.
In a vehicle owned, leased or contracted by a school and being used for a school purpose.
In a vehicle being driven for a school purpose by a school employee or designee.
At a school-sponsored activity or athletic event.

The 2024 bill and this year’s copy of it, LB 236, would have allowed lawsuits beyond direct ties to a school, including child abuse, when such harm was the “proximate result” of the failure of any political subdivision or an employee to exercise “reasonable care” to protect the child.
Private entities, including private schools, can already be sued and held liable in these cases.
‘They failed me’
Elizabeth Eynon-Kokrda, general counsel for Education Rights Counsel, said she was in “truly vigorous support for LB 156 because, frankly, too many children are being sexually violated at school.”

Lauren Micek Vargas, chief executive officer of Education Rights Counsel, supported the narrowed bill, stating that for more than 10 years she has represented several children who have been sexually trafficked.
“Unlike the movies,” Vargas said, traffickers rarely kidnap kids and sell them into sex work. Instead, she said, predators groom children and are in positions of authority, targeting students’ vulnerabilities.
“We are asking for our most vulnerable students to be protected, and we’re asking for your assistance,” Vargas said.
Eynon-Kokrda said the organization represented two clients in the last year who were raped at school. Both were unmonitored, she said, and each predator had a “worrisome history.” Each survivor was also a child with significant special needs.
Vargas gave the committee a list of such arrests in 2024 alone, including school officials in Omaha, Madison, Maywood and North Platte. Earlier this year, a principal in Stapleton was arrested, and a Papillion-La Vista school psychologist was arrested Tuesday.
One mother writing to the committee, who planned to appear in person but had a family emergency, said her daughter in middle school was raped this school year. The mother said her daughter’s individual education plan was not followed, and the mother alleged that the boy who raped her daughter “was known to prey upon children with disabilities.”
“I trusted the school and they failed me,” the letter said. “They failed my daughter, and I still don’t know all the consequences of that failure.”
Proactive vs. reactive
Opposing both of Conrad’s bills was Brandy Johnson, on behalf of the Nebraska Intergovernmental Risk Management Association; Chuck Wilbrand of Knudsen Law Firm in Lincoln, representing a public entity school insurance pool (ALICAP); Elaine Menzel, on behalf of the state associations for county attorneys, sheriffs and county officials; and Jennifer Huxoll, civil litigation bureau chief for the Attorney General’s Office.
Menzel also opposed LB 236 on behalf of the Nebraska League of Nebraska Municipalities.

Huxoll, as she said in August when Wayne tried to revive the legislation in the summer special session on property taxes, said that few days go by without a headline regarding child pornography, sex trafficking or child sexual assault. She said law enforcement, local governments and lawmakers are working to combat those crimes.
“These two bills, however, will not reduce crimes against children,” Huxoll said. “They will simply make our friends and neighbors of Nebraska financially responsible for judgments resulting from harms caused by criminals.”
Johnson and Wilbrand said their organizations provide training and work to be proactive, not out of fear of being sued but to genuinely help children.
“The bad actor is the one that caused this, and that’s what the trainings are supposed to be addressing,” Wilbrand said.
Johnson said she has learned that local governments do try to do all they can to be proactive, yet the “evil perpetrator is often hiding in plain sight, doing their best to conceal their actions.”
“It’s not as easy as it might seem for a government or school to be able to foresee or prevent those situations,” Johnson said.
Sovereign immunity concerns
Huxoll, echoing Pillen, said that if LB 156 were to become law, even narrowly, it would become easier for lawmakers to chip away and allow more lawsuits against local governments.
  State Sens. Julie Slama of Dunbar and Mike McDonnell of Omaha. Aug. 8, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Heather Schmidt, a Lincoln mother who supported the bill, said she understands and appreciates the concern that taxpayers would be liable for costs related to crimes they didn’t commit.
“That being said, there has to be a mechanism to hold enablers accountable,” she said.
Conrad also pointed to comments from former State Sen. Julie Slama of Dunbar who challenged opponents of the 2024 bill who argued the change would raise taxes.
“How many child molesters is your school district employing if it’s going to impact your bottom line?” she asked during the 2024 debate.
Other supporters of the law have said the lawsuits would allow an attempt, but not a guarantee, at financial rewards that could help a child with medical care or counseling that they might need for the rest of their lives.
Conrad and Wayne, both lawyers, have said attorneys have an ethical duty against filing frivolous claims.
Appeal to conservative committee
Cameron Guenzel, representing the Nebraska Association of Trial Attorneys, supported the same measure as last year but opposed Conrad’s LB 156 being narrowed to schools.
He said the bill doesn’t go far enough and that the rule as interpreted by the Nebraska Supreme Court just five years ago “makes no sense.”
  State Sen. Justin Wayne of Omaha talks with State Sen. Lou Ann Linehan of Elkhorn on the floor of the Legislature. Aug. 16, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Guenzel gave an example of a school hiring a bus driver where officials knew something was wrong but negligently hired the bus driver anyway. 
If the driver had a pattern of being drunk and later injured students while driving under the influence, the district could be sued for negligence. But if the driver was known to be prone to violence and later assaulted students, Guenzel said, the school could not be sued, because it included an “assault.”
Guenzel said the current law shields bad actors and discourages accountability.
Guenzel said he is a concealed carry permit holder who has “choose life” license plates, and who hasn’t voted for a Democrat since when he was a “wide-eyed college kid” voting for Barack Obama in 2008. He said that when he has talked about the issue with people in his “circles,” who have views similar to him, they were surprised when he said there was no recourse for such families and that they don’t view the issue as political.
Jennifer Turco Meyer, president-elect of the Nebraska Trial Attorneys Association, had a similar message.
“If we think justice and accountability work in the criminal context, we can’t skip over and leave out civil justice in terms of how it will affect the way that school districts and law enforcement agencies take care of the most vulnerable people in our society, which are children,” she said.
Something is better than nothing
The departure of a large class of lawmakers this January, many in favor of Wayne’s past bill, could add to  the uphill climb to get a similar measure moving this year, even if narrowed.
That was evident in multiple back-and-forth conversations Wednesday with freshman State Sens. Tanya Storer of Whitman, who succeeded former State Sen. Tom Brewer in north-central Nebraska, and Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse, who succeeded Slama. Conrad said she would be willing to further narrow her bill. Brewer and Slama both supported last year’s measure.

In response, Conrad said she could consider reducing allowable relief (already a maximum of $1 million), capping attorney fees or increasing the negligence standard for such a case.
“A step forward is better than status quo,” Conrad told the committee.
The 2024 measure had received bipartisan support. 
Among key conservative supporters were former State Sens. Lou Ann Linehan of the Elkhorn area, Steve Erdman of Bayard and Halloran, as well as Brewer and Slama, who helped pass the bill, as did Wayne, raising the proposal for weeks before the final votes.
The new chair of the Judiciary Committee, State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln, led opposition to Wayne’s bill. Either of Conrad’s bills would require at least five votes on committee to advance. This year, four senators are new.
Conrad has selected the narrow LB 156 as her 2025 priority bill, increasing the chances it could be debated if advanced from committee.
“Our job and the law’s job is to ensure justice for people who are without justice, which is where we find ourselves today in regards to little kids of sexual assault at their schools and their schools had a hand in it,” Conrad said. “Whatever we need to do to figure out, make it work better, I hope that we can do that together.”

As of 2023, the state ranks among the top 20 for fourth grade reading, a significant leap from its 49th-place ranking in 2013. This transformation was driven by evidence-based policy reforms focused on early literacy and teacher development.
The rest of the country might want to take note.
That’s because Mississippi’s success offers a proven solution to the reading literacy crisis facing many states – a clear road map for closing early literacy gaps and improving reading outcomes nationwide.
As an expert on the economics of education, I believe the learning crisis is not just an educational issue. It’s also economic.
When students struggle, their academic performance declines. And that leads to lower test scores. Research shows that these declining scores are closely linked to reduced economic growth, as a less educated workforce hampers productivity and innovation.
The Mississippi approach
In 2013, Mississippi implemented a multifaceted strategy for enhancing kindergarten to third grade literacy. The Literacy-Based Promotion Act focuses on early literacy and teacher development. It includes teacher training in proven reading instruction methods and teacher coaching.
Relying on federally supported research from the Institute of Education Science, the state invested in phonics, fluency, vocabulary and reading comprehension. The law provided K-3 teachers with training and support to help students master reading by the end of third grade.
It includes provisions for reading coaches, parent communication, individual reading plans and other supportive measures. It also includes targeted support for struggling readers. Students repeat the third grade if they fail to meet reading standards.
The state also aligned its test to the NAEP, or National Assessment of Educational Progress, something which not all states do. Often referred to as “The Nation’s Report Card,” the NAEP is a nationwide assessment that measures student performance in various subjects.

 
 
Mississippi’s reforms have led to significant gains in reading and math, with fourth graders improving on national assessments.
I believe this is extremely important. That’s because early reading is a foundational skill that helps develop the ability to read at grade level by the end of third grade. It also leads to general academic success, graduating from high school prepared for college, and becoming productive adults less likely to fall into poverty.
Research by Noah Spencer, an economics doctoral student at the University of Toronto, shows that the Mississippi law boosted scores.
Students exposed to it from kindergarten to the third grade gained a 0.25 standard deviation improvement in reading scores. That is roughly equivalent to one year of academic progress in reading, according to educational benchmarks. This gain reflects significant strides in students’ literacy development over the course of a school year.
Another study has found an even greater impact attributed to grade retention in the third grade – it led to a huge increase in learning in English Language Arts by the sixth grade.
But the Mississippi law is not just about retention. Spencer found that grade retention explains only about 22% of the treatment effect. The rest is presumably due to the other components of the measure – namely, teacher training and coaching.
Other previous research supports these results across the country.
Adopting an early literacy policy improves elementary students’ reading achievement on important student assessments, with third grade retention and instructional support substantially enhancing English learners’ skills. The policy also increases test scores for students’ younger siblings, although it is not clear why.
Moreover, third grade retention programs immediately boost English Language Arts and math achievements into middle school without disciplinary incidents or negatively impacting student attendance.
These changes were achieved despite Mississippi being one of the lowest spenders per pupil in the U.S., proving that strategic investments in teacher development and early literacy can yield impressive results even with limited resources.
The global learning crisis
Mississippi’s success is timely. Millions of children globally struggle to read by age 10. It’s a crisis that has worsened after the COVID-19 pandemic.
Mississippi’s early literacy interventions show lasting impact and offer a potential solution for other regions facing similar challenges.
In 2024, only 31% of U.S. fourth grade students were proficient or above in reading, according to the NAEP, while 40% were below basic. Reading scores for fourth and eighth graders also dropped by five points compared with 2019, with averages lower than any year since 2005.
Mississippi’s literacy program provides a learning gain equal to a year of schooling. The program costs US$15 million annually – 0.2% of the state budget in 2023 – and $32 per student.
The learning gain associated with the Mississippi program is equal to about an extra quarter of a year. Since each year of schooling raises earnings by about 9%, then a quarter-year gain means that Mississippi students benefiting from the program will increase future earnings by 2.25% a year.
Based on typical high school graduate earnings, the average student can expect to earn an extra $1,000 per year for the rest of their life.
That is, for every dollar Mississippi spends, the state gains about $32 in additional lifetime earnings, offering substantial long-term economic benefits compared with the initial cost.
The Mississippi literacy project focuses on teaching at the right level, which focuses on assessing children’s actual learning levels and then tailoring instruction to meet them, rather than strictly following age- or grade-level curriculum.
Teaching at the right level and a scripted lessons plan are among the most effective strategies to address the global learning crisis. After the World Bank reviewed over 150 education programs in 2020, nearly half showed no learning benefit.
I believe Mississippi’s progress, despite being the second-poorest state, can serve as a wake-up call.

Federal infrastructure investments transformed Highway 55 from a rutted dirt road into a catalyst for economic development and a gateway to some of the best outdoor recreation in the world. Those investments didn’t come because of existing demand; they were born from a vision of a more accessible and prosperous Idaho. 
That vision of an Idaho that would draw people from across the country came not from the private sector, but from our state and federal governments, which turned this dream into reality through federal investments in American transportation infrastructure. 
Today, we’re in the midst of another great federal investment in our county’s infrastructure, to build electric vehicle (EV) charging stations along federal highways through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program. However, this program has been frozen by the new administration, jeopardizing $23.5 million already appropriated to Idaho to ensure we have access to charging infrastructure throughout the state.  
I’ve heard the argument against NEVI: Not enough people drive EVs yet, so why are we publicly funding charging stations? The same could have been said for the trip between the Treasure Valley and McCall 80 years ago. Building the U.S. highway system brought the American economy into dominance in the second half of the 20th century; building a national network of charging stations will help maintain that dominance through the 21st. U.S. EV sales continue to rise, with a 15% year-over-year increase in the last quarter, so the time is now to invest in charging infrastructure.
Congress appropriated this money in the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. With federal approval, Idaho created its state-level program, drew up deployment plans, and collected bids from charging companies for planned charging stations in Pocatello, Bliss and Lewiston. 
Idaho’s NEVI plan also sets money aside for workforce development. These charging infrastructure projects will bring jobs to the communities where they are located, not only during the construction of the stations but also through ongoing maintenance, strengthening our rural economies.
Unfortunately, Idaho is among the states that will suffer the most if this program disappears. States like California and New York have large enough tax bases to pay for this infrastructure, but Idaho, even as we recently topped two million residents, will not be able to afford these investments without federal assistance. Rural areas will be particularly affected, left behind as the rest of the county moves toward an all-electric transportation future.
Federal infrastructure investment is why we have one of the best trans-national highway systems in the world. It’s why we’ve led the world in economic growth for the last 80 years, why the great American road trip exists, and why all Americans — no matter their backgrounds — can take family vacations to American icons like Yellowstone, the Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls, and Idaho’s own Sawtooth Mountains. Our roads and the federal investments that make them possible are one of the most economically successful democratizing projects in our country’s 250-year history. 
It’s not too late to make sure Idaho isn’t left behind in this next great infrastructure project. It’s up to our congressional representatives to hold the executive branch accountable for distributing the funds Congress promised us. Reps. Mike Simpson and Russ Fulcher and Sens. Jim Risch and Mike Crapo ought to know that if this money disappears, their constituents — all of us — will pay the price.

What does religious liberty look like today? With so much unsettling and destabilizing news coming from the new administration in Washington, DC, it’s hard to keep up with and keep track of everything. We believe, however, that a recent decision by the President is a dangerous threat to religious liberty, promotes Christian Nationalism, and all people who care about our democracy need to take note. 
We, the Lutheran (ELCA) bishops in Wisconsin and Upper Michigan, are concerned about an executive order signed by President Trump on Feb. 6 that established a new “Task Force to Eradicate Anti-Christian Bias.” This task force has the duty to “identify any unlawful anti-Christian policies, practices, or conduct by an agency.” While some might think that all Christians would support an effort to root out “anti-Christian bias,” that’s not the case. We believe this executive order is a threat to the religious pluralism enshrined in the Constitution and does not actually protect Christians. Instead, this order aligns the federal government with Christian Nationalism, a dangerous conflation of fundamentalist Christianity, conservative politics, and fierce patriotism that distorts what it means to be an American citizen and an engaged Christian in society.
With this executive order, the federal government has given itself the authority to define what might be considered “anti-Christian,” and therefore also the authority to define what is Christian — a power which belongs to the Church alone, not the federal government. This executive order violates religious freedom, corrupts the separation of church and state, and creates a more hostile environment for Christians and all citizens who believe differently than the current administration and its religious advisors.
We feel so strongly that this task force is a threat to our values and our freedom that we wrote a public statement and invited religious leaders and others to sign on (https://www.wichurches.org/articles/religious-liberty). We now have over 250 signers, and we invite all who care about religious freedom and the preservation of our democracy to join us. 
Christian Nationalism is a dangerous ideology that distorts the Gospel and turns Jesus and Christianity into a weapon for power and division instead of a movement towards love and justice. It demands that a particular brand of Christianity be privileged by the state and impose that singular belief system in order to be a “good American.” (For more information on Christian Nationalism, check out www.christiansagainstchristiannationalism.org.) 
In order to protect religious freedom, the federal government must not align with one religious ideology but rather honor the constitutional mandate to defend space for religious pluralism and ensure that each member of society is free to practice their religion, or no religion, while keeping the peace and working together for the common good. Please join us as we call upon the President of the United States and all elected officials to protect religious freedom in our country and uphold the constitution of the United States of America.

(Kevin Mohatt for Colorado Newsline)A bill that would give Colorado police officers who report misconduct in their office more protection from retaliation passed a House committee on Tuesday, nearly a year after a similar bill failed in the face of law enforcement opposition.
House Bill 25-1031 would allow officers to sue their employers if they face retaliation for reporting a danger to public safety or an alleged crime by another officer. It would clarify that there is whistleblower protection for local law enforcement.
“If someone wants to come forward because there has been a violation of law or policy, they should be protected in doing so,” said Rep. Jennifer Bacon, a Denver Democrat sponsoring the bill.

The bill passed the House Judiciary Committee on a 9-2 vote. Republican Reps. Ryan Armagost of Berthoud and Jarvis Caldwell of Colorado Springs voted against it.
Bacon also ran last year’s bill alongside former Rep. Leslie Herod, another Denver Democrat. That bill would have required investigations of reported misconduct and criminalized a failure to report, and was inspired by a former Edgewater police officer who told lawmakers she was retaliated against after she reported a supervising sergeant for sexual assault.
That bill, which was introduced and debated in the final weeks of the legislative session, faced heated opposition from Republicans and law enforcement groups, and failed on its final vote in the House.
Bacon and Rep. Chad Clifford, a Littleton Democrat also on the current bill, leaned on working groups of officers, legislators, legal experts and whistleblowers during the interim to come up with this year’s version of legislation. It has the support of the Colorado Fraternal Order of Police.










I'll have a client call. They're aware of something that has happened, but they don't know what to do. They are concerned of the ramifications they will feel if they speak out. Every one of those officers feel that they should speak out.


– Sean McCauley, general counsel for the Colorado Fraternal Order of Police


Some officers have “very deep, robust civil servant protections from a place like Denver, where they have an entire department to deal with this stuff,” Clifford said. “Not everybody has a department, so we were able to bring the experts together who understand the right way to do it.”
“Everything that’s in the four corners of this bill is related to a police officer having the protections that they need to do their job effectively and not get jammed up in their careers,” he said.
The bill expands the definition of retaliation from discharge and demotion to also include actions like suspension, creation of a hostile work environment, work hour reduction, and issuing a rating that could adversely affect an officer’s future employment.
Sean McCauley, general counsel for the CFOP, said the issue of whether to report misconduct comes up “monthly.”
“I’ll have a client call. They’re aware of something that has happened, but they don’t know what to do. They are concerned of the ramifications they will feel if they speak out. Every one of those officers feel that they should speak out,” he said. “But if you really value your career and you want to move through the organization, you have to decide if this is something that you want to speak out about.”
Under the bill, whistleblowing officers could be awarded damages for financial loss, emotional pain, mental anguish and inconvenience. They could also be reinstated to their agency with back pay. Caldwell said he might be able to support the bill if there’s a cap set on those potential lawsuit payouts.
The bill would set a statute of limitations for whistleblower cases of two years.
It would also create an affirmative defense for law enforcement agencies if their actions are determined to not have been retaliatory.
“Affirmative defense would say ‘We did cut your hours, but for a different reason,’” Bacon said. “We see that in other places in employment law, especially in government.”
The bill now heads to the full House chamber for consideration.

(Getty Images)The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed into law 15 years ago, and it remains one of the most consequential health care reforms in our country’s history.
At the time it was enacted I was the CEO of Covenant House. We were the recipients of a small grant — awarded from West Virginians for Affordable Health Care, no less — that allowed us to act as Community Assisters. Covenant House advocates enrolled over 300 West Virginians  — some of our most vulnerable citizens — in health care; for most it was the first time in their lives that they had access to health insurance. 
Over the last 15 years, the ACA has expanded affordable coverage to people previously locked out of health insurance, lowered premiums and out-of-pocket costs, and helped the nation’s uninsured rate reach an all-time low. Unfortunately, dismantling it remains a top Republican priority as they look to give tax breaks to the ultra-wealthy and big corporations. 
Do we really want to make it nearly impossible for West Virginians to afford health care? 
The ACA protects 737,900 West Virginians with pre-existing conditions from being charged more or denied coverage by insurance companies. It guarantees free preventive care for over 217,000 West Virginians, and it allows young adults to stay on their parents’ insurance plans. More Americans than ever count on it today: a record 24.2 million Americans are enrolled in quality coverage thanks to Enhanced Premium Tax Credits (ePTC) that make health care more affordable for millions of middle-class families purchasing coverage on their own. 
Millions of Americans are relying on these tax credits, but Republicans want to take them away, which would lead premiums to spike and leave 5 million more people uninsured. 
I personally acquire my health care through the ACA and qualify for ePTC. I do pay my fair share: The ePTC makes health insurance more affordable for me. If the ePTC are not renewed, my combined out of pocket and annual premium costs would reach $40,000 annually. I’ll be honest, this makes my heart skip a beat. 
Unless Congress acts now, premium costs will skyrocket for over 64,000 families across West Virginia, including me. On average, families would pay at least $1,404 for their premiums, and 5,300 West Virginians will lose their insurance entirely — including people who are self-employed, small businesses, older adults who don’t yet qualify for Medicare, people living in high-cost rural areas, farmers, people with pre-existing conditions and more. 
Lower premium costs have helped take the pressure off families and given them more room to pay for other necessities like food, rent and gas. ACA coverage in West Virginia has more than doubled thanks to the efforts of Democrats who have worked tirelessly to protect and expand the ACA. 
Yet, here we are again, standing at the edge of a health care cliff. Republicans are pushing to raise premiums and health care costs for 24 million Americans by taking away these tax credits from hard working families. From day one, Republicans have been fighting to raise health care costs, from voting against these savings in the first place to now taking them away. 
Instead of protecting affordable coverage, Republicans are more focused on delivering tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations while leaving Mountaineers struggling to get by. Losing these savings would be devastating to millions who may otherwise not be able to access health care. As a result, millions of families will once again have to choose between being able to see a doctor or keeping a roof over their heads. 
As the ACA turns 15 years old this month, the law is unfortunately once again in Republicans’ crosshairs while Democrats have introduced the Health Care Affordability Act to ensure health care costs remain affordable for people who buy coverage on their own. If Republicans are serious about bringing down costs, they will ensure these tax credits remain available for families for years to come, and people with pre-existing conditions can continue to afford coverage. It is time for Republicans to get on board and protect the health care of millions of Americans.

(Sharon Sullivan for Colorado Newsline)Some Grand Junction community members, including Colorado Mesa University students and alumni, are angry about a white supremacist speaker scheduled to talk at the University Center on Thursday. 
The Southern Poverty Law Center describes the speaker, Jared Taylor, as the 1990 founder of the New Century Foundation, “a self-styled think tank that promotes pseudo-scientific studies and research” that purports to show the superiority of white people. 
The Foundation is known for its American Renaissance magazine and website, which often features proponents of eugenics, as well as anti-Black racists. The New Century Foundation also sponsors conferences attended by Klansmen, neo-Nazis and other white supremacists, according to the SPLC. 
Students and community members have planned a protest prior to the event, at 4 p.m. on the corner of 12th Street and North Avenue in Grand Junction. The group will gather there before marching through CMU campus to the University Center.

Max Applebaugh, a 21-year-old CMU junior majoring in business, founded the Western Culture Club with five members about a month ago, after another club had cut ties with him over personal disagreements, he said. One of the Western Culture Club’s first actions was to invite Taylor to campus to speak. Applebaugh is president of the club. He is also secretary of the conservative CMU-Turning Point USA club. 
“I’ve been wanting to bring Jared Taylor for a few months now,” Applebaugh said. “I had a personal connection — a lawyer friend named Jason Lee Van Dyke, based in Texas, who made it possible. He paid for Taylor’s flight, accommodations and stay.”
Van Dyke is a former member of the Proud Boys extremist group and is known for representing far-right defendants in court, according to Cleveland.com.
Fifteen CMU students who are opposed to Taylor coming to their campus attempted to quash the invitation by joining the Western Culture Club and electing new members. They had hoped to rescind the invitation but the college administration refused to recognize the election, several members said. 
One of the students, senior Tahirah Pedro Bochmann, said they asked the club’s faculty advisor — business instructor Georgann Jouflas — to recognize the election, which Bochmann said Jouflas declined to do.
“She said we should ‘just let it go,'” Bochmann said.










Freedom of speech is easy to support when you agree with what is being said. It becomes much more difficult when you do not.


– CMU business instructor Georgann Jouflas


Jouflas said she had become acquainted with Applebaugh when he was her student the prior semester. She said she was impressed that he was always reading before class, typically a history book, as opposed to being on his phone or computer. She said she enjoyed their conversations and his intellectual curiosity, so when he asked if she’d sponsor his club, she agreed.
She said her role was not to approve or disapprove of the club’s speakers but to guide it through the process of securing approval from CMU’s Student Life, which she said she did. Jouflas said she wished the club had chosen a different speaker.
“I do not support white supremacy in any form,” she said. “Freedom of speech is easy to support when you agree with what is being said. It becomes much more difficult when you do not.”
University President John Marshall did not respond to phone or email requests for comment by the time of publication. Director of Student Life Trey Downey also did not respond to a request for an interview.
Applebaugh, who said he grew up in Frisco, acknowledges that Taylor’s ideas about race make some people feel uncomfortable.
“(Taylor) describes himself as a white advocate,” Applebaugh said. “And that people should have the option to their own spaces.”
Applebaugh said he considers himself a white nationalist and libertarian. 
“I do believe strongly in advocating for the interests of white people, because there are forces in America that are anti-white,” he said.

Why? It’s like the bank robber Willie Sutton said when someone asked him why he robbed banks, “That’s where the money is.”
Just in case that’s the plan, let me tell you a story.
Sometime in 1990 a young man sat on a couch in my house and asked for help. He had a brain tumor. He was there because an older friend of his brought him and insisted that I was somebody who could help him. I wasn’t so sure. I was in my first term as a state representative and was just feeling my way around. I didn’t yet understand the power that having a title gave to a person. Louie, the older man, did.
He knew not only that that title gave me the power to help, it also gave me the responsibility to help.
The young man worked at a local lumber mill “pulling chain”—removing and sorting boards coming off a chain conveyor at a very rapid rate. Sometimes, because of the tumor, he would black out, and the boards would come whizzing past him. His workmates covered for him during these spells and took on his share of the work until he snapped out of it and resumed working.
He had no medical insurance. He couldn’t afford it, and even if he could have afforded it, it wouldn’t have paid for the operation to remove the tumor because it was a “pre-existing condition” that no insurance company would then cover.
At that time the only way a person who needed expensive medical care, but couldn’t pay for it, was to get on a program called Social Security Disability Insurance. It usually took three years and required hiring a lawyer.
He was in a hard place. The only good news was that the tumor wasn’t cancerous and would be easy to remove. But it was still growing, and his blackouts would get worse.
I decided to call a person I knew slightly who worked for Montana’s Sen. Max Baucus and ask for her advice. Holly Luck answered and I explained the situation. She asked to talk with the young man, so I handed him the phone, but he didn’t take it. He couldn’t take it. He had blacked out.
When he came to, I gave him Holly’s number to call. He did, and the Senator’s office quickly got him on Social Security Disability Insurance, he had the surgery and was able to go back to work as a productive part of the American workforce.
That’s the way it was before the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid Expansion. There were a lot of stories like that. Keeping people healthy keeps them working and contributing to a healthy economy. If we want that for America, the choice between subsidizing billionaires and keeping American workers working should be pretty clear.

(Photo: Lynn Bonner)People with disabilities and their parents came to the Legislative Building in Raleigh on Wednesday to illustrate for legislators the frustrating problem of finding help that enables people with intellectual or developmental disabilities to live in communities. 
Their testimony highlighted the challenges of finding frontline workers amid constant turnover and the years-long wait to receive help from a Medicaid program called the “Innovations Waiver.” But speakers also described lives of people who are able to work, make friends, and pursue hobbies with the help of workers called direct support professionals. 
“Innovations has been an incredible success story for Nicholas,” Ray Hemachandra of Buncombe County said of his 24-year-old son, who is autistic and intellectually disabled. Nicholas works at an ice cream shop and volunteers at a food bank and a community church ministry, his father said. 
“Nicholas learns skills for greater independence with his support workers, from running laundry and doing dishes to self-care skills,” Hemachandra said. “He participates in Asheville City recreational programs and other social groups, swims and takes classes at the Y, and he has become a truly exceptional juggler. His Innovations support workers contributed to all of this.”
He highlighted the importance of his son receiving support workers while he was still in school. 
Unfortunately, for thousands of other North Carolinians in need of similar supports, the wait for help will likely take years. There are now more people on the waiting list (18,771) than there are people who are using the program. Most children on the list now will be well into adulthood before they receive services under the waiver. In 2021, Ruby Loftis of Winston-Salem, died while waiting for a slot.

The frontline workers, called direct support professionals, are employed by private companies and their average pay is below the state’s living wage. Low pay and lack of opportunity for career advancement contribute to worker shortages and job turnover.  
A bipartisan group of legislators that Rep. Zack Hawkins (D-Durham) helps lead is in its second year working to highlight the needs of people with disabilities and their families and to convince budget writers to contribute more money to support them. 
“Families are crying for the help from the General Assembly,” Hawkins said. Helping these families will help “build a more inclusive state,” he said. 
Rebecca Conway quit her job in 2022 to care for her daughter Erica, because no direct support professional was available to do the work, she said.  
Erica, now 34, suffered a traumatic brain injury when she was 16, Conway said. 
“Changes must happen to attract a healthy workforce to care for our fellow North Carolinians that need assistance,” she said. “Better wages, a statewide database for certification that can be accessed by all provider companies, clear career paths, and educational development programs would send a message that [direct support professionals] are valuable and caregiving is recognized as a profession,” she said. 
Last year, the state Department of Health and Human Services published a multi-year plan to address the workforce shortage. 
Legislators have been adding Innovations Waiver slots, and in the last few budgets increased rates paid to the companies that employ the frontline workers with the intention that they increase worker salaries. 
  Rep. Sarah Crawford (D-Wake) (Photo: ncleg.gov)
Yet, the waiting list keeps growing, and most workers’ salaries have not reached the legislature’s target of $18 an hour. 
The workers who are helping people with disabilities live full lives “are making $12 and $14, maybe if they’re lucky, $15 an hour,” said Rep. Sarah Crawford (D-Wake). “That is not a living wage here in North Carolina. Many of these people are leaving work to go to work, either to another job so they can make ends meet, or to take care of other family members.”
Sens. Lisa Grafstein (D-Wake) and Timothy Moffitt (R-Henderson), co-sponsored bills that seek to raise direct support worker pay to $25 an hour, and to add another 10,000 Innovations Waiver slots over the next two years. 
Hawkins said he wants a 10-year plan and to work alongside the state Department of Health and Human Services to figure out how to move through the waitlist.

Glenn Youngkin.  (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed several bills aimed at improving maternal health in the commonwealth, building on promises both he and Democratic leadership made to support parents and health care workers. 
Dubbed the “Momnibus” package, the Democrat-led bills stem from a Black Maternal Health Summit hosted last year in the state Capitol that brought medical professionals, advocates and lawmakers from across the state and beyond for roundtable discussions and panels. Alongside these conversations, a rural health committee spent months touring Virginia, gathering firsthand accounts of maternal care gaps in underserved communities. 
Resulting legislation included bills aimed at addressing disparities, from requiring implicit bias training for medical license renewals to strengthening obstetrics training in hospitals and expanding support for midwives and doulas.
While the state has previously allocated funding to boost OB-GYN and family practice medical residencies in the state, maternal healthcare workers like midwives and doulas are more likely to live longer-term in the areas that they serve. Both are key players in filling rural health care gaps as well as addressing health care disparities for patients of color. 
To that end, Youngkin has signed Senate Bill 1352 and House Bill 1635, which build on a 2021 law that allowed some midwives to establish private practices after completing 1,000 training hours under agreements with other physicians. The new bills, by Sen. Kannan Srinivasan, D-Loudoun, and Del. Joshua Cole, D-Spotsylvania, respectively, will extend that opportunity to other types of midwives.
Youngkin signs bill to protect reproductive and sexual health data, vetoes right to contraception

Relatedly, Youngkin didn’t fully approve but also didn’t outright reject House Bill 1923, which would create more pay parity for midwives. In lieu of a signature, his amendment requires the Health Insurance Reform Commission conduct an assessment and that if the legislature accepts his tweaked version of the bill, it would be subject to reenactment next year. 
Bolstering emergency responses, Youngkin also signed House Bill 1904 by Del. Rodney Willett, D-Henrico, which will allow midwives and nurse practitioners to be on 24-hour on-call duty rosters. The governor further approved  House Bill 2753 by Del. Cliff Hayes, D-Chesapeake, which requires hospitals and outpatient birthing facilities to establish protocol for identifying and responding to obstetric emergencies. He also signed House Bill 2083 by Del. Irene Shin, D-Fairfax, which will establish a special enrollment period for qualified pregnant people on Virginia’s health insurance exchange.  
A survey the state conducted last year showed long wait times for new enrollees’ paperwork to be processed. This contributed to delayed access to care for people to schedule their appointments.
 Likely veto ahead on unconscious bias training bill

Though Youngkin followed through on his stated goals of remedying maternal health care issues, for the second year in a row he is seeking an amendment on the unconscious bias training bill.
Senate Bill 740 by Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton and House Bill 1649 by Hayes would require workers to complete unconscious bias and cultural competency training to renew medical licenses. 
The bills have been carried for several years in a row. Last year, with bipartisan co-patrons and supporting votes, they reached Youngkin’s desk where he also sought amendments before vetoing them. 
Like last year, Youngkin’s substitute strips the mention of cultural competency and unconscious bias, adding instead “populations that data indicate experience significantly greater than average maternal mortality, postpartum complications and infant mortality.”
Governor unleashes veto storm to drown progressive legislation

Studies show that Black people are more likely to experience negative maternal health outcomes, in part, due to providers’ racial bias. Black women are also more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications than white women, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows. 
Youngkin’s substitute also would limit the training to two hours. 
Locke, who has carried the Senate version of the bill for several years, said that “no one can overcome unconscious bias and cultural incompetence by viewing a two-hour video.”
As she did last year, she plans to reject his substitute, which will likely garner another veto from the governor. 
“My point to him is he needs to overcome his own implicit bias regarding Black maternal health issues,” Locke said. “It is clear that he has no clue.” 
While Youngkin has been supportive of doulas, which are key companions and advocates for parents-to-be, his amendment to a bill to expand doula state health insurance coverage postpartum left one of its patrons perplexed. 
House Bill 1614 by Del. Adele McClure, D-Arlington, and Senate Bill 1418 by Sen. Lashrecse Aird, D-Petersburg, could allow for Virginia’s health insurance to cover up to 10 doula visits — four during pregnancy and six afterwards. 
Youngkin’s substitute changes the semantics by removing the words “birthing people” and changing it to “birthing women.” 
Though most pregnancies are experienced by cisgender women, transgender and nonbinary people with uteruses can still get pregnant, groups that  the original language of the bill would have included. The governor’s amendment also removed a provision referring to “culturally appropriate and individualized care.” 
Aird called it “frustrating” to see the removal of culturally tailored care from her bill. She also said his fixation on gendered language is “distracting from what really matters — getting people the care they need to improve outcomes and save lives.”

However, at Wednesday’s Board of Education meeting, Interim Superintendent of Public Instruction Emily Anne Gullickson ensured board members and the public that the agency made no recent language changes to the history standards or the instructional guides. She said staff only added web links to primary and secondary sources to the instructional guides.
Gullickson, former deputy secretary of education, sat with the board for the first time at Wednesday’s work session, which had directed her to prioritize the instructional guidelines after she replaced Lisa Coons, who resigned nearly two weeks ago.
“We wanted to make sure that there was alignment with the clarity that really matches up well with Virginia’s guiding principles, which is nonpartisan, factual resources and the true telling of history, which is what this (department) has really prided itself on,” Gullickson said.
Education department staff members provided an overview of the gradual release of the instructional guidelines at the meeting and how the agency plans to help teachers get ready, noting that they had paused dissemination of the guides in December.
Indigenous Peoples Day removed, then re-added, to board-approved Va. education standards

Public concerns about the guidelines and the standards grew after some education leaders noticed a change between the board-approved 2023 history and social science standards and the online versions, where “Indigenous Peoples Day” was missing from the Kindergarten, Grade 1, and Grade 2 versions.
The agency has since fixed the issue and the observance is present in all the standards. Schools are slated to start teaching students using the updated standards in the 2026-2027 school year.
 Sources added to instructional guides

The history instructional guides released between November 15, 2024, and December 5, 2024 now include additional resource links. These resources will help teachers access primary and secondary sources that confirm the facts of the teaching materials.
Web links to primary and secondary sources, including the Bill of Rights and the Magna Carta, were present in a history instructional guide released in November and a draft guide for civics and economics that the Mercury reviewed.
The agency said in its overview to the board on Wednesday that the instructional guides are “living, breathing documents that will continue to grow and undergo technical edits as well as expand the number of high-quality instructional materials” as it works with its partners including museums and other cultural institutions.
The agency also said it will provide in-person and virtual regional professional learning sessions from May through the fall to ensure that teachers and educational staff will learn about the instructional guides’ purpose, intention, structure, content and context for implementation.
 Educators and advocates say standards’ implementation should be pushed back 

Some education leaders called for a one-year delay to start teaching the updated standards, because they were concerned that the release of the instructional guides would be too late.
Danyael Graham, president of the Virginia Social Studies Leaders Consortium, signed a joint letter requesting a delay along with more than a dozen educational organizations, including the Virginia Association of Colleges and Virginia Association for Teaching, Learning and Leading.
Graham said some schools will be closing for the summer by the time the rollout begins. She said the current school year should have been when teachers could have tried out both the standards and the instructional guides.
With the instructional guides expected to roll out gradually starting in April and, the window for teachers to review the instructional materials before the next school year is tighter, she said. 
“Our teachers are off contract over the summer. They shouldn’t be spending their summer trying to grapple with these 50 to 75-page guides,” Graham said, adding that the gradual rollout will greatly impact smaller school districts without dedicated social studies offices. 
“It does not provide ample time to provide some sort of high-quality professional development,” Graham said. “This doesn’t feel very responsive to the needs of our educators, and the fact that they’re not even hearing the requests of 13 organizations is a bit concerning.”
Chris Jones, executive director for the Virginia Association for Teaching, Learning and Leading, asked “what is the harm” in delaying the rollout, considering some school divisions, teachers and schools are already preparing for the upcoming school year by collecting resource materials and coordinating professional development in May.
“I just think when we consider that the department has had two years to put the guides together, and then, essentially, for some of our school divisions, they will only have two months with the guides in hand, I just think it’s even further evidence that we’re simply not ready for an effective implementation of the standards,” Jones said.
Despite the request, the education department intends to proceed with its plan to launch the standards next school year. 
“If we were producing standards right now and had not solidified those standards, that would be a completely different conversation for in terms of implementation timeline, (but) we are not moving the goal post,” said Board President Grace Creasey, an appointee of Gov. Glenn Youngkin. “This is just to support the instruction of the standards that we already have in place, so I don’t see that the board is going to do anything to change the timeline of implementation for the history standards.”

Governor unleashes veto storm to drown progressive legislation

If signed into law, Virginia would have become the second state to enact comprehensive artificial intelligence rules, behind Colorado. The Virginia measure would have made companies responsible for protecting consumers from bias in areas such as hiring, housing and health care decisions.
In his veto explanation, Youngkin said that while he supports responsible governance of artificial intelligence, the bill’s framework “fails to account for the rapidly evolving and fast-moving nature of the AI industry and puts an especially onerous burden on smaller firms and startups that lack large legal compliance departments.”
The bill, sponsored by Virginia Democratic state Del. Michelle Lopes Maldonado, would have required AI developers to disclose the intended uses of their AI system while assessing its risks and limitations. Businesses using these systems would then be required to implement risk management policies. Both AI developers and deployers would have been subject to civil penalties for noncompliance.
As the Trump administration loosens AI rules, states look to regulate the technology

While many companies use artificial intelligence, the measure would have applied only to the ones developing and using “high-risk” AI systems, such as those used for employment decisions or financial services.
“I think it’s really critical for us to create guardrails and frameworks that are flexible and breathable, so that we don’t stifle innovation and creativity,” Maldonado told the Virginia Mercury when introducing the bill in January.
Opponents of the bill, including the Chamber of Progress, a center-left tech industry coalition, argued that it would hinder innovation and cost taxpayers.
AI should be regulated sector by sector, said Brianna January, Chamber of Progress’ Northeast state and local government relations director.
“When you have an omnibus approach like HB 2094, you unintentionally stack the cards against smaller innovators that want to operate in the state because you’re creating such a regulatory and liability framework that really only the big players can operate in,” January said in a phone interview.
While the Trump administration has lowered some artificial intelligence guardrails in hopes of boosting innovation, states are continuing to establish policies for the safe use of AI, including measures to prevent algorithmic discrimination.
Lawmakers in other states — including California, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New York, Texas and more — are considering similar legislation to curb potential AI abuses.

Chief economist Jonathan Smoke said the analytics company, which surveys more than 1,000 car dealers to produce a quarterly sentiment index, revised its forecast to reduce the number of new vehicle sales expected this year from 16.3 million to 15.6 million, a 4.3% decrease that equals a 700,000 vehicle decline.
Smoke made the forecast Wednesday, just hours before Trump imposed a 25% tariff on imported cars and light trucks.
Smoke said while their original forecast predicted sales of new vehicles would increase by one to two percent over last year, their updated projections represent a decrease of one to two percent from last year.
“If we do see circumstances turn for the negative, it will be a squandered opportunity as we were poised for continued growth,” Smoke said.
But making projections can be difficult with Trump’s tariff plans constantly evolving, Smoke said.
“We’ve seen uncertainty grow dramatically over the last two months, and uncertainty can be like a deep fog that simply ruins the morning commute,” Smoke said.
While the updated projection represents what Cox Automotive analysts view as the most likely scenario, Smoke said there’s enough uncertainty that it’s still possible to meet their original projections – or to see even more detrimental impacts of a full-blown trade war.
“The opportunity is still there, but storm clouds are forming on the horizon,” Smoke said.
In addition to announcing plans to implement 25% tariffs on automakers that do not produce cars in the U.S. beginning next week, Trump said the administration is also set to implement tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico next week, in what the President has referred to as “Liberation Day.”
United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain praised the tariffs in a statement, saying that Trump is “stepping up to end the free trade disaster that has devastated working class communities for decades.”

“These tariffs are a major step in the right direction for autoworkers and blue-collar communities across the country, and it is now on the automakers, from the Big Three to Volkswagen and beyond, to bring back good union jobs to the U.S.,” Fain said.
But Smoke said tariffs would be “highly disruptive” to North American vehicle production, resulting in tighter supply, higher prices and lower production and sales.
Even when vehicles are assembled in the United States, parts often cross between Canada, the United States and Mexico several times.
Depending on the extent of the tariffs, Smoke said the cost of a vehicle made in the United States could increase by $3,000 and the cost of a vehicle assembled in Canada or Mexico could go up by $6,000 or more.
It would also result in 20,000 fewer vehicles being produced per day, Smoke said.
Charlie Chesbrough, a senior economist for Cox Automotive, said that would exacerbate supply shortages that began during Trump’s first term in office, when the COVID-19 pandemic caused supply chain failures that sent prices skyrocketing.
Had pre-pandemic trends continued, Chesbrough said, the cost of a new vehicle today would be nearly 10% below where they currently are. While prices were declining for much of the last year, they never reached their pre-pandemic levels and are now on the rise again, which could be accelerated by tariffs.
“We expect sales to fall, new and used prices to increase and some models to be eliminated if those tariffs persist,” Smoke said.
Tariffs could also lead to budget-friendly vehicle lines being eliminated, Smoke said, as half of the affordable vehicles sold in the United States are assembled in Canada or Mexico.
And while many vehicle sales have been driven by wealthier individuals, Smoke said economic uncertainty – which has also manifested in the form of a declining stock market – makes them less reliable purchasers.
“Affordability has been holding back market potential for years, and between rates and tariffs, affordability looks to get much worse,” Smoke said.
Smoke added that the actions taken by the Trump administration have been “far more aggressive than anyone expected.”
“Worse still, the administration has communicated that they are willing to see the economy deteriorate if that is necessary to accomplish their goals,” Smoke said.

American Indian and Alaska Native tribes are fighting for equal governance and sovereignty over their own health data. (Kris Hanning/University of Arizona)When Stephanie Russo Carroll, a citizen of the Native Village of Kluti-Kaah in Alaska, set out to earn her doctorate in tribal health 15 years ago, she focused her research on tribal cultural and health programs within six tribes.
She needed vital statistics data, such as birth and death rates, for each of them. But getting that data from the state, which houses vital statistics, was difficult — and in some cases, the data she needed was missing.
“Health outcomes data were unobtainable,” Carroll recalled. In one case, her team had to try using breastfeeding rates as a proxy to estimate birth rates. But even getting those for all six tribes was impossible.
For the next two decades, Carroll would continue to push for U.S. tribes — which are sovereign nations — to own and maintain control over their data, including health statistics.
The concept, known as data sovereignty, is important amid the harrowing health disparities seen in tribal people, rooted in forced assimilation dating back more than a century. Often, data gathered by and about tribes has been shared with state and federal agencies; but those same agencies haven’t always shared their tribal-related statistics in return.
The reasons vary, from systemic issues within the health care system to mistaken assumptions by some federal officials about what data be securely sent to tribes without risking privacy violations.
Lackluster investigations may perpetuate high Native infant mortality rate

The lack of tribe-specific data has hindered tribes from fully taking care of their members and clouded their work on public health responses to disease outbreaks such as syphilis and COVID-19, on maternal and infant health outcomes, and on chronic issues such as diabetes, heart disease and substance use.
Data sovereignty is especially relevant now, as the Trump administration scrubs federal health websites of data that recognizes and tracks metrics among the country’s various racial and ethnic groups, including what little data there is on tribal members.
States govern their own health data systems. But the same isn’t true for the nation’s 574 federally recognized tribes.
Now an associate professor of public health at the University of Arizona, Carroll co-founded the U.S. Indigenous Data Sovereignty Network and directs the Collaboratory for Indigenous Data Governance. Both are groups that work to research and strengthen Indigenous data governance, accuracy and data-driven policy.
“If you don’t know who has been sick or hospitalized,” Carroll said, “how can you make sure you have the right care systems for your community?”
Withholding tribes’ data
As part of its slashing of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, the Trump administration removed numerous racial, ethnic, adolescent and maternal health datasets from the websites of several federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While some of the data has been reinstated, the swift deletions raised alarms in tribal communities.
Abigail Echo-Hawk, a member of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma and director of the Urban Indian Health Institute, said the youth behavioral risk surveys were reinstated, but were missing key race and ethnicity search features that tribes use to track mental health conditions in American Indian and Alaska Native teens.
“Now, we can’t search, disaggregate by Native youth,” she said. “That information is about our children, and it is the legal right of both now the tribal epidemiology centers and the tribes to have access to that previously gathered information.”

Despite their public health authority, tribes and tribal epidemiology centers, which support tribes with health data tracking, say federal and state health officials have long withheld or denied requests to direct access of health data related to their tribes, including coronavirus data during the pandemic.
Such data is tied to treaty rights obligations and shouldn’t be lumped together with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives currently under attack by the Trump administration, Echo-Hawk said.
“Our treaty rights are tied to having information around tribal people. So, if you’re going to uphold our treaty rights, you need to say: ‘This number of Native people are experiencing this issue,’ or ‘This number of Native people exist,’” she said.
It wasn’t until 2021 that the CDC conducted its first comprehensive life expectancy profile of American Indians and Alaska Natives; it showed that in 2019, their life expectancy was seven years lower than that of white people.
“All of the data is a story. It’s a grandmother, it’s a son, it’s a story of a community’s well-being,” Echo-Hawk said.
When tribes receive federal grants — whether for transportation, housing or education initiatives — there are grant reporting requirements.











All of data is a story. It's a grandmother, it's a son, it's a story of a community's well-being.


– Abigail Echo-Hawk, director of the Urban Indian Public Health Institute



Under those rules, tribes send raw data to federal agencies, but they often don’t get that data back, said social demographer Desi Small-Rodriguez, an assistant professor of sociology and American Indian studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, who co-founded the data sovereignty network with Carroll.
“It’s a one-way data highway coming from tribal governments — leaving tribal governments and going into the feds — and it’s not coming back,” said Small-Rodriguez. She also directs the Data Warriors Lab, working with tribes — including her own Northern Cheyenne Tribe of Montana — to develop legal mechanisms to ensure data ownership.
She said the federal government should provide funding, as part of its treaty obligations, to pay for expensive data support such as secure storage systems, high-performance computers and analytics staff.
“As part of our treaty rights, we have a right to health care and education. We have a right to clean water and air — and data form the basis for all of that,” she said.
State data agreements
In January, the Tulalip Tribes in northwest Washington state secured a data-sharing agreement with the state department of health. It gives the tribes access to the state’s disease reporting system, allowing them to extract some data directly. Tulalip plans to eventually secure access to more datasets.
It’s the first agreement of its kind in the state, said Summer Hammons, legislative policy analyst in the Treaty Rights and Governmental Affairs Department of the Tulalip Tribes, which has at least 5,000 members. Hammons grew up on the reservation.
She hopes it will help the tribe direct resources and funds where they’re needed — whether it’s more cancer screenings or vaccinations against diseases such as measles, as other states grapple with outbreaks of the virus.
“It allows us to collaborate and lead on outbreak investigations related to tribal members,” Hammons said. “It’s a clear outline that tribes own their data in partnership with the state, because the state’s the one that’s collecting it. But we want to tell our story, and we want to be able to work with DOH [department of health] to be mindful of our stories and to also get better access to the statistics.”
For Indian Country, federal cuts decimate core tribal programs

A few other states — Alaska, Arizona, Oregon and South Dakota — also have limited-scope agreements with tribes.
Gary Ferguson, Unangax (Aleut), is the director of integrative medicine at Tulalip Health Clinic. He said he hopes the data will help the tribe track health care interventions over time.
“We don’t know what’s working. We don’t know what’s not working,” he said. “We want to celebrate our wins.”
Tracking disease
In recent years, the nation has seen alarming surges in congenital syphilis, a preventable infection passed through pregnancy to newborns. Nearly 40% can be stillborn or die as a newborn. Babies can also suffer lifelong blindness or deafness. Tribal babies suffer the highest rate.
Officials at the Great Plains Tribal Epidemiology Center, which tracks tribal public health across four states, were denied syphilis data from local public health departments for years until the group leaned on the CDC for assistance.
It wasn’t until then that, finally, last year, one state — South Dakota — agreed to share American Indian and Alaska Native syphilis cases as soon as they’re reported, said Sarah Shewbrooks, the group’s lead tribal epidemiologist.
Shewbrooks hopes the access in South Dakota will pave the way for more agreements in the other Great Plains states.
‘We needed this yesterday’
During COVID-19, American Indian and Alaska Native people were more likely to be infected and compared with white people, had double the risk of in-hospital death and three times the rate of severe infection, research shows. Yet even then, data weren’t telling the whole story.
Echo-Hawk’s organization published a report card in 2021 that scored each state’s collection of Natives’ COVID-19 cases. In total, the nation averaged a D+. This year, she published a follow-up for epidemiologists on addressing the misclassification of Native people, who often are listed as “white” or “Hispanic” in health settings and death certificates. Many states also inconsistently or don’t report tribal affiliation on death certificates, which can make tribe-specific death rates elusive.
A report in 2021 from the nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office found that some officials from the CDC and the Indian Health Services agency didn’t recognize that they were required by law to share data with tribal epidemiology centers, the centers told investigators.
In the GAO report, investigators detailed logistical barriers, including federal agencies’ reluctance to share COVID-19 data because of concerns around privacy and security in data transmission.
“This is one of the best examples of what structural racism looks like,” said Shewbrooks. “Because when you look at the infrastructure for public health systems and public health data, tribes and [tribal epidemiology centers] were never included in that infrastructure.
“COVID really put it up there as: No, we needed this yesterday.”
Shewbrooks said that as part of her work she’d go to funeral directors, who may fill out death certificates, throughout the region to educate them on proper classification of American Indian people. “I even had one say to me once, ‘I just always code them by how they look. I never ask what their race is.’”
“A lot of them didn’t know that this is data that gets really used,” she said. “Vital records data is just super important, foundational work in a lot of epidemiological work.”

There is no national standard for tribal health data, explained Cheryl Ellenwood, who is a citizen of the Nez Perce Nation and also Diné (Navajo).
Ellenwood, an assistant professor in Washington State University’s School of Politics, Philosophy and Public Affairs, experienced firsthand the data disconnect when both her parents died of COVID-19.
Four years ago this month, her mother, Annie Benally Ellenwood, an enrolled Navajo tribal member from New Mexico, died at age 71 in a hospital in Idaho. Annie Ellenwood’s death, however, wouldn’t show up in primary statistics of COVID-19 deaths in Navajo people — her tribe isn’t listed on her death certificate.
“I was very hurt by this, because my mother died because of COVID-19, and I wanted her death to count and mean something,” Ellenwood said.
“It still feels very life and death, like we are fighting to demonstrate the impact of so many things on our people,” she said.

Jeanne Shaheen's U.S. Senate seat (from left): U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas (file photo by Will Steinfeld/New Hampshire Bulletin); U.S. Rep. Maggie Goodlander (file photo by Annmarie Timmins/New Hampshire Bulletin); and former Gov. Chris Sununu (file photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin).After U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen announced she wouldn’t seek reelection in mid-March after almost two decades representing New Hampshire, multiple Granite State politicos quickly jumped into action to position themselves as frontrunners in the race to replace her.
U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas, a Democrat representing New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District in the House, is openly considering a run for the seat and has embarked on a 10-county listening tour of the state.
“On paper at least, he’s the most logical successor,” Dante Scala, a political science professor at the University of New Hampshire, said. “He’s been through a number of different elections both at the state level and now since 2018 as congressman. So this would be the obvious next step up for him.”
Pappas, whose district includes Manchester, Laconia, and the Seacoast, has served in Congress since 2018 when he became the first gay man elected to represent New Hampshire in Congress. If elected, he would be the first openly gay male U.S. senator.
“Pappas is very much, even in these days, not a polarizing figure,” Scala continued. “He’s squarely in the Democratic camp, but will occasionally make an effort to reach across the aisle.”
The Lugar Center ranked Pappas as the most bipartisan Democrat in Congress in 2023. Some of his most notable moves as congressman involved crossing the aisle to vote with Republicans, such as when he opposed the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act — which would’ve legalized marijuana federally. He also supported the Laken Riley Act — an immigration and law enforcement bill passed in the wake of a Georgia teenager’s tragic death that has been criticized by progressives and immigration advocates.
“He’s had a very successful track record running for the 1st District, which is kind of a difficult swing district,” Scala said. “On paper, it makes sense. I think the wildcard in all of this is Maggie Goodlander.”
Democratic U.S. Rep. Maggie Goodlander, who represents New Hampshire’s 2nd Congressional District, is also considering a run for the seat, her team told the Bulletin. This would pit the Granite State’s two House representatives against one another in a primary. 
“If (Goodlander) decides not to run, then (Pappas is) clearly the heavy favorite to be the Democratic nominee,” Scala said. “There might be some sort of challenge, but I think Goodlander would clearly be the most formidable one.”
Goodlander, whose district includes Nashua, Concord, and the North Country, has been in office only a few months. Scala dismissed the idea that Goodlander might be concerned about it being too early in her tenure as a representative to abandon that post in favor of the Senate or about two of the state’s most prominent Democrats cannibalizing each other.
“Goodlander, last year she demonstrated to me that she doesn’t always follow the conventional wisdom,” he said. “The conventional wisdom last year was that, ‘Well, she’s a carpetbagger. She’s just taking advantage of an open seat in order to move into the district. She’s not gonna get the support of local people who see her as someone who’s coming in from out of state.’ And she ignored all of it, and she did really well.”
Goodlander beat out Republican Lily Williams for her seat in November’s election, earning 53% of the vote. In the primary, she defeated Colin Van Ostern with 61% of the vote. Before being sworn into elected office for the first time this year, Goodlander worked in President Joe Biden’s Department of Justice, was a foreign policy adviser to former U.S. Sens. John McCain and Joe Lieberman and served as counsel to the House Judiciary Committee during President Donald Trump’s first impeachment hearings. While she’s a Nashua native, this work brought her out of state. Additionally, a couple years before her election, she and her husband purchased a home in Portsmouth, which is on the opposite side of the state as her current district, though she rents a home within her district. She’s only been in office a few months.
“You can point to all sorts of examples of politicians who decided to wait for one thing or another because it seemed prudent at the time, and then it turned out not to be so prudent,” Scala said. “The next opportunity never arose the way they thought it would.”
Scala noted that both Pappas and Goodlander leaving their own posts to seek a seat Shaheen, also a Democrat, just left could create anxieties for the party, which would also need to put up candidates to replace them both in the House. The candidates themselves would also have to worry about the risk they take by giving up their current positions in pursuit of this higher office.
“For both of them, you have something already,” he said. “Are you willing to risk it and at the end of the day wind up with nothing? That’s the thing they both have to be thinking about, especially as they circle each other.”
Scala says it comes down to each candidate’s “appetite for risk.”
“I suspect they’re thinking a lot more about what’s in it for them, not so much necessarily worrying about the party, but thinking about their own careers,” he said. “Politicians tend to be very ambitious and self-interested. That tends to be a very reliable barometer of their ultimate decisions.”
Another name being thrown around is former U.S. Rep. Annie Kuster, who represented the 2nd District in Congress until retiring from the post and being succeeded by Goodlander this year. She said she would consider running if Pappas doesn’t. However, Scala speculates that if Pappas doesn’t but Goodlander does, that would still be enough to scare her away from the race.
“I strongly suspect that if Pappas doesn’t get in, Goodlander is very likely to,” he said. “I don’t think she’s gonna sit there and watch Kuster get it. I’m a little doubtful that, when push comes to shove, Kuster will do anything.”
Scala thinks the Democratic primary election is Pappas’ or Goodlander’s to lose. Although, he imagines “there might be a lane” for a more progressive candidate in the style of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York or Bernie Sanders of Vermont to run to the left of these two moderates. But there are no prominent New Hampshire figures who have arisen to fill that role yet.
“The thing about New Hampshire politics is that, when you get past congressional seats, it’s a really steep drop off in terms of what your base in the party is,” he said. “State senator sounds impressive, executive councilor sounds impressive, but you’re not talking about a big base of voters who even know who you are. And name ID is really important.”
On the Republican side, the popular former Gov. Chris Sununu originally said he wouldn’t run for U.S. Senate in 2026, but just before Shaheen’s announcement, he publicly changed his mind and said he hasn’t ruled it out.
“Democrats were never able to figure out a way to beat him,” Scala said. “He would very clearly be national Republicans’ A-list candidate to run for U.S. Senate. All that’s true, but national Republicans wanted him to run twice already for U.S. Senate seats … but he’s declined both times.”
Scala said the former governor “likes to talk about running for the U.S. Senate, and he likes being talked about.” However, after leaving office, his mindset could be different.
“He is at loose ends right now,” Scala said. “He’s been out of office for a few months. Has that changed his mind about things?”
Sununu won four terms as New Hampshire’s governor and left office with high approval ratings. His governorship was characterized by deregulation and tax cuts; one of his notable accomplishments was implementing the “Doorway” program, an effort to better centralize and distribute substance use disorder treatment options. He was a moderate who often strayed from the policies and governance style of the first Trump administration, something Scala said would be more difficult to do in a federal position like senator than his state-level governorship.
Scott Brown is another Republican name being floated. The New Hampshire native was a U.S. senator representing Massachusetts before moving back to New Hampshire and unsuccessfully running against Shaheen for this same Senate seat in 2014. He was then appointed ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa in the first Trump administration.
Where Sununu has a “complicated relationship with Trump,” Scala said that “for Scott Brown, it’s pretty straightforward. He’d be perfectly happy being a Trumpy Republican if it gets him a seat in the Senate.”
Scala notes there’s a “weird dynamic” recently in New Hampshire where Republicans have “had lots of success on the state level, with Sununu, with the Legislature, but no success at all running for federal office.”
Dean Spiliotes, a political scientist and civic scholar at Southern New Hampshire University, said a general election between Pappas and Sununu would be “the marquee race.”
“If that were to happen, that would probably be one of the biggest spending races in the country,” Spiliotes said. “Races in this state have crept up in terms of costs over the years and this would probably be the most expensive, easily up over $100 million.”
Spiliotes said that includes both campaign money and money coming in from political action committees.
“It feels, to me, that for the most part, the race is frozen until we see what those two guys are gonna do,” he said. “I think Pappas will get in, but the big question mark is Sununu.”
He said Sununu has been “coy” about the race, but noted that he’s the only Republican figure besides Brown to be active recently.
“If Sununu gets in, Scott Brown’s not gonna be the nominee,” he said. “And I think he knows that as well.”
Spiliotes said Sununu’s decision likely comes down to whether his family wants him to pursue it, whether he has the stamina to run a campaign and serve in Congress after eight years as governor, and “whether he wants to insert himself into MAGA world.”
If there’s a primary between two candidates like Sununu and Brown, he wonders how Trump-influenced that primary is gonna be.
“Our governor races are typically not like that,” he explained. “New Hampshire governor’s races are typically center — slightly left of center, slightly right of center. But our congressional primaries on the Republican side in recent years have been more kind of Trump-focused, kind of MAGA-focused. So what would that look like? Could Sununu do his usual thing again where he’s sort of all things to different constituencies or would he have to kind of reinvent himself.”
“There aren’t a tremendous number of people on the bench on either side that would be able to command that kind of money and have that kind of name recognition in the state,” he said.
That includes Sununu and Pappas, who have both seen electoral success recently, but also Goodlander, who Spiliotes said can likely bring a lot of money through her national connections.
On Goodlander, Spiliotes isn’t sure voters these days care too much whether a candidate seems overly ambitious, and so the fact that Goodlander is so new to her current congressional seat won’t impact her prospects too much in his view. His biggest question on that potential matchup is how the two would differentiate from one another.
“Their campaign styles are not particularly polarizing,” he said. “They’re both smart. They both do their homework. They’re not ideologues or polarizing, and their temperaments are even very similar: sort of soft-spoken and moderate. I don’t know how they’d differentiate from each other other than experience.”
To earn her current role, Goodlander beat out Kuster’s anointed successor: Van Ostern. He’s another Democrat who’s been speculated about. Spiliotes worked with Van Ostern personally at SNHU where he helped the university launch its College for America program and said he’s a “smart guy very interested in public service.”
“My sense is, he’s probably gonna take a break from this for a while,” Spiliotes said. “Given the way that the Democratic primary went for him in the 2nd CD.”
After she announced she was retiring from her congressional seat, Kuster personally endorsed Van Ostern in the race to replace her. That made his defeat by Goodlander in the primary particularly tough. He also ran for New Hampshire governor in 2016, but was defeated by Sununu. He served on the Executive Council from 2013 to 2017.
“It doesn’t mean that he’s done politically,” Spiliotes said. “But if he wants to rebuild his political capital for future office, I think it’s going to take him a while to do that.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/pappasgoodsun-1024x590.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

Policy advocates and Democratic legislators pushed back on that idea, saying the move wouldn’t help relieve property tax struggles and would mean the loss of necessary government services due to lost revenue.
State Reps. Adam Mathews, R-Lebanon, and Brian Lampton, R-Beavercreek, presented their plan to the Ohio House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday to phase in the 2.75% flat tax over the next two years, by way of House Bill 30.
“This bill builds upon the work of previous General Assemblies to simplify and reduce the tax burden on Ohioans and ensure our state remains a destination for businesses to grow and attract people wishing to work, raise a family and truly thrive here,” Lampton told the committee.
Under the bill, 2025 non-business income tax would be reduced for the top income bracket – those making more than $102,400 – from 3.5% to 3.125%, with the bottom income bracket staying at 2.75%. In 2026, the top tax bracket is dropped further to 2.75%, matching that of the lower brackets.
According to the Legislative Service Commission breakdown of the bill, the tax for business income would remain at 3%.

In comparison with Pennsylvania’s 3.7% income tax and Indiana’s 3% rate, lowering Ohio’s rate as laid out in H.B. 30 would “put Ohio in a position to lead the Midwest with a lower tax than our neighbors, thereby making us an economic model for the region,” Mathews said.
Democrats on the committee questioned the move, especially as discussions of staggering property tax rates in the state are a top priority for constituents who reach out to their legislators.
“The one thing we are constantly hearing about is ‘do something about property taxes,’” said state Rep. Daniel Troy, D-Willowick. “This change of dropping the tax rate some more, it basically takes away the revenue that’s needed for property tax relief.”
Tax collections from the state General Revenue Fund feed the Public Library Fund as well, which has seen a $27 million drop in the last budget, and library systems are struggling to get by as they await the next budget decisions related to their state funds and potential federal cuts.
State Rep. Elgin Rogers, D-Toledo, pointed to that loss as another way the flat tax could cause damage, along with cuts to other important government services.
“Everyone wants their taxes cut,” Rogers said. “With that, there are cuts in government services and also, we want a strong Ohio that’s educated, and it’s my belief that this will have a a negative impact on the Public Library Fund.”
Republicans on the committee seemed supportive of the bill, with state Rep. Steve Demetriou, R-Bainbridge Twp., laying out a different outlook on the tax changes.
“When we’re talking about taxes, this money doesn’t belong to anyone else except the taxpayer,” Demetriou said. “It doesn’t belong to the state, it doesn’t belong to the libraries, it doesn’t belong to the schools. It’s their money, so we’re just helping get more of that back into their pockets.”
The think tank Policy Matters Ohio released information about House Bill 30 just before the measure had its first committee hearing. An analysis of the bill from the group found the bill would “tax the income of everyday Ohioans at the same rate as the state’s wealthiest households.”
“With H.B. 30, librarians and school teachers will pay the same tax rate as professional athletes and corporate CEOs,” according to Bailey Williams of Policy Matters Ohio. “A flat tax is a handout to the most well-off among us – and it will devastate Ohio’s ability to provide services that benefit everyone.”
Citing the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, the think tank said H.B. 30’s tax changes would cost the state an estimated $1.1 billion, with more than 98% of that going to Ohioans with income in the top 20%.
The Public Library Fund and the Local Government Fund were both mentioned by Policy Matters as pots of money that would be reduced, thereby shifting the burden onto taxpayers through local property tax levies.
Public libraries have been vocal about the need for more state support to keep up with inflationary costs and the rising demand for the many services Ohio libraries provide to their communities, from literature and materials to social services and tax help.
Lampton told the committee the tax changes wouldn’t necessarily mean a reduction in the overall General Revenue Fund, and “to say it will cut library spending may or may not be a direct result of that.”
H.B. 30 will be subject to further hearings in the House Ways and Means Committee, including opportunities for testimony for and against the measure.

In this case, the spa was injecting patients with “counterfeit” Botox that the operator said she’d gotten from a California dentist she wouldn’t identify. The board said the business also was distributing other drugs suspected to be counterfeit, including some obtained in “cash purchases” off of Facebook.
This is at least the third time this year that the board has seized the license of a company operating beauty spas on charges of using fake drugs on their patients. In January, it suspended the licenses of two companies operating clinics in Columbus, Cleveland, Dayton and Cincinnati on charges that they were fobbing off unapproved weight-loss drugs known as GLP-1s on their patients. 
The instances raised concerns that many so-called “wellness” clinics were putting profits over patient safety.
The board on Tuesday summarily suspended the license of Rejuv and Renew Wellness Spa to distribute dangerous drugs. The business operates locations in Mainville and Franklin, both in Warren County between Cincinnati and Dayton.
The order suspending the license says that Board of Pharmacy inspectors visited the spa’s Mainville location on March 14. 
They found Botox, an injection used to reduce wrinkles and facial lines; Liporase, an enzyme used to undo some skin procedures, and Xeomin, a drug similar to Botox. The Botox vial lacked a National Drug Code and a manufacturer’s hologram, while the Liporase vials “had characters of an unknown language on the label,” the inspection report said.
Three days later, on March 17, drug distributor AbbVie confirmed that the Botox inspectors found was counterfeit, the inspection report said. Inspectors said they also confirmed that the Liporase found at the spa had not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
A call to the spa wasn’t returned on Wednesday.

But Patty Cantrell, a registered nurse who co-owns the spa, said she’d gotten the drug from a dentist in the Bay Area of California, the report said.
“RN Cantrell was not willing to share the name of the dentist or the specific location from which she ordered/he shipped from,” the report said. “She said she knew him from high school and considered him a friend.”
Cantrell later told inspectors that she had been getting Botox through Allergan, an AbbVie company. But then late last year, she started getting it from the California dentist for about half the price, the report said.
Cantrell also said that she had purchased the Liporase off of Facebook for cash, and that she didn’t have documentation for the purchases. Then she seemed to allow that only some of the drugs her business was giving patients would pass muster with the pharmacy board.
“She asked that ‘if’ the Xeomin was found to be real, could she get the money back,” the report said. “She stated the product taken was worth $1,000.00 and she did not want to lose the money. She was able to produce invoices for the Xeomin.” 
The report alleged numerous other violations. They included distributing dangerous drugs at the Franklin spa even though it wasn’t registered with the Board of Pharmacy, improper storage and record keeping, and having expired and adulterated drugs.
In ordering the spa to surrender its license, the pharmacy board cited dozens of potential violations of the law and board rules, each of which carry possible fines and criminal penalties.

(Photo by Senior Airman Nichelle Anderson/U.S. Air Force)As Maryland continues to adapt to a rapidly changing job market, we must equip our students with the tools they need to succeed. House Bill 772, currently before the Maryland General Assembly, presents an opportunity to strengthen career readiness for middle and high school students by ensuring dedicated funding for the Career Counseling Program, a program established nearly two years ago through Pillar 3 of the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future.
As representatives of the Maryland Workforce Association, we strongly support this bill and urge legislators to pass it without delay.
Too many students graduate without a clear plan for their future, unsure of what careers align with their skills and interests. Many are unaware of the diverse job opportunities available in their home counties and in Maryland, including those in high-demand fields like health care, information technology and skilled trades. Without proper career guidance, students may end up underemployed or disengaged from the workforce altogether.
At the same time, Maryland faces a growing skills gap. Employers are struggling to find qualified workers, and many high-paying jobs go unfilled simply because young people are not aware of these career paths. Early exposure to career options and individualized counseling can bridge this gap, ensuring that students make informed decisions about their futures while strengthening our state’s workforce.

HB 772 will ensure that local workforce development boards continue to receive dedicated funding to support the Career Counseling Program in schools. If passed, the bill requires county boards of education to allocate funds based on student enrollment, with a per student amount that adjusts for inflation each fiscal year. These resources will enable us to continue to provide individualized career planning, connecting students with employers, internships, apprenticeships, and vocational training programs.
One of the Blueprint’s most significant advantages, which would be shored up in passing this bill, is its emphasis on collaboration. By leveraging the expertise and resources of Maryland’s workforce development boards, we can provide better support to county public schools, which often lack the capacity to fully implement career coaching programs on their own. Workforce boards bring connections to employers, access to industry-specific training programs and a deep understanding of regional labor market needs.
To date, local workforce boards have collectively hired more than 200 professionals to provide career counseling and guidance in middle and high schools across the state. In addition, over 190,000 students were reached through workforce-led career counseling in the program’s first year alone. This collaborative approach ensures that students receive comprehensive, real-world career guidance that school systems alone often struggle or do not have the bandwidth to provide.
As we know, there are many conversations surrounding budget and cost as Gov. Wes Moore and the General Assembly work to address the $3 billion deficit we currently face. The Blueprint and funding for its various pillars have not been safe from the conversation. However, the reality is that the long-term benefits of career coaching far outweigh the initial investment. By preventing career missteps and reducing the number of graduates who struggle with job instability, we create a more self-sufficient and prosperous workforce.
Maryland has a responsibility to prepare its students for success in an increasingly competitive job market. Protecting the funding for career counseling established by the Blueprint through passing House Bill 772 is a vital step in achieving this goal, will ensure the fruits of this hard work aren’t lost and that students will continue to benefit from the program. We urge lawmakers to support this legislation and invest in the future of our students and our state.
Together, we can create a stronger workforce, a more resilient economy, and brighter futures for Maryland’s young people. Now is the time to act — let’s keep career readiness a priority.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/251171-1024x735.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

LANCASTER, OHIO — Kim Barlag knew she couldn’t let women be canceled.
For nearly two decades, Ohio University’s Lancaster campus hosted an annual conference to “promote and advance gender equity by recognizing the past, present, and future achievements of women from diverse ages and backgrounds.” Known as Celebrate Women, it featured awards honoring women in leadership, panels on business and civic engagement and service opportunities. The plan for this year was to collect food and school supplies for university students facing financial hardship.
Celebrate Women became a much-anticipated Women’s History Month tradition in this central Ohio city of 40,000, just 30 miles southeast of Columbus, the state capital. But then, on the eve of its 19th year, politics intervened.
On March 6, two weeks and a day before the event, Ohio University announced that the conference had been “placed on hold … in light of recent guidance from the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights,” which threatened to withhold federal funding to institutions that do not conform to the Trump administration’s notion of anti-discrimination. The university’s decision followed the cancellation of a reunion for Black alumni, another regular occurrence in previous years.

When she heard the news about the women’s conference, Barlag, herself an alumnus and the president of the Chamber of Commerce in nearby Pickering, cycled through a series of emotions: disappointment, sadness, anger, resolve.
“I guess I should have seen it coming after that happened, but I was still surprised,” she told The 19th. “I was pretty devastated. I shed a few tears. Then I thought: Action makes people feel better. How can we save this event? We needed to act fast.”
She called and emailed other women leaders in the area — including some who, like her, had been scheduled to participate in Celebrate Women panels — to gauge their interest in reviving the conference as a non-university event. Their response, Barlag said, was “gung ho.” The plans for the new event came together quicker than Pam Kaylor, a communications professor who organized Celebrate Women for the university, was able to notify participants of the previous one’s cancellation.
The independent event had a new name, We Rally & We Rise Women’s Conference, and it brought together some 300 women at the Crossroads Event Center in Lancaster last week. Many Celebrate Women sponsors shifted their support and some new sponsors signed on, angry about the cancellation — Barlag took to calling it “mad money.” Organizers handed out branded tote bags and notebooks. The event raised money for local nonprofit organizations. Speakers shared strategies to conquer anxiety and impostor syndrome. The boxed lunches were made by a nonprofit caterer that employs survivors of sex trafficking. The writing on the back of attendees’ name tags captured the vibe: “Welcome All BABS!!! BAD ASS BITCHES. Yes, you read that correctly.”
As Barlag opened the conference, the audience’s enthusiastic response “set me off my game there for a minute” because “it was so powerful and inspiring,” she later said.
“The energy was great — people were grateful to have a conference to attend, to be together, a show of force in support,” she added.

Lancaster may be close to the state’s capital, but it’s the county seat in an agricultural region of pig and cattle farms. Lancaster itself is known for its glassware — the hometown company, Anchor Hocking, is named for the Hocking River, which snakes through the city. Once one of the world’s largest manufacturers of glassware, Anchor Hocking went through a merger, then a bankruptcy. Like in so many small cities and towns, Lancaster’s historic downtown became a symbol of economic decline in the post-industrial Rust Belt. In recent years, though, Lancaster’s population began to tick up again.
Fairfield County is a Republican stronghold in presidential elections. President Lyndon Johnson, in 1968, is the only Democrat who has won there since 1944. Republican President Donald Trump’s America-first economic message resonated with voters who have watched Lancaster struggle, then rebound. In 2024, close to 62 percent of the county’s voters cast ballots for Trump and Vice President JD Vance, who was then one of the U.S. senators for Ohio. The state, a one-time presidential bellwether that has in recent cycles grown more conservative, backed Trump over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris by 55-to-44 percent.
In this slice of Trump Country, personal interpretations of the reasons for the cancellation of Celebrate Women are a sort of political Rorschach test. Some left-leaning voters believe it was the inevitable result of Trump’s assault on diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, a broad concept that his administration has deployed to challenge and threaten institutions deemed too liberal. Some conservative-leaning voters believe the cancellation to be an overly cautious move by the university — and potentially a way to make the new administration look bad.
One thing on which women on both sides agree is that they should not be silenced.
“There is dissent about how we came to this place,” Fairfield County Auditor Carri Brown, an elected Republican, acknowledged during her opening remarks. But “when we’re told we cannot celebrate women, we’ll respond by saying, ‘Yes we can’ … and we’ll rally and we’ll rise!”
When she described diversity as “not a bad word” but a “blessing,” the crowd applauded and some rose to their feet. “I have a very strong faith in America,” Brown said.

Ohio University’s decision to cancel the Celebrate Women event is the latest skirmish between conservative politicians and the elite institutions of higher education that they have long charged with being hostile to their political viewpoints, with so-called DEI efforts at colleges and universities now front and center to their case.
A February 14 “dear colleague” letter from the civil rights office of Trump’s Department of Education to colleges and universities alleged an “embrace of pervasive and repugnant race-based preferences and other forms of racial discrimination” at the expense of White students. It noted that federal law “prohibits covered entities from using race in decisions pertaining to admissions, hiring, promotion, compensation, financial aid, scholarships, prizes, administrative support, discipline, housing, graduation ceremonies, and all other aspects of student, academic, and campus life.” Noncompliance would risk the federal funding that nearly all colleges and universities receive.
Though the letter made no direct mention of gender, it put university administrators on alert as they sought to identify any programming that could jeopardize their funding. When the Department of Education, which Trump now seeks to dismantle, launched investigations against more than 50 education institutions, it included two in Ohio: the University of Cincinnati and the Ohio State University.
Judith Cosgray, a librarian and leader of an arts nonprofit who has attended Celebrate Women on and off for the past 15 years, described its cancellation as a balloon deflating when its attendees most needed a lift.
“I understand that they’re afraid of losing their funding, I understand that, but sometimes you’ve got to stand up, too,” Cosgray said in between conference sessions.
In addition to the various executive orders and directives that Trump has made about DEI, the Ohio legislature, where Republicans hold a veto-proof majority in part due to unconstitutional gerrymandering, recently approved a higher education bill that bans DEI training, scholarships and offices, and contains admonitions about teaching “controversial” topics. It is expected to be sent to GOP Gov. Mike DeWine for his signature as early as this week.
A spokesperson for DeWine did not respond to a request to comment on whether he will sign the anti-DEI legislation or if, by his estimation, events like Celebrate Women would fall under its purview. The office of GOP state House Speaker Matt Huffman likewise did not respond to the same question by publication time.

Celebrate Women isn’t the only recent example of how the assault on DEI across public life has led to a seeming prohibition on celebrating the accomplishments of women, with many actions taken during March, the month specifically earmarked to remember such events.
Information about the first woman to pass Marine infantry training was among some 26,000 photos and online posts marked for deletion as part of a DEI purge at the Defense Department, the Associated Press reported. A page about Golden Girls actor Bea Arthur, one of the first to serve in the Marine Corps Women’s Reserve, also disappeared. There are reports that Arlington National Cemetery scrubbed its website of references related to notable women veterans.
It isn’t limited to women. A Defense Department webpage that described the military service of Black civil rights icon and baseball player Jackie Robinson disappeared — and then reappeared. Information about the Tuskegee Airmen, the first Black military pilots who served in World War II, when the U.S. military was still segregated, has also vanished. Outcry over the removal of webpages about the Navajo Code Talkers who served during the same war led to their restoration. “History is not DEI,” Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said as the department scrambled to respond.
Tabitha Stover, a financial adviser who describes herself as liberal, attended Celebrate Women for the first time last year. Despite spending most of her life in Lancaster, she didn’t know anyone at the event, but found the group kind and inviting. She was disappointed to hear this year’s conference would not move forward, then heartened when We Rally & We Rise took its place. She has vacillated about who was to blame, but described it as an event that brings people together instead of driving them apart.
Stover shared a table with a group of colleagues from the area branch of a national nonprofit organization focused on youth mentorship. Several of them are friends of hers on Facebook; she knows the women have what she called “very different” politics from one another.
“And yet we’re all here sitting at the same table,” Stover said.

(Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)In a March 5 ruling, the Merit Systems Protection Board ordered the U.S. Department of Agriculture to temporarily reinstate nearly 6,000 probationary employees who had been terminated en masse on Feb. 13.
The ruling found reasonable grounds to believe that the terminations had violated “Federal laws and regulations governing reductions-in-force (RIFs) and probationary terminations.”
Six days later, the USDA issued its own announcement indicating that it would “place all terminated probationary employees in pay status and provide each with back pay, from the date of termination.” while they develop a phased plan for their return to work.
My wife was one of the 6,000 USDA probationary employees unceremoniously fired Feb. 13 at the behest of Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency. We observed these developments with mixed emotions.
On the one hand, we felt vindicated. One of the most insulting elements of the terminations — the baseless claim that they were a result of poor performance — was central to the decision declaring the firings unlawful. But vindication is not always comforting.
For many recently terminated federal employees — including my wife — the leadup to their termination was more disconcerting than the firing itself. During this period, they received a flurry of emails that communicated veiled threats about the permanence of their positions and a disregard for the value of their work. The result was a hostile state of limbo.
Much of this seemed intentional. As Russel Vought, director of the United States Office of Management and Budget, said: “We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected. … We want them to not want to go to work because they are increasingly viewed as the villains.”
So, when my wife received news of her termination, there was a limited sense of relief that this kind of hostility and uncertainty was over.
Some of our federal employee friends who were fired have left Kansas, moved in with their families or are interviewing for new positions. For them, the news that they were to be “temporarily reinstated” plunged them back into uncertain waters and made it difficult to plan for the future.
As my wife interviews for new jobs and considers alternative career paths, she knows that she may be “rehired” at any moment. But even then there is no guarantee that she wouldn’t simply be fired again in a few months.
The ruling and this renewed uncertainty highlighted the irony that the Department of Government Efficiency is creating an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency.
In keeping with the meme and trolling lore that informs Musk and DOGE’s operations, it was as if they couldn’t resist justifying the termination of thousands of probationary employees with an unwarranted slight about their performance. In doing so, they contravened standard reduction in force procedures.
As a result, 6,000 federal employees will receive salary and benefits for a month of inactivity. Moreover, they will continue to be paid to stay at home while the USDA works
out a plan for some of them to be reinstated while others are dismissed in line with standard procedures. How’s that for government efficiency?
Across the country, the chaos and unpredictability of the Musk/DOGE cuts have made it significantly harder for individual offices to function. For government employees and department leaders alike, planning projects and managing schedules has become nearly impossible when there’s no certainty about who will still have a job tomorrow, or whether funding for critical projects will remain in place.
Had Musk and DOGE pursued their cuts in a more methodical manner, much of this waste, disruption, and inefficiency could have been avoided.
But focusing on these inefficiencies alone is to miss the forest for the trees. The recklessness of Musk and DOGE isn’t just the byproduct of their adherence to meme and troll culture — it is a deliberate strategy rooted in their fundamental disdain for the civil service itself. They are not trying to fix the system, they are trying to break it. By creating dysfunction, they validate their own argument that the government doesn’t work.
When Musk pranced around on stage at the CPAC conference with his “chainsaw for bureaucracy” he wasn’t signaling his intentions for methodical restructuring or communicating a new vision for the federal workforce. He was foreshadowing its demise. Indeed, had he been able to wield a diesel-powered clear cut logging machine, it would have been a much more honest portrayal of his intentions.
Concerned citizens should take note of the individual abuses and waste generated by DOGE while remaining aware of its broader agenda. The ultimate goal is for the public to relinquish responsibility for protecting public lands, conserving wildlife, and preserving history and archaeology based on the flimsy hope that the private sector might do a better job. As I wrote last time, this is a very dubious proposition.
Before concluding, I want to address two anticipated criticisms.
The first is the inevitable whataboutism that will point to previous administrations’ callousness toward workers, such as Joe Biden’s suggestion in 2019 that displaced coal miners could transition to tech jobs, stating: “Anybody who can go down 3,000 feet in a mine can sure as hell learn to program as well.”
This type of response assumes both my endorsement of such frivolous remarks and my political affiliations, which are  false and irrelevant respectively. More importantly, it serves as a deflection — an excuse to avoid engaging with the problems that Musk and DOGE have created. Rather than fostering solidarity over shared grievances, the “welcome to the club” comments I expect to receive will be laden with schadenfreude, as if the real takeaway is that the “other side” is finally feeling the same pain.
The second likely criticism is a perceived lack of gratitude for the back pay my wife and thousands of other civil servants are receiving. But this overstates the value of money as a remedy for the confusion, disrespect, and upheaval. It also misjudges the character of many federal workers like my wife.
For those dedicated to preserving history, safeguarding public lands, and protecting national parks and wildlife, the work itself is more important than the paycheck. They don’t just want compensation. They want to return to their jobs and continue serving the public.

DeWine’s proposed tobacco tax hike from the state budget.
When DeWine rolled out his child tax credit increase as the centerpiece of his final budget proposal, he assured lawmakers in the General Assembly that he would finance it with an increase to the state tobacco tax.
The tobacco tax is not necessarily tied to the child tax credit. The tax credit will be paid for partially through foregone revenue and partially through payments from the state General Revenue Fund. But the governor was trying to “show his work” that he was balancing the budget with this particular proposal.
Much breath has been lost and ink has been spilled by those critical of tobacco taxes as a financing mechanism. Meanwhile, the most powerful human impact of a tobacco tax took a backseat in the discussion: its ability to discourage smoking. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Smoking reigns as the number one preventable cause of death in the state of Ohio. Tobacco kills more than three times as many people as heroin in the state of Ohio every single year. This state has a special problem with it: Ohio has the 4th-highest smoking rate in the country, behind only West Virginia, Kentucky, and Louisiana. The state tobacco tax is an evidence-based strategy to discourage its use and save lives.
A 2011 report by the American Cancer Society projected the impacts of tobacco tax increases across each of the 50 states. In this report, researchers estimated the impacts of a $1-per-pack increase in tobacco tax in each of the states. This would equate to about a $1.44 increase in 2025 after accounting for inflation, which makes this study very helpful for analyzing the potential impacts of DeWine’s proposed $1.50 increase.
According to the American Cancer Society study, a tobacco tax increase would cause 59,000 adult residents of Ohio to quit smoking and prevent 72,000 youth from beginning to smoke in the first place. They also project a tobacco tax would save 56,500 lives by causing people to quit and preventing smoking habits from developing.
In addition to saving lives, the study projected the tax would reduce health care spending. This includes savings of $8.4 million in lung cancer treatment, $20.3 million in heart attack and stroke treatment, $5.7 million in Medicaid spending, and $22.2 million in smoking-related pregnancy treatment savings in the first five years of the program.
Some anti-poverty advocates worry about the potential household financial harm from a cigarette tax. In particular, people who are current smokers and unlikely to quit, especially those who are low-income, will bear the largest burden of the increased tax. To support smoking cessation, policymakers can invest funds toward evidence-based programs like tobacco quitlines and anti-smoking media campaigns. By preventing people from taking up smoking, Ohio can mitigate the impacts of health problems and the higher economic burdens imposed by tobacco taxes.
The tobacco tax is a powerful tool the state of Ohio has to reduce smoking rates, reduce medical spending, and save lives. If the general assembly cuts this program, they will be voting for more smokers and more deaths. On the other hand, if this increase makes its way back to the governor’s desk in June, we are likely to see progress on one of Ohio’s largest public health fronts.

C.T. Wilson (D-Charles) said his 2023 bill meant to help victims of sexual abuse get justice could potentially bankrupt the state. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Attorneys representing hundreds of people with allegations of sexual abuse while in state custody said a late-session attempt to limit financial damages is insulting and likely unconstitutional.
The state faces what could be billions in potential financial settlements under the 2023 Child Victims Act, which made it easier for child sex abuse victims file claims against public and private institutions.
The House Judiciary Committee, which passed that law, is now being asked to consider changes in an effort to limit liabilities some believe could bankrupt state government.
“We’re in a very different situation, and as stewards, fiduciaries of taxpayers money, you really have to think things through on this,” said Del. N. Scott Phillips (D-Baltimore County), a member of thec ommittee. “I voted wholeheartedly for CVA, and I believe in it. At the same time, I’ve got to say this is impacting the state of Maryland … in a really challenging way.”
The committee held a hearing Wednesday on House Bill 1378 by Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles), the sponsor of the 2023 law. He said HB1378 is an attempt to hold the state “accountable for all the atrocities committed within the facilities, while recognizing the financial constraints that come with governance.”
“We’re not a private corporation. We do not have endless reserves, nor can we shift the cost to the shareholders,” Wilson said of the potential impact of the 2023 law. “You must maintain a responsible budget, while safeguarding the central services that millions of people depend upon, including education, public safety and health care.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The passage of the 2023 law was personal for Wilson, who himself is a survivor of physical and sexual abuse as a child. He said the law, which he worked more than a decade to pass, was not about the money.
“I just wanted people to have an opportunity to come and tell their story,” Wilson said. “That’s what they begged for — giving survivors a voice, allowing them to acknowledge their pain, and making sure they know that Maryland hurt them, however, but what’s definitely changed is our understanding of the fiscal realities.”
The bill proposed this session by Wilson, chair of the House Economic Matters Committee, would reduce the maximum payout that each plaintiff could receive. It also would require each case to go through a mandatory arbitration process before seeking a civil jury trial.
Amendments provided to the committee ahead of Wednesday’s hearing establish a mandatory arbitration process that plaintiffs would participate in before they could seek a jury trial. Payouts made through the arbitration process would be public, though victims could request their identities be withheld.
The new draft of the bill substantially reduces potential claims.
First, it removes a plaintiff’s ability to seek damages for each instance of abuse. Instead, awards would be based on the individual claimant, regardless of the number of times they alleged abuse.
The maximum award would remain at the current $890,000 for those who sue before Oct. 1, 2025, but drop to a $400,000 award for those who file after then.
The changes would not lower liability caps for private institutions.
Wilson said he had assurances from Attorney General Anthony Brown that the proposed changes would pass constitutional muster. Neither Brown, who was on a list of witnesses for the hearing, nor anyone from his office appeared Wednesday.
With 12 days remaining in the 2025 legislative session, Wilson’s efforts are also in a race against the clock.
Lawmakers, concerned about the potential of billions in damages, are motivated to move quickly. But the bill must clear the Judiciary Committee and full House before heading to the Senate to begin the process again.
Opponents of the bill said the ever-changing proposal should be tabled for the session to allow a more thoughtful review.
“This is very ‘ready, shoot, aim’ legislation,” said Tom Yost, founder of Baltimore-based Yost Legal Group. “The bill was one thing on Saturday, a different thing on Sunday, a different thing on Wednesday.”

Wilson became emotional as he faced questions from Del. Robin L. Grammer Jr. (R-Baltimore County) about the fairness of reining in liability for the state but not for private institutions.
Wilson said state victims are “people who are trapped, not only being detained but being raped. When you compare that to a situation where they’re in a church, it’s a little bit different. It seems to me that the state seems to be the biggest offender here.”
He said that if Grammer wants to “punish and bankrupt the state, God bless you. You can do that, if that’s your goal, but it’s not mine.”
“It’s what you want to do to the taxpayer, I’ve told you what I want to do. I don’t have to explain any more than this,” he continued. “I’m sorry to be this way. I’m not going to sit here and go back with you. If you don’t like this and you want to go to the taxpayer, you screw them, because I’m not.”
When Grammer said he worried victims were getting lost in the debate, Wilson shot back, “Holy sh-t…. Who are you talking to? No, no, no, no.”
“Do you really think for a minute that I don’t know? Do you think I don’t know what the victims go through and do you think there’s any amount of money that’s going to make it better?” he said. “You can lie to yourself, but it’s not.”
House Judiciary Chair Luke Clippinger (D-Baltimore), attempted to tone down the exchange and called on another member of the committee to ask questions.
Wilson later apologized for the heated exchange.
Wilson’s proposal also faced criticism from attorneys representing clients with potential cases against the state.
Andrew Freeman, a partner at Brown, Goldstein & Levy told the committee the current law is “inadequate” to compensate survivors of institutional abuse. Reducing the amount to $400,000 per claimant “is more than inadequate consulting. It also is retroactive to the extent that we’re taking away the expectations that people have built.”
The change is also likely unconstitutional, he said, adding that it “would still be unconstitutional, no matter what it costs taxpayers.”
Freemen downplayed the potential for bankrupting the state. But he said taxpayers were responsible for the system that locked victims up and failed to protect them. That, he said, makes taxpayers “responsible for some sort of fair compensation to them. Is that going to cost money? Yes. Is that going to bankrupt the state? No.”
  Ben Crump, a nationally known civil rights and personal injury lawyer, said an effort to lower the cap on payouts for sexual abuse claims is “a shame before God.” (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)
Ben Crump, a national civil rights and personal injury attorney, said he and other attorneys want to work with Wilson to help “these victims right these historical wrongs.”
“While this is a human rights issue, I believe this is a civil rights issue as well because a substantial majority of the plaintiffs — over 90% of them — are African Americans,” Crump said. “The proposed amendment with the $400,000 ceiling I believe is an insult to them because these African American men and women were abused and raped as boys and girls when they were in the full custody of the Maryland juvenile detention facilities.”
Capping the damages on a per claimant basis is “not just denial of equal justice, I believe it is a shame before God.”
The size of the financial risk to the state is both an academic discussion lacking a lot of specifics and a budgetary boogeyman.
The 2023 law lifted limitations on filing lawsuits against institutions involved in hiding sexual abuse allegations and protecting abusers. It capped liability at $890,000 per occurrence. It also raised the liability limit on claims against private institutions for noneconomic damages, such as pain and suffering, to $1.5 million.
Much of the original focus was on the Roman Catholic Church. The Archdiocese of Baltimore filed for federal bankruptcy protection in September 2023, one month before the new law took effect, because of mounting claims.
But Wilson’s law also opened the door to lawsuits against state and local governments despite warnings from some lawmakers including Sen. Justin Ready (R-Carroll and Frederick).
Lawmakers were warned in January about the “enormous liability” facing the state. Legislative analysts at the time said there were 3,500 cases against the state alleging sexual abuse, some dating back as far as the 1960s.
The potential value of a settlement was not given to lawmakers at the time. Based on current law and the potential for a payout of $890,000 for each instance of abuse — which some lawmakers said remains an open legal question — the minimum payout approaches $3.1 billion, about as much as the structural budget deficit lawmakers were already facing in the coming budget year.
That amount could be much higher if claimants could collect on more than one occurrence. It could also be much lower depending on the outcome of settlement negotiations with plaintiffs’ attorneys, which have been ongoing.
One group of nearly two dozen firms claims it currently has 5,000 clients with potential claims against state agencies, including the Department of Juvenile Services.
Those attorneys said many of those clients have multiple instances of abuse. The potential liability to the state could run in the multiple billions of dollars.
Those attorneys said they have been in negotiations with the Office of the Attorney General since 2023 and have asked for a fraction of the potential full value. The attorneys declined to provide specifics of the potential liability or a settlement demand citing ongoing negotiations.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DSC_0091-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(File photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)There were repeated references to “my friend” from here or “the gentle lady” from there, but the niceties were overpowered by the shouting and the finger-pointing Wednesday during a second day of debate on the fiscal 2026 budget.
The House ultimately approved the $67 billion budget for next year, after three hours of debate — which was on top of seven hours of testy debate Tuesday, when House Democrats beat back a series of Republican amendments.
While Wednesday’s debate was shorter, it was no less heated, with the highlight — or lowlight, perhaps — coming in a shouting match between two Democrats that eventually pulled in the Speaker.
“I know this is not popular, as a person in the majority party … I stand here because I feel like I don’t have a place in this place anymore — I don’t. And it’s for some of these reasons in this very budget,” said Del. Sheree Sample-Hughes (D-Dorchester and Wicomico).
“It doesn’t look like what the Eastern Shore is in need of,” she said in explaining her “no” vote on the budget, which includes more than $2 billion in cuts and $1 billion in tax increases.
When House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) tried to tell her the allotted two minutes of floor time was up, Sample-Hughes steamrolled over the Speaker.
“And you know what, I’m not even going to talk about the budget stuff anymore, and yes I know that’s what the purpose is – I get that,” Sample-Hughes said. “This institution is not for everybody … ”

When Del. Stephanie Smith (D-Baltimore City), the House Parliamentarian, called a point of order to remind the delegate that her time was up, Sample-Hughes pushed right on through, leading Smith to shout over her. That didn’t stop Sample-Hughes, who was trying to press how the budget would affect her constituents.
“Parliamentarian, I hear you, but enough is enough,” Sample-Hughes said. “When I have an 80-year-old woman calling me saying she’s working with candles to light her house–”
As Jones brought the gavel down, Smith issued another warning. “The two minutes for the gentle lady,” she said, pausing for emphasis, “are over.”
“I can count,” Sample-Hughes shot back.
“Yes, but you must sit down,” Smith said. “You no longer have the floor.”
“I understand, the one last thing I will say,” Sample-Hughes continued, “and I was not trying to be controversial –”
“People are allotted two minutes to explain their – I can talk louder; do you want to do that?” Smith shouted, her frustration growing. “Sit down.”
“Let’s keep calm,” Jones jumped in. “You had your two minutes.”
Sample-Hughes yielded but not before saying, “Two minutes is up, but the passion for the people continues” — a line that drew a smattering of applause from House Republicans.
It was not the first flare-up of the day: Several delegates engaged in pointed remarks over the “core values” of Republicans and Democrats as they argued over what should be cut or preserved as the state works to close the $3 billion deficit for fiscal 2026.
“I’m disappointed that the minority party wants our citizens to go it alone based on their proposals on this budget. They want every man to fight for themselves,” said Del. Malcom P. Ruff (D-Baltimore City), citing a series of failed amendments Republicans proposed Tuesday.

Ruff said that despite $2.5 billion in spending cuts, he is proud that the proposed budget still funds programs in education and raises salaries for state workers.
“This is what our budget and our morals and our values are about  — stand 10 toes down,” he said, raising his voice to a level that Del. Jason Buckel (D-Allegany) later described as yelling.
“I appreciate my friend from Baltimore City, but I don’t appreciate being yelled at,” Buckel said. “If I did it too, you wouldn’t like it as much.”
But as Buckel’s comments went on, the volume of his comments also rose at times.
“We’re the only state in our damn region that has a multibillion-dollar budget deficit and needs to raise billions of dollars in taxes to do the same stuff that they do in Richmond,” he said raising his voice at the end.
“I don’t know if we know how things work here in Maryland,” he said. “They seem to know how they work in Virginia. They seem to know how they work in Pennsylvania, and Delaware and West Virginia. But we can’t seem to get it done here in Maryland.”
Despite the shouting and two hours of debate, the House voted 100-39 to approve House Bill 350, the main part of the budget , with Sample-Hughes joining Republicans to vote no.
About an hour later, the House voted 93-46 to approve the second prong of the budget in House Bill 352. In addition to Sample-Hughes, Democratic Dels. Brian Crosby of St. Mary’s County and Heather Bagnall of Anne Arundel County joined Republicans opposing the bill.

For the Day Eagle Hope Project, federal money has helped volunteers deliver fresh produce and meat to families in need across the remote Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in northern Montana — while putting cash into the hands of farmers, ranchers and meat processors.
The nonprofit generally has less than $300,000 to spend per year. So the $200,000 from a U.S. Department of Agriculture local food buying program drastically raised both the quantity and quality of the food it could distribute.
“They were a major, major contributor to our food,” said Tescha Hawley, who directs the organization, which aims to improve physical, mental and spiritual health.
The USDA recently nixed more than $1 billion from two programs that helped food banks and school meal programs buy local foods, including $660 million for schoolchildren. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins recently described the programs as “nonessential.”
But the move has left hundreds of school systems and food banks reeling. They already face rising food prices and are struggling to help community members with growing food insecurity.
State lawmakers embrace RFK Jr.’s health policies

Created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs aimed to build more resilient supply chains of domestic food by connecting schools and food pantries with small ranches, farms and dairies. The program was initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but later expanded by the Biden administration.
The federal programs stimulated the purchase of locally grown fruits, vegetables, dairy and meats — benefiting both the smaller farmers who received fair market pay for their products and the organizations granted funds to buy high quality foods.
The noncompetitive grants sent hundreds of millions of dollars to all 50 states, the District of Columbia and 84 tribal governments, boosting business for more than 8,000 farmers and providing local food to almost as many food banks. The Trump administration is killing the programs, despite Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s campaign against processed food, which he says is “poisoning” Americans.
Without ongoing funding, Hawley said, she would have to rely on cheaper, less nutritious food.
“It’s simple, right? I can get a truck … in here with all highly processed food, no problem,” she said.
Schools are facing a similar challenge: While officials running breakfast and lunch programs would prefer to buy more local products, those are often expensive. And with underfunding, high food costs and labor struggles, school lunch programs are already stretched thin.
In Milan, Tennessee, the federal funds allowed the local school system to buy minimally processed beef from a local stockyard, and broccoli, purple hull peas, tomatoes and melons from local growers.
Vickie Dunaway, who supervises the school system’s food services, told the Tennessee Lookout the federal cuts mean “going backwards” on purchasing healthier foods.
“That will obviously have to be cut out, because our budget will not withstand being able to purchase local,” she said. “Purchasing local, minimally processed food is way more expensive than buying from a distributor.”
 A ‘devastating’ cut to food banks

Late last year, USDA said the programs had already spent more than $1 billion on local foods, and announced an expansion of the two programs with an additional $1.13 billion. USDA has killed that $1.13 billion expansion; it is still reimbursing the previously committed funds.
The Trump administration, which has sought to dramatically slash the size of the federal government, told recipients earlier this month that the programs “no longer effectuate the goals of the agency.”
In a statement to Stateline, the USDA said the current administration is “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
“The COVID era is over — USDA’s approach to nutrition programs will reflect that reality moving forward,” the statement said.










The only thing we’ll be able to do is just ration what little we have — to spread it as thinly as possible over the number of households we provide food to.


– Eric Cooper, president and CEO of the San Antonio Food Bank


The nonpartisan National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, which represents the ag department leaders of all 50 states, last month lobbied the federal government to continue the local foods program with permanent funding and ease procurement regulations for school meal programs. Arkansas Secretary of Agriculture Wes Ward, president of the association, said in a statement that the local food programs aid both producers and consumers.
“Investing in local and regional food systems not only strengthens the connections between farmers and their local communities, it bolsters supply chain resiliency as well,” his statement read.
In New Mexico, the program allowed food banks to buy some 900,000 pounds of locally grown food from more than 200 farmers since 2023. Before the program was terminated, the state was expecting close to $3 million in additional funding, Source New Mexico reported.
‘The lifeblood of the community’: States invest to save rural grocery stores

Jill Dixon, executive director of The Food Depot in northern New Mexico, called the cuts “devastating.”
In Texas, the San Antonio Food Bank counted on USDA’s local food program to help round out the food boxes it provides to families in need. The food bank, which serves more than 100,000 people across 29 Texas counties, largely relies on donated foods from hotels, restaurants and grocery stores.
“The challenge is I might get peanut butter donated, but I don’t have the jelly, or I might have pasta donated, but I don’t have the marinara,” said Eric Cooper, president and CEO of the food bank. “This program allowed us to purchase those items that we didn’t get that then helped round out the food box, or really complement the food that was being donated to give families the ability to make meals.”
The program initially provided the food bank nearly $3 million in grant funding — about 20% of what the organization spends each year on bulk food purchases. It expected a similar amount this year, before USDA’s announcement.
Cooper said cuts come even as the need for assistance rises. Food prices have squeezed families, and mass layoffs of federal workers portend more demand for food assistance in the coming months, he said.
“And we’ll be caught in the middle. And you know, that’s an incredibly uncomfortable place to be. The only thing we’ll be able to do is just ration what little we have — to spread it as thinly as possible over the number of households we provide food to.”

 A boost for school lunches

For years, school meal programs have struggled with tight margins. Not only do they have to meet strict nutritional guidelines, but schools also face lagging reimbursement from the federal government and spend millions covering the cost of students’ unpaid meal debt.
At the 1,600-student Monticello School District in Arkansas, that debt is approaching $60,000.
So $50,000 from USDA’s local food program was a significant boost to the bottom line.
“That was such a help,” said Amanda West, the district’s child nutrition director.
The southeast Arkansas district used grant money to buy locally grown ground beef. The beef went into dishes including taco salad, meatloaf and spaghetti.
West said staff and students immediately noticed a difference in taste from conventionally purchased meats. And though the local product cost more, West said it also yielded more because it was not full of additives that cause the meat to shrink when cooked.
West, who is the president of the Arkansas School Nutrition Association, noted that her state is home to the nation’s highest rates of food insecurity.
Trump’s school choice push adds to momentum in statehouses

West had hoped to see the local foods program help turn that tide by bringing more stability to school meal programs and growing the state economy by boosting local farmers, ranchers and distributors.
“We’re all upset about it. I hate that we’re not receiving it because grocery prices are 30, 40% higher than what they were a few years ago, and it really hurts our budget,” she said. “It helped a lot of districts, including mine, and it would be amazing if we could get it back.”
On top of the local foods program cuts, congressional Republicans are considering billions in potential cuts to free and reduced-price school meal programs — cuts the School Nutrition Association says could potentially affect millions of American students.
The federal government partially subsidizes breakfast, lunch and after-school snack programs at rates calculated by the income level of students’ families.
The School Nutrition Association, which represents 50,000 school meal providers across the country, said the school meals are the healthiest many American children receive. But that group says federal reimbursements are far from adequate, leaving members worried about the future of their meal programs.
In a recent association survey of more than 1,390 school meal directors, more than 90% reported serious or moderate concern over the financial sustainability of their school meal programs three years from now.

The job of governing a state of 10 million people with a 60 billion dollar annual budget is big and serious business that requires elected leaders to read, think, learn, listen and work with people of widely differing views.
Unfortunately, this basic premise of elementary school civics seems to have escaped Republican state Representative Keith Kidwell.
  Screengrab from Rep. Kidwell’s Facebook page.
Kidwell — a veteran lawmaker who chairs three committees and ought to know how to behave like a grownup– nonetheless posted an image to his Facebook page this week of Gov. Josh Stein’s proposed state budget in a trashcan, along with the caption “appropriately filed.”
It was a juvenile and distinctly unhelpful stunt. First, Stein’s budget is a good proposal. Republicans will vote for most of it. Moreover, the governor has worked hard to build bridges during his first months in office and won praise from other GOP leaders for doing so.
The bottom line: even if Kidwell disagrees with some of the Governor’s budget, his disrespectful display is not the act of a serious lawmaker interested in governing. His constituents should be appalled.

(File photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)A Senate committee voted Wednesday to accept an amended version of its Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reform plan and send it to the full chamber, where a debate is expected to take place Friday.
The Budget and Taxation Committee 9-4 vote not only accepts portions of the “Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act” first submitted by Gov. Wes Moore (D), but it also voted to make the House version approved earlier this month conform to the Senate version. If approved by the full Senate sometime early next week, then both bills will be sent back to the House.
Because the delegates rejected many of the governor’s proposals, such as a four-year pause in the phase-in of collaborative time for teachers, the House is expected to reject the Senate plan, setting up a conference committee to hash out differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill.
The last day of the legislative session is April 7.
Before its vote Wednesday, the committee discussed amendments approved Tuesday night by the Senate Education, Energy and the Environment Committee, which focused on provisions that mainly deal with statewide and local school system programs and initiatives.
Some members of the Budget and Taxation Committee, which approved the fiscal items in the bill, had questions on some programs such as instructional coaches.
There are about 800 coaches throughout the state, but officials with the state Department of Education said before the Senate education committee Tuesday another 200 would need to be hired under the Blueprint.
About 63% of the current coaches are located in five of the state’s 24 school systems, and three school systems –  in Western Maryland, Southern Maryland and  on the Eastern Shore – have no coaches. Alex Reese, chief of staff at the department, said Tuesday the “best practice” is a 12-to1 ratio of teachers to a coach, but the current ratio is more like 79:1.
Under the bill, coaches would be housed in the department’s new Academic Excellence Program that would provide coaching for teachers and administrators at schools with “low proficiency rates and declining achievement results in recent years.” During fiscal years 2026 and 2027, the focus would be on literacy in elementary schools.
The program is estimated to cost $17 million next year, which would also include hiring regional program managers to support instructional coaches to provide evidence-based tools and strategies, professional development materials and other guidance.
Sen. Michael Jackson (D-Prince George’s Calvert and Charles) wanted to know why three school systems have no coaches. Mike Thomas, deputy legislative officer for the governor, said some instructional coaches went back into the classroom to help teach.
Jackson, who voted for the bill, wasn’t pleased that no one from the department appeared Wednesday.
“That’s a little troubling for me. This is an important matter,” he said. “We all want to get this right. This is talking about accountability at all levels.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/blueprint-newsletter-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

Stanley Dunlap/Georgia Recorder Sweeping changes to election rules intended to increase paper ballot options, expand the powers of the State Election Board and remove the state from a voter registration sharing database are up for debate as the 2025 legislative session nears a close.
The Senate Ethics Committee held a two-hour hearing on the latest version of House Bill 397, which could mandate big changes to Georgia election procedures if signed into law. No vote was taken on the bill sponsored by Covington Republican Rep. Tim Fleming.
The Republican-backed election bill would prohibit Georgia from sharing voter information with third-party groups like the Electronic Registration Information Center, known as ERIC. The partnership allows  Georgia to share updated voter rolls with 24 other states.
Under HB 397, the Georgia elections board would evaluate the procedures and policies for withdrawing from ERIC. and provide recommendations to the Senate Ethics Committee and the House Governmental Affairs Committee by the end of this year.
It would also give the Secretary of State the authority to make agreements with other states to share voter roll data.
Secretary of State election officials asked legislators Wednesday to reconsider banning the state from participating in a multistate database they say helps efficiently maintain accurate voter rolls.
Charlene McGowan, general counsel for the Georgia Secretary of State, said the proposals in HB 397 could undermine the state’s ability to conduct meaningful and secure data matching with other states, whether it be through a state-to-state agreement or a multi-state compact.
“This bill does severely restrict the secretary’s ability to share information, such as driver’s license numbers, Social Security numbers with other states,” she said. “The problem with that is that states rely on that type of information in order to conduct accurate matching.”
The bill’s Republican sponsors were also urged by the statewide association of county election officials to make changes to the bill that would require hand counting of ballots as voting precincts are closing down for the day.
Fulton County is home to more than 750,000 registered voters, according to the secretary of state office’s website. State law requires that local election superintendents report to the secretary of state and post publicly the total number of ballots cast both on Election Day and during early voting, including absentee ballots.
Rebecca Anglin, the election director in Greene County, expressed concerns about the chain of custody and hand count of paper ballots at the precinct level, emphasizing the need for secure handling and timely reporting.
Bill offers more power to State Election Board
The election overhaul legislation proposes giving the State Election Board more independence from the secretary of state’s office by moving its administration under the state accounting office.
The controversial state GOP-controlled board that is now dominated by three supporters of President Donald Trump could also be the body to hear appeals to a controversial mass voter challenge after complaints are settled by county election boards.
“This will allow for faster adjudication. If  you start with them and then you disagree with the decision, then you’ll  go to the superior court,” Fleming said.
Georgia Republican Party District Chairman Brad Carver said it’s important that the State Election Board has enough backing from the state to be fully staffed to afford more investigators and other support positions that can trim case backlogs and handle new roles.
He mentioned the significant expenses associated with voter challenges going to superior courts instead of election officials.
Georgia election board majority that was praised by Trump resumes rulemaking push this week

“If you have an appellate authority in the State Election Board, you will have more consistent application to make sure that the laws are followed across the state by all 159 counties,” Carver said.
Another provision expands board duties to allow custody of all state investigative reports and communications between the secretary of state and election superintendents.
Fleming said the bill seeks to restore more autonomy to the state board that enforces election rule compliance.
“The State Election Board handles elections investigations and complaints, and having access to this information is necessary for them to do their job and for adjudication purposes,” Fleming said. “This continues to return autonomy to the State Election Board.”
State election officials could also spell out their rulemaking powers with proposed year-round authority to adopt election rules so long as they don’t take effect within 60 days of an election.
Paper ballot bill clears committee
The Senate Ethics Committee passed a bill Wednesday that would allow Georgia voters to cast a hand-marked paper ballot at polling places during early voting and on Election Day.
The Senate Ethics Committee voted Wednesday in favor of Senate Bill 214, a proposal to give voters the ability to cast their votes in polling places using pen or pencils, which can now be used to complete absentee ballots.
Sylvania Republican Sen. Max Burns said the legislation gives voters during early voting and election days the option of paper ballots or the electronic touchscreen system that’s been used for statewide elections since 2020.
“At the end of the day (SB) 214 is designed to provide us a path forward beyond the current environment and move to hand-marked paper ballot systems tabulated with an optical scan and then supported by a print on demand ballot system,” Burns said.
Burns said he expects modifications to the bill as he tries to usher it through the legislative process.

If Burns can get his bill signed into law, it will mark a big win for a movement that has long contended that hand-marked paper ballots are more transparent and safer than electronic machines.
The state’s electronic Dominion Voting Systems machines were rolled out statewide in 2019, but by that time the state was already involved in a legal battle with Coalition for Good Governance and other plaintiffs who argue that hand-marking ballots is the safest way to vote.
The debate over electronic voting machines versus paper ballots later became the focus of conspiracy theorists who blamed Dominion’s system for Republican President Donald Trump’s loss to Joe Biden in 2020.
Over the last couple of years, a prominent pro-paper ballot movement has been led by VoterGa, a largely pro-Trump faction that has urged people to request that state officials get rid of the electronic voting system.
Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger has defended the security of the voting machine system.

Ford/Maryland Matters)As the Trump administration continues its push to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs wherever they are found, Maryland lawmakers are advancing a bill that creates a Cabinet-level department to oversee social equity programs in the state.
The name of proposed agency has changed since it was first introduced by House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County), from the Department of Social Equity to the Department of Social and Economic Mobility. But the mission remains the same: supporting social equity programs throughout state government and collecting scattered agencies that assist small and disadvantaged businesses under one roof.
House Bill 1253 passed the House on a 101-37 vote on March 17 and was heard Wednesday by the Senate Education, Energy and the Environment Committee.
“We know we are stronger when everyone has the same access to the same opportunities, and when everyone has a seat at the table,” Jones said in testimony befoer the committee Wednesday.
“We have programs that require minority and small business contracting. We support supplier diversity and state procurement,” Jones said. “Unfortunately, right now, these programs are fractured across our state government. They’re isolated in different agencies and often work independently of each other.”
The department would combine three existing offices focused on social equity programming: the Governor’s Office of Small, Minority, and Women-Owned Business Affairs (GOSBA); the Office of Social Equity in the Maryland Cannabis Administration; and the Office of Minority Business Enterprises in the state Department of Transportation.
Besides overseeing programs that support small and disadvantaged businesses, the new department would be responsible for proposing new and innovative approaches to social equity programs, monitoring trends in social equity programs and policies across the nation and adopting standards for various agencies and other units within the executive branch to promote social equity.
The proposal comes at President Donald Trump had ordered the elimination of DEI programs at the federal level and has threatened to withhold federal funding to states that don’t comply to eliminate initiatives focused on diversity, equity and inclusion.
At a February gathering of governors at the White House, Trump challenged Maine Gov. Janet Mills (D) over her state’s policy allowing transgender girls from playing girls’ sports. But Mills held firm, telling Trump, “We’re going to follow the law sir. We’ll see you in court.”
This month, the federal government started to investigate Maine and found it was in violation of the federal civil rights rule that bans sex-based discrimination in schools.
On the day HB 1253 passed the House, Del. Lauren Arikan (R-Harford) said Maryland could be next in line for federal retribution.
“We have some of the worst policies in the nation, maybe second only to California … because of our woke policies,” Arikan said. “I think a lot of our behavior is being watched, and we’re really close to D.C. We’re an easy target to keep an eye on because we’re right next door.”
But Del. Vanessa Atterbeary (D-Howard) said Wednesday that Maryland should not back down in the face of federal threats, but should continue to implement and support diverse programs and initiatives, especially about people of color. Atterbeary is chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, which reviews education policies.
“We heard the message loud and clear, Mr. President, you don’t care for us. You don’t like us. You don’t want us around,” Atterbeary said. “You want no mention of us in any photo and any history.
“He’s [Trump] trying to erase history and our culture, which is our culture. America’s culture. So, I think it’s really important in Maryland that we preserve that,” she said.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Members of the Alaska Legislature said this week that they’re likely to use the state’s Constitutional Budget Reserve to fix a roughly $173 million budget deficit for the 12 months that end June 30.
Lawmakers are confronting another, larger deficit as they craft the budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1, but it remains possible that some tax increases — on oil, business income and online sales — could offset the need to spend from savings for that year.
When it comes to the current fiscal year, things are more certain. Passing new taxes and implementing them would take time, and the state’s budget needs to be balanced by June 30.
While members of the Senate’s bipartisan coalition majority previously rejected the idea of spending from savings, they admitted this week that there is no other option.
“Times change, things change, and sometimes you have to eat crow up here,” said Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, during a news conference with reporters.
Spending from the state’s $2.8 billion Constitutional Budget Reserve will require the approval of three-quarters of the state Senate, plus three-quarters of the state House. 
Reaching those thresholds will require the support of the Republican minority caucuses in both the Senate and the House. It isn’t clear what political horse-trading — if any — will be required to get the needed Republican support.
About half of the deficit in this year’s budget is attributable to lower-than-expected oil revenue. The other half is due to budget changes proposed by Gov. Mike Dunleavy, whom the Republican minority caucuses generally support.
Among the budget additions: $10 million for the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute, millions for wildfire firefighting, and $2.7 million to cover missed payments by the state to employees’ retirement accounts.
As of Wednesday afternoon, members of the House Finance Committee were debating the use of the budget reserve for the upcoming fiscal year as well as the current one, but those debates had yet to reach a resolution.

Some say the most expensive in the country. And it’s only getting harder for families and businesses to keep up. Now, two bills in the Alaska Legislature, Senate Bills 121 and 122, could make things even worse. They would raise health care costs for nearly everyone with private insurance, without improving access or quality of care.
At Premera Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alaska, we’re very concerned about what these bills would mean for Alaskans.
 One network = higher costs for everyone
Some people think these bills would only affect certain types of insurance, like individual plans or small businesses. But that’s not true. At Premera, we use one provider network for all of our Alaska customers, whether they buy insurance on their own, get it through a small business, or work for a large, self-funded employer. That means if these bills force us to pay higher prices to providers, everyone’s costs go up; not just the people directly covered by the law.
SB 121: a step backward
SB 121 would bring back a version of Alaska’s old “80th percentile rule.” That rule said insurers had to pay high out-of-network bills, no matter how inflated they were. It led to huge increases in health care costs, and it was finally repealed last year. After the rule was repealed, access to care didn’t get worse. In fact, our network of doctors and providers grew. That shows we don’t need extreme payment rules to keep providers in the system.
Now, SB 121 proposes a similar rule: insurers must pay providers either the 75th percentile of billed charges or 450% of what Medicare pays, whichever is higher. That would raise costs across the board. We estimate that for a family of four in the individual market, this could mean $5,000 more per year in premiums starting in 2026.
And because we use one network, those increases would hit all of our customers.
SB 122: mandating higher costs
SB 122 would force insurers to include almost every provider in the state in their network, even if those providers charge high prices or don’t meet our quality standards. It would also limit our flexibility in how we build networks in different regions of Alaska. The end result? Less control over costs, higher prices, and no improvement in the quality of care.
Who pays the price?
Together, SB 121 and 122 would raise costs for almost everyone in Alaska’s private insurance market, including large employers, union trusts, and small businesses. They wouldn’t improve access to care or help people get healthier. They would just shift more financial burden onto families and businesses who are already struggling. And in a state where the working-age population is shrinking, asking employers to pay even more for health insurance just isn’t realistic.
There’s a better way forward
If lawmakers want to improve access to care, there are smarter ways to do it:

Raise Medicaid payments so providers can keep serving low-income patients
Push for higher Medicare rates that reflect Alaska’s true cost of care
Support innovations that improve care while keeping costs under control

Businesses across Alaska face significant challenges in offering good benefits and supporting their employees. Let’s keep working together to make health care more affordable for Alaska.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa House approved a bill Wednesday that would stop pipelines carrying liquified carbon dioxide from using eminent domain. 
Six other bills related to carbon sequestration pipelines, eminent domain and the Iowa Utilities Commission were combined into one bill, which also advanced. 
The bills were directed at an ongoing fight between landowners and the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline, which would stretch more than 1,000 miles in Iowa connecting to biofuel refineries and transporting the sequestered carbon dioxide to underground storage in North Dakota. 
House File 943 is similar to a law recently passed in South Dakota, another state crossed by the pipeline’s proposed route. 
Summit recently asked South Dakota regulators to pause proceedings on its pipeline permit due to the new law.

The Iowa bill would take effect in May and apply to any eminent domain filings made on or after that date. 
Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, R-Wilton, said businesses should “expect the unexpected” if they plan to use eminent domain in Iowa. 
“Expect that we’re going to make changes when eminent domain is involved, and expect that we’re going to make changes in favor of landowners,” Kaufmann said. 
Pipeline opponents advocated for the bill March 18 during a rally at the Capitol and again on Monday at a press conference with a group of Republican lawmakers opposed to the pipeline project. 
The bill passed 82-12. 
Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw said in a press release the decision by the House was “hardly surprising, but it is still disappointing.” 
“IRFA members have been saying for three years that (carbon capture and sequestration) is the most important tool available to grow ethanol demand into new markets both here at home and around the world,” Shaw said in the statement.
Shaw said he believes “cooler heads will prevail in the Senate” and said the opposition to the project has been led by a “small, though loud, minority.” 
“IRFA calls on the Iowa Senate to stand with the majority of impacted landowners, farmers, ethanol producers, and Iowa’s economic future to ensure the state has the tools it needs to meet the brewing economic disaster in the heartland,” Shaw said.
‘No eminent domain for private gain bill’ 
House File 639 would increase the insurance requirements for liquid hazardous pipeline operators. 
The five amendments to the bill would also update the definition of a common carrier, require IUC commissioners to be present at all hearings, expand who is allowed to intervene in an IUC docket, limit the pipeline permits to one term not longer than 25 years and stop the IUC from imposing sanctions on intervenors.  
These were all bills that had already advanced from House committees, but Rep. Steven Holt combined into HF 639. 
Holt, R-Denison, said with all of the amendments, the bill should be called the “no eminent domain for private gain” bill. 
The bill passed 85-10.
A spokesperson for Summit said the company has signed easements with more than 1,320 Iowa landowners and has “adjusted the route based on feedback from stakeholders and regulatory agencies.” 
“Regulatory certainty is crucial for maintaining Iowa’s competitive edge in business, fostering long-term opportunities for farmers, ethanol producers, and rural communities,” the spokesperson said in a statement.
Concern about Senate opposition
Some representatives voiced concern because of historic opposition in the Senate.  
Rep. Brian Meyer spoke in support of the bills but said he wondered if lawmakers were “wasting our time here today.” 
“We’ve done this now several years in a row, and the Senate has not acted,” Meyer, D-Des Moines, said. “As far as I can tell, they have not even tried to negotiate … Do something. Do something about this important issue.” 
Rep. Charley Thomson, R-Charles City, said he appreciated the concerns about the Senate on the issue and said he believes the House will “do the right thing without regard for what others may do.” 
Holt said the issue is not partisan and that in both the House and the Senate, the two parties disagree with one another on the issue. He disagreed with a claim that he and other lawmakers fighting for the issue are doing so performatively. 
“We’re doing it because it’s the right thing to do,” Holt said. “And regardless of whether the Senate is going to pass it or not, we’re going to fight for it here because it’s the right thing to do.”

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) Editor’s note: This story contains graphic material and discusses the sexual exploitation of minors. 
FARGO — Former state Sen. Ray Holmberg seeking out young men for sexual exploitation is “not recent, nor isolated,” someone who said he’d been victimized by the North Dakota legislator told the court at a sentencing hearing Wednesday. 
A lawmaker for 45 years, Holmberg also worked as an educator and student counselor at Grand Forks Central High. He pleaded guilty last year to traveling with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct, and prosecutors say he left the United States to seek sexual contact with minors numerous times.
Witnesses said in court Wednesday that his abuses weren’t relegated to trips overseas. 
They spoke before Holmberg was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison.
Former ND Sen. Ray Holmberg sentenced to 10 years in prison for sex crime

One person said that he met Holmberg while he was in high school in the 1990s, and Holmberg became a trusted adviser. Holmberg eventually paid him to make sexual videos of himself.
“The impact of Mr. Holmberg’s actions has been life-long,” he said. 
Investigators found three of the videos on tapes belonging to Holmberg. The former student said he needed money to support a drug habit.
“Unless one has personally experienced drug addiction, it is difficult to convey the depth of despair” that would lead to such “extreme acts,” he said. 
There were also sexual encounters with Holmberg, who was “fully aware of my vulnerabilities,” he said. 
Though he’s been clean and sober for more than 13 years, he said he still struggles with the trauma of those experiences. 
He admitted that at one point he attempted to blackmail Holmberg but said he was “deeply misguided.” He said he was advised to go to the FBI with information about the state senator but that it took a few more years to do. 
His report to the FBI in 2016 did not lead to charges against Holmberg, but prosecutors pointed to it as evidence that he had a long history of sexual exploitation.
Defense attorney Mark Friese urged the judge to focus on the conduct alleged in the court indictment for traveling to Prague with the intent to pay for sex with minors and denied many of the prosecution’s allegations. He said Holmberg was not charged with other offenses. 
A former University of North Dakota graduate student who also spoke Wednesday in court became a cooperating witness in the case against Holmberg. 
He echoed the effect that his relationship with Holmberg had on his life, saying he experienced “constant shame and disgust.”  
The student said he became involved with the longtime state senator in 2009. UND is in Grand Forks, Holmberg’s district.
Investigators said the graduate student and Holmberg attended UND hockey games in the university president’s suite, with Holmberg making introductions to influential North Dakotans, but with the understanding that it would lead to sex. 
Dan Casetta, a special agent with the Department of Homeland Security, called people with access to the UND president’s suite a “who’s who of North Dakota” that would at times include the governor and members of Congress. 
The witness accompanied Holmberg on a trip to Prague in the Czech Republic but said he did not join Holmberg at a brothel known for massages that involved sexual contact. He said he was “terrified” about what might happen there. 
As a result of his relationship with Holmberg, he said he struggles to maintain relationships and has had multiple nervous breakdowns. 
“I don’t trust others anymore,” he said. 
U.S. District Judge Daniel Hovland and acting U.S. Attorney Jennifer Klemetsrud Puhl commended the two men for speaking in court.
“That was remarkable. They exhibited a lot of strength and courage to come forward,” Klemetsrud Puhl said.  
A group advocating for victims of sexual violence said others must have known about Holmberg’s activities. 
“Whether those who knew stayed silent out of fear, negligence, or for their own personal gain, we owe it to victims and survivors to bring those individuals to justice as well,” the North Dakota Domestic and Sexual Violence Coalition said in a statement. “Sexual violence thrives in a culture of isolation and silence, and Ray Holmberg used power and control to keep those around him silent.” 
The coalition encouraged people to speak out about other cases of suspected sexual exploitation. 
“If you see warning signs that someone may be abusing or exploiting others, say something,” the statement said. “Depending upon your situation, you can report to your school, workplace, or to law enforcement. Anonymous tips can be reported to law enforcement officials through ND Tip.” 
For victims of sexual and domestic violence, the Central Dakota Forensic Nurse Examiners also released a statement that there are numerous organizations offering support. Contact information is on the group’s website at cdfne.org/contacts.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderA bill aimed at removing gender-affirming care for transgender state workers covered by the state health insurance plan moved forward in the Georgia House Health Committee after committee Chair Lee Hawkins, a Gainesville Republican, broke a tie vote.
The bill’s author, Vidalia Republican Sen. Blake Tillery, said treatments like hormone therapy or mastectomies will still be available, but not for gender-affirming purposes.
“Senate Bill 39 relates to the state health benefit plan, and it states that the state health benefit plan will not pay for gender-reassignment surgeries or gender care when it’s related to a sex that is not someone’s sex at birth, that is it,” he said.
  Rep. Kim Schofield Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Democratic state Rep. Kim Schofield of Atlanta questioned the intent behind banning treatments specifically for transgender people.
“I’m concerned about this bill and the public health research on this bill,” she said. “Where is that? Or is this really just a personal ideology?”
“I don’t know that it’s a personal ideology,” Tillery answered. “If it passes the General Assembly, then it would be the ideology of the General Assembly, and if the votes are against it, then it’s not in the ideology of the General Assembly.”
Schofield wasn’t convinced.
“I mean, where’s the research? Where’s the public health research that this is a problem or we should be taking this issue up?” she said. “This is a decision between someone’s personal life, their doctors and their family. It shouldn’t be the General Assembly.”
“Well, ma’am, I beg to differ,” Tillery said.”You’re gonna be asked to vote on a budget that we send back over to you that’s gonna have over roughly $1 billion in the state health benefit plan. If you think that the state should pay for transgender surgeries–”
“I do,” Schofield said.
“– then you should vote against my bill,” Tillery continued.
“And I will,” Schofield said.
Public comment on the bill was largely in opposition.
Attorney Amanda Kay Seals represented transgender state workers in a 2023 lawsuit after they were excluded from the health plan. In that case, the state paid out a $365,000 settlement and removed transgender exclusions.
Seals said passing SB 39 into law will lead to more taxpayer dollars going to settlements.
“Georgia has settled these cases for millions of dollars, not out of the charity to the plaintiffs,” she said. “It’s because these exclusions are legally indefensible, and you will be sued again. The state will be sued again if this bill passes, and again, the exclusions will be legally indefensible. You will spend more money litigating over these exclusions than you would offering this care to state employees and their dependents.”
  Attorney Amanda Kay Seals, who represented transgender state workers in a previous suit against the state, said banning gender-affirming care again would invite new lawsuits. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Dr. Jason Schneider, a physician who treats transgender patients, characterized the bill as government overreach that could harm his patients.
“The government should not be able to overrule a person’s decision to seek health care for themselves and their families, whether they are transgender or not,” he said. “And this would allow, this bill allows politicians to interfere with private decisions between me and my patients, my adult patients. It’s important to know that the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, and every other leading U.S. Medical Professional Association recognizes and supports this care.”
Khara Hayden, a transgender state employee who would be affected by the bill, characterized it as heartless.
“I require hormones. I don’t produce hormones anymore, so this is essentially taking life necessary care away from me,” she said. “It boggles my mind as a Georgian. I’ve been in the state since the first grade. I’ve grown up here. Where is the care for community? Love your neighbor as you love yourself. Treat others the way you want to be treated. This is specifically targeting a group, a very small group of people for no apparent reason other than trying to save money.”
The bill could come up for a full House vote any time between now and the end of the legislative session on April 4.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderA ban on puberty-blocking medications for transgender minors was the subject of an unexpected compromise at a House committee meeting Thursday.
The bill no longer bans the medications, but it makes them harder to get.
  Sen. Ben Watson. Ross Williams/Georgia REcorder
“My thought process is that it certainly allows gender dysphoria to be treated with puberty blockers,” said Savannah Republican Sen. Ben Watson, author of Senate Bill 30, which originally did not allow gender dysphoria to be treated with puberty blockers.
“I think that, on minors, that’s the wrong thing to do,” he added. “But I’ll tell you, I’m sort of trying to be the bigger person here and allow this bill to move, so I would not try to delay it, and I would not suggest any changes – unless we want to go back to the original bill.”
Marietta Republican Rep. Sharon Cooper, chair of the House Public and Community Health Committee, said Watson’s original bill was not an option.
“Thank you very much, senator, as I told you outside, the bill that is up for decision today is not your previous version. The only thing we will be voting on is the one that we have as a substitute to Senate Bill 30,” Cooper said.
Tensions appeared to run high between Cooper and Watson the last time this bill was before her committee.
Watson, who is a physician, argued that puberty blockers can have dangerous side effects and children are better off without them. Mainstream medical organizations recommend them as part of treatment for gender dysphoria.
Under the version that passed committee, the child could be prescribed puberty blockers only by a licensed physician who is board certified in pediatrics and either pediatric endocrinology or adolescent medicine and diagnosed by two independent behavioral health professionals including one licensed psychiatrist and one licensed psychiatrist or psychologist.
Before that could happen, both of the child’s parents would need to sign a form listing the potential risks of puberty blockers, and if they cannot agree, they would need to seek a court order.
In addition, children undergoing hormone therapy would need to attend regular counseling, and doctors who provide it would need to submit treatment progress reports to the Georgia Composite Medical Board.
Cooper characterized the measure as a compromise between those who want transgender children to have access to the treatments subject to their doctors’ and parents’ agreement and those who want them totally banned.
  Rep. Sharon Cooper. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“I think that we should be fair about stating that this is not a one-sided thing,” she said to Watson. “There’s two sides to it, and in the middle, a family is caught, and I will say, as a Republican, we push parental involvement, it’s sort of our mantra, and as you know, if you remember, you agreed last time that they shouldn’t have any choice in this, and I think a lot of us are just having some trouble about that sort of dictatorial thing.”
“I will respectfully disagree,” Watson said.
“OK,” Cooper replied. “I appreciate it being respectful.”
Some transgender Georgians, parents and health providers said they did not see the alteration as a victory. Elizabeth Downey, a registered nurse and mom of a transgender daughter, said the requirements could be onerous, especially for families that may have to travel long distances to reach the kind of specialists needed under the bill.
Downey said the constant stream of bills aimed at transgender Georgians, especially youths, make her daughter, who is otherwise thriving in school and happy with her identity, feel targeted.
“My daughter just wants to live her life,” Downey said. “She wants to go to school every day. She wants to play with her friends on the weekend. She wants to participate on sports teams with her friends, and these constant attacks on who she is as a person and the scrutiny that it brings on her life and in our family’s life every single day is harmful. She is a target every single day without people realizing it just because she is who she is.”
Speaking to the Recorder after the vote, Cooper said she thinks the committee came to a good compromise.
“I agree with people that say that when both sides are not happy, that probably it’s a good compromise, and that you can tell exactly from the crowd today, both sides were not happy,” Cooper said. “But, you know, it’s not really about either side. It’s really looking at the situation and just doing the best you can do.”
The bill must go back to the Senate before it can come to the House for final passage. The final day of the legislative session is April 4.

Ed Setzler, right presents his RFRA bill to a House committee. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderGeorgia is closer to a so-called religious freedom bill than it has been in nearly a decade after a House panel passed a bill Wednesday.
Acworth Republican Sen. Ed Setzler’s Senate Bill 36 is now teed up for a full House vote, which would send it to Gov. Brian Kemp’s desk.
It’s the farthest a Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or RFRA bill, has come in Georgia since 2016, when then-Gov. Nathan Deal vetoed a similar measure after it sparked outcry from LGBTQ advocates and large employers in the state.
The nearly decade-long push for religious protections began after the U.S. Supreme Court issued its landmark same-sex marriage ruling in 2015.
Setzler says the bill will protect religious Georgians from state and local governments the same way the First Amendment does at the federal level. He often gives examples of RFRA beneficiaries from other states, including a veiled Muslim woman who was allowed to be photographed unveiled for her driver’s license in a private room by a woman photographer so as not to violate her religion.
Opponents instead refer to examples of same-sex couples denied service at shops or other businesses.
Detractors argue that because Georgia does not have a civil rights law, RFRA bills would provide carte blanche to discriminate against LGBTQ Georgians and others under the fig leaf of religion. At a previous committee hearing, lawmakers inserted an amendment including civil rights protections, but that amendment was eliminated ahead of Wednesday’s vote.
Setzler presented the bill as a compromise because it does not prevent local governments from instituting their own anti-discrimination ordinances.
“This bill specifically takes the middle road, doesn’t go after local ordinances that elevate rights of certain people groups,” he said. “It doesn’t invalidate the rights of people of faith, it takes the middle road. It allows those local ordinances to stay in place while the rights of people of faith have the weight they should receive in our legal system. This balanced approach is not what was taken back in 2016.”
“And I think we recognize by exactly mirroring the federal language, by following our governor insisting on language that does exactly that, nothing more, nothing less, no changes,” he added. “That’s why these amendments came off from committee. We don’t need to make these changes to our federal framework and (instead) simply take the same protections that exist in federal law, apply those protections to state and local governments.”

Atlanta Democratic Rep. Stacey Evans said she would have supported the bill with the civil rights amendment, but she has serious objections without it.
“This bill will give a license to discriminate, that’s exactly what it does,” she said. “And all attempts to make sure that that’s not true, all attempts to make sure that it really is about just making sure that folks can exercise their religious beliefs, all of that could be taken care of if we also put in comprehensive civil rights protections for the state or made sure that local ordinances against discrimination would be respected. Every single time, those amendments were rejected, which tells you the intent of the author here is to discriminate. If it wasn’t his intent, if it wasn’t the intent of this body to discriminate, then why are we opposed to amendments that make it clear that we’re not discriminating?”
The bill could come to a full House vote any time before the end of the legislative session on April 4.

(Photo by Dave Bordewyk/South Dakota NewsMedia Association)A carbon dioxide pipeline company has asked courts to pause or dismiss its pending legal fights against landowners and a state regulator in South Dakota after the state’s adoption of a law that prevents the company from using eminent domain.
Eminent domain is a legal process for acquiring access to land for projects that have a public benefit, with compensation for landowners determined by a court. It’s commonly used for projects such as electrical power lines, water pipelines, oil pipelines and highways.
Some South Dakota landowners who oppose the Summit Carbon Solutions project sued to stop the company from surveying their property. They argued that doing so without just compensation was unconstitutional because soil sampling and other invasive practices would occur.
Summit said it had a right to survey the land because it had eminent domain authority. The company sued some landowners as well.
Carbon pipeline company seeks dismissals of North Dakota court challenges

The disputes ultimately reached the South Dakota Supreme Court, which determined Summit had not yet proven it meets the legal qualification for using eminent domain, and sent the cases back to lower courts. Lawsuits in which Summit no longer needed to survey the land in question – because an agreement was reached or the route was changed – were then dismissed, leaving four cases remaining.
Summit filed a motion to dismiss those cases on March 20, two weeks after Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden signed the bill barring carbon pipeline projects from using eminent domain.
Regulator case paused
Meanwhile, a judge has paused Summit’s legal effort to remove an elected state regulator from its pipeline permitting case. Summit alleged the regulator has a conflict of interest. The company cited the eminent domain ban as part of its rationale for seeking a stay in the case.
South Dakota Public Utilities Commissioner Kristie Fiegen’s sister-in-law is part of a trust that owns land on the proposed pipeline route. Fiegen declined to recuse herself from Summit’s permit application, and Summit sued to disqualify her from considering the permit.
Both Summit and the state agreed to indefinitely stay the case, and a judge entered the stay on March 14.
Permit pause sought
Summit has also requested a pause for “review and adjustment” of its permit proceedings with the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission. The commission rejected Summit’s first application in 2023, largely due to the route’s conflicts with local ordinances that mandate minimum distances between pipelines and existing features. Summit later adjusted its route and reapplied.
The eminent domain ban has been hailed as a victory by some landowners who have resisted Iowa-based Summit’s proposed $9 billion project. The pipeline would transport carbon dioxide emissions from dozens of ethanol plants in five states to an underground storage site in North Dakota. It would qualify for billions in federal tax credits incentivizing the sequestration of heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions.
The project has permits in North Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa, although some permits are being challenged in court. Nebraska does not have a permitting process.
Summit has said it is not giving up on the project.
“In South Dakota, recent legislative changes have temporarily slowed our timeline, but they have not altered our vision or our determination,” said Summit CEO Lee Blank in a press release. “We remain confident that our project is moving forward in a way that benefits farmers, ethanol producers, and rural communities.”

Bob Casey Jr. (D-PA) speaks on stage during the final day of the Democratic National Convention at the United Center on August 22, 2024 in Chicago, Illinois. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)HARRISBURG — Describing the current moment as a “time of real peril” for families across the state and nation, former U.S. Sen. Bob Casey detailed the issues he believes should be at the forefront of the political conversation.
“We’ve got to make sure that we saddle up here and get into this fight,” Casey said Wednesday morning during a 45-plus minute address in Harrisburg. “There’s no more important work that we could be engaging in on domestic policy than this: Stopping cuts to Medicaid, SNAP, and other programs.”
“Secondly, making sure that we don’t make the same mistakes that have been made, not just year after year, but decade after decade after decade, on tax policy where the tax code gets rigged over and over and over again, against the interests of the most vulnerable and against the interests of the middle class,” Casey added.
The former three-term Senator, who was the longest-serving Democrat in the chamber in the commonwealth’s history before his loss last November, was the keynote speaker at the Pennsylvania Policy Center’s “Federal Fightback Summit.”
During his address, Casey laid out the ramifications that could occur if efforts by the Trump administration are successful in cutting those programs.
When talking about healthcare, Casey discussed the potential impact a proposed House bill with spending cuts to Medicaid would have. He cited statistics that 39% of all children and 59% of children with disabilities are covered by Medicaid, along with 34% of all births in Pennsylvania. Casey also warned Medicaid cuts would impact nursing home residents and lead to losses of rural healthcare services.
On the topic of tax policy, he accused Republicans who support extending the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), also known as the “Trump tax cuts,” of “worshiping at the altar of tax cuts for rich people and big companies.”
“And I do think that the more people hear about this, and the more that we’re able to make the case, on these, on both the devastating cuts in the tax bill that’s driving those cuts,” Casey said. “I think a lot of voters, and I think even people that voted for President Trump and Republicans up and down the ballot, will begin to scratch your head and say, ‘I didn’t really vote for this.’”

He said he believes a good place to start fighting back against these proposals is to discuss the impact they could have on rural communities.
Following Casey’s defeat in November to now-U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) and President Donald Trump’s victory over Vice President Kamala Harris, Republicans hold a trifecta of having a majority in both chambers of Congress and holding the White House. 
In addition to finding themselves in the minority, a recent NBC News poll showed only 27% of registered voters said they had a positive view of the Democratic Party.
Casey said if Democrats effectively fight on tax policy and proposed cuts to healthcare, those numbers would change.
“And I think we just have to as a party, both citizens like me and elected officials like those who are there, have to make this argument over and over again, put that in front of people month after month after month,” Casey said. “And sometimes, to the exclusion of other issues, other issues that are in the news or relevant or urgent that day.”
“You can’t lose your focus on these basic core issues, because a lot of what 2024 was about was the economy, right,” Casey added.
Casey described the current moment as one “for the middle class.”
“And if you’re a political party that’s not talking about those issues like costs and the overall economic fortunes of folks who are in the middle, you’re probably not going to be successful,” he said. “So I just think we have to get back to those kinds of basic principles and talk about the unfairness to the middle class of this tax bill and the devastation it would bring about for the most vulnerable.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Casey also said he’s been “amazed” by the amount of coverage at the local level in Scranton, where he lives, that has been given to proposed cuts to food banks.
“It’s becoming a major, major issue,” Casey said.
Despite the current negative numbers for the Democratic Party, Casey expressed optimism it can be successful in pushing back against the Trump administration.
“And I think that there’s a lot of noise back and forth, but I think as you get closer and people start hearing the impact of these cuts and realizing the impact on their families, I think it’s going to change the dynamic,” he said.
Marc Stier, executive director of the Pennsylvania Policy Center, opened up for Casey. Stier lauded him as the champion for the state who fought to pass the Affordable Care Act, noting how he and many others in the room are “missing him terribly” in Washington D.C. 
Casey on Fetterman criticism
U.S. Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.), now the state’s senior senator, has faced criticism from members of his own party for backing several Trump cabinet selections and other comments over the past few months. Cumberland County Chair Matt Roan has even called for Fetterman’s “immediate resignation from the Senate,” as a result.
Casey called Fetterman a “very good senator” in response to a question about the recent pushback he’s facing.
“I think on these issues especially, he’ll do the right thing when it comes to protecting the most vulnerable and protecting the middle class,” Casey said. “I think John will be fighting the fight on our side, on this.”
What’s next for Casey?
Casey, who was in elected office for 28 consecutive years, said that actions from the Trump administration in recent weeks “pushes” him in the direction of wanting to speak out.
“The argument is going to be won or lost based upon what families tell their legislators about the impact of these cuts and the unfairness of rigging the tax code again,” Casey said. He believes the families that shared their stories in 2017 ahead of the vote on the Affordable Care Act, like the Little Lobbyists, played a larger role than the legislators did in preventing it from being overturned.
As of late he’s been talking to a lot of people about what’s next for him.
“I’ve been home a lot, but I haven’t settled on my next chapter yet,” Casey said. “Still kind of working through that.”
He said that he has a “couple of discussions going” but didn’t say which they were yet. 
“But, I’ll tell you about it when I make a decision,” he added.
In December, he said that he wasn’t ruling out a future run for office: “I never say never.”
But on Wednesday, Casey told reporters that he “was blessed to have a long tenure in public service,” while adding “right now, it’s time for something different.”

Carter Nordman, R-Adel, spoke in support of enacting work requirements for Iowa's expanded Medicaid program during floor debate March 26, 2025. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa House sent the bill imposing work requirements on recipients of Iowa’s expanded Medicaid program back to the Senate Wednesday.
Senate File 615 was approved by the House 61-35 with some changes. The bill, which passed in the Senate Tuesday, would require people receiving health insurance through Iowa’s expanded Medicaid program known as IHAWP, or the Iowa Health and Wellness Plan, to work at least 80 hours each month to be eligible for coverage.
IHAWP coverage is available to able-bodied Iowans from ages 19 to 64 who have household incomes at or below 133% of the federal poverty level — roughly $20,030 in annual income for a single individual and $27,186 for a household of two.
Rep. Carter Nordman, R-Adel, the bill’s floor manager, said Medicaid is intended to serve individuals with disabilities and with very low incomes. However, he said currently “more able-bodied adults are accessing Medicaid benefits without the requirement of work” through the IHAWP program.
“While Medicaid expansion has been a vital safety net, it is not meant to be a permanent solution,” Nordman said. “We want to help individuals transition off the reliance of government and into a position where they can thrive independently. Requiring work is a key part of that transition.”
According to analysis by the Legislative Services Agency, roughly 142,000 of the 181,000 Iowans currently enrolled in IHAWP would be subject to work requirements under the bill when accounting for medical exemptions and other caveats provided in the legislation, like exemptions for people with children under age 6 and in substance abuse treatment programs for up to six months.
Of the people who would be required to work 80 hours a month — and report this information to the state to continue receiving care — LSA estimated that 32,000 Iowans would lose IHAWP coverage if the bill is implemented. This figure was calculated using data from Arkansas, a state that previously implemented Medicaid work or community engagement requirements.
Rep. Austin Baeth, D-Des Moines, said the bill will deprive low-income people of health care and coverage using a false argument that there are a large number of people receiving Medicaid coverage who are choosing not to work. He cited a study from the Kaiser Family Foundation that found 92% of adults under age 65 who did not receive benefits through other programs like Social Security or Medicare were working full or part time, or were not working because of caregiving responsibilities, school or due to an illness or disability.
Baeth said the bill sends a “cynical message that people in poverty are lazy” and will take away health care coverage from working Iowans who do not have the time or resources to meet the reporting requirements that would be implemented under the bill.
“Hardworking people are too busy working their jobs, trying to make rent, trying to put food on the table, not watching the news (to know) that they have to go to a particular website by a particular amount of time to press some particular button,” Baeth said. “That’s how people fall through the cracks. And when they fall through the cracks, in this particular case, it can be the matter of life or death.”
A major point of contention for Democrats on the bill was language that directed the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services to discontinue IHAWP if the federal government does not approve work requirements for the program. The House amended the bill to clarify that this “trigger” language to seek federal approval for ending IHAWP would only apply if the implementation of work requirements has been federally approved and later revoked.
If the federal government does not allow the state to end the Medicaid expansion program, the bill would direct Iowa HHS to pursue implementation of an “alternative plan” acceptable under federal Medicaid administration guidelines.
Nordman said the language on discontinuing IHAWP without work requirements was to avoid making Medicaid policy changes in Iowa contingent on who is in the White House.
“The reason why this is in there is we are not going to play this back-and-forth game with the federal government that would disallow us to do it every four years, and then we do it another four years, and then four years later we’re not allowed to do it,” Nordman said. “… Just to make it clear, if this is approved by the Trump administration, as I believe it will be, the only reason why Medicaid expansion in the state would go away is because of a Democrat president.”
Rep. Timi Brown-Powers, D-Waterloo, questioned how these changes would be implemented by HHS, pointing to the fact that the department has a “pause” on hiring for new positions.
LSA, a nonpartisan agency, noted that the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services had not responded to multiple requests for information on the fiscal impact of implementing work requirements, but estimated that the bill would result in $3.1 million in decreased Medicaid expenditures for fiscal year 2026 and $17.5 million in FY 2027.
Iowa HHS has not responded to requests for comment on why information was not shared with LSA or lawmakers who said they had made requests.
Brown-Powers said the department has also not shared figures on Medicaid waste, fraud or abuse occurring through IHAWP that would be addressed through work requirements. She said unless HHS data shows there is a substantial number of people misusing the expanded Medicaid system, the costs of implementing the bill will outweigh money saved.
“And guess what? We don’t have a lot of money,” Brown-Powers said. “We’re already dipping into the funds to pay the bills. So how are we going to pay for this? Where are the (full-time employees) going to come (from) to monitor this? How are we going to assure Iowans that they’re not going to lose their insurance?”
Nordman said that in Iowa “it is estimated that more than 100,000 able-bodied people on Medicaid expansion are not working … to their capacity or what they should be.”
The bill also directs Iowa HHS to seek federal approval to implement work requirements for public assistance programs like Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). SNAP recipients who are able-bodied adults with no dependents already are required to work, volunteer or participate in work programs for at least 80 hours a month to receive benefits.
The House passed another bill Wednesday related to SNAP benefits that proposes a new $1 million appropriation to the food stamps program to the Double Up Food Bucks program, allowing recipients to double SNAP dollars for fresh produce purchases. However, the bill makes the additional funding contingent on the federal government approving restrictions on what foods are available for purchase through SNAP to only include healthful foods “based on necessary nutrition for good health.”
The House sent the legislation back to the Senate with some changes, including the language clarifying IHAWP federal approval contingencies as well as a new section requiring Iowa HHS to conduct a review on the Medicaid for employed people with disabilities program. The department would be directed to look at issues like eligibility criteria, asset limits and cost-sharing requirements in other states’ programs over the 2025 interim and deliver a report to lawmakers by December with recommendations on how to expand employment opportunities for people with disabilities on this Medicaid program.
The bill also includes a provision to raise the amount of available resources that a married couple receiving coverage through the Medicaid for employed people with disabilities program can have from $13,000 to $21,000. Individuals with disabilities on this program would still have the $13,000 asset limit if they are single.
The amended bill must be approved by the Senate before it would go to Gov. Kim Reynolds for final approval. A spokesperson for the governor said Tuesday that the governor has directed HHS to submit a federal waiver for Medicaid work requirements independent of the legislation “which will be done soon.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/nordman3.26.1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

Watkins represented the state’s Third  Congressional District, known as “Little Dixie,” for 20 years as both a Democrat and as a Republican.
He also served in the Oklahoma Senate and made two unsuccessful gubernatorial attempts as a Democrat and independent.
Watkins, who was born in Arkansas, grew up in poverty, said his son, Wade Watkins.
He lived in a chicken house a portion of the time he attended Oklahoma State University, where he met his wife of 61 years, Lou, in the campus library over Christmas break.
The former congressman overcame a stutter by giving speeches in empty barns, Wade Watkins said.
He became state president of the FFA and president of the OSU student body, Wade Watkins said. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1960 and a master’s in 1961 from OSU.
OSU Interim President Jim Hess said the university lost a leader and a friend.
“He left an indelible mark on this university, his alma mater, through his generosity and vision for economic prosperity for Oklahoma businesses and students,” Hess said.
Watkins wasn’t the “slickest politician,” but his peers knew that if he said something, it “was from the heart,” Wade Watkins said.
“My dad always did what was in the  best interest of his constituents,” Wade Watkins said.
He had a great memory and could remember constituents from years ago, Wade Watkins said.
“He was one of the most heartfelt, amazing men I knew,” Wade Watkins said. “I feel very fortunate to have had him as a dad and the lessons that I was able to witness.”
Oklahoma House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said Watkins had a heart for students and spent his life making Oklahoma better.
“Oklahoma is better thanks to his contributions,” Hilbert said.
The CareerTech in Wetumka, a center for international trade development at OSU and a reservoir south of McLoud all bear his name.
Watkins is survived by his wife Lou, two children and four grandchildren.
Visitation is set for 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. Saturday at Strode Funeral Home, 610 S. Duncan Street, in Stillwater. Funeral services are set for 1:30 p.m. Sunday at the Wes Watkins Center for International Trade Development on the OSU campus.

On Wednesday, they voiced concerns with a plan to automatically lower income tax rates based on surplus funds. (Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Personal and corporate income taxes could see major breaks under Republican-led legislation that advanced Wednesday out of the Kansas House, but Democrats warned of repeating past mistakes. 
Senate Bill 269, also known as “the income tax trigger bill,” would reduce the individual and corporate income tax rates to as low as 4%. Bank rates could drop as low as 2.6%. However, the cuts are contingent on maintaining the state’s budget stabilization fund, also known as the rainy day fund.
House lawmakers advanced the bill Wednesday mostly along party lines in an 84-38 vote. The Senate still needs to give its stamp of approval in the two remaining days of the regular session. 
No Republicans defended the bill, but Democrats called it “a ratchet” and “dangerous.” 
Rep. Stephanie Sawyer Clayton, an Overland Park Democrat, argued the House was the final stopgap between “what is fairly dangerous tax policy” and constituents. 
The cuts can only go into effect if the state budget stabilization fund maintains a 15% balance. Right now, the fund sits at around an 18% balance, or $1.75 billion.
Anytime the amount of state income tax collected exceeds the 15% balance threshold, as determined by the state budget director, an income tax rate “buydown” would be triggered under the law, Smith said. Legislative staff couldn’t estimate the exact financial impact of such a policy change.
The changes would go into effect in 2025. The budget director would determine by Aug. 15 whether the most recent fiscal year’s total State General Fund tax receipts exceeded the previous fiscal year’s amount, adjusted for inflation. 
State personal income tax rates currently range from 5.2% to 5.58%, according to the Kansas Department of Revenue. Corporations solely in Kansas are taxed at 4% of their net income plus a 3% surtax on income above $50,000. Corporations with income in Kansas and outside of it are subject to rates based on sales, property and payroll.
Under SB 269, if receipts are greater than the previous year’s inflation-adjusted amount, the director of the secretary of revenue would calculate tax rate reductions, starting with individual income taxes.
Once individual rates in both the lower and higher tax brackets reach 4%, rate reductions for corporations and financial institutions would be triggered.
Reductions would continue until the combined rate for corporations reaches 4%, the combined rate for banks reaches 2.6% and the combined rate for other financial institutions reaches 2.62%.
Rep. Tom Sawyer, a Wichita Democrat, said the cuts put the state in a difficult situation. He said the policy takes all of the state’s excess income tax revenue and transforms it into a flat income tax, leaving no additional revenue to provide property tax relief.
“I have a problem with the whole ratchet situation,” Sawyer said. 
He added that special education funding hasn’t been at its statutorily mandated level since 2010, and achieving full funding will be “very difficult” under the proposed cuts.
When — not if — a recession hits, Sawyer said, the hole left behind by income tax reductions will be much more difficult to fill.
“Those of us who were here in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 that had to deal with (trying) to dig ourselves out of a deep hole in the budget know what that’s like,” he said.
The cuts are reminiscent of former Gov. Sam Brownback’s tax experiment that gave hundreds of millions in tax cuts to corporations and “bankrupted” the state, Rep. Jerry Stogsdill, a Prairie Village Democrat, told Kansas Reflector. However, Brownback’s cuts were not contingent on the state’s surplus tax revenues.
Democrats also have challenged whether Republicans are going to be able to muster meaningful property tax relief legislation, a campaign-trail promise from both parties.
One of those property tax relief efforts passed the House before the income tax bill. Senate Bill 36 eliminates the statewide levy of 1 mills for the state education building fund and the .5 mills levy for the state institution building fund. 
If implemented, the gap left behind in those two funds would be replaced with State General Fund dollars. In fiscal year 2027, which begins June 2026, the state education building fund would receive about $56 million and the institutional building fund would receive about $25 million from the State General Fund.
SB 296 originally had to do with pending tax appeals fees, but during negotiations, the House inserted the contents of House Bill 2318, which contained the cuts.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Clayton-and-Stogsdill-3.24.25-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

This K-12 council is part of the larger 17-member Board of Education, first established in 2014 to oversee all levels of education from kindergarten to university. Membership across both councils is determined by governor appointees. 
The House version of the bill, led by Rep. David Morales, a Providence Democrat, was introduced on Feb. 28 but has yet to be scheduled for a hearing. DiMario’s bill was held for further study Wednesday by the Senate committee.
In her testimony, DiMario cited Article 12 of the Rhode Island State Constitution, which allows the General Assembly to “adopt all means which it may deem necessary and proper to secure to the people the advantages and opportunities of education.”  
“I believe that allowing for the Teacher of the Year as well as the chair of the Student Advisory Council, to have full voting seats on that council will be a means to that end,” DiMario told her fellow senators on the committee. 
This year’s bill layers together two previous legislative efforts. RIDE announces the state’s Teacher of the Year from the prior year’s batch of District Teachers of the Year, an honor determined by the district’s own teachers. The state’s top teacher was granted a voteless seat at the table in 2023, although the bill became law sans Gov. Dan McKee’s signature. 
Sen. Valarie Lawson, an East Providence Democrat who is president of the National Education Association of Rhode Island, led the legislation for the student voting powers in recent years. But Lawson, who began her tenure as majority leader in January, has “a lot on her plate,” DiMario said. So this year Lawson and DiMario combined their efforts into the current bill, which features both women plus eight other Democrats as sponsors. 
An overfull plate was also one of the reasons cited by RIDE in its public opposition to the bill at Wednesday’s hearing — a concern relayed from Gabriella Bautista Bolvito, the current chair of the Student Advisory Council and a senior at Classical High School in Providence. In her written testimony, Bolvito wrote about one of the first K-12 council meetings she attended, in which the council members were readying the fiscal 2026 budget.










They could come to the meetings, they could participate, but they weren’t truly decision makers.


– Sen. Alana DiMario, a Narragnsett Democrat


“I knew little of what a budget entailed but was happy to be present in the conversation and to have the opportunity to give my input when necessary,” Bolvito wrote. “As a 17-year-old with only an intro level Macroeconomics course in my back pocket, the prospect of potentially having to vote on a matter as serious as RIDE’s budget is daunting. Although I hold several leadership positions. RIDE’s area of focus is still foreign to me.”
Bolvito did not attend the hearing, but quoting parts of her testimony in person for the Senate committee was Andy Andrade, special assistant to the commissioner for legislative relations at RIDE, who also argued that, rather than the power to contribute to K-12 council decisions, students would be better served by sitting on their local school boards. 
“It seems to me that the best place for a student…would be to be a member of their local school committee, where they have a vested interest, where they know the issues, and they would be, I think, much more effective in that role,” Andrade said. “A commitment as a voting member would be challenging for any student with many responsibilities in and out of school.”
Sen. Tiara Mack, a Providence Democrat who has previously supported lowering the voting age, disagreed.
“I was a little disappointed to hear that one of our students didn’t feel like they were given the tools or empowerment to engage civically within our state at a variety of levels,” Mack said. “I think our young people are smart, and when given the proper tools, empowerment and resources, I believe they can engage in multimillion dollar decisions … and I think we should be giving our young people more opportunities to authentically engage in civics.”

Two people spoke up on behalf of the bill in person, while a packet of nine written submissions from members of Young Voices, a youth-led Providence nonprofit focused on empowering students of color in the state’s urban core, rallied in support of the bill. 
“People constantly ask us to be involved civically, but then we lack the opportunity to do so,” Krissia Diaz, a Classical student, wrote in a testimony. “Give us the opportunity to have a real say as to what happens in our schools. . “We need to pass this bill, youth deserve to use their voice rather than have decisions made for them by officials who haven’t stepped foot in a school for more than fifteen years.”
It’s not unheard of for states’ boards of education to grant voting rights to student or teacher representatives. Massachusetts gives its student education board member voting rights, making it one of seven states that did so, according to 2022 data from the National Association of State Boards of Education. Some states have guardrails in place, like Maryland, which gives its student representative a say in the boardroom without being able to vote on personnel matters or certain appeals, according to state law.  
As for teacher representatives, their governing powers on school councils also vary by state. 
DiMario said the bill eliminates the need to identify and appoint new representatives for the student and teacher council seats, as they would be filled by existing office holders. The Teacher of the Year would sit on their council seat the year following their tenure as the state’s top teacher. DiMario’s bill would use the Senate, rather than the governor, to appoint the two new seats. 
“I do expect that there could be some questions about that separation of powers issue,” DiMario said, adding that she’s not sure if the governor would support the legislation. A spokesperson for Gov. Dan McKee did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.  
“I think it’s a fundamental approach to policy, I believe very strongly in that whole idea of ‘Nothing about us, without us,’” DiMario said. “We can only make our best decisions about what is going to solve a problem when we talk to people that are closest to that problem. To me, this is just a piece of that.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)House lawmakers sent a bill to the Senate Tuesday that would allow public and charter schools to hire chaplains or allow them to volunteer to provide “support, services, and programs” for students.
The House passed House File 884 on a vote of 57-39. The measure would allow public school districts, charter schools and innovation school zones to hire or engage a chaplain to provide services for students. The bill contains language stating that a school cannot “require or coerce a student to utilize” services or support from a chaplain and that chaplains cannot be used in lieu of a school counselor or guidance counselor.
Even so, multiple Democrats criticized the measure as an attempt to introduce religion into public schools.
Rep. Elinor Levin, D-Iowa City, said the bill represents “a dangerous attempt to go around the separation of church and state.”
While supporters of the measure compared the measure with current chaplain positions allowed in the U.S. military and in hospitals, she said the considerations of religious services are very different when involving a child who has not necessarily requested to see a chaplain.
“We are talking about a bill that has no consideration for parental consent in having a child meet with a chaplain,” Levin said. “We are talking about a bill that has no consideration for accreditation of a chaplain, training of a chaplain. We are talking about a bill that makes no prohibition on evangelizing within a school building.”
While a school’s board of directors can decide to set qualifications, credentialing or other requirements for chaplains they hire or allow to volunteer, school districts cannot require chaplains to have an certification, authorization or recognition from the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners (BOEE) in order to be in a school, as is required for other school staff positions.
Democrats said the measure could lead to adults who are not properly vetted or trained to engage with children from being in schools in an official capacity as a chaplain. But Rep. Brooke Boden, R-Indianola, said the BOEE “is not in the business of credentialing chaplains,” and that training and other requirements should be left to school districts’ discretion.
“If a school wants to make sure that a chaplain is appropriately credentialed, it is their responsibility to make sure they’re credentialed,” Boden said. “That’s local control. That’s what we gave them in the bill.”
Rep. Helena Hayes, R-New Sharon, cited research by Dr. Lisa Miller, author of the book “The Spiritual Child,” that found children and teenagers who have an active relationship with spirituality are less likely to abuse substances and face depression.
“Chaplains trained to provide spiritual and emotional care — they’re uniquely positioned to apply the findings that I just shared in schools and assist us in fostering healthier, more resilient students and reducing destructive behavior,” Hayes said.
Levin argued that the data Hayes presented is not necessarily linked with the legislation, as only one state, Texas, currently has a law allowing for public schools to employ chaplains.
“This isn’t something that has been done in many places,” Levin said. “This is something that Iowa is considering, and we have to think about Iowans. And the spiritual needs of Iowa’s kids should be met outside the school by decisions made by their parents and families.”
The bill’s floor manager, Rep. Barb Kniff McCulla, R-Pella, said the legislation will help “protect our youth and make them successful.”
“Every Iowa school in Iowa should have a chaplain, if that’s what the school district decides on,” Kniff McCulla said. “And the usage of chaplains is well documented for impacting lives in a positive direction.”
The bill moves to the Senate for further consideration.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/kniffmcculla-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderA House panel heard hours of testimony Wednesday on a bill that would expand Georgia’s law to completely ban and criminalize abortion, while even some anti-abortion groups oppose the measure. 
No vote was taken on House Bill 441, and no vote is planned, but the surprise late-session hearing drew hundreds of people to the state Capitol Wednesday who either pushed for the long-shot bill or urged lawmakers to steer clear of a bill that they warned would undermine a popular proposal to protect access to in-vitro fertilization.

Sign-toting supporters of the bill sang hymns and prayed aloud as opponents passed out stickers that said “support and compassion – not punishment” and held their own counter-protest signs in a cramped committee room before the over-capacity crowd was ushered out into the hallway to wait their turn to have their say.
The public airing of the controversial bill Wednesday was tense and came the day before the Senate is expected to finalize a bipartisan measure designed to protect access to IVF. That bill, House Bill 428, passed unanimously in the House and was supported by the sponsors of the proposed total ban on abortion.
“Tens of thousands of babies, made in the image of God, continue to be murdered in our state every year, all within the bounds of the current law. That must be changed,” said the bill’s sponsor, Rep. Emory Dunahoo, a Gillsville Republican.
Georgia’s current law bans most abortions once fetal cardiac activity is detected, which is at about six weeks and before many women know they are pregnant. The law, which took effect in 2022 after Roe v. Wade was struck down, allows for a few limited exceptions, including some – in the cases of rape and incest – that would be wiped away by Dunahoo’s bill.
Under his bill, abortions after fertilization would be deemed a homicide. A pregnant woman could be charged with a crime, unless she can prove she was forced into having the abortion.
But even prominent anti-abortion advocates in Georgia argue the bill goes too far. The Georgia Life Alliance submitted a letter to the House Judiciary Non-Civil Committee opposing the bill and objecting to the hearing even being held.
“Regardless of one’s beliefs on access to abortion, women and girls should not be further traumatized from their abortion by the fear of criminal prosecution,” wrote Claire Bartlett, the group’s executive director, and Bryan Tyson, the group’s board chairman.
A former anti-abortion lobbyist in Georgia also testified against the bill Wednesday.
“This is just really bad legislation, whether a woman has been sexually assaulted or is pregnant and facing a crisis,” said Elizabeth Edmonds. “This is not compassion. This is not how Jesus would love us.”

Several metro Atlanta doctors urged lawmakers to oppose the bill, saying it would end IVF treatment in Georgia. 
During IVF, doctors typically harvest and fertilize multiple eggs in the hope that at least one results in a successful pregnancy. Unused embryos, which are only days old and barely visible to the naked eye, are often allowed to thaw out and be destroyed. 
Dr. Karenne Fru, who is the founder and owner of a fertility clinic in Sandy Springs, said she tells all her patients that they may start out with 20 eggs but wind up with two embryos.
“Am I guilty of murder? That makes me a serial killer. What? My whole life is doing God’s work,” Fru said in impassioned comments. “He said, ‘Go forth and procreate.’ I’m doing that. Please. Just let me continue to do that. I cannot go to jail because I want to help people become parents, and this bill criminalizes what I do.”
Rep. Charlice Byrd, a Woodstock Republican who is a co-sponsor of the bill, questioned another one of the doctors how the measure would affect IVF access.
Dr. Kathryn C. Calhoun said granting embryos full legal personhood from the time of fertilization and making abortion a homicide would deter doctors from offering seemingly legal procedures.
Calhoun explained that it can take many embryos to be successful and that sometimes those embryos stop growing in the lab because they are not healthy enough to survive. 
“If our embryologists or our doctors or any of the providers in our clinic could be held criminally liable for the fact that an embryo didn’t make it in a dish by no fault of their own, but just by biology or God’s will or whatever you all want to believe about that, we wouldn’t be able to practice,” Calhoun said. “The threat and the danger would be too real to ourselves and our own families to practice that in the state of Georgia.”
The bill is part of a national effort backed by End Abortion Now, which is one of the male-run groups pushing for stringent anti-abortion restrictions and penalties. And many of the proponents who spoke in favor of the bill Wednesday were from outside of Georgia.
But not all the supporters were out-of-towners. Nikki Crannell said she and her husband, who live in Gainesville, reached out to the group. The couple said they recognize it could take years of advocacy to get such a bill passed in Georgia. 
Crannell said she has concerns about IVF.
“Those babies are babies made in the image of God too and are just sitting in the freezer, who also need a right to life,” Crannell said.

With the session set to end April 4, Wednesday’s hearing will likely be the most action the bill gets this year, though it will still technically be in play when lawmakers return next January. More moderate Republicans like Rep. Sharon Cooper say they have no interest in going further than Georgia’s current law.
Cooper, who chairs the House Public and Community Health Committee, also said she agrees with concerns that Dunahoo’s bill would threaten IVF access.
“I believe that we have gone as far as we should go on that issue,” the Marietta Republican told a reporter Wednesday, referring to abortion. “And that bill also interferes with, or would interfere with, people who are trying to get pregnant using in vitro, and I am certainly against that. And it’s a hearing only, but I certainly hope that that’s all it is, a hearing.”
The Senate is set to vote on a bill that would protect access to IVF treatment but would not regulate it. That bill is a priority of House Speaker Jon Burns, a Newington Republican who reiterated his support for the proposal Wednesday when asked through his spokesperson about the hearing on the strict abortion bill.
“While the House’s bill codifying protections for IVF is still moving through the legislative process, it will without a doubt strengthen the ability of countless Georgia families to bring life into the world,” Burns said in a statement. 
But reproductive rights advocates like Allison Coffman, who is the executive director of the Amplify Georgia Collaborative, argued that it is harmful to even hold a hearing on what she described as one of the most extreme forms of an abortion ban. 
“We are letting it see the light of day,” Coffman said. “We are saying that this is something that this committee, that this Legislature thinks is important enough to put to public discussion.”

(LA Birdie Photography)The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced late Tuesday it will release previously authorized grant funds to farmers and small rural business owners to build renewable energy projects — but only if they rewrite applications to comply with President Donald Trump’s energy priorities.
The move has left some farmers perplexed — and doubtful that they’ll ever get the grant money they were promised, given the Trump administration’s emphasis on fossil fuels and hostility toward renewable energy. 
Some of the roughly 6,000 grant applicants have already completed the solar, wind or other energy projects and are awaiting promised repayment from the government. Others say they can’t afford to take on the projects they’d been planning unless the grant money comes through.
A Floodlight analysis shows the overwhelming majority of the intended recipients of this money reside in Trump country — congressional districts represented by Republicans. 
After hearing of the USDA’s latest announcement Wednesday, Minnesota strawberry farmer Andy Petran said he suspects many previously approved projects won’t be funded. He’d been approved for a $39,625 grant to install solar panels on his farm. But like many other farmers nationally, Petran got word from the USDA earlier this year that his grant money had been put on hold.
“It’s not like any small farmer who is looking to put solar panels on their farms will be able to put a natural gas refinery or a coal refinery on the farm,” Petran said. “I don’t know what they expect me to switch to.”
Petran was counting on the benefits that solar power would bring to his farm.
After getting word in September that the USDA had approved his grant application, he expected the solar panels would not only reduce his electricity bill but allow him to sell power back to the grid. He and his wife figured the extra income would help expand their Twin Cities Berry Co. and pay down their debt more quickly.
Petran’s optimism was soon extinguished. A USDA representative told him earlier this year that the grant had been frozen.
His 15-acre farm about 40 miles north of Minneapolis operates on a razor-thin margin, Petran said, so without the grant money, he can’t afford to build the $80,000 solar project.

“Winning these grants was a contract between us and the government,” he said. “There was a level of trust there. That trust has been broken.”
In its announcement, issued Tuesday night, the USDA said grant recipients will have 30 days to review and revise their project plans to align with President Trump’s Unleashing American Energy Executive Order, which prioritizes fossil fuel production and cuts federal support for renewable energy projects.
“This process gives rural electric providers and small businesses the opportunity to refocus their projects on expanding American energy production while eliminating Biden-era DEIA and climate mandates embedded in previous proposals,” the USDA news release said. “… This updated guidance reflects a broader shift away from the Green New Deal.”
USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said in the release that the new directive will give rural energy providers and small businesses a chance to “realign their projects” with Trump’s priorities. 
It’s unclear what this will mean for grant recipients who’ve already spent money on renewable energy projects — or those whose planned projects have been stalled by the administration’s funding freeze.
The USDA didn’t directly answer those questions. In an email to Floodlight on Wednesday, a department spokesperson said the agency must approve any proposed changes to plans — but offered no specific guidance on what or whether changes should be made.
“Awardees that do not respond via the website will be considered as not wishing to make changes to their proposals, and disbursements and other actions will resume after 30 days,” the email said. “For awardees who respond via the website to confirm no changes, processing on their projects will resume immediately.”

IRA funding targeted
The grant funding was put on hold after an executive order issued by President Trump on his first day in office. It froze hundreds of billions of dollars for renewable energy under President Joe Biden’s massive climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). 
The law added more than $1 billion to the USDA’s 17-year-old Rural Energy for America (REAP) program.
About 6,000 REAP grants funded with IRA money have been paused and are being reviewed for compliance with Trump’s executive order, according to a March 5 email from the USDA’s rural development office to the office of U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland. 
A lawsuit filed earlier this month challenges the legality of the freeze on IRA funding for REAP projects. 
Earthjustice lawyer Hana Vizcarra, one of the attorneys who filed the suit, called the latest USDA announcement a “disingenuous stunt.”
“President Trump and Secretary Rollins can’t change the rules of the game well into the second half,” she said in a statement Wednesday. “This is the definition of an arbitrary and capricious catch-22.” 
Under the REAP grant program, farmers pay for renewable and lower carbon energy projects, then submit proof of the completed work to the USDA for reimbursement. The grants were intended to fund solar panels, wind turbines, grain dryers, irrigation upgrades and other projects, USDA data shows.
At a press conference in Atlanta on March 12, Rollins said, “If our farmers and ranchers, especially, have already spent money under a commitment that was made, the goal is to make sure they are made whole.” 
But some contend the administration is unfairly making farmers jump through more hoops.
“This isn’t cutting red tape; it’s adding more,” said Andy Olsen, senior policy advocate with the Environmental Law and Policy Center, a Midwest-based environmental advocacy group. “The USDA claims to deliver on commitments, but these new rules could result in awarded grants being permanently frozen.”
U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, a longtime farmer and Maine Democrat who sits on the House agriculture committee, said she thinks it’s illegal and unconstitutional for the administration to withhold grant money allocated by Congress. Beyond that, she said, it has hurt cash-strapped farmers.
 “This is about farmers making ends meet,” she told Floodlight. “It’s not some ideological issue for us.”
GOP lawmakers silent
Using USDA data, Floodlight identified the top 10 congressional districts that received the most grants. They’re all represented by Republicans who have said little publicly about the funding freezes affecting thousands of their constituents. It’s impossible to tell from the USDA data which REAP grants will get paid out. 
The congressional district that received the most REAP grants was Iowa’s 2nd District, in the northeastern part of the state. Farmers and business owners there got more than 300 grants from 2023 through 2025. The district is represented by U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, who has previously voiced support for “alternative energy strategies.” 

“More than half of the energy produced in Iowa is from renewable sources, and that is something for Iowans to be very proud of,” she told the House Appropriations Committee in June 2022. 
Hinson’s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the matter. 
The No. 2 spot for REAP grants: Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District, represented by U.S. Rep. Brad Finstad. In that district, which spans southern Minnesota, more than 260 farmers and rural businesses were approved for REAP grants. 
Finstad’s office did not return multiple emails and calls requesting comment. His constituents have been complaining about his silence on funding freezes. They’ve staged at least two demonstrations at his offices in Minnesota. Finstad said he held a Feb. 26 telephone town hall joined by 3,000 people in his district.
In a Feb. 28 letter to a constituent, Finstad said Rollins has announced that the USDA will honor contracts already signed with farmers and that he looks forward to working with the administration “to support the needs of farm country.”
Finstad is no stranger to the REAP program. Before becoming a congressman, he was the USDA’s state director of rural development for Minnesota. In that role, he was a renewable booster.
“By reducing energy costs, renewable energy helps to create opportunities for improvement elsewhere, like creating jobs,” Finstad said in a 2021 USDA press release. That has since been deleted from the agency’s website.
Rollins, meanwhile, called herself “a massive defender of fossil fuels” at her confirmation hearing, and she has expressed skepticism about the findings of climate scientists. “We know the research of CO2 being a pollutant is just not valid,” Rollins said at the Heartland Institute’s 2018 conference on energy.
She has also said that she welcomes the efforts of Elon Musk and his cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency team at the USDA.
Losing trust in government
Jake Rabe, a solar installer in Blairstown, Iowa, said he has put up more than 100,000 solar modules in the state since getting into the business in 2015. More than 30 of his customers have completed their installation but are awaiting frozen grant funding, he said. At least 10 more have signed the paperwork but are hesitant to begin construction. Millions of dollars worth of business is frozen, he said. 
On top of that, Rabe said, the state’s net metering policies — in which solar users get credits for any excess power they send back to the grid — are set to expire in 2026.
“I kind of feel like it may be the beginning of the end for the solar industry in Iowa with what’s going on,” said Rabe, who owns Rabe Hardware.
Despite it all, he remains a Trump supporter. 
“Under the current administration, I think we’re doing things that are necessary for the betterment of the entire United States,” he said.
On March 13, Earthjustice, a nonprofit environmental law group, filed a federal lawsuit against the USDA on behalf of five farmers and three nonprofits. They’re seeking a court order to compel the Trump administration to honor the government’s grant commitments, saying it violated the Constitution by refusing to disburse funds allocated by Congress. 
Vizcarra, the Earthjustice lawyer, said she is disturbed by the lack of concern from Congress, whose powers appear to have been usurped by the administration.
She added, “These are real people, real farmers and real organizations whose projects have impacts on communities who are left with this horrible situation with no idea of when it will end.”
One of the plaintiffs, Laura Beth Resnick, grows dahlias, zinnias and other cut flowers on a small farm about 30 miles north of Baltimore.
Florists are her customers, and demand for her flowers blooms during cold-weather holidays like Thanksgiving. Each of her three greenhouses is half the length of a football field, and heating them during those months isn’t cheap, Resnick said. The power bill for Butterbee Farm often exceeds $500 a month.
So a year ago, Resnick applied for a USDA renewable energy grant, hoping to put solar panels on her barn roof — a move that she estimated would save about $5,000 a year. In August, the USDA sent word that her farm had been awarded a grant for $36,450.
The cost of installing solar panels was $72,000, she said. So she paid a solar contractor $36,000 upfront, expecting that she’d pay the rest in January when the federal grant money came in. The solar panels were installed in December.

But the federal government’s check never arrived. A Feb. 4 email from a USDA representative said her request for reimbursement was rejected due to the Trump administration’s recent executive orders. 
Resnick said she sought help from her elected representatives but got “pretty much nowhere.” 
After hearing about the USDA’s announcement Wednesday, Resnick said that based on the response she’s previously gotten from the USDA, she’s not confident she will get her grant money.
“I’ve lost my trust in the USDA at this point,” she said. “Our project is complete, so we can’t change the scope of it.”
Van Hollen, the Maryland Democrat, said he supports the legal fight against the funding freeze. 
“Donald Trump and Elon Musk are scamming our farmers,” Van Hollen said in a statement to Floodlight. “By illegally withholding these reimbursements for work done under federal grants, they’re breaking a promise to farmers and small businesses in Maryland and across the country.”
Renewable projects on hold
Since 2023, when IRA funding became available, the USDA has given or loaned about $21.3 billion through programs to support renewable energy in rural areas, according to a Floodlight analysis of agency data, including the REAP program.
Those grant payments were processed until Jan. 20, when the Trump administration announced its freeze.
Trump’s decision was in line with Project 2025, a conservative blueprint crafted by the Heritage Foundation aimed at reshaping the U.S. government. That document called for repealing the IRA and rescinding “all funds not already spent by these programs.”
Environmental groups have sharply criticized the administration’s move, and several lawsuits are challenging the legality of the freeze of IRA funding.
At a recent public roundtable, Maggie Bruns, CEO of the Prairie Rivers Network which supports Illinois communities’ transition to clean energy, listed REAP grants that have been held up in Illinois, where her multifaceted environmental nonprofit is based. A $390,000 grant for a solar array at the grocery store in Carlinville; $27,000 for solar panels at an auto body shop in Staunton; $51,000 for a solar array for a golf course in Alton. 
Since 2023, farmers and businesses in Illinois have been approved for more than 590 REAP grants, making the state the third highest in number of recipients in the United States, Floodlight’s analysis shows. In an interview with Barn Raiser, Bruns said the decision to freeze such grants has caused unneeded stress for farmers. Before the executive order, USDA’s rural development team had worked hard to bring dollars for renewable energy projects to Illinois farmers, she said. 
“That’s the thing we should be celebrating right now,” Bruns said, “and instead we have to fight to make sure that money actually does land into the pockets of the people who have gone ahead, jumped through all these hoops and are attempting to do the right thing for their businesses and their farms.” 
In January, Dan Batson’s nursery in Mississippi was approved for a $400,367 REAP grant — money that he planned to use to install four solar arrays. He intended to use that solar energy to power the pumps that irrigate more than 1 million trees, a move that would have saved the company about $25,000 a year in electricity costs. 
Seated in a wooded area about 30 miles north of Biloxi, his 42-year-old GreenForest nursery ships potted magnolias, hollies, crepe myrtles and other trees to southern states. Until a couple of months ago, Batson had been excited about what the grant money would mean for the business.

But when he saw news about the funding being held up earlier this year, he called a local USDA representative who confirmed the funds had been frozen. Batson had already sent the solar contractor $240,000. Now, his plans are on hold.
“I just can’t do the project if I don’t get the money,” he said.
Tuesday’s announcement from the USDA makes him no more confident he’ll get the money, he said.
Batson said he’s a fiscal conservative so he understands the effort to cut costs. “But,” he said, “the way they’ve gone about it has disrupted a lot of business owners’ lives.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The yellow shirts of Second Amendment advocates far outnumbered orange and red shirts donned by gun control supporters at the State House for a committee hearing Wednesday on the latest proposal to ban assault-style weapons in Rhode Island.
Nearly 2,000 people filled the halls and State House rotunda to oppose the proposed ban backed by Gov. Dan McKee and the rest of the state’s general office holders. 
“It’s not common sense,” Brenda Jacob, a lobbyist and secretary for the Rhode Island Revolver & Rifle Association, told the House Committee on Judiciary. “This is an all weapons ban — let’s call this what it is.”
The bill sponsored by Jason Knight, a Barrington Democrat, would prohibit the sale and manufacturing of assault-style shotguns, handguns, and rifles beginning Jan. 1, 2026. Violators would face up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $10,000 and forfeiture of the weapon. 
Knight’s bill defines assault-style weapons based on their function and features, such as ability to accept detachable magazines and stocks, pistol grips, bayonet mount, and barrel shrouds.
“We as a General Assembly have an obligation to think about and do things to ensure the public trust, given the increase and uptick in mass murder in the United States,” Knight told the committee.
Knight’s bill was held for further study by the committee, as is standard procedure when legislation is first considered. 
Will Worthy, owner of Big Bear Fishing and Hunting in Glocester and the Range RI in Exeter, told the committee that the proposed definition would mean roughly 60% of all firearms he sells would be deemed illegal. 
“This could result in layoffs, reduced work hours or even the closure of our business,” Worthy said.
He argued that the features lawmakers aim to ban actually enhance firearm safety. Removable components, Worthy said, make guns easier to clean and securely store in a safe — something required under a law passed by the General Assembly last year.
Adding a pistol grip to a shotgun, he said, could help younger hunters properly operate their weapon.
“These are all control features,” Worthy said. “The bill’s problematic definition of semi-auto and misrepresentation of certain firearm features could lead to unintended consequences — you’re possibly going to create more accidents.”
But Knight said such arguments by gun right advocates are hyperbolic. 
“All these weapons enable a fast and powerful bullet that makes much bigger holes than a handgun,” he said in an interview before Wednesday’s hearing.

During the hearing, Knight said the proposed ban may affect some other firearms, but not nearly as many as those cited by gun rights advocates.
“Your average pistol? Legal,” he said. “Thousands of hunting rifles and shotguns would remain legal — same with several semi-automatic rifles as well.”
Second Amendment advocates also took aim with a provision that would require them to register assault-style weapons purchased before the proposed ban with state or local police.
Knight said he would likely amend the bill to instead let owners of weapons purchased before the potential ban voluntarily apply for a certificate of possession. That drew a few groans from the crowd of yellow-shirt clad advocates
But not from Rhode Island Coalition Against Gun Violence Melissa Carden, who urged the committee to advance the proposal to the House floor.
“Everyone deserves to live free from gun violence,” Carden said. “The time for change is now and the vast majority of Rhode Islanders want to end this preventable bloodshed.”
Though Wednesday’s hearing was dominated by gun rights advocates, a recent poll conducted for the Rhode Island AFL-CIO found 64% of Rhode Islanders support the ban.
It also has clear support from a majority of House members, where 39 of the chamber’s 75 legislators back Knight’s bill. Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi has previously indicated support for a ban on assault-style weapons, but House spokesperson Larry Berman said the speaker still plans to review all of Wednesday’s testimony — which garnered over 550 letters online.
Shekarchi does not support the proposed ban being in McKee’s proposed budget.
Companion legislation was filed in the Senate by Lou DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat, where the bill has 23 additional sponsors
Not among them: Senate President Dominick Ruggerio.
Senate spokesperson Greg Paré said Ruggerio plans to review the legislation after it receives a hearing before the Senate Committee on Judiciary, which has not been scheduled as of Wednesday.
With such legislative support, Knight said he is optimistic 2025 is the year his proposal will eventually get a committee vote.
“More people are paying attention,” he said. “It feels like the politics is right.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Iowa senators narrowly passed a bill Wednesday that would protect pesticide companies from “failure to warn” lawsuits. 
Similar bills have been introduced across the country, after failing in Iowa, Missouri and Idaho last year. Legislators in Georgia advanced their version of the bill, but it has not yet been signed into law by its governor. 
Senate File 394 would rule that pesticide labels issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency “shall be sufficient” in satisfying any requirement to warn users of the product’s health and safety. The bill passed the Senate 26-21.
Sen. Mike Bousselot, the bill’s floor manager, said despite the arguments against the legislation, “it’s a simple bill.” 
“It says that if you sell your glyphosate or your product and you follow federal law to the T, you can’t be sued for having done the wrong thing in labeling your product,” Bousselot said of the bill. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The bill does not name the popular household and commercial pesticide RoundUp and its ingredient glyphosate, but debate on the bill centered on the pesticide’s manufacturer, Bayer, and the numerous lawsuits that claim the product gave plaintiffs cancer. 
Senators clash over meaning of immunity
Bousselot said the bill does not give blanket immunity, because plaintiffs can still sue under other claims, like negligence, fraud and breach of warranty. 
The Republican from Ankeny also introduced an amendment that said the bill would not “prohibit a cause of action based on any other provision or doctrine of state law.” 
Sen. Matt Blake, D-Johnston, said even with the amendment, which passed, the bill is “an immunity bill” for pesticide companies. 
Blake said product liability law comprises three main theories of law, all of which would “fail” in Iowa under the bill.  
“Failure to warn is the root of a product’s liability claim,” Blake said. “If the state deems a warning label to be … sufficient, it kills the root cause.”
Sen. Adrian Dickey, R-Packwood, said the bill is about “sue happy lawyers” and reiterated a point he made in a committee hearing on the bill that the abundance of warning labels in the country have “diluted” their cautioning. 
EPA will not allow Bayer to put a cancer warning on its label to simply “cover their backside” if it is counter to the science submitted to agency, Dickey explained. 
“Today’s bill is not preventing anyone from suing a company if they feel the product causes cancer,” Dickey said. “It’s simply common sense legislation that states that you cannot sue a company for having a label on a product when the federal government doesn’t allow the label to be on the product.” 
Sen. Janice Weiner, D-Iowa City, noted evidence uncovered during RoundUp litigation, known as the Monsanto Papers, that show the company ghostwrote independent studies to support the safety of the pesticide. 
“If they did everything right, why are there reams of discovery emails showing that they lied?” Weiner said. 
Weiner noted a recently settled case against Bayer in Georgia that sided with plaintiffs. She said the same case would not be allowed in Iowa under the bill. 
“A vote for this bill is a statement to Iowans that a plaintiff in Georgia will be made whole financially … but in Iowa, in Iowa, the farmer with cancer gets nothing,” Weiner said. 
In February, more than 100 Iowans gathered in the State Capitol rotunda to hold a vigil for loved ones who were lost to cancer and to protest the bill they deemed the “cancer gag act.” 
Bousselot said the “dirty little secret” is that his opponents don’t want the bill to pass because it would require lawyers to prove that a pesticide chemical is carcinogenic.

“It can’t be proven (that) glyphosate causes cancer,” Bousselot said. “What is the justice in suing someone for mislabeling a product, if the label that you want would have broken federal law in the first place?”
Future impacts of the bill
Daniel Hinkle, senior counsel for policy and state affairs at American Association for Justice, said the bill would defer to the EPA label on a product’s safety, but he said if the label changes in the future, the user would only be protected by what the label said at the time they used the product.
Hinkle explained with an example of a farmer using a different chemical, paraquat, which research has shown may be linked to Parkinson’s Disease. EPA “has not found a clear link” between the two, which is reflected in the product’s label, similarly to that of glyphosate which the EPA holds is not linked to cancer.
“From this, even if the EPA came out in 2026 and says, ‘You know what, paraquat causes Parkinson’s disease, and we think it should be on the label,’ … the farmer who is exposed under the old label, would have no ability to hold the company accountable,” Hinkle said.
Legislators in Oklahoma proposed an amendment to their pesticide bill that would remove a company’s immunity from failure to warn claims in the state if the EPA canceled the registration of the pesticide based on new findings.
Proponents of the Iowa bill argue that without its protections, Bayer will stop manufacturing and distributing glyphosate, which according to Modern Ag Alliance, would double or triple farmers’ input costs across the country. 
Modern Ag Alliance is a group of agricultural stakeholders, including Bayer and several Iowa commodity groups, that has lobbied in favor of the bills and sponsored advertisements in farming communities across the country with slogans like “control weeds, not farming.” 
Weiner brought up the advertisements and said despite the rhetoric, glyphosate “isn’t going anywhere.” 
Bayer argues it has complied with all EPA rules
Jess Christiansen, the head of crop science and sustainability communications at Bayer, said the company set aside $16 billion for RoundUp litigation and already, the company has spent more than $10 billion of that. 
“The reality is that it doesn’t matter if you’re a big multinational company, like a Bayer Crop Science, or a mid size or a startup company — the math is the math,” Christiansen said. “You can only endure so much loss before you have to make a tough decision … we can’t continue to go down the path we’re going.” 
Bayer maintains that its products do not cause cancer and that it complied with all of the requirements from EPA for the labeling of their products. 
“We’re very much in favor of being a regulated industry,” Christiansen said. “It’s in the best interest of the public for that to happen –- then let’s uphold that, so that’s really what the (bill) language is about.” 
Opponents of the bill, including several senators who spoke on the bill, allege Bayer and other pesticide companies have worked to cover up key information showing researchers are aware of the link to cancer. 
Central to the argument is a 2015 finding from International Research Agency for Research on Cancer, or IARC, that classified glyphosate as “probably carcinogenic to humans.” 
Proponents of the bill discredit the IARC study, noting the large number of substances the body considers carcinogenic, and point to other bodies of research, including those evaluated by EPA and other countries that corroborate the safety of glyphosate. 
Opponents say IRAC evaluated a greater body of work. Research published in 2019 about the divergence of the two decisions showed IARC evaluated more than twice as many studies in its decision, and more that were peer-reviewed. 
Sen. Molly Donahue, D-Cedar Rapids, noted recent research showing Iowa has some of the highest rates of new cancer in the country, and said the bill would “protect the corporate profits at the expense of public health.” 
“I’m here to tell you right now that giving corporations immunity when their product harms Iowans, is like handing a wolf the keys to the hen house and hoping for the best,” Donahue said. 
A bill that advanced in the Iowa Senate last year had a provision limiting the bill’s protections to Chinese-owned companies, which targeted paraquat’s manufacturer, Syngenta which is owned by ChemChina. 
SF 394 does not mention Chinese-owned companies. The bill was immediately messaged to the House.

(Nathaniel Bailey for the Daily Montanan)Montana Senate President Matt Regier hired legal counsel in accordance with state statutes and procurement rules, and in close and “ongoing” consultation with legislative services staff, contrary to allegations of waste and abuse, according to a memo published by the Legislative Audit Division and released Wednesday.
The audit division examined six allegations leveled against Regier and for all six found that the “allegation of fraud, waste and abuse to be not substantiated.”
Regier had previously called the allegations a “witch hunt,” and said every action he took was “100% legal and business as normal.”
On Wednesday, Regier told the Daily Montanan the audit report found exactly what he expected — nothing. He spoke to reporters at a press conference later that afternoon.
“I’m glad to see the Legislative Audit Report fully bring to light all the false allegations that have been thrown,” Regier said. 
“I sleep well at night. Everything, everything was up and up,” he added. This was the second time the legislative auditor investigated a sitting senator. A January audit memo found former Senate President Jason Ellsworth, R-Hamilton, committed waste and abuse while procuring a $170,100 contract for a close friend and business associate, while skirting standard procurement rules.
Sen. Shelley Vance, R-Belgrade, brought forth the allegations against Regier during a March 6 floor session just before transmittal break. She originally requested the Senate convene an ethics committee to investigate her claims, but a substitute motion was made to send it to the audit division, following the same pathway as Ellsworth’s allegations. 
Vance, an ally of Ellsworth, cited an article by the Montana Free Press published earlier this month, which laid out a series of actions current Senate President Regier, R-Kalispell, took during the 2023 session and interim period when he hired a lawyer using taxpayer funds — appropriately, according to the memo released Wednesday.
Friday, the Montana Republican Party released a statement condemning the article and calling for retraction. During his press conference, Regier called MTFP’s story “full of unsourced, untrue, legal conclusions, inaccuracies, contradictional claims and baseless innuendo,” and said he had made his own request for corrections and retractions. 
MTFP Editor-in-Chief John Adams said the Free Press stands by its reporting, did not allege misconduct by anyone, and the auditor’s findings “confirm the accuracy of our original reporting.”
“Our March 5 report raised timely and legitimate questions about public spending, contracting procedures, and legislative accountability,” Adams said in a written statement.

The audit memo investigated the six allegations Vance brought forth predicated on the Free Press article, including whether the president tried to evade the law in hiring an attorney; engaged in waste, fraud and abuse in hiring a lawyer; unlawfully used state resources related to a private matter; and failed to disclose a conflict of interest, among other allegations the report could not substantiate.
The auditor’s memo, authored by Legislative Auditor legal counsel Ken Varns, said the audit division examined the article, and conducted interviews with Regier, Deputy Director of Legislative Services Division Legal Services Jaret Coles, and Angie Carter, financial manager for LSD. 
The report also examined legal contracts and invoices submitted by Abby Moscatel of Blacktail Law Group, the attorney Regier hired. The audit investigation found Regier properly hired legal staff, that contracts were executed using authorized funding, and that contracts had proper signatories.
The investigation further found that the allegation of waste, fraud and abuse, when Regier hired Moscatel for tasks routinely done by legislative staff, were unsubstantiated. 
“President Regier consulted with and obtained approval from Legislative Services when engaging outside counsel,” the memo states. 
“Legislative leadership has authority to obtain outside counsel for legal services, which can include tasks typically performed by nonpartisan legislative staff,” the memo continues. “Because existing legal authority allows for these activities and due to President Regier’s ongoing reliance on Legislative Service’s guidance relating to these contracts, we find the allegations of fraud, waste and abuse set forth in the second allegation to be not substantiated.”
The allegation that Regier hired Moscatel for work related to two constitutional initiatives in 2024 using state funds was also unfounded, according to the memo. 
In its call for retractions to the MTFP article, the state GOP stated that the party had paid for legal services related to those lawsuits. 
The investigation further found that Regier did not engage in any attempts to artificially deflate expenses to evade spending limits — an allegation that was leveled against Ellsworth and identified as problematic by the Legislative Audit Division. 
The memo states that the cumulative value of work done by Moscatel was $22,980, which even were it not broken down between multiple, specific contracts, would not require the contracts to undergo a competitive bidding process according to state procurement laws. It further stated that all legal and financial staff “made appropriate decisions or recommendations” throughout the contracting process. 
Another question about Regier’s failure to disclose a conflict of interest in a Senate Bill 352, brought to offer immunity to legislative staff, had “no clear linkage” to the work Moscatel was hired to do.
“It is difficult to discern a conflict of interest in this scenario,” the memo states.

On Wednesday afternoon, Vance said she had not yet read the memo, but when told all six allegations were considered “not substantiated,” she declined to comment. 
Ellsworth, who has been on the opposite side of an intra-party division as Regier that has roiled the Senate this session, said he had read parts of the memo and that they are “totally inaccurate.” He said he would still like to see the matter referred to the Ethics Committee. 
“I trusted that the Auditor would do his job. I verified that the Auditor has not done his job,” Ellsworth said, also taking issue with the fact that the auditor released findings on Ellsworth after just one week, while Regier’s investigation took three. 
The Legislative Audit Division said it is not typical practice to publish findings on unsubstantiated reports to its fraud hotline, but the public nature of the current investigation — stemming from a vote on the Senate floor — led to a public document.
“Accordingly, although we will not be making any further public comments on this matter or releasing our investigative documents, we believe the enclosed memo is a public document and can be disclosed by Senate leadership,” said Legislative Auditor Angus Maciver said. 
At the press conference, Regier called for apologies from the Free Press and Sen. Vance, not for himself, but for “victims of their actions,” including legislative staff and Moscatel, a private citizen. He also said he remains committed to making legislative and budget appropriations processes as transparent as possible, even in the face of misinformation. 
“I remain committed to rooting out corruption and unethical behavior at the Legislature and also in this state government, and I’m going to continue to do that no matter what the retaliation or false allegations are to anyone that tries to shoot me next time,” Regier said.

Schatzel, who began leading the university about two years ago, gave her resignation and the board accepted it in a special-called meeting Wednesday evening. 
The board unanimously voted to name Gerry Bradley as the 20th president of the university effective immediately. He was previously UofL’s executive vice president and university provost. There will be no presidential search. 
Board chair Diane Medley read a joint statement from the board and Schatzel before taking questions from reporters after the meeting. The statement praised Schatzel’s “strong relationships with elected officials” and said both Schatzel and the board “share a mutual love for the University of Louisville and its students, faculty and staff and look forward to the institution realizing even greater success in the future.” 
When asked if the relationship between the board and Schatzel had turned “sour” leading up to Wednesday, Medley said she would not frame it that way.
“We were very pleased with how things had gone with the legislature, with some of the programs that were being initiated,” Medley said. As with any position, times change, the goals of Dr. Schatzel changed, our goals changed, and we were very fortunate to have had the ability to name Dr. Bradley, who had already been here, so we wouldn’t lose any momentum.”

Schatzel was not present at Wednesday’s board meeting, but rumors about her exit swirled Tuesday.  WDRB reported Schatzel said in a phone call Tuesday that she could not comment on her employment status. The agenda for the Wednesday board meeting was released and included an executive session to discuss “personnel matters” in private. 
The board met in executive session for more than an hour Wednesday evening along with its general counsel. 
According to the terms of her separation, Schatzel will be paid $400,000 plus applicable earnings on account of deferred compensation within a month of her resignation. She will also receive an additional payment of $300,000 in six monthly installments beginning April 15. 
Gerry Bradley
Bradley had recently accepted a position at the University of Cincinnati, though that changed Tuesday. In a memo to campus, President Neville G. Pinto said Bradley had declined to join the University of Cincinnati as its executive vice president for academic affairs and provost and was “pursuing other opportunities.” UC had announced last week that Bradley would join the university. 
At UofL, Bradley has been executive vice president and university provost for three years, including two as interim. Shortly after the meeting ended, he had not yet signed an official contract for his new position. 
“It’s an exciting time to be here,” Bradley told reporters after Wednesday’s meeting. “And I couldn’t be prouder to be a part of this Cardinal community — a community of care.” 
Bradley joined UofL as dean of the School of Dentistry in 2016. Before that, he was chair and professor of developmental sciences at Marquette University School of Dentistry. 
Bradley said the opportunity to stay in Louisville came within the past couple of days. He said his working relationship with Schatzel had been “very good.” 
Schatzel joined UofL in February 2023. She joined the university after leading Towson University in Maryland.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_3711_jpg-e1743033344958-1024x737.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)The West Virginia House of Delegates is considering a bill that would allow the Legislature to write its own rules for disclosing public records, but House Speaker Roger Hanshaw said the intent is not to hide records. 
Journalists, researchers and members of the public use the Freedom of Information Act to obtain access to lawmakers’ emails, presentations and more that can shed light on how decisions are being made. The emails can reveal what lobbyists or special interest groups are involved in bill making. Some communications are exempt.
House Bill 3412, sponsored by Hanshaw, R-Clay, would exempt the Legislature from requirements of the Freedom of Information Act, if it adopts its own rules. 
The House Rules Committee reviewed the measure Wednesday. 
Current state FOIA law does not differentiate between the state’s court system, the executive branch and the legislature, Hanshaw said. He told committee members individuals often use FOIA to access drafts of bills that are never introduced.
FOIA laws have existed since 1966.
Hanshaw wants the House to write rules that make it clear to the public what is and is not a public record.
“One of the objections sought to be achieved by this particular piece of legislation is clarification of what is and isn’t a legislative record that can actually be reachable by those who simply seek access to legislative records,” he said. 
Doug Skaff, interim director of the West Virginia Press Association, appeared before lawmakers to question if the bill would affect journalists’ access to legislative records.
“We just want to make sure that these laws provide a legal basis and a framework that government records, meetings and all the doings within the public body of this Capitol is available to recognized media outlets in this state,” Skaff said. “We think we owe it to the people of West Virginia to discuss and spread the information that happens under this dome.”
Hanshaw said that he views the media as partners who disseminate the information about what happens at the Capitol.
“We think we have a pretty constructive relationship with our media partners right now … we realize that the press is not the only user of the Freedom of Information statute,” Hanshaw said.
“We would be supportive as long as it doesn’t restrict the right of the media to do their job,” Skaff responded.
Ann Ali, deputy chief of staff and communications director for the House of Delegates, said in an email that the intent of the bill is not to hide public records and that Hanshaw wants any legislative records currently available to the public to remain available to the public.
“However — the intent is also to exempt the Legislature from FOIA and to adopt open records rules the Legislature would follow, because there may be instances when FOIA doesn’t fit the specifics of what the Legislature is or does,” she said. If the change is adopted, people would cite a rule rather than the Freedom of Information Act in a request for public documents, she said.
While House Minority Leader Sean Hornbuckle has concern about the bill, he feels that it would still permit the media to access records for reporting. 
“It appears it has to do more with people outside the state who might have ulterior motives. I do feel better [about it],” said Hornbuckle, D-Cabell.
The American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia also has concerns with the bill.
“First the Senate limited recording in the chamber. Then, the House did away with public hearings. Now they want to exempt the Legislature entirely from open records laws,” ACLU-WV Advocacy Director Rusty Williams said in a statement. “They won’t be satisfied until they’re passing their harmful, extremist agenda entirely in private. Enough is enough. We have a right to know what our elected leaders are up to.”
In order for the change to go into effect, the bill would first have to become law. Next, the House would have to create then adopt its own rules in order for the new FOIA rules to go into effect. Without a rule, the default would be the current FOIA statute, Hanshaw said. 
The Senate could adopt the rules to become regulations that apply to both bodies, according to Hanshaw.

Malone did better with a stunning upset in the 36th District special election Tuesday. He beat Republican County Commissioner Joshua Parsons by 0.89%, according to unofficial results, and became the first Democrat to represent Lancaster County in the Pennsylvania Senate since 1879.
Parsons conceded Wednesday afternoon, saying in a post on the social media platform X that a review of the remaining ballots showed there were not enough uncounted votes to change the outcome.

Having reviewed the numbers from last night, including the fact that there are not enough provisional or other outstanding ballots to change the overall result, I have called Mayor Malone to congratulate him and wish him the best.  1/2

The Democratic victory drew national attention as the latest in a string of special election wins across the country. Although it did not change control of the Senate, it reduced Republicans’ majority in the Senate to 27-23. 
Ryan Aument, who ran unopposed for the seat in 2022, resigned last year to work for U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick.
Democrats attribute the win, in part, to voters who feel betrayed by what they describe as President Donald Trump’s draconian and tumultuous first months in office.
“Folks are not happy with the chaos that we’re seeing in Washington and are not happy with Parsons,” Malone said, recounting what he heard from voters as he knocked on doors across the district, which President Donald Trump won by more than 15%.
Parsons campaigned on his reputation as a conservative firebrand who defied the state-ordered lockdown during the COVID-19 emergency, an abortion opponent and Trump ally. 
But he also drew national attention for his harassment of a reporter at Lancaster Online/LNP and stoking anger over a drag queen story hour at Lancaster Public Library. The library ultimately canceled the event when a bomb threat and suspicious package shut down downtown Lancaster in March 2024.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“A lot of what we heard was they didn’t like his negativity and they didn’t like that he was voting against them,” Malone said.
Efforts to reach Parsons on Wednesday through his campaign’s website, Facebook page and campaign officials were unsuccessful. 
A Republican official blamed Parsons’ defeat on a loss of focus after the 2024 election.
“This is a wake up call. We can’t rest on the laurels of last November’s great victories,” Pennsylvania GOP Chairman Greg Rothman said in a post. “We can’t be complacent and we must be unified. We need to keep the intensity of 2024 and fight together for every vote.”
Franklin & Marshall College pollster Berwood Yost said the outcome was both surprising and followed a trend so far in 2025.
“When you have a Republican who loses the district with a 23 point registration advantage, that qualifies as a surprise,” Yost said.
At the same time, Democrats have won five special elections across the country this year, Yost noted. That has a lot to do with the electorate in special elections, when turnout is typically low. In Lancaster county, 29% or about 54,000 registered voters participated.
The emphasis for national Democrats on Tuesday was the special election for the 35th House District in Allegheny County, where the party focused efforts to defend the one-seat majority it won in November. The seat was left empty in January when Rep. Matthew Gergely died after suffering a medical emergency.
Democrat Dan Goughnour won the election with 63.4% of the vote, according to unofficial results.

Special election voters tend to be more tuned-in and have more education, which favors Democrats, Yost said. It also tracks trends following presidential elections, when there is typically a swing toward the party not in the White House or in the majority in Washington.
“When you look back to Trump’s first term, there was a big swing toward Democrats in special elections at that time,” Yost said.
State Rep. Nikki Rivera (D-Lancaster) said Malone was a perfect foil to Parsons, who espoused many positions of the MAGA movement. 
As the mayor of East Petersburg, a borough of about 4,500 people a short distance from Lancaster, Malone earned a reputation as a person who leads by example and shows genuine concern and compassion for people. 
“He’s known for being personable and connecting with people on all sides of a topic,” Rivera said. “He is truly able to cross party lines to understand and be understood.”
But outside his small community, Malone had “almost no name recognition,” Sexton said. That called for a grassroots effort to introduce him to voters in more than two dozen municipalities.
Sexton said she found inspiration in Iowa Democrat Mike Zimmer’s victory, flipping a state Senate seat in January.
“I reached out to them and said we have to know how you did it,” Sexton said. “They gave us their whole plan.”
Lancaster Democrats enlisted phone banking help from county committees across Pennsylvania and launched a ground game that included “obsessively” tracking mail ballots and dispatching volunteers to retirement communities to follow up with voters, Sexton said.
She said Malone worked hard, meeting voters and attending a League of Women Voters forum that Parsons skipped. Libertarian Zachary Moore of Mount Joy was there too, and won 480 votes, almost exactly the margin by which Parsons lost, Sexton noted.
Sexton said Malone’s campaign spent about $215,000, an amount she estimates is tied with or slightly greater than Parsons’ spending. Campaign finance reports show money continued to flow to the candidates in the final 24 hours of the race.
Parsons’s campaign was supported by GOP activist Scott Presler, who helped turn out Amish voters in the 2024 general election. Presler, who has drawn criticism for his anti-Muslim language, rung early alarm bells about a possible Democratic victory, drawing the attention of billionaire megadonor Elon Musk, Lancaster Online reported this week.
Sexton said Musk’s post came too late to help Parsons’ fundraising. But it reinforced Malone’s message.
“Parsons was really being supported by billionaires and ours was a grassroots campaign and that was really a contrast that resonated with people,” Sexton said.
When Pressler posted on X late Tuesday night lamenting Parsons’ apparent loss, Musk replied with a one word post: “Damn.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_0592-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014
,DC,2025-03-26 23:40:43+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump administration turned down for now in use of Alien Enemies Act for deportations,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-turned-down-now-use-alien-enemies-act-deportations,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration lost a round Wednesday night in its attempts to use a wartime law for deportations of Venezuelans accused of gang ties.The 2-1 decision by a U.S. District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit panel will keep in place a temporary restraining order to prevent any more deportations of Venezuelan nationals ages 14 and older under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, invoked by President Donald Trump.The Trump administration sent three deportation flights carrying more than 250 men to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador after the restraining order was issued.Judge Patricia A. Millett, a nominee of President Barack Obama, and Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson, a nominee of President George H.W. Bush, ruled that the Department of Justice did not meet the requirements to lift the order.Henderson also noted a presidential proclamation signed by Trump did not set up a due process to allow those accused under the Alien Enemies Act to challenge it.Judge Justin R. Walker, who was appointed by Trump, agreed with the Trump administration’s request to block the restraining order.Shortly after the appeals court order, the American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the suit against the Trump administration, filed a request with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, asking for the temporary restraining order to be extended for another 14 days.The ACLU noted it plans to file a preliminary injunction request on Friday “in which they intend to submit additional factual material so that there is a more complete record.”A hearing on the preliminary injunction is set for April 8.Bondi and state secrets privilegeWednesday's decision comes after Attorney General Pam Bondi on Monday invoked the “state secrets privilege” to block U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg from obtaining additional information about deportation flights carried out under the Alien Enemies Act.The privilege is a common-law doctrine that protects sensitive national security information from being released.Boasberg has sought detailed information about the timing of the three deportation planes to determine if the Trump administration violated his order.From the bench on March 15, he gave a verbal order that blocked the use of the act and ordered anyone on the deportation flights subject to the Alien Enemies Act to be returned to the United States.The Trump administration has said only two of the three planes carried Venezuelans subject to the proclamation.Due processHenderson, in her opinion, noted that the Trump administration “has yet to show a likelihood of success on the merits.”In oral arguments before the appeals court Monday, the Department of Justice argued that the U.S. District Court lacked the jurisdiction to hear the case and that the Trump administration's “conduct is lawful under the plain text of the Alien Enemies Act.”Henderson also raised due process issues. She noted that the temporary restraining order is simply pausing “the summary removal of Venezuelan immigrants to a notorious prison in El Salvador or other unknown locations without first affording them some semblance of due process to contest the legal and factual bases for removal.“In the government’s view, based on its allegation alone, Plaintiffs can be removed immediately with no notice, no hearing, no opportunity—zero process—to show that they are not members of the gang, to contest their eligibility for removal under the law, or to invoke legal protections against being sent to a place where it appears likely they will be tortured and their lives endangered,” she said.Millett in her opinion questioned why the Trump administration would ask for an emergency ruling to lift the order from Boasberg because “the government’s persistent theme for the last ten days has been that the district court’s oral direction regarding the airplanes was not a (Temporary Restraining Order) with which it had to comply.”“But the one thing that is not tolerable is for the government to seek from this court a stay of an order that the government at the very same time is telling the district court is not an order with which compliance was ever required,” she said.  “Heads the government wins, tails the district court loses is no way to obtain the exceptional relief of a (Temporary Restraining Order) stay.”Millett also criticized the Department of Justice for appealing to the circuit court first before trying the district court.“I would deny the stay on this additional ground,” she said. “The government needs to play by the same rules it preaches. And it needs to respect court rules.”Judge sides with DOJWalker, who appeared to align with the Department of Justice’s arguments on Monday, sided with the Trump administration.In his opinion he reiterated his stance from Monday’s oral arguments.Walker again argued that the right way for Venezuelans to object to detention under the Alien Enemies Act is a habeas corpus claim, which is used to challenge an unjust imprisonment, including immigration detention.The original five men who brought the suit under the Alien Enemies Act, before the federal judge moved to a class suit, were in a detention center in Texas, rather than the District of Columbia.“The problem for the Plaintiffs is that habeas claims must be brought in the district where the Plaintiffs are confined,” he said. “For the named Plaintiffs at least, that is the Southern District of Texas.”Tren de Aragua gangBorder Czar Tom Homan said Monday that he was confident that the more than 250 Venezuelans on the deportation flights were members of the Tren de Aragua gang, according to White House pool reports.Homan said that he got “assurances from the highest levels of (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) that” everyone on the planes were members of the Tren de Aragua.“We're talking about terrorists,” he said. “These are not good people.”Immigration attorneys for the men and family members have said those sent to the mega-prison had no criminal record or were in asylum proceedings before an immigration judge.",,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Attorney General Brenna said Wednesday that a county sheriff broke the law by saying he would not honor requests to detain people for suspected violations of immigration laws if those requests weren’t approved by the courts.
In a Feb. 4, 2025, Facebook post, Winneshiek County Sheriff Dan Marx, a Republican, stated that if his office received “detainer” requests to hold suspected illegal immigrants, and those requests were not vetted and approved by the courts, they would be rejected by his office.
In his post, Marx distinguished between detainer requests of that kind and what he called “valid” judicial warrants and court orders. He wrote that “the only reason detainers are issued is because the federal agency does not have enough information or has not taken the time to obtain a valid judicial warrant.”
In her report, Bird claims that assertion by Marx is false.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Marx also wrote that detainers which had not been vetted by the courts were “violations of our 4th Amendment protection against warrantless search, seizure and arrest, and our 6th Amendment right to due process” — another claim that Bird says is false.
Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican like Bird, had sent the attorney general’s office an official complaint seeking an investigation into the Facebook post.
In the report summarizing her investigation, Bird alleges Marx’s post violated Iowa Code Chapter 27A, which prohibits state law enforcement from discouraging public cooperation with federal immigration authorities.
On Wednesday, Bird said Marx’s Facebook post discourages such cooperation by making “false claims” and by threatening to interfere with enforcing Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainers.
According to the report, Marx stated on Feb. 14, 2025, that his office had complied with all 21 of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainers that it had received.
Bird said Wednesday her office will close its investigation once the sheriff has issued a statement “clarifying” his Facebook post, and she gave him until 5 p.m. on Wednesday to do so. Bird’s report and a related press release were issued at 4:44 p.m. Wednesday, 16 minutes before the deadline. It’s not clear when Marx was informed of the deadline.
Failure to comply with the directive, Bird said, would result in enforcement action against the sheriff.
“Iowa law makes clear that there are no sanctuary counties,” Bird said in a press release.  “Any reports of sanctuary counties or sheriffs will be investigated. Our investigation into Winneshiek County found that the sheriff is violating the law, and we are giving the sheriff a chance to fix the problem. Failure to do so means that his county may lose all state funding.”
In an unusual move, Bird provided Marx with specific language to include in the public statement that is to go out over his signature, adding that his statement must conform “substantially” to the language she dictated:
“People of Winneshiek County,
The Winneshiek County Sheriff’s Office fully complies with all state and federal law. We cooperate with ICE, FBI, and others under both state and federal law. Iowa law requires full and complete cooperation with federal immigration authorities. We follow that law.
“We will always comply with ICE detainers and, at least since November 26, 2018, we have done so. This post serves as formal revocation of my earlier February 4, 2025 post. Since we adopted our official policy that we will comply with ICE detainers, we have complied with all 21 ICE detainers that ICE has made with our office. We will continue to comply with every ICE detainer request made in Winneshiek County. 
“On Feb. 4, I posted a message on Facebook that implied we would not fully comply with state and federal law. I have deleted that message, which I disavow. It was wrong. It made many incorrect statements regarding my office’s policies on ICE detainers. This message explaining that the Winneshiek County Sheriff’s Office has always complied with every single ICE detainer made and will continue to comply, as required by both state and federal law, replaces that message. 
“My office has a long-time stance on recognizing and complying with ICE detainers. We will continue to do so.
“Respectfully, Sheriff Dan Marx.”

Advocates have called Senate Bill 2 anti-trans legislation and criticized its high priority for the General Assembly this session. 
The bill says public dollars cannot be used to fund a “cosmetic service or elective procedure” for Kentucky inmates. It also says if a health care provider documents that ending a treatment would harm an inmate, use of the drug or hormone may be “systematically reduced and eliminated.”
In a brief statement, Beshear’s office said he “does not believe that the state should pay for gender reassignment surgeries for convicted felons, as this would mean those in prison would receive better access to medical care than a law-abiding citizen. However, courts have ruled that federal law may require some nonsurgical care.”

(Courtesy of Office of Gov. Jim Pillen)LINCOLN — Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen has officially appointed a new “Water Quality and Quantity Task Force” as he seeks to merge two state agencies that oversee water resources.
Pillen’s office announced the initial appointment of seven members to the task force and a first meeting of the group earlier in the day, according to a news release Wednesday evening. The first meeting was not open to the public or announced ahead of time. The governor’s office is still working out whether some future meetings will be public.
In the coming weeks, Pillen has promised to appoint more members and is eyeing a group of about 20 to 25 people who will focus on water quality and quantity but also education.
Pillen promised to create the group when he testified on Legislative Bill 317 last month, which was introduced at his request. That bill seeks to fold the Nebraska Department of Natural Resources into the Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy.
LB 317, led by State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, chair of the Legislature’s Natural Resources Committee, would create the Nebraska Department of Water, Energy and Environment.
“We have tremendous opportunity through this group to initiate actions that will impact Nebraska for generations to come,” Pillen said in a statement. “For years, water policy in this state has been largely reactive. Now, we have the knowledge and technology in place to be proactive in how we approach issues that impact our farmers, our industries and our communities.”
Pillen plan to merge two agencies hits rough waters at legislative hearing

Task force members said they want to encourage increased adoption of technologies and solutions for handling water issues, especially in agriculture, according to the release.
The group plans to meet over the next year to 15 months to identify short-, mid- and long-term goals and accompanying action items. This could include subgroups, as needed.
Brandt, as committee chair, selected LB 317 as a 2025 committee priority bill, increasing the chances it will be debated by the full Legislature this spring. The bill hit a string of opposition at its committee hearing last month, as some argued the merger could divide, rather than increase, attention on water. The merger is not expected to result in cost savings.
The Natural Resources Committee voted to advance LB 317 to the full Legislature last week.
Pillen, who started Columbus-based Pillen Family Farms in 1993, and whose family still operates a major hog operation, said “water is our holy grail because of the Ogallala Aquifer.”
“We must be smart about how we use our water and keep it as clean and contaminate-free as possible,” Pillen said. “Only then, will we be able to meet all necessary demands.”
The initial task force’s “core members” appointed by Pillen are:

Jesse Bradley, interim director of the Nebraska Department of Natural Resources and Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy.


Matt Manning, an engineer in the Natural Resources Department.


Marty Stange, environmental supervisor for the City of Hastings.


Brandon Hunnicutt, chair of the Nebraska Corn Board.


Don Batie, a farmer and past president of the state’s Natural Resources Commission.


Dean Settje, founder and president of Settje Agri-Services and Engineering, a provider of livestock systems design, engineering, construction management, manure marketing and environmental compliance.


Scott Schaneman, general manager of the North Platte Natural Resources District.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Promising that movement will continue to be slow, panels in both the Iowa House and Senate moved forward Wednesday with the major property tax proposal set forward by legislative Republicans.
Subcommittees for House Study Bill 313 and Senate Study Bill 1208 were held Wednesday, the first public hearings for the property tax legislation that Rep. Bobby Kauffman, R-Wilton and Sen. Dan Dawson, R-Council Bluffs introduced in early March.
The legislation would change Iowa’s local property tax system from a “rollback” to a “revenue-restricted” system, according to the legislators. Currently, residential property taxes are calculated by assessing the market value of a property, a portion of which is taxable. The Iowa Department of Revenue sets the rate of how much of the property’s value can be taxed each year based on the growth of statewide taxable properties — but the rollback system limits how much the aggregate value of residential property can grow each year to 3%.
The new system would remove this rollback restriction, allowing taxable property value to grow by a larger margin in the state. However, there would be new limits in place that would limit property tax growth, Dawson and Kauffman said, including measures that cap the increase of most property tax levy rates to 2% each year — excluding new construction — and that limits the amount of new tax revenues that local governments can collect. The new system would be phased in over the course of five years.
Several speakers at the subcommittee meetings expressed concerns about the 2% growth cap. Amy Campbell, representing Polk County, suggested that instead of a flat rate, the growth cap should be attached to the consumer price index (CPI) or the Midwest employee index “since human resources and employee costs are a large part of the budgets and county government.”
Jolly Omar with the city of Pleasant Hill said the 2% cap could have a negative impact on cities’ ability to keep up with inflation as it relates to services and staffing that residents.
“The 2% hard cap is a little too restrictive when you take into account CPI, when you take into account public safety costs — again, those are expanses that for Pleasant Hill, about 50% of our property tax dollars go towards the support of public safety,” Omar said. “So we just want to help bring some context with that.”
Scott Sanders, city manager of Des Moines, expressed similar concerns, saying that public safety makes up 60% to 70% of a city’s general fund spending. In Des Moines, he said, public safety costs grow 4% each year.
“The 2% will not reconcile with that,” Sanders said. “The 2% cap, coupled with the historic 4% growth in public safety, would force Des Moines to make about $2 million of additional cuts each year continuously.”
Sanders and other speakers also brought up concerns about the changes to revenues collected through tax increment financing (TIF) — a mechanism where increased property tax revenues in a designated TIF district from development in that area go toward public improvements in that district. He said he feared the change would stop cities from pursuing these projects.
“A new development within a TIF district will not generate the future additional general operating lending dollars that are needed,” Sanders said. “Obviously, those projects are breeding additional needs for services. There is no motivation at that point for communities to incentivize the projects, because they’re not getting any additional tax dollars for operations at any point.”
Dawson said he did not agree with concerns brought up about TIF districts, saying that if “TIF is your first concern on property tax reform, you’re not concerned about property tax reform.” He said while these projects may be financially beneficial for developers and cities, they do not benefit most taxpayers.
“The people involved in TIF are probably going to make some money off it, and everyone else has to have a bad system and a high TIF rate to support it,” Dawson said. “And by the way, from a state budget standpoint, we’re here to make you whole at the tune of $95 million a year right now, the state of Iowa is supplementing on TIF, which we are robbing from school districts.”
The bill also shifts $426 million funding for K-12 schools currently paid for using property taxes to the state. Dawson told reporters this would not result in an increased cost to the state, as these funds would be reallocated from existing tax credits that would be eliminated by the legislation.
Margaret Buckton, representing the Urban Education Network and Rural School Advocates of Iowa, warned that while the state taking over the levies funding public schools under the current formula will result in a lower cost for property taxes, it could make it more difficult for schools to get needed funding from the state.
“What that does is makes it a lot harder for schools to convince you and the public that they have enough money, because you see your line item going up in investment (from the state) and don’t necessarily see what the property taxpayer would have paid,” Buckton said. “We are struggling with adequate funding, and this doesn’t make it easier to do that, but understand that gives property tax relief.”
Rep. Larry McBurney, D-Urbandale, said he was glad to see the process of this bill going “a little bit slower” than previous discussions on property tax changes and that he still had issues with the legislation. However, he said the bill could be a good vehicle for needed changes to Iowa’s property tax law.
“I will give credit where credit is due, and that is, this is a very bold change to our property tax code,” McBurney said. “I think that there are a lot of things in here that are workable. There are concerns that I have, speaking with my city leaders and speaking with my school districts that I would like to see addressed. … (I’m) not ready to call it a property tax cut yet, because I don’t think we’ve seen a true cut since we started doing this in 2013, but I am hopeful.”
Kaufmann said he appreciated the feedback from local officials and advocate groups on the issue, pointing to multiple areas brought up by lobbyists that were areas “to work on” like TIF components and education funding consistency. He said these discussions were why he “committed to moving slowly on this.”
“That’s why there was two weeks in between subcommittee and the bill being released,” Kaufmann said. “There’ll be two more weeks in between subcommittee and committee, and then after that, I’m sure we’ll have a couple more weeks after that, where we will then continue to solicit feedback and hopefully put forth an amendment that most of us can agree on.”
House Speaker Pat Grassley said Republicans are “not trying to rush anything forward” and were still assessing the full impact of the proposed changes to Iowa’s property tax system.
“When you’re trying to tackle something of this magnitude, it isn’t something you should rush forward,” Grassley told reporters earlier in March. “But we’ve been having some good meetings with groups coming in … and I think we need to be very deliberate, because this is a significant change to the current system.”
Though legislators said they plan to take their time with the measure, Dawson said he believed moving forward with the measure was necessary to lower costs for Iowa taxpayers.
“I’ve got to say that, either we do something in this (form) or we do nothing at all and stay in the current system, which isn’t fair to the taxpayers,” Dawson said. “And I’m not sure some other entities out there can survive underneath that.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_20250326_151840115-scaled-e1743029703698-1024x638.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)FRANKFORT — Health advocates are urging the Kentucky General Assembly to reconsider Republican changes to the Medicaid program passed in the final hours before lawmakers broke for the 10-day veto period.
Meanwhile, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear on Wednesday vetoed the changes — contained in House Bill 695 — saying they would “put up barriers to and delay health care for Kentuckians.” 
Lawmakers return to Frankfort Thursday and Friday to wrap up the 2025 legislative session. Republicans can easily override the Democratic governor’s vetoes thanks to holding supermajorities in both chambers.
HB 695 would do several things that health advocates say are concerning. One is a mandated work requirement for able-bodied Kentuckians between the ages of 18 and 60 who don’t have dependents and are both “physically and mentally able to work.” Advocates said the requirement would create red tape and increase administrative costs at the expense of paying for actual health care. 
Another: the bill would reinstate prior authorization requirements for Medicaid behavioral health benefits, which include treatment for substance use disorder. It also would keep the executive branch from making changes to Medicaid without the General Assembly’s approval, unless required by federal law. 
  Dustin Pugel
“Freezing that until the legislature can give approval for anything along those lines — there are a lot of unforeseen outcomes of that,” said Dustin Pugel, the policy director at the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy, in an interview with the Lantern. 
Other parts of the bill — setting up an advisory board to oversee Medicaid spending and learn more about it, are generally supported. 
Given the growth of Medicaid spending, Andrew McNeill, the president and senior policy fellow at the Kentucky Forum for Rights, Economics & Education (KYFREE), told the Lantern in an interview that he’s “not surprised that the legislature is asserting itself in this way to become far more active and involved with the Medicaid program, and I think that their primary initiative in that vein is this new Medicaid oversight committee.” 
Medicaid is a state-federal program that covers almost 1.5 million Kentuckians.
‘Less health care to fewer people’
  Emily Beauregard
At a Wednesday press conference, Emily Beauregard, the executive director of Kentucky Voices for Health, said the bill, in its current form, “puts our safety net and workforce at risk by adding costly administrative red tape to the program that would end up providing less health care to fewer people.” 
“As a coalition led by consumer voices, we are acutely aware that most Kentuckians are simply a lost job, new baby, accident or illness away from qualifying for Medicaid and other safety net programs that exist to catch us when we fall and sustain us while we get back on our feet,” she said.
The work requirement 
Section 4 of the bill says “the cabinet, to the extent permitted under federal law, shall implement a mandatory community engagement waiver program for able bodied adults without dependents who have been enrolled in the state’s medical assistance program for more than twelve (12) months.” 
On the night this language was added, Senate budget committee Chair Chris McDaniel said “the intent is that if you are an ablebodied adult, that you have to demonstrate some kind of a work effort, be that school, be that child care, be that community involvement job, whatever the case is, right, the intent is that you have to execute some type of task like that.”
That’s a very small population. According to data from the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy, the work requirement would apply to only 2%-4% of Kentuckians on Medicaid. Most Kentucky adults  on Medicaid work. 
Former Gov. Matt Bevin made an unsuccessful attempt to add a work requirement to Medicaid, which was reversed when Beshear took office. Before that, though, President Donald Trump — in his first term — had approved a waiver application to add the requirements, but a federal judge in Washington twice blocked it, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported. 
“On the face of it, the expectation for Kentuckians to work and contribute to their families and their communities sounds like common sense. It’s certainly a goal we all share,” Beauregard said. “But in reality, a work reporting requirement is the opposite of common sense. The paperwork and administrative red tape will actually make it harder for people to get and stay healthy enough to work. Terminating someone’s health care for not reporting will only make them sicker and less able to work. That’s not common sense.”

During a coffee conversation with reporters Wednesday morning, Senate President Robert Stivers said “I don’t think anybody wants to see a deserving person lose their benefits.” 
“We’re trying to get to the point to make sure that there is not that overutilization by people who are work-able, and make sure that those people who are needy and don’t have the ability to work or obtain insurance because of their status or their employment status, they can’t because of physical or mental issues, that they do have health care coverage,” Stivers said. 
But, he said, “when your budgets in the Medicaid realm are so fast and growing, you’ve got to control that expenditure.” 
“Plus, there are many things offered in the Medicaid list of services that private insurance doesn’t cover,” Stivers said. “And so, for working people, middle class, middle income people, they can’t get the coverage that a person on Medicaid gets, which I think is wrong. You should have equal, comparable, but not better than.” 
Beauregard questioned  the assertion that Medicaid benefits are better than those provided by private insurance.
“Here’s the thing: people with commercial health insurance — or with any other type of health care, Medicare, Medicaid — we should all expect to have the type of care that we need when we need it,” she said. “We should have access to those services when we need them. And to suggest that Medicaid is a better benefit than commercial insurance, to me, says we need to expect more from commercial insurance.” 
She added: “I don’t think that anybody with Medicaid coverage is getting services that aren’t medically necessary, and we hear oftentimes that people do struggle with access to care for other reasons. I would reject any notion that Medicaid benefits are too generous.” 
‘Unintended consequences’ 
  Sheila Schuster
Sheilia Schuster, who leads the Kentucky Mental Health Coalition and has long been a mental health advocate in Frankfort, takes issue with the term “able bodied” in the work requirement. 
“To look at some of our folks with substance use disorder or mental illness, they look able bodied, but they are not,” she said. “They are not mentally fit to be able to go to work.” 
KFF released a poll in early March that showed a majority of Americans — 62% — support the idea of work requirements. That same poll showed the same percentage of people have the misconception that people on Medicaid aren’t already working.  KFF (formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation) is a nonpartisan nonprofit that focuses on health care policy.
McNeil said incentivizing more people into the workforce through a Medicaid work requirement would be a positive for the state. 
“With the public support for it and for the potential benefits — by that, I mean upside benefits of more people getting into the workforce, still knowing that they can keep this coverage — it is a policy model that is worth pursuing and trying to make as strong and as compassionate as possible,” McNeill said. 
Michael Stanley, the CEO of Grace Health, a community health center in Eastern Kentucky, said more than 40% of the patients his center sees are covered by  Medicaid. 
Kentucky under former Gov. Steve Beshear expanded Medicaid eligibility to include more low-income adults. The Medicaid expansion was made possible in 2010 when Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act, informally dubbed Obamacare. The Republican Congress now is considering cuts to Medicaid to reduce federal spending, including potentially reducing federal funds to cover the Medicaid expansion population.
The most likely Medicaid cuts would hit rural areas the hardest

“With expanded Medicaid, our quality clinical performance measures showed that the communities we serve are healthier,” Stanley said. “The loss of expanded Medicaid and a work requirement could reduce our Medicaid-covered patients by 10 to 15% with a loss of $2 million to $3 million in Grace Health revenue. A loss of this magnitude would threaten our behavioral health, school based health, substance use disorder and dental services.” 
Tim Cesario, the substance use disorder director for Cumberland River Behavioral Health in Corbin, said  he’s worried about “unintended consequences” from the work requirement. 
“In the substance use field, we encounter a lot of people that have never had regular work and have not developed the skills to maintain a full time job, or what we would call a ‘regular job,’” he said. “The reporting requirements, I believe, will cause a hardship, especially when you consider that the 5th Congressional District is not a bustling manufacturing area. The ability for people to find steady full time traditional work is not always available.” 
Cesario also said reinstating the prior authorization requirement would “be cumbersome for the providers.” 
“Often, we have people who are ready to engage in services today,” Cesario said. “If we have to go through the pre-authorization process to allow people to access services in three weeks, that interest and that desire to receive help may be gone.” 
The ‘critical’ waiver component 
Legislators seek to examine Kentucky Medicaid for ways to contain costs

The bill directs the Cabinet for Health and Family Services to submit a waiver application to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services “requesting approval to establish the mandatory community engagement waiver program” for the able-bodied adults previously described. 
The bill directs the cabinet to send a copy of that application to the Legislative Research Commission for referral to the Medicaid Oversight and Advisory Board, the Interim Joint Committee on Appropriations and Revenue and the Interim Joint Committee on Health Services. The cabinet would also need to update these boards and committees on the application’s progress.  
Under the bill as written, the cabinet “would put out a proposal. There would be a state comment period. They would need to address those comments, and then they would need to submit it to the federal government,” Pugel explained. “There would be a federal comment period. Once that’s over, the federal government would need to negotiate with the state for the details of the plan. Usually, there’s some back and forth.” 
After this process, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services would either approve or deny the application. 
“The waiver’s critical, in my understanding,” said McNeill, who served as the deputy state budget and policy director in the Bevin administration. “Certainly in the Bevin administration’s waiver, there was a significant amount of detail of what the implementation of the program would look like.” 
It’s also worth noting, he said, that the legislature has directed a Democratic gubernatorial administration to lay out these details in an application to a Republican federal government. 
“It’s a question of who writes the waiver for the states and who is in charge of CMS in Washington at the time? And those things don’t line up perfectly,” McNeill explained. “But to direct a Democratic administration here in the state to submit this waiver, knowing that it would look much different under a potential future Republican governor? It’s just going to be something interesting to watch play out, because the details of the waiver matter a lot.” 
Beauregard, with Kentucky Voices for Health, acknowledged there is some flexibility with how the state would write the waiver, but it could be inconsistent in the future. 
  Andrew McNeill
“The Cabinet for Health and Family Services does have some discretion in how it would create that process — the paperwork, in particular, how often people would have to report — and I think all of that is potentially a very good thing,” she said. “But that same discretion means that this administration could do it one way, the next administration could do it a very different way.” 
She also expressed concern to the Lantern over Kentucky potentially spending more on red tape than the coverage itself. 
McNeill agreed “simpler is better” when it comes to the reporting process. 
“Oftentimes, the theory of policy design doesn’t match with human behavior,” he said. “I’ve learned through the years that the best approach to achieving a policy goal, like a work requirement, is to practice humility and keep it … simple, both from a policy standpoint and from an implementation standpoint.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_9202-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Debate stalled on a bill previously expected to pass Wednesday that would ban government agencies across South Carolina from requiring diversity training or mandating statements of inclusion.
After about two hours of discussion, House Education Chairwoman Shannon Erickson asked to halt the debate until Tuesday, a move rarely used by Republicans on the House floor once debate starts.
It’s normal for Democrats to make the motion on a bill pushed by Republicans, as they tried to do so earlier Wednesday. But their various procedural attempts to halt debate failed. And then, suddenly, the chairwoman of the committee that advanced the bill pressed pause herself.
“I just realized that I need a minute,” the Beaufort Republican told reporters afterward. “The committee deserves to put forth the best bill we can do.”
As amended by her committee last week, the bill bans all state agencies, public schools and local governments from considering a person’s race, gender or other aspects of their identity in hiring employees or accepting students. It bans governments from having offices or divisions dedicated “for the promotion of diversity, equity and inclusion.”
And it bans colleges specifically from demanding any political declaration from an applicant or employee.
House Democrats all oppose the bill. But in a supermajority GOP chamber, Republicans generally push through whatever they want in a single day, with the main question being how many hours they argue.
In putting debate on hold, Erickson said she wanted more time to read and consider the approximately two dozen amendments proposed Wednesday for changing the bill.
SC anti-DEI bill advances without requirement on private contractors

Some seemed like good ideas, Erickson said, and she didn’t want to dismiss amendments that could improve the bill without giving them serious consideration.
“If I can’t get a minute to research it, then I don’t even know, would it be right of me to completely vote no on everything and not look at it?” she told reporters after the House adjourned.
About half of the proposed changes came from Democrats, caucus members said.
Democrats in the Legislative Black Caucus, who led the opposition Wednesday, said the move showed Republicans were not ready to defend their proposal.
House Democrats and activists held a news conference before the session began to condemn the bill. Opponents from across the state rearranged their schedules to stay for the debate, said Rep. Jermaine Johnson. The Columbia Democrat noted he had intended to be absent from the chamber Wednesday due to his father’s surgery but postponed his trip to be there for the floor fight.
“Those individuals in there decided to silence everybody across South Carolina today because they wanted to change some things,” he said outside the House chamber.
Democrats suggested the Republican caucus had fractured over the bill and needed time to regroup.
Erickson dismissed that. Every single Republican may not be on board, but the caucus has the votes needed to pass the bill, she said, adding that played no role in her decision.
Democrats will continue the fight when the debate resumes next week. In a show of solidarity against the bill, House Democrats dressed in black Wednesday.
SC anti-DEI bill could impact everything from school cafeterias to university bookstores

“The efforts that this bill is making to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion is worth mourning,” said Rep. Hamilton Grant, D-Columbia. “It is a sad day here in the state of South Carolina.”
Supporters of the bill insist it is not about ending diversity in the state but about ensuring hiring and opportunities are based on merit rather than identity traits. The bill comes amid a federal effort to ban DEI initiatives under an executive order signed by President Donald Trump.
“DEI programs as we’ve seen in this country are a failed experiment,” said Rep. Tim McGinnis, R-Myrtle Beach.
As changed last week, the bill does not affect Black History Month events, teacher recruitment initiatives for Black men, school curriculum teaching about the Holocaust, programs for veterans with disabilities or local Pride events, McGinnis said.
Those were all programs that opponents said the original bill would eliminate. That version also would have extended to state contractors and other organizations.
At the morning news conference, a University of South Carolina professor said DEI programs started in the first place because Black people, women and other people with marginalized identities have historically been shut out of certain opportunities because of their identity.
“The playing field is not level,” said Susi Long, an English professor at USC.
Passing the bill could scare away businesses looking to open in the state and students considering South Carolina colleges, Rep. John King said. He called on Black students to stay away, calling the bill hostile toward them.
“They don’t want diversity here,” the Rock Hill Democrat said on the floor to Black students considering coming to the state. “Stay away from South Carolina.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_1940-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

With very little fanfare, the House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly to approve HB 6017 , with “no” votes cast by just six members.
The Senate companion, SB 734, cleared the Senate Rules Committee with one dissenting vote cast by Sen. Gayle Harrell. Harrell’s late husband was a longtime Florida obstetrician and she has traditionally been a strong voice for organized medicine in the Florida Legislature.
The insurance industry, Florida hospitals, and organized medicine such as the Florida Medical and Florida Osteopathic associations, oppose the bill in its current form. But they are willing to support eliminating the ban if the Legislature agrees to limit damages for pain and suffering by placing caps on the amount that can be recovered.  
Otherwise, increasing civil liability will further increase medical malpractice insurance rates and drive physicians away from practicing, the opponents say.

Florida has had no caps on pain and suffering in medical malpractice lawsuits since 2014, when the Florida Supreme Court ruled them unconstitutional. But the makeup of the Florida Supreme Court has changed since then, with the majority of the justices now having been appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis. 
And the medical and insurance industries are eager to reinstate caps and put the new justices to  the test.










If it's something that the Senate wants to entertain, it's a conversation that we're always willing to have. This is part of negotiation.


– House Speaker Danny Perez


To date, neither the House nor Senate have included the industry-coveted caps in the bills.
But House Speaker Danny Perez told reporters that things could change.
“The House didn’t entertain caps. If it’s something that the Senate wants to entertain, it’s a conversation that we’re always willing to have. This is part of negotiation,” he said.
You know, we don’t know where we’re going to end up. It’s kind of like the budget. We came out with our budget … and the Senate came out with theirs, and now we just got to begin to have those conversations and see what the middle ground is, and see where we land. And I think, you know this bill is, is no different.”
When it comes to wrongful deaths stemming from medical malpractice claims, parents of single, childless, adult children cannot sue for noneconomic damages, such as pain and suffering. 
Additionally, adults (defined as 25 or older) cannot pursue wrongful death claims for parents who die from medical malpractice.The Legislature adopted the ban during the 1990s as lawmakers wrestled with rising malpractice premiums. 
There has been a concerted effort in recent years, though, to eliminate the ban, and members of Senate Judiciary heard from people on both sides of the issue Tuesday, the first day of the annual 60-day legislative session.

“I don’t think this bill really, frankly, does anything anymore,” said Steve Fenberg, a patient rights advocate who supported the original bill. “I think it’s a shame.”
Senate Bill 5493 intended to give the state’s Department of Health the ability to enforce a 2021 federal rule that required hospitals to provide transparent pricing. The idea was to provide patients with clearer information about how much they would pay for care and to spur competition that could help drive down costs.
“We’re on an unsustainable trajectory for health care costs, we are not bending the curve,” said Sen. Marcus Riccelli, D-Spokane, the bill’s sponsor. “We need to relieve burdens on patients and consumers from our broken system and do actual things that will drive costs down.”
Advocates have raised concerns over the lack of compliance with the federal rule, while hospitals say it takes time to adjust to new requirements. 
“The understanding of what compliance and transparency mean has sort of evolved over time,” since the 2021 federal rule, said Andrew Busz, a policy director with the Washington State Hospital Association. 
When the rule first took effect, hospitals were required to upload “machine readable files,” which are large, not considered accessible or understandable to most consumers, and mainly used by researchers, insurers, and data aggregators, Busz explained. 
Over time, the rule required hospitals to upload “shoppable services” — a consumer-friendly list of around 300 medical services, such as imaging, surgeries, and maternity care. 
At the federal level, hospitals that do not comply with these requirements are first issued a warning notice. If the noncompliance continues, it can lead to a corrective action plan or civil monetary penalties.
In Washington, 20 hospitals out of the 114 in the state have been issued warning notices and no further action has been needed, according to a list provided by the hospital association. 
“It’s fairly common for state or federal agencies, when something rolls out that’s new, to give organizations kind of time to be compliant, these are new requirements,” said Chelene Whiteaker, senior vice president for government affairs with the Washington State Hospital Association. 
States like Colorado have been taking action in recent years to enforce the federal requirements and the Washington bill is in that mold. 
Riccelli suggested Washington has been lagging behind other states in moving ahead with the new transparency measures. “We see red states, blue states, and purple states, moving forward with price transparency a little more aggressively,” he said.
When the bill was first introduced this year, it had three main components: requiring hospitals to comply with the federal regulations and to submit data to the state’s Department of Health; giving the state enforcement authority, and calling for the state to develop an interactive price comparison tool — similar to one in Colorado. 
Hospitals that don’t comply would have been subject to civil fines ranging up to $10,000 per violation. Proceeds from fines would have gone toward creating the tool for people to search and compare hospital prices. 
The version of the bill the Senate passed unanimously on March 11 did not include the enforcement provisions.
“I made some changes that I would rather not have made, but we did just to kind of keep something moving on in this session. I contemplated not moving it forward, but I do see value,” Riccelli said, adding that both Republicans and Democrats have struggled with getting behind transparency measures. 
Whiteaker said that the hospital association pushed for the changes so that the state bill complemented the federal regulations, rather than duplicating or distracting from them.
The most recent version of the bill would require the state’s hospitals to comply with the federal rules and submit price data to the state’s Department of Health, which would track compliance. It sets a July 1, 2027 deadline for hospitals to publish the data and calls for annual updates after that.  
The complexity of health insurance and factoring in copays, deductibles, and whether a hospital accepts someone’s insurance is often what makes health care difficult to navigate. 
“The payment mechanisms and rate structures are actually determined by the carriers, not by the hospitals,” Busz said, adding that the type of insurance someone has typically has more of an effect on what a patient pays than the rates a hospital charges. 
Also, while price estimate tools exist on hospital websites now, it can be difficult for someone to predict what services they may need. 
“There’s no real perfect way to anticipate what the costs are going to be,” Busz said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/nurse-hospital-1024x696.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

Wes Moore (D) speaks at the one-year commemoration of the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Dundalk. (Photo by Christine Condon / Maryland Matters)Maria del Carmen Luna Castellon had hoped to speak at the memorial on the one-year anniversary of the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse, which claimed the life of her husband Miguel.
But March 26 was too painful a day, too laden with traumatic memories. So instead, she wrote it down.
Her husband, and the other five immigrant workers who were filling potholes on the bridge the night it collapsed, would still be alive, she wrote — if it weren’t for the “negligent and reckless” operation of the Dali, the cargo ship that toppled the span.
“Concrete and steel can be replaced. The laughter of a father, the embrace of a husband, the future of six men — these are lost forever,” Luna Castellon wrote.
Dignitaries, first responders and victims’ family members gathered Wednesday morning at the bridge site in Dundalk to commemorate the somber anniversary of the disaster etched in the history of the Port of Baltimore and the communities that surround it.
Eleven weeks after the collapse, the debris that filled the Patapsco River and snarled the shipping channel leading to the port had been removed. The bodies of all six victims were recovered by salvage divers and returned to their families, for funeral services in Maryland and in Latin America.
A year later, crews are preparing to demolish what remains of the Key Bridge, including massive concrete support columns still standing in the Patapsco River, and a highway truncated in midair.
The replacement will be Maryland’s first cable-stayed bridge, said Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller (D). It is expected to open in fall 2028, and is currently slated to be fully funded by the federal government.
“We remember the tears that we shed, and the uncertainty that we all felt,” said Gov. Wes Moore (D). “We remember looking out and seeing a deeply painful and unfamiliar sight, that a fixture of the Baltimore skyline and the Baltimore spirit — that parts of it were now laying on top of a ship the length of three football fields.”
In total, more than 1,500 first responders from 55 agencies reported to the bridge site, and formed part of the Unified Command headquartered at Baltimore’s cruise ship terminal, said U.S. Coast Guard Rear Adm. Shannon Gilreath.
“You accomplished things on a timeline that no one thought was possible,” Gilreath said of the responders. “You removed thousands of tons of steel and concrete from the water, recovered the victims and reopened the Port of Baltimore.”

A fund created to provide aid after the collapse garnered $16 million in donations from over 550 individuals and companies, said Shanaysha Sauls, president and CEO of the Baltimore Community Foundation.
A year later, all of the funds have been committed, Sauls said. The projects included cash assistance to 3,000 port workers and truckers, new fire boats to replace vessels damaged on the day of the collapse and transportation assistance for elderly residents of communities cut off from one another when the bridge fell.
Assistance also flowed to the families of the workers who perished in the tragedy, but Luna Castellon said the funds will run out in December. Her remarks Wednesday were read by Yolanda Maria Martinez, special secretary of the Governor’s Office of Small, Minority and Women Business Affairs.
“While this support is a relief, today, I dare to ask for something more,” Castellon Luna said. “When the end of this support approaches, I ask you to consider the possibility of extending it. The path to emotional and financial recovery is long, and it is filled with obstacles.”
Victims’ families, including the Lunas, and collapse survivor Julio Cervantes, are among the dozens of parties that have filed suit against Grace Ocean Private Ltd. and Synergy Marine Ltd., the owner and manager of the Dali. But the complex web of proceedings is expected to take years to resolve.
Army Corps of Engineers gives green light for next step in Key Bridge replacement

Last May, the National Transportation Safety Board released its initial report on the collapse, revealing that the Dali lost power in port twice the day before it hit the Key Bridge. On March 26, 2024, a blackout aboard the ship caused it to crash into one of the bridge’s support columns.
Earlier this month, the Board faulted the Maryland Transportation Authority for failing to conduct an assessment of the bridge’s vulnerability to ship strikes. The bridge was 30 times above the acceptable risk level, according to the NTSB. State officials have pushed back, arguing that the collapse was the “sole fault” of the ship operators. 
Wednesday, Anne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman noted that it was the Latin American immigrant community hit hardest by the tragedy. The six victims were “doing work that needed to be done, work that most of us lack the skill and the drive to do,” Pittman said.
Victims Alejandro Hernandez Fuentes and Carlos Daniel Hernandez Estrella, who were related, both hailed from Mexico. Dorlian Ronial Castillo Cabrera came from Guatemala, as did Jose Mynor Lopez. Miguel Angel Luna Gonzalez came from El Salvador, and Maynor Yasir Suazo Sandoval from Honduras.
During Wednesday’s ceremony, which also featured musical selections from a trio of Baltimore Symphony Orchestra musicians, memories abounded from March 26, 2024.
For Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, the news came in a phone call from his fire chief, who had just dispatched rescue crews to the Patapsco River.
“I once had him repeat himself, to ensure that I got it right, and we both knew at that very moment that our city and our state would be waking up to a very different reality than when the sun set a few hours before,” Scott said.
In Annapolis that day, when Sen. Johnny Ray Salling (R-Baltimore County) rose to speak about the collapse on the Senate floor, “you could have heard a pin drop,” said Baltimore County Executive Kathy Klausmeier (D), who was a state senator at the time.

Some officials shared personal reflections Wednesday on the bridge’s significance.
Rep. Johnny Olszewski (D-2nd), a Dundalk native who was Baltimore County executive when the bridge collapsed, spoke about the bridge’s prominent role in his childhood years.
“We fished under it. We celebrated getting our driver’s license by driving over the bridge. We had murals of it in our bars. We put it on our sports uniforms,” Olszewski said. “It was our cathedral in the sky.”
Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-7th) said he remembers a time before the bridge’s construction in the 1970s, when “there was nothing in the water but water,” and officials debated building a bridge or a tunnel.
The communities linked by the Key Bridge, which stretched from Turner Station in Baltimore County to Hawkins Point, which straddles Baltimore City and Anne Arundel County, saw the structure as a symbol of a promising future, Mfume said.
“That meant hope. That meant transportation. That meant access. And people grew up here every day after that, watching the sun kiss the steel beams because they went up so high,” Mfume said.
Still today, the site of the former Key Bridge is a source of hope, with the reconstruction effort soon to begin in earnest, Mfume said.
“Soon, and very soon, we will have a continuation of this story,” Mfume said. “That day when we met here, it was just like this: Cold, windy — but overcast. Today is cold and windy, but the sun is out, and the sun is a great reminder of the bright things that are before all of us.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)From reining in deepfakes to regulating chatbots used for therapy or legal advice, Utah lawmakers passed a handful of laws this year that deal with artificial intelligence. 
In 2024, the Legislature took its first step in regulating artificial intelligence, passing a law that created a new state office to both regulate the emerging technology, while fostering innovation. The Utah Office of Artificial Intelligence Policy is intended to be a regulatory sandbox, inviting the private sector to work with the state’s Department of Consumer Protection to identify ways in which AI can be used for good, and bad. 
In the year since the office was created, the intersection of AI and mental health has emerged as an area that shows promise, but also requires extra regulation, according to lawmakers. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Amid a shortage of mental health professionals, having an AI-powered “therapist in your pocket” is exciting, said Rep. Jefferson Moss, the Utah House majority leader — but it also raises concerns over the collection of sensitive data, advertising and deceptive practices.
That prompted Moss, R-Saratoga Springs, to sponsor HB452, which passed unanimously this session and was signed by Gov. Spencer Cox on Tuesday. 
During the session, Moss highlighted two areas where AI is being used in mental health care. The first is clinician-focused, where therapists, social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists and other professionals use AI to summarize and analyze meetings with clients, create treatment plans and update health records.
The other is consumer-focused, where people can use AI for mental health interventions or practicing skills learned in therapy — like Moss said, a “therapist in your pocket.” 
As the Trump administration loosens AI rules, states look to regulate the technology

HB452 targets the latter, creating consumer protections around the sharing of data. Now, if an AI therapy chatbot collects personal information, it can’t sell that data or use it for anything other than the mental health services it offers. 
The law also prohibits businesses that run a mental health chatbot from advertising products or services to clients in discussions with the AI, unless the chatbot “clearly and conspicuously identifies the advertisement as an advertisement,” according to the bill text. 
And, the business cannot use information disclosed by a client to customize advertisements within the chatbot service. 
AI chatbots will now be required to remind clients that they aren’t actually talking with a real person — and if it fails to disclose itself as AI, or violates other provisions of the law, the Utah Division of Consumer Protection can fine the operator $2,500 for each offense. The operator could also be liable for other penalties, depending on how severe the violation is.  
While HB452 is arguably the largest and most impactful AI-related bill to pass this session, lawmakers passed a handful of other laws targeting the new technology. 
SB180, Law Enforcement Usage of Artificial Intelligence
Sponsored by Sen. Stephanie Pitcher, D-Millcreek, SB180 is in response to the growing use of AI in writing police reports. Pitcher, a former prosecutor, said she knows of several agencies in the state that use Axon’s Draft One, which can create a report based on video or audio from an officer’s body-worn camera. 
These technologies would still be permitted under the law, but law enforcement will be required to disclose the use of AI in the report. The author of the police report would also be required to sign a certificate stating that they reviewed the AI-generated report for accuracy. 
The law directs all Utah law enforcement agencies to create an AI policy that outlines which technologies the agency uses, and when and where the technology is permitted.
SB180 passed unanimously and was signed by the governor on Tuesday. It will take effect on May 7. 
SB226, Artificial Intelligence Consumer Protection Amendments
Sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Kirk Cullimore, R-Sandy, SB226 narrows AI legislation passed last year that, in hindsight, he said was too broad. 
Now, instead of requiring up-front disclosure for all AI-powered chatbots, SB226 narrows the requirement for “high risk” interactions — that includes chatbots that offer financial and legal advice, or medical or mental health care. 
A chatbot is still required to disclose whether it’s AI-powered if the user asks, according to the bill. But for those “high risk” services, an AI-powered chatbot will need to disclose itself when the user starts interacting with it. 
“For those types of things, the consumer should know up front that they are dealing with AI,” Cullimore said during the session. 
Companies that violate the disclosure rules could be subjected to a $2,500 fine for each violation. The bill, which is awaiting the governor’s signature, passed unanimously in both the House and Senate. If signed, it will take effect on May 7. 
SB271, Unauthorized Artificial Intelligence Impersonation Amendments
Sponsored by Sen. Mike McKell, R-Spanish Fork, SB271 is modeled after a Tennessee law called the “Elvis Act” that protects artists and musicians from having their work copied and commercialized. 
Under current Utah code, advertisements that use a person’s identity to falsely convey an endorsement are illegal. But the law doesn’t yet expand to deepfakes, which are images, audio or videos edited or generated by AI that depict a person, real or fake. 
Deepfakes are becoming more and more realistic, sometimes used to create pornographic material, re-create music or movie scenes, fabricate political endorsements, and make up videos or scenarios involving celebrities. 
McKell’s law would target anyone who uses a person’s name or image without their consent to endorse a product, fundraise or solicit donations through AI, digital manipulation, animation and “any other technological means.” 
The law would allow victims to file a lawsuit to reclaim money made using their image or identity. The law is awaiting the governor’s signature — if signed, it will take effect on May 7. 
SB332, Artificial Intelligence Revisions
Also sponsored by Cullimore, SB332 is a simple bill that extends the lifespan of the Artificial Intelligence Policy Act. Now, the state’s Office of Artificial Intelligence Policy will remain in place until July 2027. It was signed by the governor on Tuesday.

(Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Senate President Ty Masterson asked lawmakers Wednesday to consider the hypocrisy of those who opposed a constitutional amendment to curtail rising property taxes by limiting increases in property valuations to 4% annually.
Democrats had raised concerns during debate on House Concurrent Resolution 5011 that the proposal would offer little or no relief on property tax bills while also complaining that it would lower state property tax collections that support school funding to the tune of $1 billion over five years.
“I hope that the body is absorbing the doublespeak, the hypocrisy of the conversation, the opposition,” Masterson said. “We’re both saying it does nothing, and it’s going to be so devastating we won’t even be able to fund our schools. I hope this is this is apparent to you that those are opposites, and the truth, like many things, is right in the middle. It’s not devastating change, but it’s real change.”
Despite his urging, the Senate failed to muster the two-thirds support needed to pass the resolution, falling one vote short. Five Republicans joined Democrats in opposition on a 26-14 vote.
The Senate vote effectively kills the resolution, although it could be revived by a motion to reconsider, or it could resurface under a different bill name before legislators close the books on the session at the end of the week.
Rep. Adam Smith, a Weskan Republican and the chair of the House Taxation Committee, said he fully expected the resolution to come to the House.
“I was kind of shocked that it didn’t,” Smith said.
He said he wasn’t fully in favor of the proposal but was willing to bring it to the floor for a vote. He was wary of the resolution’s cap on property appraisal increases. The cap, which increased from 3% to 4% during negotiations between the House and Senate, doesn’t do anything to limit the mill levies, he said. Under the proposal, valuation remains lower, but the levies continue to increase.
“Your average taxpayer isn’t going to see actual tax relief,” Smith said.
During debate in the Senate, Sen. Ethan Corson, D-Fairway, questioned why negotiations between the Senate and House resulted in a change in placing the proposed constitutional amendment before voters in August 2026 instead of November 2025, as previously planned. If the bill offers true property tax relief, Corson wondered, why delay it?
The short answer: Sen. Caryn Tyson doesn’t play Uno.
Tyson, a Parker Republican, said she proposed the change — she didn’t explain why — and the House accepted. Then, she said, the House “asked me if I wanted to play my Uno card of reversal.”
“I don’t play Uno. So we stayed on. We agreed on August ’26,” Tyson said.
Corson said legislators have heard from “Kansans in every corner of the state about the desperate need for property tax relief.” Seniors and veterans are being forced out of their homes “because of sky high property taxes,” he said. And GOP leadership promised before the session that property tax relief would be a day one priority.
Now, he said, the Legislature is at the end of the session, and “we have done nothing meaningful on property tax relief.”
“We are putting politics over what is best for people. That’s what’s happening,” Corson said.
Corson and Sen. Cindy Holscher, an Overland Park Democrat, referenced projections produced by the nonpartisan Kansas Legislative Research Department of how the cap on property appraisals would impact school funding. The state assess 20 mills to finance public schools, and 1.5 mills for school buildings. According to the projections, the state would lose $1 billion in revenue for schools over five years, which would need to be offset by draining the State General Fund.
“Maybe that’s exactly what this body wants,” Holscher said. “Maybe we want to make it more difficult to fund our schools.”
But Tyson reiterated Masterson’s comments.
“We’re getting doublespeak,” Tyson said. “First, it doesn’t do anything for the taxpayers, and then, oh no, it’s going to break school funding and the state SGF. So you can’t have it both ways.”
The five Republicans who joined Democrats to defeat the resolution were Sen. Mike Argabright of Emporia, Sen. Tory Marie Blew of Great Bend, Sen. Brenda Dietrich of Topeka, Sen.

(Screenshot/Capitol TV)A tidal wave of support for reforming the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council swept through the Rhode Island State House Wednesday, a stark contrast to the lukewarm reception two years ago.
Backing by environmental groups, the Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General, local residents, and even former council members comes as the state coastal agency continues to come under fire for flouting staff recommendations, lawsuits and recurring vacancies.
“The reality is the council is just not working in its present form,” Sen. Mark McKenney, a Warwick Democrat, told members of the Senate Committee on Environment and Agriculture. “It’s not sufficient to paper over a systemic problem with new personalities. Reform is imperative.”
McKenney is sponsoring a bill that would bring about comprehensive reform by eliminating the appointed council and reshaping the agency as an administrative arm led by expert staff, much like the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management. A citizen advisory council would retain opportunity for a public voice in decision-making, but act only to make recommendations.
Similar legislation has been introduced in 2023 and 2024.
The bill was held for further study — standard practice for an initial vetting by a legislative panel. Companion legislation has been introduced in the Rhode Island House by Rep. Terri Cortvriend, a Portsmouth Democrat.
Laura Dwyer, a spokesperson for the CRMC, declined to comment on the legislation.
Former council members call for change
The parade of proponents who spoke Wednesday included two of the council’s former members: Paul Beaudette, who served a single three-year term that ended in 2017 and was not asked to return, and Catherine Robinson Hall, who resigned in 2024, two years into her term.
Beaudette said the agency’s expert staff’s recommendations were squashed by the volunteer council and lawyers for private property owners.
“They need their representation,” Beaudette, the former eastern vice chairman for the National Wildlife Federation and past president of the Environment Council of Rhode Island, said of the agency’s staff. 
Another 20 advocates and residents wrote to lawmakers ahead of Wednesday’s hearing. None expressed opposition.
“It is refreshing to have so much interest in this body in this room,” said Sen. V Susan Sosnowski, a South Kingstown Democrat and chair of the Senate Committee on Environment and Agriculture. “I’ve been trying to reform CRMC for a long time, just trying to nibble around the edges.”
Sen. Robert Britto, an East Providence Democrat, questioned the lack of critics.
“Why is it that we don’t have any opposition?” Britto asked.
“Because it’s the right proposal,” replied Alison Fonseca, policy and legislative counsel for the Rhode Island Attorney General’s office. 
Jed Thorp, advocacy director for Save the Bay, chalked up the lack of action in the past two years to fear of change.

Sticker shock
Another obstacle: cost.
A fiscal analysis by the state budget office in 2024 pegged the cost to reshape the agency into an administrative group at $1.2 million to $1.9 million. But advocates insist the price tag was inflated.
The Senate in June approved a resolution calling for the Rhode Island Department of Administration (DOA) to more closely study the cost of various reform options, including abolishing the council and creating a standalone coastal agency, or funneling the CRMC into DEM. The 51-page report published in February estimated that reshaping the agency as a standalone administrative arm would cost $1.1 million to $1.7 million in fiscal 2026, with most of the cost coming from the seven to 15 new staff members required to fulfill additional agency duties.
“The notion that eliminating the council would require hiring seven new staff people is frankly laughable to anyone who understands what the council does and how they function,” Thorp said.
Shifting the coastal agency into the DEM, either as a bureau or within the general structure of the department, comes at a slightly lower cost: $500,000 to $1.3 million in fiscal 2026, according to DOA’s report.
Then there’s the option to keep the agency in its current form, which has no extra cost beyond the $3.6 million in state revenue included in the annual budget. But doing nothing also has a cost to the state’s 400 miles of coastline, and to the public trust in how that coastline is protected.
“Our coastal resources are facing a series of complex and consequential challenges,” Thorp said, naming public access, coastal erosion, climate change and development pressures as examples. “Even if you had more qualified people on the council, the structure itself does not lend itself to good decision making.”
Not ‘showing up for work’
Council decisions often take years because of the inability to meet a quorum. There are three open seats on the 10-member council now.
“CRMC frankly doesn’t show up for work a third of the time,” said Michael Woods, chair of the New England Chapter of Backcountry Hunters & Anglers.
In 2024, the council missed or canceled nearly 30% of its bimonthly meetings — without explanation or advanced notice, Woods said. Even when the council had a full roster of 10 members, it still missed 20-30% of its meetings, he added.
A 1-acre oyster farm proposed for Tiverton’s Sapowet Cove — symbolic of the battle between aquaculture farmers, fishermen and property owners — is now heading into a sixth year of waiting for the council’s decision.
“We heard that for two years during my time on the council, and we still haven’t resolved it,” said Hall, who now serves as staff attorney for Save the Bay.
And an illegal seawall built along the shoreline of a North Kingstown country club still stands, two years after it was built, and despite coastal regulators denying the club’s retroactive attempt to seek permission.
Dr. Michael Reuter, a Barrington podiatric surgeon confirmed as the newest member of the council on March 20, was interested to serve due to his own frustrations in waiting for the council’s approval on changes to his waterfront home.
“The experience of every day Rhode Islanders shows the body is not working the way it needs to be from a customer perspective,” Sen. Alana DiMario, a North Kingstown Democrat, said in an interview.
Senate President Dominick Ruggerio and House Speaker K. Joseph remained noncommittal in individual statements Wednesday, though both stressed the importance of the coastal agency’s work.
“It is imperative that the state have in place a modern, professional agency with appropriate expertise to fulfill its crucial mission,” Ruggerio said in a statement. He returned to the State House on Tuesday, following a seven-week absence during which he was hospitalized with pneumonia.

Considering alternatives
Shekarchi previously suggested tweaking the membership of the council to include more experts from a broader array of backgrounds. 
Sosnowski has proposed separate legislation requiring a three-fifths majority of the council to override the recommendations of its expert staff. Across the rotunda, Rep. Jay Edwards, a Tiverton Democrat, introduced legislation that would abolish the council and shift the coastal agency into DEM. Rep. Alex Finkelman, a Jamestown Democrat, introduced a bill to reduce council membership from 10 to seven members, all of whom would need experience in “environmental matters.”
The House State Government and Elections Committee will give a first hearing to CRMC reform bills the week of April 7.
Any changes to the CRMC requires approval from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration — a process which typically takes 30 days but could extend beyond 120 days. Jasmine Blackwell, a NOAA spokesperson, declined to comment on the pending legislation.

(Photo credit: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Undercover seafood testers sampled a selection of restaurants in the Shreveport area this month and detected what they say is the highest shrimp fraud rate they have recorded to date in Louisiana.
SeaD Consulting, a food testing company that has been making headlines for uncovering seafood fraud at restaurants and festivals across the Gulf Coast, announced in a news release Wednesday that a “troubling” 58% of the restaurants sampled were deceptively serving foreign shrimp falsely presented as if it were domestic in violation of state law. 
The company’s use of genetic testing found a total of 17 out of 24 restaurants sampled, or 71%, served foreign farm-raised shrimp. Fourteen of those, or 58%, did so deceptively by mislabeling the country of origin or refusing to indicate it on their menus or restaurant signage. 
The sampling, taken March 8-10, is so far the highest inauthenticity rate the SeaD has recorded in Louisiana since it first launched its testing efforts last year at the Louisiana Shrimp & Petroleum Festival in Morgan City.
The company does not identify the restaurants that aren’t following the state’s labeling law, opting instead to raise awareness of its existence. 
SeaD executive Erin Williams said six of the restaurants were “blatantly being deceptive” by explicitly mislabeling their dishes as “Gulf shrimp” rather than just falsely suggesting it. 
It is illegal under federal and state law to mislabel imported seafood as local and can result in fines or other penalties. In some instances, seafood fraud offenses at the federal level can yield criminal charges or even prison time, such as in the 2024 convictions of two Mississippi restaurant owners, one of whom was sentenced to eight months in prison.  
Local seafood was once easy to find in Louisiana, but an influx of cheap foreign catch, particularly shrimp and crawfish, has flooded the market over the past two decades. 
Williams said she believes there is less public awareness in the Shreveport area of the foreign seafood problem and the plight of the coastal communities that depend on commercial fishermen.
In the past few years, state and federal authorities began cracking down on restaurants that mislead their customers into thinking the foreign seafood they’re eating is wild-caught from the Gulf of Mexico. Some establishments do this through vague dish descriptions or suggestive dining room decor such as nets or photos of shrimp boats on their walls — practices that the Federal Trade Commission announced could be illegal last year. 
For more than a decade, Louisiana law has specifically required restaurants, eateries and other food establishments to state on their menus the country of origin of any shrimp and crawfish being served. The same requirements apply to food vendors at fairs and festivals. 
There have been 2,600 violations of Louisiana’s imported shrimp law — and no fines

However, a 2023 review of state enforcement records revealed that many restaurants had not complied with the laws. Louisiana health inspectors issued thousands of citations to restaurants but levied no fines against them.
Some establishments have found creative ways around the laws by using vague menu descriptions, such as “Local shrimp served when available.” 
In an effort to strengthen enforcement, state legislators recently enacted heavier fines for violators and updated Louisiana’s menu labeling statute. Still, a January meeting of the legislature’s Seafood Safety Task Force exposed some loopholes and contradictions in the new law, so it will likely undergo additional changes when lawmakers convene for their 2025 session beginning April 14.  
SeaD Consulting launched its testing efforts last year using undercover inspectors to purchase shrimp dishes from vendors and restaurants. The inspectors run the shrimp through a rapid field testing kit that examines seafood tissue genetics in a process similar to the way medical professionals detect viral infections. 
Dave Williams, a commercial fishery scientist and SeaD Consulting’s founder, developed the test in collaboration with Florida State University microbiologist Prashant Singh. Their process has been published and undergone peer review in a scientific journal.
In December, the Louisiana Shrimp Task Force, an advisory panel for the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, asked SeaD Consulting to analyze shrimp from restaurants across the state in an effort to eliminate consumer seafood fraud. Its analysis includes sampling batches of 24 randomly selected restaurants in different cities across the state.
“This is a blow to the culture of Louisiana, where authenticity in food is paramount,” Louisiana Shrimp Task Force Rodney Olander said in the press release. “When consumers are misled, it hurts local shrimpers and damages the reputation of our beloved seafood industry. We have the support of Southern Louisiana, but clearly not the entire state.” 
In addition to its latest results out of Shreveport, the company’s testing of sampled eateries found a 30% shrimp fraud rate in Baton Rouge in December 2024, a 13% fraud rate in New Orleans in January, and a 33% fraud rate in Lafayette in February.
SeaD said it has furnished the names of all the restaurants found to be fraudulently serving imported shrimp to the Louisiana Department of Health for review and enforcement. The Health Department could not be immediately reached for comment Wednesday.

Duffy, who lives in southern California, said in an interview that he was surprised to see Omaha take the top spot, but noted that local experts he spoke to were not so shocked. What stood out to him in his discussions about the Omaha market was an “unusual level of collaboration” from people in the industry.
As an example, he said, the Metro Omaha Builders Association (MOBA) brings together competitors to work on common issues such as how to lessen government regulation in homebuilding and the upcoming Spring Parade of Homes.
“It was easy to get a sense of why this ‘big small town where handshakes mean something’ is becoming more than a sleeper hit,” he said.
 Big-city amenities

Nationally, Duffy said, a tightening job market has employers regaining the balance of power so working remotely full time has become less a consideration for today’s home buyers. He said factors defining a hot market are returning to more traditional metrics such as local demand, supply and financial considerations.
“Whether in Nebraska or South Carolina, what these hottest markets seem to share are big-city amenities without the high housing costs of MSAs closer to the megacities along the West and East Coasts,” he wrote.
Relative to other places, Omaha offers a low unemployment rate, cost of living and a “practical process” to encourage new housing developments at a lesser risk to builders, Duffy said.

He cited Nebraska’s unique Sanitary Improvement District law as contributing to the homebuilding pace. An SID essentially is a political subdivision outside the city limits that can issue bonds to fund infrastructure and levy taxes and special assessments on homeowners. 
The article quotes Alec Gorynski, vice president of the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce, who says of the metro area: “We have something for anyone, including urban vibrancy, great suburban neighborhoods, historic neighborhoods with character and family dynamics and tranquil spaces as well.”
Gorynski said the larger challenge is recruiting new employers and workers — and keeping those here from leaving for greener pastures.
According to the U.S. News & World Report analysis, the Omaha metro’s overall housing market index score rose 0.7 points from January 2024 to January 2025 — from 75.5 to 76.2. During the same time period, the score for the nation fell by 0.8 points to 66.6 this past January. 
The analysis, based on January data pulled from the U.S. News Housing Market Index, which incorporates a wide array of data points and provides what the author said is a simple-yet-comprehensive way to rank more than 50 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) on a scale of 1 to 100. 
 Parade of Homes

Metro areas also were ranked on subindexes, or more specific measures that point to the hottest market. The Omaha area ranked No. 1 for financing, a subindex that considers such variables as construction costs, affordability, builder expectations and housing supply. It ranked No. 6 for both housing demand and resiliency.
The report said that since hitting a record high of $325,000 in June, the median home sales price in Omaha has fallen to $304,000. It said home prices still rose 4.8% year-over-year, while the nation’s rise was 4.2% to $419,000.

The Omaha area’s 2025 Spring Parade of Homes — which starts this weekend and showcases the latest construction and home design trends — includes 61 houses priced from $280,000 to $2 million. Officials said the event, a partnership between MOBA and Build Omaha, is the largest parade to date and a sign of an active market.
The parade encompasses 43 neighborhoods. Participants over two weekends, March 29-30 and April 5-6, can tour the homes at no cost to view the properties and connect with local builders and remodelers.
Median monthly rent in Omaha also has jumped 4.3% in a year, to about $1,350, the report noted.

Kelly Armstrong speaks during a press conference on banning student cellphone use in North Dakota on March 26, 2025. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Gov. Kelly Armstrong showed up at two committee hearings and held a press conference Wednesday to advocate for eliminating student cellphone use in North Dakota public schools.
Identical amendments replacing most of the bill text were presented to both the Senate and House Education Committees during hearings on Senate Bill 2354 and House Bill 1160, both of which attempt to address student cellphone use during the school day.
“Bringing a substantial policy change like this after crossover as an amendment is not something we take lightly,” Armstrong said during a media availability following the hearings. “We need to get cell phones out of schools.”
Armstrong said it could be the most impactful thing lawmakers do during a legislative session for the mental health and well-being of students even with a large focus on property tax relief.
“This is absolutely something we can do to help teachers, to help school systems and to help students,” he said. “This will help the next generation of North Dakota leaders be better leaders. It’ll help them physically. It’ll help them emotionally, and it’ll help them academically.”

The bill would prohibit student cellphone use from “bell-to-bell,” including class time and unstructured time in between classes for the entire school day. It would cover cellphones, bluetooth-enabled devices, smart watches and other wearable devices capable of voice, text and other data transfers between students.
Students must turn off their devices and store them in a locked, secure area during school hours.
School districts would also have the ability to limit cellphone use during school-related activities, such as bus rides, field trips and after-school activities.
Students would be able to contact a parent or caregiver by using a school phone.
The bill also includes exemptions to the policy for those with medical conditions that require the use of a device to monitor a condition, and students under individual education or rehabilitation plans.
Private school students would not be subject to the law.
Lt. Gov. Michelle Strinden testified in favor of the bill, saying she wants to give North Dakota students the ability to learn and grow without the mental health challenges and distractions that smartphones provide.
“We need a course correction, and we need it now,” Strinden said. “Senate Bill 2354, as amended, is an urgent policy, and we can’t wait two years to debate the need for it.”
She added young girls are struggling with self-image and confidence issues, which is why eliminating phone usage during the school day is necessary — to grant a temporary reprieve for those kids.

Sen. Michelle Axtman, R-Bismarck, presented the amendment to the House Education Committee. She said she mentioned the phone-free schools bill to members of the girls golf team that she coaches, and one of the students said they would be bored without their phone.
“I said, ‘Thank you so much. That is why I’m doing it,’” Axtman said. “I’m hoping that instead of being bored they turn their attention to each other and their class work.”
Jeff Fastnacht, superintendent of Bismarck Public Schools, told lawmakers that his district would be able to implement the policy if it was signed into law during the 2025-26 school year.
Armstrong said up to $1.5 million could be attached to the bill as an appropriation to reimburse school districts for lockable devices to store phones during the school day.
Both the Senate and House Education Committees took no immediate action on the legislation.

(Getty file photo)For the third year in a row, the Florida House has passed a bill (HB 759) that would lower the age for individuals in Florida to purchase shotguns and rifles from 21 to 18. The final tally was 78-34.
The Florida Legislature and then Gov. Rick Scott raised the age for purchasing rifles, shotguns, and other long guns in 2018 as part of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Public High School Safety Act, just weeks after the school shootings in Parkland that killed 17 people.
Similar legislation has passed in the Florida House in the past two legislative sessions, but has been blocked in the Senate. And that could be the case this year as well. There are two proposals filed in that chamber that match the House’s bill, but neither has been heard in any committee yet.
Senate President Ben Albritton has been noncommittal about whether he supports the measure in his chamber. He told reporters last week the proposal was “not easy.”
“I’m an NRA lifetime member,” he said. “Nearly every day I carry at least one weapon. I have a concealed carry permit. The Legislature passed concealed carry, permitless concealed carry, constitutional carry. That shows this Legislature takes the Second Amendment seriously.”
Many supporters of the bill said that 18-year-olds are already allowed to do plenty of activities for which a level of responsibility is required.
“You can get at 18-years-old a commercial driver’s license that will allow you to hurdle down the roads of Florida with an 80,000 pound total load on an 18-wheeler, all when you’re 18,” said Central Florida Republican Richard Gentry. “You can serve on a jury in Florida. That’s a level of responsibility, and you can be prosecuted as an adult on the other side of that jury.”
Southwest Florida Republican Vanessa Oliver said that it didn’t make any sense that the law bans 18 to 21-year-olds from purchasing rifles while at the same time they are allowed to receive them as gifts.
“This loophole sends a confusing message that young adults are responsible enough to own a firearm, but only if someone else buys it for them,” she said. “If these individuals are trusted to own, possess, and use a rifle responsibly, they should be entrusted to work through the legal process themselves.”
11th Circuit ruling
Broward County Democratic Rep. Robin Bartleman offered an amendment that would have essentially killed the bill, as it called for banning the sale or transfer of a firearm to a person younger than 21. For those concerned that the existing law violates the Second Amendment, she cited the recent decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denying a legal challenge to the law by the NRA.
“This minimum age of 21 is constitutional,” she declared, adding that Democrats don’t want to take away anyone’s guns. “I want common-sense gun laws.”
The amendment was rejected by the GOP-controlled House.
Broward County Democratic Rep. Christine Hunschofsky, who was mayor of Parkland at the time of the 2018 shooting, begged her colleagues not to approve the measure.
“This hurts every time, and I know that it’s going to continue to keep going on, until this eventually passes, because you can do this,” she said. However, “The facts are not with you on this. This is a good law that has stood the test of time. And the only reason to get rid of it is this emotional allegiance to this idea that you have to have a gun as the most awesome right you have.”
Luis Valdes, the state director for Gun Owners of America, praised the vote in a statement, noted how former Senate President Kathleen Passidomo killed the legislation the past two years, and say now all eyes are on Senate President Albritton.
“Ben Albritton faces a choice,” he said. “Champion the will of the people and restore Second Amendment rights. Or follow in Passidomo’s footsteps and betray gun owners across Florida.”
Meanwhile, gun safety advocates denounced the House vote.
“This is a betrayal of the families and survivors who have fought tirelessly in honor of those who died,” said GIFFORDS executive director Emma Brown. “The Florida Senate must once again reject this dangerous rollback as they have done repeatedly in recent years.”
Despite the recent judicial decision affirming the Florida law, Second Amendment supporters embraced comments by Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier in the immediate aftermath of the 11th Circuit’s ruling.
“Notwithstanding CA11’s opinion today, I believe restricting the right of law-abiding adults to purchase firearms is unconstitutional,” Uthmeier said on X, adding that the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in Texas recently reached the same conclusion.
This story was updated with comments from Luis Valdes and Emma Brown.

One theme that comes up over and over again is a push for school funding that supports the goal we all share — that every Washougal student graduates with a plan for their future, and the experiences and knowledge they need to achieve that goal.  
A recent statewide poll shows most Washington voters support increased public school funding, highlighting its vital role in student success, community growth, and economic prosperity. Investing in education ensures all students have access to quality learning, strengthening our society’s foundation.
Last month, a group of Washougal students joined staff members in Olympia to advocate for greater investment in schools to address the growing needs and the gap between current funding and the true cost of public education. Our legislators shared how proud they were of our students and their thoughtful advocacy, and we’re grateful for their willingness to listen and learn. Ensuring school funding keeps pace with inflation is critical to providing excellent teachers in every classroom and the support students need.
Nearly 19% of Washougal students receive special education services, but the state only funds 16% of our students. In our district, this leaves about 86 students without state support, forcing local taxpayers to cover essential services like assistive technology, behavioral support, specialized transportation, and individualized instruction. Even for funded students, resources fall short. The state must fully fund special education to ensure all students have the opportunity to learn and thrive.
Just like every family, our district budget has experienced huge cost increases. Utility, food, insurance and fuel costs are all higher. The district saw a $727,000 funding gap in 2023-24 in materials, supplies, and operating costs, known as MSOC in the state budget. The Legislature responded with an increase of $21 per student to meet these costs — $54,000 for our district. This helped, but it is not enough.
Last November, voters overwhelmingly upheld the capital gains tax paid by wealthier Washingtonians. Lawmakers need to take this as a sign and look for other ways to make sure the wealthy pay what they owe for our schools and public services. While lawmakers are discussing many options, inaction must not be one of them.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/school-classrom-k-12-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

This tariff will remain in place until he leaves office, he said, and was meant to protect the U.S. industry.“I think our automobile business will flourish like it’s never flourished before,” he said.The tariff will go into effect April 2, he said. It will add to – not replace – any other applicable existing tariffs, he said.“We’re going to charge countries for doing business in our country and taking our jobs, taking our wealth, taking a lot of things they’ve been taking over the years,” he said. “They’ve taken so much out of our country, friend and foe alike. And frankly, friend has been oftentimes much worse than foe.”The measure could bring in $100 billion in tax revenue, a White House aide said during the Oval Office event.Trump said the administration would have “very strong policing” to enforce the tariffs.Trump said he did not seek advice from White House adviser Elon Musk, the CEO of U.S. electric carmaker Tesla, because “he might have a conflict.”Trump said the tariffs may be good or neutral for Tesla, which he noted had large plants in Texas and California.“Anybody that has plants in the United States it's going to be good for,"" he said.",,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)The union that represents just under 500 Environmental Protection Agency employees in Colorado rallied Wednesday outside of the agency’s downtown Denver headquarters against President Donald Trump’s threats to cut workers.
Members of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 3607 and other supporters marched around the EPA Region 8 headquarters near Union Station to urge the Trump administration to “let us work” as it continues to undermine federal workers. 
Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency has been tasked with reducing the size of the federal government and targeting “waste, fraud and abuse,” which has led to mass firings of probationary federal employees among other cuts the administration claims will reduce federal spending. Two federal judges, deeming the firings illegal, have ordered the Trump administration to reinstate probationary employees.

AFGE Local 3607 Secretary Greg Lohrke told the crowd that a contract that took the union years to negotiate was “ripped apart in days” by the Trump administration. He said the administration has ignored civil service protection laws meant to “ensure a stable, nonpartisan federal workforce.”
Miles Batson, vice president of AFGE Local 3607, said the chants the group led its march with — “Let us work” and “You’re going to miss us when we’re gone” — are the key points the union wants the administration to understand. The Office of Personnel Management directed each federal agency to develop “reduction in force” plans to cut their staffing, and while there hasn’t been any specific guidance on what this will look like yet, Batson said it won’t make anything more “efficient.” He said blindly cutting federal workers “under the guise of efficiency or fraud is really insulting.”
“It’s going to be really devastating to see us all go, and we don’t want to wait until the anvil drops to say that,” Batson said. “Federal workers are for better and more efficient work. We want to do our work better.”
Batson said his involvement with the union started as a way to help federal workers with work conflicts or contract negotiations. Now, he said, the entire structure of that work is “completely under attack” as the Trump administration continues efforts to cut the federal work force. 
“I’ve turned into a fighter much more so than I expected, but we’re up for the fight,” Batson said. “I’m not backing down in any way shape or form.”

Emily Bedell, a union steward for AFGE, said losing probationary workers is “a disservice to the American people, public health and the environment.” She said she’s worried about maintaining clean drinking water in the region, as well as underserved communities after the Trump administration cut environmental justice programs. 
“We’re here today to tell the administration that we have been beaten down by the policies that they’re enacting,” Bedell said. “We’ve all felt super depressed … like things are out of our control, and we’re here to take that power back and show the administration that we will be here no matter what they do to us, and we’ll keep working hard to serve the American people.”
Support from the union has been essential, Bedell said, especially as the federal government has violated worker contracts by firing probationary employees and mandating a return to in-person work. That has been especially hard for working parents, as they’ve had to search for spots in daycare for children, and Bedell said office morale is down overall. 
“The austerity that’s coming from the top is making it really hard to then put that aside, come into the office and do our good work that we’re all passionate about,” Bedell said. “We’ve been treated deplorably by the administration and by DOGE, and we don’t deserve it. We’re here today to stand together to protect our jobs, our rights and the future of federal service.”
Commerce City Councilmember Renée Chacon said environmental justice is a human right, and she asked EPA workers to keep fighting to ensure people in underserved communities like hers have access to clean air, land and water. She said she’s fighting for the same water rights in Commerce City that her grandmother was.
“I’m asking for your help and your profession and your medicines to come back to my community and never go away,” Chacon said. “That’s how we beat people like Trump. He thinks he can bully us.” 
A Suncor Energy oil refinery in Commerce City is frequently flagged for violations of environmental regulations. In July, the EPA and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment served the refinery with a 140-page list of alleged violations. 
“What I would say to the Trump administration is that isn’t government efficiency,” Ean Tafoya, Colorado state director of GreenLatinos, said about federal worker cuts. “Efficiency is when our people can wake up and breathe clean air, clean water and live the American dream. They are stealing the American dream from my community with missed days of school, with lower property values, with your inability to save and send your kids to college.”

Rollan Roberts, R- Raleigh, lead sponsor of Senate Bill 249, addresses the Senate during the session Wednesday, March 26, 2025, in Charleston, W.Va. (Will Price | West Virginia Legislative Photography)The West Virginia Senate has approved a bill that would expand the work and training requirements for recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly called food stamps. 
Senators approved Senate Bill 249 with no discussion and a vote of 32 to 2. 
With some exceptions, able-bodied people without dependents ages 18 to 54 are required to work or train in order to receive SNAP benefits. The bill would expand the age to 59 by requiring the Department of Human Services to assign people in that age range to a mandatory work or training program. 
Under the bill, exemptions include caring for a child under age 6 or an incapacitated adult, going to school at least part time, being employed at least 30 hours a week and participating in a drug or alcohol treatment program, among other things. 
The bill would allow the state Department of Human Services to exempt up to 20% of individuals from the SNAP Employment and Training program work based on challenges that the person would experience complying with the requirements. 
According to a fiscal note from the Department of Human Services, the agency estimates the cost of implementing the legislation would be $2.7 million in state funding for fiscal year 2026 and about $1.7 million per year in state funding when the bill is fully implemented. Those costs include hiring one new family support supervisor in each county office to oversee the program. The department warns that the implementation of a program based on this bill might lead to a higher error rate for SNAP, which could lead to the state having to pay back federal funding.
“Other states implementing mandatory E&T programs have seen drastic increases in their SNAP error rates,” the department wrote. “Error rates above the national average for two consecutive years place a state at risk of federal financial sanctions requiring potential repayment of federal funding. While West Virginia’s error rates are currently compliant, the administrative complexity of implementing new eligibility criteria under a mandatory program does expose the state to significant risk of repayment.” 
Rhonda Rogombe, health and safety new policy analyst for the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, called the bill harmful. 
“We know from lots of studies, including some of our own, that mandating work reporting requirements disconnects people from access to food but does not connect them to work,” she said Wednesday. “So we have lots of concerns about this bill.” 
The bill would also impact retailers that rely on SNAP and put pressure on the state’s food banks as they fill in the gaps, she said. 
Jeremiah Samples, the former deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Resources and now a lobbyist for the right-leaning organization Opportunity Solutions Project, previously testified in support of the bill, saying it gives people both the expectation and resources to work. 
The legislation has been opposed by representatives of the state’s charitable food network. Caitlin Cook, director of advocacy and public policy for Mountaineer Food Bank, told West Virginia Watch previously that in other states, mandatory education and training programs have increased food insecurity. 
The Senate passed the legislation during the 2024 legislative session, but the House did not adopt it.
The bill will next go to the House of Delegates for consideration.

“Outside of safety, those children deserve permanency. We are physically damaging their brains and slowing their development by traumatizing them time and time again unnecessarily,” said Del. Adam Burkhammer, R-Lewis, who is a foster parent. “We’re trying to shorten the unnecessary moves.”
The bill would also change how the Department of Human Services handles reunifying foster children with their biological siblings. Reunification is still a priority, bill sponsors say, and the measure shortens the timeframe for DoHS to find siblings. 
It would loosen the requirement that children be reunited with siblings if it’s against the child’s best interest.
The bill has received pushback from child welfare groups, who say its requirements could harm children. It conflicts with federal child welfare laws that prioritize biological family and sibling reunification, they say.
“West Virginia should be taking actions to keep brothers and sisters together — not make it easier to separate them,” said Jim McKay, state coordinator for Prevent Child Abuse West Virginia. “Noncompliance with this federal legislation puts West Virginia at risk of losing essential [federal] funding that supports services for children and families statewide.”
  Del. Jonathan Pinson, R-Mason
Bill sponsors maintain that the bill will still meet federal regulations. Del. Jonathan Pinson, R-Mason, said, “We are pushing the envelope because we’re serious about trying to improve our foster care system in West Virginia.”
The bill passed the House on a vote of 97-2. 
The state’s foster care system is overwhelmed and has the nation’s highest rate of children coming into foster care. There are more than 5,800 children in foster care.
A 2019 class-action lawsuit brought by West Virginia foster children said that the state left kids to linger in its system without any plans for permanency. A federal judge recently tossed the lawsuit, but said the problems in foster care persist and gave a scathing review of how state leaders had neglected the system.
The measure, House Bill 2027, says that if a child has been in an appropriate and safe foster care arrangement, including a foster family, for 15 months or 50% of the child’s life, then the department cannot terminate that placement unless it’s in the best interest of a child. Current state law sets the window at 18 months.
West Virginia terminates parental rights at twice the rate of any other state.
Pinson said foster children regularly cycle from placement to placement, which could be foster homes or residential facilities. As a foster parent, he has experienced a foster child, who was a baby, being taken from his home only to return later. 
“What you have in front of you today is one opportunity to address one specific problem of addressing children who are being bounced around from foster home to foster home oftentimes for no fault of their own and at no fault of the foster parent,” Pinson said. “We have watching today foster parents who have had their hearts ripped out because a child was moved from their home who they’ve connected with … but moved from their home simply because it was more convenient for the other stakeholders in the case.”
  Del. Jim Butler, R-Mason
Del. Jim Butler, R-Mason, said, “We need to allow the kids to move onto a better life.” 
Molly Arbogast, executive director of the National Association of Social Workers West Virginia chapter, said the change would allow termination of parental rights far earlier than the federal Adoption and Safe Families Act standard.
“ASFA sets a uniform timeline  — 15 out of the last 22 months in care — before a termination petition is required, ensuring parents have a fair opportunity to work toward reunification,” she said. “The bill’s 50% rule would create a harsher, arbitrary standard that could result in unnecessary family separations, particularly for very young children, without federal authorization.”
Bill would change state’s sibling reunification policy 
The bill also would also mandate that DoHS find a child’s biological siblings and families of siblings within 90 days, and the department must inform foster or adoptive parents of eligible siblings for placement or adoption.
“Those decisions were being delayed out for quite some time,” Burkhammer said.  
Current state law says the department “shall” prioritize sibling reunification; the bill would change “shall” to “may.” 
Burkhammer said that the measure still prioritizes sibling reunification, but there are instances — including cases where sibling abuse is happening — that aren’t best for reunification. Children are also sometimes reunified with half-siblings and their family whom they’ve never met, he said. 
“There was no flexibility with folks to truly determine the best interest of the child,” Burkhammer said. “What we’re doing too often is cookie-cuttering too many of these cases. It’s a preference, and it should be considered, but we really want you to consider the best interest of the child first and foremost.”
McKay hopes the bill will be amended in the Senate should they take it up for consideration.
  Del. Patrick Lucas, R-Putnam
“For many children, those [sibling] relationships are their only remaining connection to family — and a critical source of comfort and stability. Separating them adds to the trauma they’ve already endured,” he said, adding that federal law requires states to take actions to place siblings together.
The American Bar Association has stressed the importance of prioritizing sibling connections. 
The House also passed House Bill 2880, which assigns an individual through the Court Improvement Program or Public Defender Services to assist parents through the requirements to be unified or reunified with their children.
Del. Patrick Lucas, R-Cabell, told members that they’ve faced criticism this session about passing “red meat bills.”
“It’s about time we did something to improve the lives of foster children and foster parents,” he said.

(Photo via Getty Images)After years of failed starts, the Iowa Legislature has finally sent legislation banning the handheld use of cellphones while driving to Gov. Kim Reynolds.
The Iowa House passed Senate File 22 on a 84-11 vote Wednesday. The legislation is an expansion of Iowa’s current laws banning texting while driving to cover any handheld use of a cellphone. Drivers could still use a device in hands-free or voice-activated modes under the legislation.
If signed into law, the bill would be enacted July 1, 2025, when law enforcement officers would begin giving warnings for violation of the measure. Beginning Jan. 1, 2026, violations of the law would result in a fine of $100. If the incident results in an injury, that fine would increase to $500; in cases causing death, the fine would be $1,000.
It’s a change to Iowa law that law enforcement officers have been asking the Legislature to pass for years, as Iowa’s current distracted driving laws are difficult to enforce. An officer who sees a person using a cellphone behind the wheel  often cannot tell if a person was texting or using their phone for an approved function, like navigation.
Though sought by law enforcement and families of people who died in accidents involving distracted drivers, the measure has for years failed to advance through the Iowa House.
Rep. Sean Bagniewski, D-Des Moines, thanked the families who came to speak with lawmakers at subcommittee meetings and with committee members about the measure, saying “their advocacy, for years now, is what brought us to this moment.”
This year, the measure gained more momentum as Reynolds called for lawmakers to support a measure to ban the handheld use of cellphones while driving in her January Condition of the State address, which she said will help prevent traffic deaths.
The measure received only one “no” vote in the Iowa Senate from Sen. Kerry Gruenhagen, R-Walcott. In the House Wednesday, 10 Republicans and one Democrat voted against the measure.
No representatives spoke in opposition to the bill during floor debate.
Rep. Ann Meyer, R-Fort Dodge, floor manager for the legislation, thanked the Iowans who for years spoke about the need to pass a ban on the use of handheld electronic advices behind the wheel.
“Thanks to everyone who’s worked on this bill over the years, especially thanks to the families — telling your story is very difficult, but it has made a difference,” Meyer said. “I do believe this legislation will save lives.”
Advocates celebrated the bill’s passage Wednesday. Luke Hoffman, executive director of the Iowa Bicycle Coalition, said in a news release the bill “will save lives and make our roads safer for all Iowans”
“Iowa urgently needs a hands-free driving law, and the Iowa Bike Coalition has worked towards this day for nearly seven years since it was first introduced,” Hoffman said. “We have been persistent in our efforts because of the stories our advocates elevate of Iowans impacted by this issue. … We do this for them, for their families, and know that this new law will for a fact prevent unnecessary future loss of loved ones. This law is the seatbelt law of our generation, and we will be working in the coming months to educate the general public on how we can all change behavior so we can save lives, together.”

(Getty Images)In a press release announcing the signing of 20 bills passed by the General Assembly, the governor is quoted as stating “we’ve been laser focused on addressing the everyday needs of our Kentucky families and communities, and the 20 bills I signed do just that.”
Unless you agree that Kentucky families and communities wake up in the morning hoping that their right to statutory judicial review of planning and zoning decisions will be disrupted by the Kentucky legislature, then the passage and signing of House Bill 321 into law were grave misjudgments.  
The bill as altered by a Senate committee is indeed “laser focused,” but in a Star Wars way rather than on protecting the rights of Kentucky families and communities.
In Gov. Andy Beshear’s defense —  and that of most of the legislators who voted on HB 321 — the last-minute insertion of the offending language was done without any meaningful public notice or opportunity to debate or study the impact in committee. Before the Senate action, the measure had been an uncontroversial and positive House bill providing additional training for local planning officials.
The conversion of a good bill into a direct assault on the judicial appeal rights of the public in planning and zoning matters occurred during the first of two hectic “concurrence” days before the veto period, after one chamber had already considered and approved the bill.
In the two days remaining in the 2025 regular session, the General Assembly could fix this problem by enacting changes that undo the damage caused by HB 321 and restore the statutory right to judicial review.  Here’s why they should.
Kentucky Revised Statutes Chapter 100 involves many government decisions that can dramatically affect the quality of life in local communities with planning and zoning. It covers final actions of planning commissions, boards of adjustment, counties, and cities with zoning authority, and landmark commissions. It covers a broad range of decisions including the grant or denial of a rezoning, a variance, a conditional use permit, a cell tower, a subdivision, or revision to a comprehensive plan or zoning regulations, or adding or removing a binding element.  Before HB 321, any person claiming to be injured or aggrieved by that final action could bring a suit in circuit court within 30 days of that final action seeking court review of whether the action complied with the law.
HB 321 will limit that statutory appeal right to “owners of real property within the zone where the property that is the subject of the final action is located.”
Under HB 321 neighborhood associations, renters, homeowners living near properties whose zoning has been changed to commercial or industrial, groups concerned with demolition of historic properties or impacts on public parks, and others injured or aggrieved, would be barred from the statutory right to judicial review of action by local governments and their agencies on land use matters. The right to appeal government decisions on planning and zoning would be limited to persons who are injured and who own land in the same “zone” as the property that is subject to the government action.
The new limit is as arbitrary as it is offensive to the rights of homeowners, renters, neighborhood associations, and civic groups dedicated to historic preservation and parks, among others, treating their economic and other interests as if they are unworthy of protection.  
HB 321 is a direct affront to Kentuckians in all communities that have adopted planning and zoning. It seeks to deprive them of access to the courts where a local government decision affects their quality of life and the homes they own or rent, unless they own property in the same “zone” as the property subject to the final action that has caused them harm.
HB 321 treats renters, neighborhood associations, and civic groups like second-class citizens, shutting the door to statutory judicial review unless they “own real property within the zone” that is the subject of the action that has caused injury.  Current law requires someone seeking judicial review to be injured or aggrieved, and the new restriction would exclude everyone injured other than property owners in the same “zone” from seeking review.
HB 321 shuts the door on statutory appeals for many property owners as well. A zoning amendment case usually involves a change in the zoning classification of a property. A homeowner in a residential zone could not, under HB 321, challenge a zoning change converting residential property to a commercial or industrial zoning even if the change was next door to the homeowner’s property.
Many of the most controversial decisions under KRS Chapter 100 occur in the transition area from one zone to another — a landowner in a residential zone that abuts a commercial zone, or a farm owner in an agricultural zone that abuts land rezoned as industrial; yet none of these challenges could be brought under the statute as amended.
HB 321 also arbitrarily links the right to judicial review to the zoning status of property owned by the person injured by the government action. Many final decisions under KRS Chapter 100 don’t depend on the zoning status of property at all but nevertheless can dramatically affect the quality of life of individuals, neighborhoods and communities. Decisions such as adoption or revisions of comprehensive plans and zoning regulations; approvals of cell towers; imposition and removal of binding elements; granting or denying of conditional use permits or variances; all of these are not focused on the “zone” and yet could be denied judicial review because of the bill’s new limit to judicial appeal for landowners in the same “zone” as the property that is the subject of the final action.
If unrepaired, the message behind HB 321 will be clear — your legislature doesn’t care how much a government action under planning and zoning laws may harm you or your family, your quality of life or your community, unless you own property in the same zone as the subject of that government action. No statutory right to ask a court to review the lawfulness of government action would exist when a zoning change occurs next door or down the street, if the rezoned property is no longer in the same zone. Renters, civic groups, neighborhood associations, your statutory right of appeal no longer exists. 
Finally, HB 321 will likely prove to be an ineffective, yet disruptive, effort to chill these appeal rights of many people in communities concerned with government planning and zoning actions. Ineffective, because there is an inherent constitutional right to seek judicial review of government action, arising under Kentucky Constitution Sections 2 and 14, that cannot be abridged by the General Assembly. 
If HB 321 stands as law and all of those harmed by decisions under planning and zoning laws can no longer access the courts using KRS 100.347 to appeal, the inherent constitutional right of appeal will be available to assure that arbitrary government acts are held to account.
The more likely impact of HB 321 will be to significantly disrupt local planning and zoning, causing harm not only to those sought to be barred by this law from appealing, but also to those seeking to develop properties.
For if there is no statutory right of appeal, then the 30-day time limit in law to file such appeals will no longer be applicable, and judicial review could occur later in time. HB 321 will not result in fewer land-use appeals; instead, there will likely be the same or even more appeals, some occurring later in time with more disruption to developers, local governments and the public.
The General Assembly reconvenes Thursday for two days. There is time to fix this blunder, and to restore the right of all persons injured or aggrieved by a government decision under KRS Chapter 100 to timely seek judicial review of the legality of that government action.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2094257663-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

Wingate spoke Wednesday at the end of a hearing that he called “very informative.”

At issue is a proposed $227.5 million settlement unveiled in January by Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman.
Attorneys for a group of state employees opposing the settlement say the amount falls far short of compensating the pension funds for what the plaintiffs allege were breaches of fiduciary duty by the hedge funds, in particular what they characterize as excessive fees.
In court Wednesday, an attorney for the state employees, Michelle Ciccarelli Lerach, also said the settlement would “extinguish” her clients’ ability to continue to press their claims on behalf of the pension systems.
“They are trying to wipe us out,” Lerach said. “Our clients’ due process rights are being violated.” 
KY state workers group blasts pension settlement with hedge funds, presses its own lawsuit

On the other side, attorney Justin Clark, head of the state attorney general’s civil division, told the judge that the benefits of settling far exceed the risks posed by continuing to litigate the case. He stressed that the boards of the three state pension systems have unanimously approved the settlement; he also said state law makes the attorney general responsible for representing the pension systems.
The original case drew national attention when filed by a group of eight state pensioners in late 2017 against some former officials of Kentucky Retirement Systems (now the Kentucky Public Pensions Authority) and major hedge fund companies KKR & Co., Prisma Capital Partners, The Blackstone Group and Pacific Alternative Asset Management. They alleged the financially troubled retirement systems gambled $1.2 billion on secretive, high-risk hedge fund investments that eventually went sour.
The case has gone through several permutations since then and at one point might have reached a dead end but was revived by former Attorney General Daniel Cameron.
The proposed settlement came out of more than five months of negotiations between Attorney General Coleman’s office  and the defendants and mediated by a former federal judge — a process that Lerach on Wednesday criticized as a “secret mediation.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_1388-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

Offering no explanation, Grall put forward an amendment removing all of the provisions in one of her bills, SB 1626, dealing with abused and abandoned migrant children vying for immigration relief.
Immigration attorneys representing children fleeing abuse previously condemned the bill, calling it unethical because it would have prevented kids without legal permanent status from gaining residency in Florida if the abuse happened outside of the country.
Miami Republican Sen. Ileana Garcia said she had been in talks with Grall to walk back provisions that would have restricted a path to residency for immigrant children entering the country without their parents or a guardian.
“So we want to make sure, at least I’m going to make sure, that children are always safe,” Garcia told reporters after the committee meeting.
The amended child welfare bill advanced in the Senate Appropriations Committee on Health and Human Services on Wednesday. Wihout the immigration provisions, the bill would allow the Florida Department of Children and Families to issue provisional certifications for new domestic violence shelters, have more power over exemptions to background checks for child care employees, and extend licenses for family foster homes.
Grall had originally pitched the excised language as necessary to close what she claimed was a loophole allowing criminals and gang members to gain legal status, a claim President Donald Trump touted in his first term.
“It’s also clear that there is some abuse of the special immigrant juvenile visa by those who have other criminal history, gang activity, that type of thing,” Grall said during the first hearing of the bill on March 14. “That’s what this is really responsive to and to make sure that we are really looking out for the interest of the children that are within the state of Florida.”
Although advocates with the Florida Immigrant Coalition (FLIC) thanked the lawmakers for the change, they said they were still concerned about a provision giving sheriffs authority over cases of missing children who are supposed to be in custody of the Florida Department of Children and Families.
Tiffany Hankins, FLIC’s director of politics and policy, said she worried missing kids without legal status would wind up in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, given the enforcement agreements the state’s sheriffs have signed with the federal government.
The House companion, HB 1301, still maintains the changes that immigration attorneys said would shut them out from representing migrant children in court. However, the bill has not been heard in the lower chamber.
At the federal level, the Trump administration moved on Friday to end a contract providing legal help to unaccompanied migrant children.
Grall’s office did not respond to Florida Phoenix’s request for comment.

(Getty Images)Amid Florida’s affordability crisis, the Republican leader of the Florida House has proposed a significant cut in taxes charged by the state, but it may come with an expensive price tag that could force legislators to enact deep spending cuts.
Florida House Speaker Daniel Perez announced Wednesday a plan to reduce the state sales tax rate from 6% to 5.25%, which, if successful, would save taxpayers’ nearly $5 billion annually and put the Sunshine State on the map for being the only state in the nation to permanently reduce its sales tax.
“This will not be a temporary measure; a stunt or a tax holiday. This will be a permanent, recurring tax reduction,” Perez said during the opening moments of the House session for the day.
The details of the proposal were not made publicly available at press time but Perez said embedded in the proposal was a reduction for business rent taxes. Gov. Ron DeSantis proposed eliminating the tax in his recommended budget for the upcoming year. DeSantis also. has proposed eliminating property taxes but that would require voters to approve a change to the state constitution.
House Democratic leader Fentrice Driskell, meanwhile, told reporters they did not have the details on Perez’s proposal either.
But she said that  Perez and DeSantis who has proposed eliminating property taxes are “Both jockeying for position with the voters but we don’t have the information to know ‘is this a good thing.’”
Katherine Betta, a spokesperson for Senate President Ben Albritton, said in a statement: “President Albritton has tremendous respect for the Speaker and looks forward to partnering with the House on a significant, broad-based tax relief package to make sure Florida families can keep more of the money they earn.”

The announcement comes as the House and Senate roll out early iterations of spending plans for state fiscal year 2025-2026.  Perez said the House’s proposed budget would be “historic.”
Already, a House health care budget subcommittee recommended this week eliminating a 10-year, $500-million health innovation fund from the budget. It was a priority for former Senate President Kathleen Passidomo and an integral component of her Live Healthy Initiative.
How low can you go?
“Our budget will not only be lower than the governor’s proposed budget, it will also be lower than the budget passed by the Legislature last term. For the first time since the Great Recession, we will roll out a budget that actually spends less money than we did in the prior fiscal year,” Perez said.
Perez predicted special interests “will say the sky is falling and the world is ending. But it won’t and it’s not. They have lost sight of the difference between our state’s needs and their wants.”
The initial budget proposals from the House have all been preceded by GOP budget leaders maintaining that the growth in state spending is “not sustainable.”
Overrides
But despite the calls for austerity, the House also on Wednesday voted to restore funding to a handful of projects that Gov. Ron DeSantis vetoed last year.
The House overwhelmingly voted to restore $4.74 million in budget vetoes for local projects, which Perez said garnered the headlines but are “irrelevant and incidental to the true growth of the budget.”
The House voted to reinstate:

$140,000 for a program aimed at preventing homelessness for senior veterans;
$1 million the Department of Corrections uses for timesheet and payroll data management;
$1.1 million to make improvements to the Town of Baldwin’s water and sewer systems; and 
$2.5 million for a program to remove 29,106 pounds of nitrogen per year from Rockledge’s water supply. 

Perez announced “combined workgroups” before the start of the 2025 session and tasked them with identifying potential vetoes DeSantis made in the state fiscal year 2024-25 budget for the House to override. 
For the overrides to be successful, the Senate must follow suit. The veto process starts in the House because the budget, contained in HB 5001, originated in the House.

Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Rep. David Kustoff of Tennessee reignited their push Wednesday to prevent incarcerated people from using contraband cellphones through device jamming systems.The Republican lawmakers are reintroducing identical legislation in their respective chambers of Congress that would allow state and federal correctional facilities to use these systems, which disrupt and interfere with wireless communication.Federal law currently prohibits the use of cellphone jamming equipment, as the devices can interfere with 911 calls and threaten public safety correspondence.  “Within prison walls, contraband cellphones are dangerous weapons,” Cotton said at a press conference in the U.S. Capitol regarding the bill.“For too long, we’ve turned a blind eye to this glaring public safety threat as crimes are planned, facilitated and ordered by convicted criminals already serving a prison sentence,” he said.Cotton clarified that the equipment would not interrupt the normal communications of law enforcement and emergency first responders, and state officials would have “full discretion as to where and how this jamming equipment is used in prison facilities.”The measure requires that the Federal Communications Commission — which has jurisdiction over the matter — “may not prevent” correctional facilities from using these systems.The system operations would be limited to the housing units of the jail or prison.Cotton said they would work with the FCC if the bill is passed to “make sure that it’s implemented in a careful and deliberate way that solves the problem that our correctional leaders have inside their prison without having any unintended consequences.”Kustoff said “it really should not be possible for people behind prison bars to order hits on people, to conduct gang activity, to traffic drugs, while behind the walls of a prison.”“The extent of this coordinated criminal activity carried out by inmates is a serious threat to everyone — those who guard and protect those in prison, as well as those in our communities,” he said.The Urban Institute surveyed state correctional administrators and found that in 2020, more than 25,000 cellphones were recovered in their facilities across 20 states.Meanwhile, a bipartisan coalition of attorneys general led by Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee and the U.S. Virgin Islands wrote to the leaders in the House and Senate, expressing their support of the measure and urging them to pass the legislation in their respective chambers.They are joined by attorneys general in Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Northern Mariana Islands, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.At the press conference, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin said he and leadership at the state’s Department of Corrections and Arkansas State Police are “begging for this bill to become law.”Griffin, who called the measure “fundamentally common sense,” cited examples of dangers posed by the use of these prohibited phones, including a convicted rapist who he said used a contraband cellphone to plan his escape from prison.The FCC did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.",,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch) Our state leaders are calling for Utah to become the “nation’s nuclear hub.” Gov. Spencer Cox has claimed that his Operation Gigawatt “puts Utah in a position to lead the country in energy development, secure our energy future, and remain a net energy exporter while diversifying and expanding our energy resources.” Deciding what energy technologies to pursue in a state involves weighing risks and benefits and determining what risks a community is willing to accept.
This year, Utah’s legislature passed HB249, which will create a nuclear energy consortium to guide the state’s plans for nuclear energy. However, in the process of passing this bill, we have yet to see a robust discussion of the risks of nuclear energy or meaningful engagement of communities that this development will most impact. While new technology may present new opportunities, we must consider the critical risks of investing so much in nuclear energy. The dangers of nuclear power before and after its operation go beyond the risk of a meltdown and could have devastating consequences for our state.
The uranium boom in the ’50s and ’60s had devastating impacts on Utah’s people and lands, as well as for uranium miners in Navajo Nation. The largest nuclear accident in the U.S. happened in 1979 at the United Nuclear Corporation’s Church Rock uranium mill site in New Mexico. A dam broke and released radiation into the Rio Puerco, contaminating drinking water, aquifers, and soil on Diné (Navajo) lands.
Uranium mining and milling are not just a part of Utah’s past. Today, the country’s last remaining conventional uranium mill is near Blanding, Utah. The mill is owned by Energy Fuels, a company that specializes in uranium and rare earth mineral mining and milling. Recently, the mill accepted uranium from the newly reopened La Sal mine complex in Utah and the Pinyon Plain Mine near the Grand Canyon. Indigenous communities around the region, including the Havasupai Nation, Diné communities, and Ute Mountain Ute Nation, have spoken out on how the nuclear fuel chain disproportionately impacts their communities and lands.
Milling, often overlooked, is a critical part of nuclear energy production. Like the history of nuclearism in this state, this mill disproportionately impacts Indigenous communities, in this case, the local White Mesa Ute community. Community members from White Mesa have fought for years against the mill’s contamination of their air and water and desecration of sacred lands. White Mesa Concerned Community, a grassroots group, and the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe held a rally this fall at the state capitol. Yolanda Badback, leader of White Mesa Concerned Community, called on the state to regulate and shut down the mill. She stated, “I want my community to have good air quality and good water resources. We live there, and that’s our homeland. And I will never leave my homeland for anything.”
State leaders have failed to listen to and represent the members of their state most impacted by the nuclear industry today. Just this fall, state legislators took a field trip down to the mill to see it for themselves. This visit allowed Energy Fuels direct access to the eyes and ears of state legislators. That same privilege was not offered to those just 5 miles down the road in White Mesa who are most impacted by its operation.
Hearing from impacted communities adds a needed layer to discussions about the safety of nuclear energy, including its entire lifecycle. Nuclear power’s lifecycle begins with uranium mining and ends with nuclear waste storage. State leaders claim that nuclear energy is clean and safe. For example, at the committee hearing for HB249, the bill’s sponsor, Rep. Carl Albrecht, insisted that new nuclear technology was safe and highly regulated. Yet, the state of Utah recently joined a lawsuit to sue the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to reduce regulations on small-modular nuclear reactors. These regulations are necessary to protect our state, public health, and future generations. Will the state also seek to reduce regulations on uranium mining and milling, transport, and waste storage?
Decisions we make about our energy future must be informed by the real lived experiences of members of our community, especially those who bear the brunt of its impacts. As state leaders seek to grow nuclear power in the state, we, as Utahns, must demand that our legislators not only listen to those most impacted but also evaluate the risks of nuclear energy, especially those within the entire lifecycle.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DSC_0623-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

President Pro Tempore Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque) sponsored Senate Bill 242, the Science of Reading Act, this session, which proposed amending the Public School Code to require new and established teachers be trained in what’s called “structured literacy,” and would have prohibited “balanced literacy techniques.” Structured literacy, a science-backed method of teaching students the foundations of reading through phonics, vocabulary and comprehension, is particularly used to teach children with dyslexia. Balanced literacy, contrastingly, uses context and visual clues.
“Forty-two other states have either already put this in their statute or they are working towards doing it now,” Stewart told Source NM of the push to require structured literacy. She also pointed to Mexico and Finland as examples of countries where using structured literacy has been successful.
New Mexico has provided a structured literacy course for elementary teachers called Language Essentials for Teachers of Reading and Spelling (LETRS) since 2019. Stewart said “we are now seeing the results of this work in pockets around the state,” including in Gadsden and Roswell, where English language learners and children living in poverty — categories identified in the Yazzie-Martinez lawsuit as at-risk in the state — are showing improved reading proficiency. 
SB242 would have also required school districts to notify parents of their children’s reading performance twice a year for K-3 students, and to notify parents if their first grade child showed reading difficulty following a dyslexia screening.
The bill found support on the Senate side, but was held up in the House Education Committee due to concerns over biliteracy needs and what lawmakers saw as a lack of attention to English language learners. Stewart presented amendments to the bill, but the committee eventually voted to table it indefinitely.
The Senate later added provisions of the original bill as amendments to several other bills. These included House Bill 167, which would require the Public Education Department to cover the cost of high school equivalency tests for some students, and House Bill 156, which would increase each of the three minimum teacher salary tiers by $5,000. Both bills included provisions to establish structured literacy as the primary approach to teaching the foundations of reading and require colleges of education in New Mexico to teach the approach. 
The bills were sent to the House floor for a concurrence vote, but representatives took issue with the amendments, particularly with HB167, saying the Senate was attempting to pass a bill despite it failing in committee. The House voted not to concur on SB167, sending it back to the Senate, whose members voted to rescind the amendments in the final hours of the session. HB167 as it originally stood awaits the signature of Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.
However, the House did vote to concur with the science of reading additions to HB156, which also now awaits the governor’s signature.
Stewart told Source NM that her original bill was 22 pages long, but she condensed it into three to four pages for the amendments, leaving out parental notification requirements, among other points. Nonetheless, she still said lawmakers made progress on this issue.
“Absolutely a first step, a good, solid win,” she said.
Stewart, a retired educator, said she has been working to address New Mexico’s approach to literacy education for 30 years, ever since the National Council on Teacher Quality gave all universities in the state a failing grade. This prompted her to introduce House Joint Memorial 16 in 2010, directing university deans and members of the Legislative Education Study Committee to study reading curriculum in teacher education programs. 
“I will continue to work with the secretary of education and the governor,” Stewart said. “As we move forward, I will continue to work with them on ensuring that our teachers are well trained.”

NC NTSP, Butler said, provided her with the encouragement and guidance needed to commit to a long-term teaching career.
Beginning teachers like Butler, defined as those with fewer than three years of experience, made up about 11% of North Carolina’s teaching workforce in 2022-23 school year, but they accounted for nearly 15% of those who left the profession, according data released last year by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction.
NC NTSP currently serves 1,200 beginning educators and has a 94% retention rate, said Dr. Elizabeth Hodges, the program director, at a press conference Wednesday morning. Hodges said the program is currently impacting approximately 40,000 students.

This success has spurred Democratic legislators to push for a $4 million appropriation to extend its reach across the state. “We are in a crisis,” said Rep. Cynthia Ball, a leading advocate for expanding the program. “We lose half our teachers after their fifth year, and the situation has only gotten worse.” 
The NC NTSP is an initiative of the University of North Carolina and partners with 83 school districts providing beginning teachers with provisional development, one-on-one coaching, and a support system designed to also address personal challenges.
Dr. Caroline Beam, an instructional coach, recounted an instance in which a simple offer of emotional support helped a discouraged middle school teacher reconsider resigning.  “What I realized, and what we all probably know, is she was just worn out,” said Beam, who meets with 33 beginning teachers weekly. “We just needed to rest, and things were going to look a lot different on the other side of spring break.”

Rep. Rodney Pierce (D-Halifax, Northampton, Warren), a former educator, highlighted the disparities in support available to teachers across the state.  “Not all teachers have support systems within their schools or districts,” Pierce said. “That’s why we need to support legislation like this.” 
Ball and her colleagues face steep odds in the Republican-controlled legislature, but she said she is determined to fight for the bill.
“I am determined not to take ‘no’ for an answer,” Ball said.  “I’m asking some of the people who are those making decisions, and you know what I mean, what is it going to take to get this $4 million that’s like a nickel in your pocket to our budget, and it is the best investment that I can think of.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSCN0029-1024x692.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

Scott Newman (R-Hutchinson), right, during a vote Thursday, May 12. Photo by Catherine J. Davis/Senate Media Services.A federal judge on Wednesday said she had “no doubt” there’s probable cause — enough evidence — against former state Sen. Justin Eichorn, a Republican from Grand Rapids, to sustain a federal charge of attempted coercion and enticement of a minor.
U.S. District Judge Shannon Elkins ruled against the prosecution, however, in allowing Eichorn to move to a halfway house under a long list of conditions. The prosecution argued Eichorn should be held in jail as he awaits trial because he allegedly attempted to conceal evidence and lied about owning a firearm.
During a two-hour hearing Wednesday — which combined a hearing for probable cause and a detention hearing — the prosecution and defense dissected the messages Eichorn allegedly sent to a person he believed was a 17-year-old girl but was actually an undercover Bloomington police officer.
Eichorn, who entered the federal courtroom in St. Paul escorted by U.S. Marshal officers wearing bright orange, was arrested on March 17 at a parking lot in Bloomington where he allegedly expected to meet the underage girl to pay for sex. He resigned from his Senate seat a few days after his arrest and moments before the Senate planned to expel him from the body.
Attempted coercion and enticement of a minor comes with a mandatory federal sentence of 10 years in prison.
In a court filing earlier this week, prosecutors alleged that Eichorn made phone calls from jail to an unnamed woman — referred to as “Individual A” in court documents — to arrange for the woman to pick up a laptop from Eichorn’s St. Paul apartment, where he lived during the legislative session.
Charles Hawkins, Eichorn’s defense attorney, on Wednesday revealed that that person was Eichorn’s wife, Brittany Eichorn — who filed for divorce earlier this week.
When law enforcement agents entered Eichorn’s St. Paul apartment, they found a red bag containing $1,000 cash, an SD memory card, a handgun and ammunition, a laptop and a factory-reset iPhone 6.
Eichorn told a probation officer in a pre-trial interview that he didn’t have any firearms in the St. Paul apartment. The prosecution said Eichorn lied, but Hawkins said Eichorn had trouble hearing the interviewer, who was conducting the interview in a U.S. Marshall’s holding cell with eight to ten other people.
“I respectfully suggest that anything that occurred was an honest mistake,” Hawkins told the judge. 
Hawkins also said that Eichorn had the gun in his St. Paul apartment because he had received increasing threats after co-authoring a bill in the Minnesota Senate classifying “Trump Derangement Syndrome” as a mental illness.
Regarding the factory-reset iPhone 6, FBI Special Agent Matthew Vogel said investigators had not completed forensic analysis of the phone, but preliminary results show the iPhone was likely reset to factory settings on Feb. 28 — weeks prior to Eichorn’s arrest.
On March 20, Brittany Eichorn in a recorded phone call from jail told Justin Eichorn that “apartment stuff is taken care of, just so you know.” She told Eichorn she planned to go to the apartment to pick up a laptop the following day.
As FBI agents prepared to search Eichorn’s apartment on the morning of March 21, they encountered Brittany Eichorn. She asked to enter the apartment to retrieve a laptop she used for business. The FBI agents declined.
Hawkins told the judge that the Eichorns own a rental property company, which oversees 138 units, and Brittany Eichorn was trying to get the laptop for the leasing business, not to conceal or destroy evidence. 
The judge said the prosecution did not present enough evidence to clearly indicate that Eichorn was a danger to the community or tried to tamper with evidence.
“Because it is unclear and because there is so much gray, the court finds the government has not met its burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the safety of the community,” Elkins said.
In the probable cause hearing, Eichorn’s defense tried to poke holes in the prosecution’s charge, noting that Eichorn didn’t formally agree over the messages to pay for sex, though he did ask about the prices, including how much it would cost to have sex without a condom. The defense likened it asking questions about buying a car.
The prosecution said that Eichorn carried out the act of paying for commercial sex as far as he could take it and repeatedly messaged the undercover officer posing as a girl asking when she was available for sex even when he didn’t receive a response.
“He arrived exactly in the location the undercover agent posing as a minor girl told him to park,” said Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Bobier. “The only thing that got in between Eichorn and having sex with a minor and paying for it is that it was a cop instead.”
Hawkins, during a cross examination of FBI agent Vogel, said that Eichorn could have decided to not go through with having sex with the girl once he arrived to the Bloomington location. 
“You don’t know what he intended to do when he arrived there,” Hawkins said to Vogel.
When ruling that there was probable cause against Eichorn, the judge said that there doesn’t need to be a formal agreement to pay for sex, but the law states that an attempt to offer a minor anything in exchange for sex is illegal.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/eichorn_1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Dan Koeck/For the North Dakota Monitor)Editor’s note: This story contains graphic material and discusses the sexual exploitation of minors. 
FARGO – A former North Dakota lawmaker was sentenced Wednesday to 10 years in federal prison after he pleaded guilty to traveling with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct.
Ray Holmberg, 81, was a Grand Forks state senator for 45 years, and received a sentence that is longer than federal sentencing guidelines. 
U.S. District Judge Daniel Hovland characterized Holmberg’s conduct as “egregious and despicable” and said he didn’t think the guideline sentence of more than three years was adequate.

“From my perspective, this was not an isolated case and this is not a victimless crime,” Hovland said. “It displays a pattern of very vile, sickening criminal behavior.”
Holmberg sexually exploited others, including people in North Dakota, witnesses say in court

Holmberg, who appeared in court wearing shackles and a bright orange jail uniform, will also have to register as a sex offender.
Prosecutors allege Holmberg traveled to Prague in the Czech Republic 14 times between 2011 and 2021 to pay for sex with boys. 
North Dakota’s acting U.S. Attorney Jennifer Klemetsrud Puhl said if prosecutors had been able to identify victims in Prague, they would have requested a longer sentence. 
“These boys experienced harm,” Klemetsrud Puhl said. 
She also described what she characterized as Holmberg’s history of leveraging his power to exploit boys and young men.
Though not part of the charges against Holmberg, two men who said they met him in North Dakota and were victimized by him gave emotional testimony at the hearing. One said Holmberg gave him money to film sex acts in the 1990s. The other man who spoke at the hearing was a cooperating witness who said Holmberg used his political power to groom them for sex. 
Defense attorney Mark Friese argued prosecutors had not presented evidence that underage boys were involved or that Holmberg ever assaulted a minor. He also emphasized that Holmberg had no criminal history and was not charged with other crimes.
Friese advocated for no prison time, arguing a sentence of time already served in jail and home confinement were more appropriate given Holmberg’s health and age.

Holmberg said in court that he traveled to Prague with the intent of having sexual contact with minors, that he liked massages and some involved sexual contact. He said he might have received a sexual massage from someone under 18, but he’s not sure.
Hovland asked Holmberg several questions about messages Holmberg sent bragging about sex with minors. In one message, Holmberg sent a cooperating witness a link to a brothel in Prague with the comment, “The boys rent at around $60 … (sex is extra).”
Holmberg claimed that was “bravado” or “locker room talk” but that the statements were not true.
Former North Dakota lawmaker pleads guilty to traveling for sex with children

Hovland expressed skepticism and said he can draw inferences from the repeat trips to Prague and the messages. 
“Those are pretty damning admissions,” he said.
Hovland drew on Holmberg’s words from a pre-sentence report in which Holmberg said he engaged sex workers outside of the United States because he believed it to be legal and politically safe.
“There was sexual contact with minors in the Czech Republic,” Hovland said.
Holmberg was linked to the investigation of Nicholas Morgan-Derosier, a Grand Forks man who was sentenced in May to 40 years on child pornography charges.
During that investigation, an employee of Morgan-Derosier’s landscaping business told law enforcement he performed a sex act on Holmberg, identifying him as a senator, testified Dan Casetta, a special agent with Homeland Security Investigations.
The employee, who had been homeless until Morgan-Derosier provided him housing and a job, was directed by Morgan-Derosier to perform a sex act on Holmberg in an effort to get a landscaping contract, Casetta testified.
Investigators searched Holmberg’s Grand Forks home in November 2021. After officers took Holmberg’s phone and other electronic devices, he asked for the phone number of North Dakota Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem, Casetta testified. Holmberg asked for the number in front of an agent for the Bureau of Criminal Investigation, which reports to the attorney general.
Holmberg left Stenehjem a voicemail indicating he was in “big trouble,” Casetta testified. Holmberg also tried calling Stenehjem at his office. He told an assistant to whisper what sounded like coded language in Stenehjem’s ear, Casetta testified. 
Holmberg, a Republican who held the powerful positions of Senate Appropriations Committee chair and head of Legislative Management, resigned from the Legislature in 2022. He was indicted on federal charges in October 2023.
In court Wednesday, the defense denied the prosecution’s claims about exploitation in North Dakota and urged Hovland to focus on the crime Holmberg pleaded guilty to.
Child sex tourism fuels demand for human trafficking, expert says

Friese said law enforcement identified four other men accused of sex crimes but did not prosecute those men. Some were granted immunity for cooperating in the Holmberg investigation, he said.
In imposing a sentence above the guideline range, Hovland gave examples of other federal sex crimes that carry more serious prison terms. 
“I think the sentence reflects how serious a crime it was,” Klemetsrud Puhl said after the hearing. “This was a crime that was an assault on the dignity of many young boys in Prague.”
Friese said late Wednesday he needed to talk to his client about whether he wants to appeal.
In exchange for Holmberg’s guilty plea, prosecutors agreed to dismiss a charge of receipt and attempted receipt of child pornography.
Holmberg has been held in jail in Elk River, Minnesota, since November. Hovland said he anticipates Holmberg will return to jail in Minnesota temporarily. Hovland planned to recommend that Holmberg be placed in a federal Bureau of Prisons medical facility in Rochester, Minnesota, but the decision will be up to the bureau.
Hovland said he still considers Holmberg a risk at 81. He ordered Holmberg to have no contact with anyone under 18 unless it’s approved by a probation officer. After he’s completed his sentence, Holmberg’s conditions of release include avoiding playgrounds, schools and other places with children. Hovland also ordered Holmberg to participate in a sex offender treatment program.

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A pair of legislators wants to protect all memorials on public property in South Carolina by expanding on a law passed a quarter-century ago primarily to keep Confederate monuments in place.
Sen. Danny Verdin, R-Laurens, and Rep. Bill Taylor, R-Aiken, introduced sibling bills Wednesday to expand a portion of state law commonly called the Heritage Act.
Since 2000, state law has given the Legislature sole authority over whether to remove or change the name of any building or memorial on public property that commemorates American wars, as well as Native American or African American history.


The Heritage Act

	
The following is the 2000 law, commonly called the Heritage Act:
No Revolutionary War, War of 1812, Mexican War, War Between the States, Spanish-American War, World War I, World War II, Korean War, Vietnam War, Persian Gulf War, Native American, or African-American History monuments or memorials erected on public property of the state or any of its political subdivisions may be relocated, removed, disturbed, or altered. No street, bridge, structure, park, preserve, reserve, or other public area of the state or any of its political subdivisions dedicated in memory of or named for any historic figure or historic event may be renamed or rededicated. No person may prevent the public body responsible for the monument or memorial from taking proper measures and exercising proper means for the protection, preservation, and care of these monuments, memorials, or nameplates.
Source: S.C. Code of Laws

But a Charleston-based group formed in 2018 to fight the removal of monuments argues the law is “no longer effective” following efforts by several boards and municipalities to oust memorials honoring certain controversial historic and Confederate figures.
In addition to expanding the scope of monuments covered under the law, the proposed legislation would allow private organizations to file lawsuits to block removal and punish those who do so without authorization.
Brett Barry with the American Heritage Association said he thinks granting legal standing to private organizations like his will deter further removals.
“You will end up in court, and you will lose,” he said at a news conference at the Statehouse.
The legislation would allow a judge to order groups that remove or alter a memorial without the Legislature’s permission to pay restitution. The state also could withhold funds to local governments.
A statue removed
Barry, a board member of the association, said the tide turned in 2020 with the removal of the bronze statue of John C. Calhoun from Marion Square in downtown Charleston.
Charleston City Council voted to pluck the statue from its 125-foot pedestal, where it stood for 124 years, in the aftermath of a white police officer killing George Floyd, a Black man, in Minneapolis.
The removal is the subject of a lawsuit from groups, including the American Heritage Association, hoping to reinstate the statue. The city has argued in court it was within its rights because the statue was not on public property — the city leases the privately-owned square — and it didn’t memorialize a historical era covered by the law.
Attorney General Alan Wilson said the same in issuing a nonbinding opinion in 2020 about the statue honoring the former U.S. congressman, secretary of war, and vice president under two presidents. While Calhoun was a fierce defender of slavery, he died 11 years before the first shots of the Civil War were fired in Charleston Harbor.
The 12-foot-tall statue remains in storage as the city has tried unsuccessfully to transfer it to a museum.

Barry said the monument’s removal has since encouraged other boards and municipalities to “violate” the law.
Other monuments
The Charleston County School District has removed a stone highway marker honoring Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from the Charter School for Math and Science on King Street. The ensuing legal battle drew Wilson’s attention. The attorney general filed a court brief saying the 2021 removal constitutes a Heritage Act violation.
Barry said the school district is “thumbing its nose at the authority of the state Legislature” and should have sought legislative approval.
As passed in 2000, the law required a supermajority vote in both chambers of the General Assembly to alter or remove monuments covered under the statute.
A unanimous state Supreme Court ruling in 2021 kept legislative authority intact but reduced the hurdle to a simple majority vote. Justices determined it was unconstitutional for legislators in 2000 to restrict the voting ability of future legislatures.
Though it’s dubbed the Heritage Act, those words don’t actually appear in state law. The memorial protection was part of a 2000 compromise that moved the Confederate flag from atop the Statehouse dome to a flagpole beside a Confederate memorial on the Statehouse’s front lawn. (That compromise also made both Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Confederate Memorial Day state holidays.)
The Legislature removed the flag from the grounds entirely in 2015, following the massacre of nine Black parishioners of Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in downtown Charleston by an avowed white supremacist.
Other monument removals that have drawn the ire of the American Heritage Association include:

A statue of Christopher Columbus pulled from a city park in Columbia and transferred to the S.C. State Museum after it was vandalized in 2020
A name change to a city of Charleston auditorium whose previous namesake, Christopher Memminger, owned slaves and served as the Confederate States’ first treasury secretary
Attempts in North Augusta to remove an obelisk memorializing Thomas McKie Meriwether, a white man who died participating in a mob that attacked a Black South Carolina National Guard militia at the Hamburg Massacre during Reconstruction. The mob captured and executed four of the Black soldiers. The city, last year, installed educational panels telling the story of the massacre and stating the monument’s white supremacist inscriptions “do not represent the attitudes of the people of North Augusta today,” the North Augusta Star reported.

‘Beyond just wars’
Lawmakers have introduced previous iterations of the current legislation in past sessions, Barry said, but the Legislature has taken no action to date.
Verdin announced the latest effort during an annual Statehouse meeting of the South Carolina chapter of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, The Post and Courier first reported last week.
“We’ve got to move beyond just wars,” Verdin told the newspaper. “There’s so many other monuments that are not in the black letter of the law that the attorney general and main courts have determined are not.”
Verdin acknowledged the number of monument removals in South Carolina have been few compared to other states.
“It’s my hope and intention there will not be another single monument brought to that demise,” he told reporters Wednesday.
Verdin said about half of South Carolina’s 46 state senators have signed on as co-sponsors. In the House, Speaker Murrell Smith also has expressed support.
“The cancel culture is here, and I understand that,” the Sumter Republican reportedly said while speaking at the Sons of Confederate Veterans event. “But at the end of the day it is up to us as South Carolinians to preserve our heritage and to celebrate our heritage.”
As of Wednesday evening, neither bill was searchable yet on the Legislature’s website.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DSC_0443-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Main photo by Getty Images; logo courtesy State of Iowa)A former social worker for Four Oaks Family & Children’s Services in Cedar Rapids sexually harassed a client and poses an “immediate danger” to the public, a state licensing board has ruled.
The Iowa Board of Behavioral Health Professionals recently issued an emergency order suspending the social work license of Dennis Dozier. The board has charged Dozier with unethical conduct by taking unfair advantage of a professional relationship, or exploiting others, to further his personal or business interests; unethical conduct by engaging in physical contact with a client; unethical conduct by sexually harassing a client; and failure to comply with a board order.
The publicly available board documents give no indication as to where or when the alleged conduct took place, but state that Dozier is a licensed social worker who practiced at Four Oaks between 2018 and 2021 as a mental health counselor.
According to the board, Dozier at some point provided counseling to a client who later reported that Dozier had disclosed his own mental health struggles to them, after which the client grew concerned Dozier might commit suicide. The same client also reported that Dozier pressured them into selling a car to another client.
The board alleges that in October 2024, it ordered Dozier to undergo a comprehensive mental health and substance abuse evaluation and that he has so far failed to comply with that order.
“There were additional reports that (Dozier) made sexual advances” toward a client, the board alleges. “The board finds that (Dozier) sexually harassed a client and that (his) behavior has caused psychological harm to the client.”
The available public records provide no information as to the age of the alleged victim.
After ruling that Dozier posed “an immediate danger to the public health, safety and welfare,” the board indefinitely suspended Dozier’s license through an undated order that was recently made public. A hearing on the license suspension is scheduled for April 24, 2025.
State records indicate Dozier was subject to a separate emergency order issued by the board on Jan. 28, 2025, but that order is not publicly accessible.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/therapist.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

Ron DeSantis held a press conference with Florida Physicians Against Amendment 4 in Coral Gables on Oct. 21, 2024. (Screenshot/Florida Channel)Gov. Ron DeSantis’ goal to make it much more difficult for citizen-led constitutional amendments to pass in Florida is one step closer to happening after a House committee approved a measure that would add significant new hurdles for such initiatives.
The bill (HB 1205) sponsored by Lee County Republican Jenna Persons-Mulicka would make a series of changes to the state’s already extensive initiative-gathering process, which has been tightened over the past decade by the GOP-controlled Legislature. It passed on Wednesday on a party-line vote after more than two hours of sometimes intense reaction in public testimony.
Citing a report produced by the Office of Election Crimes and Security in January asserting that more than 100 representatives of the group attempting to pass a ballot measure to expand abortion rights in Florida committed crimes related to gathering petitions, Persons-Mulicka told the committee that the initiative process was “broken,” and thus reforms are required.
“We need to protect all Floridians and ensure that we have integrity in the initiative process,” she said.
But Democrats and the vast majority of those who spoke during the hearing were critical of the legislation, which they said would effectively kill the citizen-led amendment process.
“What this bill will do, as currently written, is make citizen-led initiative processes impossible in the state of Florida, unless you have billions to spend,” said Orlando Democratic Rep. Anna Eskamani. “You are creating new administrative burdens under the guise of integrity, that is really designed to restrict access and suppress the First Amendment rights of Floridians.”
Provisions in the legislation include:

Requiring the petition sponsor to post a $1 million bond payable to the Division of Elections once the sponsor has obtained a letter from the department confirming that 25% of the requisite number of signatures has been obtained.
If a person who is collecting or handling initiatives petitions is found to not be a U.S. citizen or is convicted of a felony without having his right to vote restored, the petition sponsor is liable for a $50,000 fine for each person.
The bill revises the deadline by which petitions must be delivered by the petition sponsor to a supervisor of elections from 30 days to 10 days and increases the fines from a $50 flat fee for each late petition form to $50 for each day late for a total fine of up to $2,500 per late petition form. If the sponsor or petition circulator acted “willfully,” the bill increases the penalty from $250 for each petition form to $2,500.
The bill requires all petition circulators — volunteers as well as paid staffers — to be residents of Florida. It says that before a paid petition circulator is registered, he or she must submit to a criminal background check.
The bill creates a signature revocation process that allows a voter to revoke his or her signature from a petition form. The supervisor of elections must post on their website the total number of signatures revoked every month, and later every week. If the percentage rises to more than 10% of the total petitions received during that period, the Office of Election Crimes and Security is required to conduct a preliminary investigation and may report findings to the statewide prosecutor or applicable state attorney for prosecution.

Intense debate
For nearly two hours, an overwhelming number of public speakers denounced the bill, many claiming the GOP-controlled committee and Legislature simply don’t want to have the citizen-led amendment process continue.
“What’s really a fraud is that there’s a desire not to have citizen’s petitions anymore,” said Larry Collerton, a member of Orange County branch of the NAACP. “So instead of just flat out saying that, this basic show is being put on. You don’t want citizen initiatives. Just say that! Don’t pretend with this.”
Perhaps the most contentious piece of the legislation is the provision that would reduce the time that a petition sponsor has to deliver a signed petition from 30 days to 10 days, with the fines increased for every day that they are not returned.
“The 10-day turnaround time that this bill puts on is unreasonable for the tens of thousands of petitions that a citizen-led amendment sponsor needs to collect per week in order to qualify for the ballot,” said Amy Keith, executive director of Common Cause Florida. “On top of that, with that 10-day turnaround, we end up with absolutely unreasonable per petition fines, even if they make a simple error.”
But Pinellas County Republican Linda Chaney said the proposal was based on the fraud that she said was exposed in the 2024 petition-gathering process for specific amendments that was listed in the Office of Election Crimes and Security report.
“The Department of State did an investigation and they printed a 939 page-report and this bill is based on all of the issues that were identified in that report, so this is a very fact-based bill,” she maintained. 

The bill will now move to the entire House for likely passage. The Senate version is being pushed by the Senate Committee on Ethics and Elections (SB 7016) that has one more committee stop before going to the floor in that chamber.

(Will Price | West Virginia Legislative Photography)The West Virginia Senate passed a bill Wednesday that, if adopted as law, will ban all diversity, equity and inclusion practices and policies in state government and schools.
Senate Bill 474 passed the Senate 32-2, with Sens. Mike Woelfel, D-Cabell, and Joey Garcia, D-Marion, as the only no votes. The bill now advances to the House.
The bill to prohibit DEI is a policy priority for Gov. Patrick Morrisey and is the legislative side of an executive order he issued earlier this year meant to do the same. It’s reflective of a trend spearheaded by Republicans nationwide meant to undermine and end DEI in all its forms.
On the Senate floor Wednesday, lawmakers in support of the bill said diversity, equity and inclusion policies are harmful since they can prioritize services for certain groups of people — mostly marginalized groups — over others who have systemic privileges.
Sen. Patricia Rucker, R-Jefferson, said the bill is “about ending discrimination” by “not being influenced by someone’s race, power, sex, ethnicity or national origin.” 
Sen. Scott Fuller, R-Wayne, said he was “thankful to God” that diversity, equity and inclusion policies are on the path of ending in West Virginia. He said such policies were not needed anymore.
“I don’t know where this came from, this idea that we are a racist country, that we don’t give equality to women or to different religions or whatever the case may be,” Fuller said. “Does [racism] exist? I’m sure it does. This is not a perfect world, we don’t live in a perfect society, but to the point that it’s a problem? I really don’t believe it.”
In West Virginia and across the United States, wide disparities continue to exist that mean some people — due to their race, gender and identity, among other traits — are more statistically likely to succeed than others. 
Women nationwide earn on average 85 cents to every dollar earned by men for the same work, according to the Pew Research Center. 
In West Virginia, the gender pay gap is even wider as women here who work full time earn about 74 cents to every dollar made by a man in the state, according to research at West Virginia University. That gap is even larger for Black women.
According to the Bureau for Labor Statistics, Black people nationwide earn just 76 cents for every dollar made by white people. That pay gap, per the report, starts as early as 16 years old for Black workers.
And despite Black West Virginians making up less than 4% of the state’s population, they account for more than 13% of those incarcerated in the state’s prisons and jails, according to the Prison Policy Institute. In general, Black individuals are more likely to get arrested than white people for the same crimes while being significantly less likely to be offered alternative sentences or punishments for those crimes.
In West Virginia’s schools, Black children are suspended twice as often as white children despite representing less than 5% of all students. 
“I look at this as a day that we can actually end DEI because we don’t need it anymore,” Fuller said.
SB 474, as currently written, only applies to DEI policies and initiatives in state and local governments and schools, including institutions of higher education. In response to Morrisey’s executive order, colleges and universities in West Virginia have already begun to review and dismantle services previously offered to students of different races, genders, sexual identities and more.
As a whole, SB 474 will ban any state agency from running an office or division to promote diversity, equity or inclusion practices or from directing an employee to do the same. All current offices that do so are to be shut down.
It would also prohibit expressing any preferences for employment based on any metrics of diversity, equity or inclusion. No person hired can be required under the law to participate in diversity, equity and inclusion trainings and state agencies generally will not be allowed to run such trainings.
The bill would restrict how certain race- and gender-related topics are approached by teachers in schools, who will not be able to teach any lessons suggesting that someone’s race, ethnicity or sex makes them morally “superior” to someone else, among other things. The bill will also prevent teachers and school staff from being required to use a student’s preferred pronouns if those pronouns do not match the child’s sex.
Del. Tom Willis, R-Berkeley, said the bill being passed signifies “freedom from tyranny in the classroom.” The lawyer alleged that “woke teachers” are responsible for that “tyranny” and urged people to report such teachers and anyone else who doesn’t follow the bill — which still has a way to go before becoming state law — to a website he created Wednesday, http://reportwoketeachers.com.
Garcia, one of only two Democrats in the Senate, warned his colleagues about the potential consequences of ending diversity, equity and inclusion policies and initiatives, which he said are actually positive and known to help ensure everyone — no matter their background — is offered services and support to help them succeed. 
“I do not think that racism is over. I do not think that sexism is a thing of the past,” Garcia said. “I think these are things that we constantly need to remind ourselves, and there is still work to do. I think this puts us a step back.”

The case dealt with eminent domain and other related issues. (Dave Bordewyk/South Dakota NewsMedia Association)A carbon dioxide pipeline company has asked courts to pause or dismiss its pending legal fights against landowners and a state regulator in South Dakota after the state’s adoption of a law that prevents the company from using eminent domain.
Eminent domain is a legal process for acquiring access to land for projects that have a public benefit, with compensation for landowners determined by a court. It’s commonly used for projects such as electrical power lines, water pipelines, oil pipelines and highways.
Carbon pipeline company seeks dismissals of North Dakota court challenges

Some South Dakota landowners who oppose the Summit Carbon Solutions project sued to stop the company from surveying their property. They argued that doing so without just compensation was unconstitutional because soil sampling and other invasive practices would occur. 
Summit said it had a right to survey the land because it had eminent domain authority. The company sued some landowners as well. 
The disputes ultimately reached the South Dakota Supreme Court, which determined Summit had not yet proven it meets the legal qualification for using eminent domain, and sent the cases back to lower courts. Lawsuits in which Summit no longer needed to survey the land in question – because an agreement was reached or the route was changed – were then dismissed, leaving four cases remaining. 
Summit filed a motion to dismiss those cases on March 20, two weeks after Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden signed the bill barring carbon pipeline projects from using eminent domain. 
Regulator case paused
Meanwhile, a judge has paused Summit’s legal effort to remove an elected state regulator from its pipeline permitting case. Summit alleged the regulator has a conflict of interest. The company cited the eminent domain ban as part of its rationale for seeking a stay in the case. 
South Dakota Public Utilities Commissioner Kristie Fiegen’s sister-in-law is part of a trust that owns land on the proposed pipeline route. Fiegen declined to recuse herself from Summit’s permit application, and Summit sued to disqualify her from considering the permit.
Both Summit and the state agreed to indefinitely stay the case, and a judge entered the stay on March 14.
Permit pause sought
Summit has also requested a pause for “review and adjustment” of its permit proceedings with the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission. The commission rejected Summit’s first application in 2023, largely due to the route’s conflicts with local ordinances that mandate minimum distances between pipelines and existing features. Summit later adjusted its route and reapplied. 
The eminent domain ban has been hailed as a victory by some landowners who have resisted Iowa-based Summit’s proposed $9 billion project. The pipeline would transport carbon dioxide emissions from dozens of ethanol plants in five states to an underground storage site in North Dakota. It would qualify for billions in federal tax credits incentivizing the sequestration of heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions.
The project has permits in North Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa, although some permits are being challenged in court. Nebraska does not have a permitting process.
Summit has said it is not giving up on the project.
“In South Dakota, recent legislative changes have temporarily slowed our timeline, but they have not altered our vision or our determination,” said Summit CEO Lee Blank in a press release. “We remain confident that our project is moving forward in a way that benefits farmers, ethanol producers, and rural communities.”

(Faith Miller/Colorado Newsline)Colorado State Treasurer Dave Young warned Wednesday of the dire consequences for the state’s budget that could result from Republican proposals to slash federal spending, especially the cuts that would be forced on Medicaid by a recently passed GOP budget resolution.
Young spoke alongside other state treasurers in a virtual press conference hosted by the advocacy group Americans for Responsible Growth, slamming the proposed spending cuts “coming from the Trump administration and from the activities of Elon Musk.”
“The Republicans’ current budget plan, backed by President Trump, is not only financially reckless, it’s needlessly cruel,” Young said. “In Colorado alone, we have about 1.2 million seniors, disabled people, pregnant mothers, working class families that depend on Medicaid. If federal cuts go through, our state must make up the difference by slashing other essential programs like education or kicking thousands of Coloradans off Medicaid. Neither option is acceptable to me.”

The budget resolution passed by GOP lawmakers earlier this month requires the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicaid spending, to make more than $880 billion in cuts to federal spending over the next 10 years. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that Medicaid comprises 93% of the spending that could be cut by the committee. As a result, the Republican budget requires a minimum of $700 billion in Medicaid cuts — or a 10% reduction in projected spending — even if all other spending overseen by the committee were zeroed out.
Young, a Democratic former state lawmaker from Greeley, has served as Colorado’s state treasurer since 2019. One of four statewide executive offices elected by voters, the treasurer oversees the management, investment and disbursement of state funds, along with a handful of savings and loan programs and the state’s Division of Unclaimed Property.
He spoke Wednesday of his sister, Dorothy, who is developmentally disabled and has relied on Medicaid for behavioral and physical health care services throughout her life. About 25 years ago, when Colorado’s Medicaid program was previously forced to make cuts, Young said, Dorothy struggled to find care and was “essentially homeless” for a period of time.
“This is somebody who has no ability to care for herself … but was out on the street because Medicaid didn’t have enough money to support her,” said Young. “I ran for office to advocate, not only for my sister, but for the thousands like her, and because I’ve seen how essential these services are, and how fragile our Medicaid system can be if we don’t protect it.”
If congressional Republicans follow through on their planned Medicaid cuts, Colorado could face an especially difficult set of fiscal choices because of the requirements in the so-called Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights, which Young called “the most restrictive tax and expenditure provisions of any state in the country.” With state lawmakers barred from raising additional revenue without ballot-box approval, and already struggling to fill an estimated $1.2 billion budget gap this year, the state’s only options could be to make deep cuts to a range of social services.
“As these health care costs increase, it’s just going to crowd out our education expenditures even more, and these are just not sustainable pathways for delivering effective services for people in the state of Colorado,” Young said. “Children need to have a quality education. People need to have effective health care. We want an infrastructure system that works for people — our business communities count on that to thrive. And without a thoughtful approach to dealing with Medicaid, particularly in Colorado, we put the future of our state at grave risk.”

(Photo by Barbara Hoberock/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – The Oklahoma Senate on Wednesday passed a bill that would make it easier for women to obtain contraceptives despite opposition from a small bloc of Republicans who put up a lengthy argument that it results in murder.
Senate Bill 176, by Sen. Jo Anna Dossett, D-Tulsa, would require insurance companies that cover contraceptives to allow women to obtain a six month supply, reducing the number of annual visits to the pharmacy, after obtaining a three-month prescription.
Dossett said the bill was not about abortion, but aimed to increase access to preventative contraceptive medications.
Sen. Dusty Deevers, R-Elgin, disagreed and cited the The Physicians’ Desk Reference. 
“It induces the abortion or murder of a human embryo since a new human being has been created at fertilization, which is conception,” Deevers said.
Deevers asked Dossett if she believed “abortion is murder” and a violation of Oklahoma law and the Bible’s sixth Commandment, which prohibits killing.
While most women rely on the birth control pill to prevent pregnancy, oral contraception is used to treat other conditions, including acne, irregular periods, cramps, migraines and endometriosis.
KFF reported in November that 82% of women of reproductive age used contraception in the past year, with condoms and oral birth control being the most common.
Deevers focused on the side effects of various forms of contraception and the personal experiences of he and his wife.
“These drugs are very dangerous,” he said.
Deevers said that women’s brains shrink while on birth control, leading to more depression and anger and increased rates of suicide. He also said women experience a decreased sexual drive, leading to less intercourse while on hormonal birth control. He did not cite a source for that information.
Deevers said that women using a combination of oral birth control and the patch or the vaginal ring have two to four times higher rate of blood clots, thus an increased risk of stroke, heart attack and cervical cancer.
Medical experts say there is a small risk of blood clots, strokes, and heart attacks for women using birth control, though they note that women’s risk of experiencing the first two medical conditions is actually higher during pregnancy. Taking oral birth control for five or more years can increase the risk of cervical cancer, but the risk subsides after stopping the pill, according to the American Cancer Society. There is no known risk of cancer for women who use non-hormonal intrauterine devices, or IUDs.
Women do not take medication they don’t want, Dossett said. No one is being forced to take birth control, she said. 
She said she preferred not to talk about what people do in the privacy of their homes.
Sen. Mark Mann, D-Oklahoma City, said enabling women to plan a pregnancy leads to healthier outcomes and improved economic stability.
Sen. Warren Hamilton, R-McCurtain, urged his colleagues not to increase women’s access.
“I’m begging you to not do this, not only for the children whose lives will be saved, but also for the women who will not be harmed by taking these so-called medications,” Hamilton said.
The bill passed by a vote of 33-13 and is available for consideration in the House.

The bill, sponsored by Republican state Rep. Sherri Gallick of Belton, was passed by the House earlier this month and would gut Proposition A, a voter-approved law requiring most employers starting May 1 to provide paid sick time off for hundreds of thousands of qualifying workers.
Gallick called the law, which also increased the state’s minimum wage, a “one-two punch for Missouri businesses” that will increase the cost of goods and services and have an adverse impact on small businesses in rural parts of the state. 
She has said workers will “abuse” the leave.
Gallick’s bill would also modify the minimum wage law by removing the requirement that it be indexed to inflation.
The bill was passed out of committee Wednesday on a 5 to 2 vote party-line immediately following a contentious public hearing, with Democrats opposing. 
The committee chair, state Sen. Curtis Trent of Springfield, said that although usually there is at least one week between the public hearing and committee vote, it’s “extremely clear…there is not really an opportunity for further deliberation by the committee” and that pushing the bill forward immediately would allow “robust debate and consideration” by the full Senate. 
If approved by the Senate without changes, the bill would go to Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has voiced support for the proposal. There is no emergency clause, so it wouldn’t go into effect until Aug. 28 — months after the sick leave law goes into effect. 
Richard Von Glahn, policy director for Missouri Jobs with Justice, the organization that helped lead the campaign for Proposition A, said it was modeled on paid sick leave policies in 18 other states. The initiative petition passed in rural, suburban and urban counties across the state and received 58% of the vote statewide.
“Opponents made their argument, we made our argument and the voters spoke,” Von Glahn said.
Gallick’s bill is “refutation of the public will,” he added. “It will make Missouri workers more likely to have to go to work while sick, jeopardizing their own health, the health of their coworkers and of Missouri workplaces.” 
Many of the same industry groups who are challenging Proposition A in the state Supreme Court testified in support of the bill Wednesday.
Kara Corches, president and CEO of the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry, called the law, especially paid sick leave, a “job killer.”
“We believe that this one size fits all approach to paid sick leave is unworkable,” Corches said.
Buddy Lahl, from the Missouri Restaurant Association, called the requirements on businesses “extremely cumbersome” and said the law is a “slippery slope” for what businesses will be required to provide.
“Fixing Proposition A is not even an option, fixing the sick pay. It just needs to be eliminated. It’s just too erroneous. And I only listed some of the bigger issues. Every line in there is a problem for a small business,” Lahl said.
When Lahl said the only fix is to eliminate the law, state Sen. Stephen Webber, a Columbia Democrat, responded: “That’s not happening, The only path you have is to maybe make some small changes.”
State Sen. Tracy McCreery, an Olivette Democrat, said restaurant workers without sick time who go to work because they need a paycheck for public health.

Proposition A passed with the support of numerous unions, workers’ advocacy groups, social justice and civil rights organizations, as well as over 500 business owners. It guarantees sick leave for hundreds of thousands of workers and gradually hikes the minimum wage to $15. The measure won by a margin of over 400,000 votes. 
Under the law, beginning May 1, the law requires employers with business receipts greater than $500,000 a year to provide at least one hour of paid leave for every 30 hours worked. Employers with fewer than 15 workers must allow workers to earn at least 40 hours per year, with larger employers mandated to allow at least 56 hours. The law also gradually increases the minimum wage.
Under Gallick’s bill, the minimum wage would still increase to $15 per hour in 2026, as voters approved, but it would not be adjusted for inflation thereafter — a policy that has been in place since 2007. The sick leave provisions would be repealed entirely.
Because the measure changed state law and not the constitution, the legislature can modify or overturn it without returning for a new vote of the people.

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/Maine Morning Star)A majority of legislators on the health committee on Wednesday rejected a bill to put stricter limits on the number of clean syringes certified programs can hand out, backing Maine’s more flexible policy, which medical providers and harm reduction experts have vouched for.
Penobscot County is currently experiencing an HIV outbreak, with 22 cases since last October (compared to one or two cases a year, in recent years). During the public hearing on the bill, health providers and operators of syringe service programs stressed the importance of access to clean needles in the light of this outbreak, citing research that supports the efficacy of these programs.
But some municipalities have blamed expanded syringe services for syringe litter on sidewalks, public parks and private property. 
LD 216, introduced by Rep. Anne-Marie Mastraccio (D-Sanford), would limit the number of clean syringes needle exchanges can hand out, reverting to a one-for-one ratio that Maine allowed until 2022, before adopting new rules that allow participants to bring in just one used syringe to receive 100 clean ones. Maine Department of Health and Human Services also allows participants to receive up to 100 syringes, even if they don’t bring any used ones in, at the discretion of the provider.
Maine DHHS, which oversees the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, opposed the bill, arguing the “proposed language is not supported by evidenced based practice, would limit access, and increases infectious disease transmission risk including HIV and Hepatitis C,” according to testimony by Maine CDC Director Dr. Puthiery Va.
Needle exchanges face municipal pushback despite state, public health backing

Both Republicans and Democrats on the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee said Wednesday that municipalities should decide what policies are best suited for needle exchanges in their communities, but the statewide ratio does not need to change.
“To me, it just sounds like a disposal issue,” Sen. Marianne Moore (R-Washington) said during the work session on the bill. “However, it’s local control, so each of the cities can do their own ordinance. So I personally think that we should just leave it up at 100, because it’s been working other than the disposal part of it.”
With the exception of a few votes, the vast majority of the health committee voted against Mastraccio’s bill. That recommendation now heads to the full House and Senate to consider.
Municipalities blame providers for syringe litter
Last November, Sanford passed an emergency ordinance to revert back to the one-for-one syringe ratio, which Mastraccio said appears to have reduced syringe litter.
“We believe the ordinance has reduced the number of discards greatly, and I have not heard of corresponding outbreaks of HIV or Hepatitis among the needle exchange population,” she said in public testimony. 
Amanda Campbell of the Maine Municipal Association also said many towns and cities supported the tighter restrictions on needle exchanges because they are “concerned about the safety of their public works employees and their residents who are consistently exposed to used needle litter.”
But according to the Maine CDC’s syringe service report from 2023, released last May, most users bring in roughly the same amount of syringes they receive. Syringe services handed out 1.16 syringes for each one they collected last year, which means that despite some concern about the state’s 100 to 1 ratio, the effective rate of exchange has not dramatically changed. 
Syringe service programs also provide sharps disposal containers and help reduce discarded waste in communities, according to Dr. Kinna Thakarar, a physician at Maine Medical Center and an associate professor at the Tufts University School of Medicine.
Another solution lawmakers discussed is Portland’s needle buyback program, which the city’s public health director, Bridget Rauscher, said has helped reduce syringe litter by 76% and also resulted in a 58% increase in used syringe return. Participants can earn 10 cents per used needle they turn in, with a weekly cap of 200 syringes per person.

House Bill 96 prevents government entities from displaying flags on its properties, with exceptions to:

The U.S. flag
The official flag of a government entity
U.S. state flags
Military flags
POW/MIA flags
Tribe flags
Country flags to commemorate special occasions
Flags of Idaho colleges, universities and schools

The bill already passed the Idaho House of Representatives in a 53-17 vote. The bill now heads to the governor’s desk where he can sign it, let it become law without his signature or veto it.
Meanwhile, in Utah, a similar bill restricting flags at schools and on government property passed the Legislature earlier this month and is also being considered in the governor’s office.
Utah Legislature bans pride flags from schools, public buildings

The Idaho bill’s sponsor, Sen. Ben Toews, R-Coeur d’Alene, said the bill “isn’t stifling freedom of speech,” and local and state governments should remain neutral.
Sen. Jim Woodward, R-Sagle, asked if it would impact Bonners Ferry, a town he represents which flies a Canadian flag at the entrance of the city to welcome Canadian visitors.
“It’s hard to say if that’s a special occasion, I mean being a border town, I think it is understood as something that’s important, and it does allow for official flags of countries other than the United States,” Toews said. “It’s a little bit of a gray area to be honest.”
Woodward joined three other republicans to vote alongside Democrats against this bill, including Sen. Kevin Cook, R-Idaho Falls; Sen. Dave Lent, R-Idaho Falls; and Sen. Jim Guthrie, R-McCammon.
Sen. Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, said the bill targets her city and the neighborhood she represents that flies pride flags across Harrison Boulevard in North Boise.
“I understand that in my neighborhood now, when we want to celebrate and unite under this rainbow flag and support our community, that is going to be taken from us by the state,” she said. “This is two blocks off my street. Every time those flags get hung, big groups of people go out to celebrate because we welcome everyone in my district. I think this is far overreach.”

(Photo by Gabrielle Porter for Source NM)New Mexico environment officials are seeking approval for new heat protections for workers — both indoor and outdoor — which, if adopted, could go into effect as early as this summer.
Earlier this month, the New Mexico Environment Department submitted a draft rule to the Environmental Improvement Board for new standards for employers to prevent heat illnesses and related injuries, kicking off a public rule-making process.
The rule, for instance, would require employers to incorporate precautions such as rest periods, good shade or cooling areas and adequate drinking water in high-heat conditions, implement plans and training to prevent injuries and require tracking of injuries and the conditions under which they occur.
“New Mexico’s desert climate and naturally hot summer months, including the region’s rapidly warming climate, present a unique need for employee protection from heat illness and related injuries,” the department said in the petition for the hearing.
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics recorded a nationwide average of 3,389 injuries and illnesses per year between 2011 and 2020, and averaged 40 deaths annually in the same time period.  These figures, however, are likely an undercount. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration in a 2023 report called the figures “a vast underestimate” caused by a variety of factors: inconsistent reporting from health professionals; lack of recognition of heat as a factor; underreporting from employers and workers.
Public health advocates told Source NM New Mexico urgently needs the rule, which they say will benefit workers in numerous industries, including restaurants, construction and agriculture. Six states — Maryland, California, Nevada, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington — have adopted statewide regulations to reduce heat stress in the workplace.
In its application, the New Mexico Environment Department cited research that New Mexico’s temperatures are expected to rise in the coming years, driven by human-caused climate change.
They may also be hotter in the shorter term: The three-month outlook by the Climate Prediction Center shows hotter than average temperatures expected for New Mexico in the next three months.
New Mexico’s position as one of the fastest-warming in the U.S. is already harming workers, said Nathaniel Matthews-Trigg, a founding board member of Healthy Climate New Mexico, a nonprofit that advocates around climate and health issues, and will host an Extreme Heat Summit in April.
Matthews-Trigg, who has a masters in public health and is a certified emergency manager who researches climate change and public health, said heat impacts are directly impacting New Mexico.
“When we look at the data, especially the New Mexico specific data, the overwhelming number of people that experienced heat-related illness are people of working age, which we know really points to the risk people face and their jobs,” he said.
In its petition, the New Mexico Environment Department notes the most recent data shows heat stress visits are increasing in New Mexico among people ages 18 to 44. The New Mexico Department of Health’s Environmental Public Health Tracking Program documented over 900 emergency room visits due to heat in 2023 and more than 830 heat related emergency room visits since April 1, 2024
Preventable heat injuries and deaths rising in New Mexico

The federal Occupational Health and Safety Bureau started the process of making federal heat safety standards for workplaces in 2021, but the Trump administration has indefinitely paused the process.
Without a federal rule, state protections are crucial, Matthews-Trigg said.
“We are kind of setting ourselves up to be on the cutting edge, to learn from many of the lessons of other states and then also incorporating what’s really unique in New Mexico, both in how people work and our climate,” he said.
The draft rule would establish mandatory rests starting at 95 degrees depending on the intensity of work. The rule also would require employers to create heat prevention and safety plans; provide training; give access to emergency care; and to collect data when heat illness and injuries do happen. The rule would use the heat index created by the National Weather Service, which  applies measures of both temperature and humidity, as well as direct sunlight and clothing, to better estimate the dangers of heat stress.
The rule would cover both indoor workers and outdoor workers, where the heat index at the workplace exceeds 80 degrees Fahrenheit. It would exclude workplaces that keep all working areas below 80 degrees on the heat index, people who telework and emergency personnel.
Physical work in high heat can result in heat exhaustion and heat stroke as well as long term impacts such as heart and kidney damage, neurological dysfunction, and death.

NMED requested two days June 24 and June 25 for the hearing. The next step is for the Occupational Health and Safety Bureau to open comment for 60 days in April.
Jorge Estrada, a spokesperson for NMED, told Source NM in an email Tuesday the comment period has not yet been scheduled. If the Environmental Improvement Board approves the rule, it could go into effect in July 2025, according to a NMED news release.

House lawmakers voted down legislation to change the state’s constitution to allow citizens to summon a jury via petition was voted down 40-60 on Tuesday afternoon.
Rep. Tom Millett, R-Marion, sponsored House Bill 460 which he said was intended to hold “public officials, institutions and individuals accountable for their actions” and mentioned it was a tool against corruption.
“It is my firm belief that a citizen’s grand jury offers a range of benefits that can help restore trust, ensure fairness and protect the rights of all citizens,” Millett said on the House floor.
The bill would have allowed for 100 registered voters in a county, plus an additional 1/2 percent of the county’s population regardless of a county’s size, to petition to convene a grand jury. Once the threshold is met and sent to the county’s election administrator, a judge would impanel an 11-person jury.
The bill would have been a constitutional amendment brought to the voters.
The grand jury would act as its own judge, according to the bill. Similar legislation has been passed in Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Nevada and North Dakota.
Montana has seen some support for citizen grand juries in the past, two similar bills during the 2023 session failed to pass. Another attempt in 2010 died as well. Comments from former Rep. Lola Sheldon-Galloway, who was the sponsor of one of two bills, included her saying grand juries weren’t part of any of the three branches of government.
At least one member of Tactical Civics, a group that teaches the U.S. is a Christian nation and its members are empowered to hold public officials accountable, also spoke in favor Sheldon-Galloway’s bill.
The group, which according to Lee Newspapers has gained something of a foothold in Montana and educates people on how to form a “constitutional militia,” has the goal of creating citizen grand juries and expanding the U.S. House of Representatives, and its members believe much of the federal government to be illegal and warn of corruption.
Opponents said in committee and on the floor that it could be used to target people for little reason at all.
Rep. Ed Stafman, D-Bozeman, a former civil rights lawyer, spoke in strong opposition to the bill on the floor. 
“A bit of research on these few other states that allow for citizen grand juries will show that they’ve mostly been used to investigate government officials based on conspiracy theories or vendettas,” Stafman said. “The most common use was to investigate alleged government complicity in the September 11 attacks or issues around President Obama’s birth certificate.”
Millett did not agree with the characterization.
“A lot of these objections that I hear, they all center around the potential for people misusing this process to go after their political enemies,” Millett said. “I don’t agree with that. I actually believe that claim is a slap in the face to everybody in Montana.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1129133936-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Photo by Will Steinfeld/New Hampshire Bulletin)The New Hampshire House passed a bill Wednesday allowing voters to request that their ballot be hand-counted by cities and towns, even if their polling place uses machine counting.
House Bill 154 would allow any voter to make that request to a poll worker; if they did so, town election officials would be required to deposit the ballot in an “auxiliary compartment” of the ballot-counting machine to be hand-counted after the polls closed.  
The legislation comes amid a conservative movement against the use of voting tabulators in recent years. It also comes months after the state Supreme Court ruled that New Hampshire voters do not have a right to have their ballots counted by hand in towns that use machines.
The plaintiff in that case, Daniel Richard, had argued that towns did not have the authority to require voting machines under the New Hampshire Constitution and that it created an unequal voting process when compared to towns that hand count. The court ruled that the state constitution does not require hand-counting, but remanded the case down to Rockingham County Superior Court. 
HB 154 passed on the House floor in a contested voice vote with no discussion. But during a vote in the House Election Law Committee, Republicans said the vote was meant to give voters the ability to cast their ballots the way they wanted to.
Some opponents, who included Democrats, said the bill could slow down the voting process on election day.
“More people are going to ask for it, it’s going to delay the counting of votes, and hand-counting has been shown to be less accurate than machine counting,” said Rep. Connie Lane, a Concord Democrat, during the committee’s executive session.
Others, including House Election Law Committee Chairman Ross Berry, a Weare Republican, said they supported giving voters the choice but advised voters to consider whether they wanted their ballots hand-counted in the first place.
“I will issue a word of caution: When you do this, when you exercise this … you’re saying, I want somebody who’s been up for 16 hours straight to pull out my ballot and read it amongst other ballots that are either put in that bin or had errors,” Berry said. “My experience in the recounts shows that the machines are far more accurate than the people.”
Berry added that he hoped the bill, if it became law, would discourage a recent trend in which anti-voting machine advocates force towns to count their ballots by hand by intentionally overvoting — filling in too many bubbles for a specific race — so that the machine rejects the ballot and it must be hand-counted anyway. 
The House also killed a number of election-related bills proposed by Democrats Thursday. 
One, House Bill 600, would have enabled cities to choose to hold elections using ranked-choice voting, a process in which voters list candidates in order of preference, and second and third choices are factored in if a candidate does not receive at least 50 percent of the vote. Advocates for that system say it eliminates the potential for politicians to be elected with a plurality of votes and encourages candidates to court their opponent’s voters, discouraging partisanship. But Republicans said the system is confusing, can be time consuming for election officials, and is not needed.
The House rejected a constitutional amendment, CACR 2, which would have barred the Legislature from drawing districts every 10 years in a way “that favors or disfavors any political party or candidate.” Republicans said the addition would just allow the redistricting process to fall into the hands of courts, and that the current process is inherently political.
And the House voted down House Bill 175, a proposed campaign finance law that would have barred candidates from coordinating their campaign’s expenditures with the expenditures of political action committees. That practice is prohibited in federal elections by federal law, but is possible in state law.
Rep. Travis Toner, a Belmont Republican, said the law could unfairly punish political action committees that simply share the same messaging goals as candidates, and noted it would not prevent coordination with unions. And he defended the increasing prominence of political action committees in state elections, including the gubernatorial race. 
“The majority of the committee believes that political action committees (PACs) who collect money from everyday citizens of New Hampshire along with large and small businesses enable the voices of the state to be heard on a larger scale,” Toner wrote in an explanation in the House calendar ahead of the vote.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/warnervotes-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

Alabama officials argued in a motion to dismiss that professors, students and the NAACP lack standing to sue. (Will McLelland/Alabama Reflector)Alabama officials have filed motions seeking to dismiss a lawsuit challenging SB 129, a law that limits diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in public universities and the teaching of so-called “divisive concepts.”
The Alabama Attorney General’s office and members of the University of Alabama (UA) Board of Trustees argue that the University of Alabama professors and University of Alabama Birmingham students suing to overturn the law lack standing and that their claims fail to establish any constitutional violations.
The plaintiffs, who also include the Alabama NAACP, allege that SB 129, sponsored by Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the First Amendment. Plaintiffs argue that the law discriminates against minority students and faculty by restricting funding for student groups and eliminating campus spaces designed to support minority students.
The attorney general’s office claims plaintiffs “fail to show how each and every provision of the Act harms them,” arguing that plaintiffs “fail to include sufficient allegations to ‘nudge their claim across the line from conceivable to plausible.’”
The Board of Trustees stated in a separate motion that the law does not prevent discussions on race but prohibits faculty from requiring students to adopt specific perspectives.
“As it relates to the classroom, SB 129 states that professors may not ‘direct or compel’ students ‘to personally affirm, adopt, or adhere’ to one of eight ‘divisive concepts’ defined in the statute,” the motion states.

The law, which took effect last October, bars public universities from funding DEI programs and prevents discussions of concepts lawmakers deem divisive. It includes prohibitions against “compelling” students to believe that any race is inherently superior or that people are responsible for historical injustices committed by others of the same race.
UAB students, UA professors sue Alabama over state law banning DEI programs

Ahead of SB 129’s enforcement, universities across the state shuttered or rebranded DEI offices and closed dedicated campus spaces for its Black Student Union and LGBTQ+ resource center.
Plaintiffs argued that the law’s impact disproportionately affects minority students by restricting funding for student organizations such as the University of Alabama NAACP chapter. Attorneys for the board argued that the plaintiffs’ allegations “do not involve any claim that Black students were treated differently from other students.”
“Plaintiffs instead rely on the precarious assumption that coursework related to diversity benefits Black students ‘in particular,’ because of their race,” the motion further states.
Professor Cassandra Simon, one of the plaintiffs, stated in the lawsuit that she fears discussing racial issues because students have previously expressed feelings of guilt or complicity after watching material on the Civil Rights Movement. Lawyers for the state argue that this does not constitute a First Amendment violation, even if Simon has already faced threats of termination for teaching a class on systemic inequality.
The motion stated that “even construing these allegations as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, Professor Simon’s fear is not objectively reasonable,” saying that simply showing material related to the Civil Rights Movement does not “direct or compel” students to accept the concept or “penalize or discriminate” when students aren’t in agreement. 
“Professor Simon does not have standing to challenge any provision of the Act based on such conduct. The same is true of the other Professors’ allegations regarding their subjective fears that teaching ‘about’ topics could violate the Act,” the motion states.
The defense also pushed back against claims that SB 129 is too vague, arguing that the law is clearly defined.
“Though Plaintiffs may not like its terms, the act is readily understood,” the motion states.
Plaintiffs have until April 18 to respond to the state’s motion.

But the new document does not make clear when or how much pentobarbital was purchased, which would provide context for the cost.
The Indiana Capital Chronicle sued the corrections department Jan. 21 amid a months-long battle to seek taxpayer dollars spent on the execution drug.
Before that, an existing state law was broadly applied by DOC and former Gov. Eric Holcomb’s office to shield details about how the state obtained the drug. The law specifically bars release of the name, address or tax identifier. But cost is not included.
Story continues below.
IDOC Contract redacted – APRA (1)
 
Last month, Gov. Mike Braun’s team indicated a willingness to reverse the previous administration’s reluctance to disclose, saying the governor had “directed his legal team to evaluate how to provide the greatest level of transparency under current law in hopes of resolving the current lawsuit.”
During negotiations, the Indiana Attorney General’s Office — representing DOC — provided the Capital Chronicle with an almost entirely redacted single-page document. Exempted from the black redaction box on the sheet was a sliver of text: “IDOC shall pay the Contractor the sum of nine hundred thousand dollars ($900,000).”
The page appears to originate from the state’s contract with the unknown drug vendor.
The Capital Chronicle is still seeking additional details about the execution drug and dosage amounts.
The latest court response filed Wednesday by state attorneys denies any wrongdoing in shielding information requested by the Capital Chronicle.
Details still sparse
A 2015 fiscal report prepared by Indiana General Assembly found that the average cost of a death penalty trial in the Hoosier State was $385,458 — nearly 10 times more than the cost of trial and appeal for cases in which the prosecution seeks a maximum sentence of life without parole.
Elsewhere, reporting from the Idaho Statesman indicated the state’s corrections department paid $50,000 for 15 grams of pentobarbital in 2023. CBS2 in Idaho further reported that the state paid $100,000 for another three doses of the drug.
Other reporting similarly suggests that five grams of pentobarbital is generally needed for a single execution. 
What is pentobarbital? More questions than answers surround Indiana’s new execution drug.

Single-gram vials of pentobarbital appeared to cost Arizona $1,500 each; the state reportedly paid a total of $1.5 million for 1,500 vials in 2020. Arizona’s execution protocol calls for five grams of the drug.
Utah officials said they paid roughly $200,000 for two doses of pentobarbital in 2024. Both of those doses were used in an execution in August, according to the Utah News Dispatch.
And while Tennessee — much like Indiana — has mostly withheld details about death penalty drugs, The Tennessean reported last week that the Volunteer State likely spent $525,000, at some point since 2017, for an undisclosed amount of pentobarbital.
Corcoran was executed Dec. 18 at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City. He and his legal team allowed a reporter from the Indiana Capital Chronicle to witness the execution at the state prison. No other media were permitted to be present, per state law.
The execution was the first in which Indiana used the one-drug method. Previously, the state used a lethal combination of three substances to induce death.
Holcomb and Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita announced in June 2024 that DOC had acquired pentobarbital, specifically, to carry out executions. 
But prison officials gave few details on the night of Corcoran’s execution; they did not officially confirm that pentobarbital was used. It was also unclear when exactly the execution drug was administered into Corcoran’s left arm, via an IV line that protruded from the execution chamber’s wall.
In court proceedings, legal counsel for Corcoran and other Indiana death row inmates have repeatedly called on the state to make new execution drug protocols available to the public, including the amount of pentobarbital in Indiana’s possession, the drug’s expiration date and details about its potency and sterility.
Experts and advocates note, for example, pentobarbital can expire and should not be used if the drug isn’t stored at a proper temperature.
Many of the documented botched executions in recent years have occurred because the drugs being used had expired, were contaminated, or they were administered “incorrectly,” according to the Death Penalty Information Center. 
Indiana officials have refused to say how much additional pentobarbital the state has in storage or when it’s set to expire.
Other efforts — and executions — still in limbo
A Republican lawmaker attempted earlier in the legislative session to advance bill language to further regulate Indiana’s use of execution drugs, but his efforts have so far proven to be unsuccessful.
Rep. Bob Morris, R-Fort Wayne, originally filed House Bill 1030, which sought to abolish the death penalty altogether in Indiana. He later discussed plans to scale back the bill — and instead focus on execution drug rules and witness guidelines — hoping that a narrowed proposal could give it a better chance at advancing through the legislative process.

Morris’ bill never received a committee hearing in the House, though, effectively killing the measure.
Separately, an amendment Morris offered on a separate bill sought to require that Indiana State Police test pentobarbital between 12 and 24 hours before an execution to ensure the substance is “100% effective” before it’s administered. But that proposal never moved, either.
Death sentences for Indiana’s seven other death row inmates are still pending.
One of those men, Benjamin Ritchie, could be on deck. Rokita filed a motion with the state’s high court last fall requesting an execution date be set for the death row inmate, who was convicted in 2002 for killing a law enforcement officer from Beech Grove.
Ritchie has exhausted his appeals. Indiana’s high court justices have yet to grant the state’s request or set an execution date.
Two other men on death row have also exhausted their appeals, leaving four others with some recourse.

Last week the Senate passed its version of the same measure unanimously, and meaningful differences remain between the two bills. But in terms of broad strokes, it appears lawmakers have a plan.
Under the changes, new power plants will get generous tax breaks, and the major power companies in the monopoly distribution market won’t be allowed to participate. Those so-called pole-and-wire companies will also see significant changes to the way they set rates.

In exchange for a longer rate-setting horizon and a shortened regulatory timeline, a broad class of energy bill surcharges known as riders will disappear. In some cases, energy companies relied on those programs to avoid opening their books to state regulators for more than a decade.
Perhaps most notable, the roundly criticized legacy generation rider that props up a pair of aging coal plants will be repealed. The surcharge was part of 2019’s Ohio House Bill 6 and it has cost Ohio ratepayers close to half a billion dollars already.

OVEC’s last gasp?
But in the House Energy Committee, one lawmaker argued to keep the coal plant charges in the bill. State Rep. Monica Robb Blasdel, R-Columbiana, said that maintaining the rider through the end of 2026 would provide the Ohio Valley Energy Corporation companies a glide path.
“This amendment proposes a reasonable and responsible course of action,” she insisted, “preserving Ohio’s reputation as a trustworthy and stable place to do business.”
Rep. Andrea White, R-Kettering, echoed that point, warning “an immediate repeal would signal agreements made with the state can be rescinded without warning or transition, and that message would have potential ripple effects far beyond the energy sector.”
Rep. Sean Brennan, D-Parma, pushed back strongly, arguing “Let’s make the glide path the governor’s signature.”
“If you feel that (the OVEC rider) is needed, make the case for it in a separate bill, and let’s see if you can get that passed in this General Assembly,” he said. “I’ve suggested that to folks behind the scenes, and they’ve told me that bill will never pass.”
Ohio Senate committee unanimously advances energy overhaul

The coal plant bailout has been an object of scorn among Democrats for years, but repeated efforts to repeal the rider have gone nowhere in the GOP-supermajority General Assembly. But surprisingly, the idea of extending the rider did get some Democratic support in committee.
Rep. Latyna Humphrey, D-Columbus, argued that eliminating the charges wouldn’t end up hurting the utilities’ bottom line — they’d just write off the loss — and that gap would eventually get passed along to ratepayers.
It echoes a point made by AEP Ohio in testimony before the Senate Energy committee. Frank Strigari, an AEP vice president, called the repeal “draconian” and warned it would result in a $52 million write off of unrecovered costs that would drive up costs for consumers.
“I represent the poorest House district in Franklin County,” Humphrey said, “and my constituents cannot afford to take on this burden.”
Prior to the vote, Committee chair state Rep. Adam Holmes, R-Nashport, took a moment weigh in and reference the committee’s mission statement.
“I’m sure you have it tattooed on your chest,” he joked, before describing point-by-point how maintaining the rider would go against the committee’s stated goals.
In particular, he referenced White’s point that another year of the OVEC rider would cost ratepayers $27.
“Everybody pays it,” he said. “What does that mean to some of those folks that are living in North Olmsted or in Appalachia? Could they use $27?”
“And what do they get for the money?” he added. “Do they get more electricity? Better electricity? That money is not spent on improving the OVEC plans, it goes to the bottom line of the companies for their multi state businesses.”

When the amendment was put to a vote, it failed 17 to 7. And after the hearing, Holmes acknowledged they’d dodged a bullet.
“If it had gotten in, we would not have voted it out of committee,” he said.
House passage
For his part, Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman dismissed the idea of extending the OVEC rider to soften the blow of it going away. “This is essentially cash directly into the pockets of the utilities that are being serviced,” he said ahead of the House session.
“I think ultimately the question is, why should these things continue?” he said.
On the floor, sponsor Rep. Roy Klopfenstein, R-Haviland, explained the regional electricity grid manager known as PJM “has issued significant warnings that we are heading for an energy shortage crisis across its entire market as soon as 2026.”
“While other states have taken steps to close down generation and restrict new construction,” he argued, “this legislation sends a clear message that Ohio is open for business.”
But on the House floor, a handful of lawmakers took the opportunity to argue again for keeping the OVEC subsidy in place. Rep. Don Jones, R-Freeport, said House Bill 15 is a good bill, “but there’s one provision of it that I just, I can’t walk away from.” Like opponents in the committee hearing, he criticized the measure for “pulling the rug out” on an earlier agreement.
“We need to give these folks a little bit of a glide path or a runway, so to speak, to help them get their business in order,” Jones said.
But the vast majority of lawmakers saw the issue differently.
Instead of worrying about the message that cutting off the OVEC rider might send, Rep. Josh Williams, R-Sylvania Twp., expressed concern about the message sent by not repealing it.
“This industry should understand that when you go behind closed doors and bribe a member of this chamber, including the Speaker, that any deal you guys resolved is going to be null and void,” he insisted.
Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, said that the rider amounts to $1.50 monthly tax on nearly every utility rate payer in the state. Just as Brennan suggested in committee, Stewart said that a clean bill imposing that tax would be dead on arrival.
“I know this because just last year, we rejected a smaller tax increase that would have been added to Ohioans’ electric bills,” he said.
“Folks,” he added, “a tax on Ohioans to bail out a utility company is still a tax.”
Final words
In the end, the measure passed overwhelmingly — 90 votes in favor compared to just three against.
Speaking after the vote, Huffman expressed optimism about sorting out the differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill.
“I think House Bill 15 is a great bill, Senate Bill 2 is also a good bill,” he said. “The differences are slight.”
And he downplayed the utilities’ assertion that losing the OVEC subsidy would wind up raising consumers’ rates.
“That’s easy to say, but hard to prove,” he said, adding “this money (isn’t) going to Lawrence County to help that plant. It goes in Duke’s checking account in Charlotte, North Carolina.”
He said between state regulators on the PUCO, and the fact that the utilities are bringing in billions of dollars across multiple states, it’s dubious to suggest the relatively modest loss of $52 million could be directly tied to rate increases down the road.
Minority Leader Allison Russo applauded the rare example of significant bipartisan legislation.
“There were a couple of times I asked, am I missing something?” she admitted. “You know, this seems generally good — what am I missing?”
But she pushed back on argument made by some lawmakers that repealing the OVEC subsidies will turn the page on the House Bill 6 corruption scandal that has cast a shadow over the statehouse for the past several years.
“The reality is, we have done absolutely nothing to change our ethics laws, our campaign finance laws that really allowed this corruption scandal to happen in the first place,” she argued.
“We have all of the circumstances and the environment still in the General Assembly for any other corruption scandal to happen,” Russo warned.

(Photo via The St. Joe Co.)Florida State University has been given the green light by the state Board of Governors to issue $414 million in bonds to finance a new hospital in Panama City Beach as it brands its presence in Northwest Florida as FSU Health.
The FSU Board of Trustees approved the proposal hours before the Board of Governors gave final approval.
Project planning and design have not been completed but BOG documents show that the project, including design, construction, and equipment for a five-floor, 340,000 square foot facility, are projected to total $328 million. 
The Panama City Beach hospital will initially open with 80 beds and four operating rooms to support orthopedic surgery, otolaryngology, gynecology, and general surgery. FSU Health in Panama City’s footprint will eventually be able to accommodate up to 600 beds.
The hospital will be  built on an undeveloped 18-acre parcel of land donated by The St. Joe Co. adjacent to a new urgent care facility that Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare built called TMH Physician Partners and Urgent Care facility. 
Documents show FSU intends to enter into a long-term lease and management agreement with TMH to manage day-to-day operations. TMH will make lease payments to FSU in an amount greater than or equal to the annual debt service of the bonds.
The approval comes as FSU and TMH, which have been operating under a memo of understanding, are at odds over the future of a City of Tallahassee-owned hospital and whether it should be transitioned into an academic teaching institution as part of FSU or continue to be run by TMH, which has a long term-lease with the city to manage the facility.
Offense taken
Hospital administrator and Board of Governors member Alan Levine said he normally doesn’t involve himself in local disputes but took offense at TMH CEO Mark O’Bryant’s comments to the local newspaper about the dispute.

O’Bryant told  the Tallahassee Democrat that TMH is community-based and that its board comprises local residents. By contrast, he said, FSU is governed by an appointed board whose members are not local. 
When asked whether FSU was trying to emulate the University of Florida, which operates its health care facilities in Gainesville and Jacksonville under the UF Health moniker, O’Bryant told the paper:  “I’m not sure that’s the model you want. They don’t really focus as much on the local community over there because they have a different mission. Their mission is for more academic research. So if you think about the whole population, people should be concerned.”
Levine, who is chairman, president, and CEO of Ballad Health, said he “takes great offense to that comment.”
Levine told the BOG he compared charity and Medicaid care between UF Health and TMH and discovered that UF has three times as many Medicaid patients as TMH, with a 15% caseload versus 5%, respectively. Additionally, UF Health offers a financial assistance policy to provide charity care to people who earn 200% or less of the federal poverty level. TMH’s financial assistance policy is set at 150% of the FPL.
“I don’t think it’s fair. If you were to go to Jacksonville or go to Gainesville and ask people whether or not our academic medical center cares about the local community and that’s not  what drives decisions they make, then you don’t know much about academic medical centers,” Levine said. 
He called O’Bryant’s comments “uneducated” and said, “I do think something strong needs to be said to respond to that.”
Levine offered this unsolicited advice: “FSU gets to decide who it partners are but I would strongly encourage their partner here in Tallahassee to rethink their position on that because it’s not true.”

,DC,2025-03-26 19:54:22+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"'Signalgate' group chat revealed precise attack timeline, surveillance of target","Jacob Fischler, Jennifer Shutt",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/signalgate-group-chat-revealed-precise-attack-timeline-surveillance-target,,"WASHINGTON — The now-famous group chat made up of high-ranking Trump administration national security officials and a journalist included a precise timeline of U.S. bombing of Houthi targets in Yemen, and revealed one of the targets of the attack was under surveillance, according to a release of the entire text chain The Atlantic published Wednesday.Despite the newly revealed details of the leaked chat, administration officials, including President Donald Trump himself, continued to downplay the seriousness of the breach, and Republicans in Congress refused to join Democrats in calls for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to step down.Administration officials argued the texts lacked key information and that the “attack plans” revealed in the chat were less damaging than “war plans,” the term Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg used to refer to information he’d decided to withhold for national security reasons. Trump aides also implied the magazine – which has endorsed Trump’s opponent in each of his elections – was spinning the entire episode to discredit the administration.What’s been dubbed “Signalgate” began when The Atlantic on Monday published a stunning account by  Goldberg of his apparently accidental inclusion in a group chat on the messaging app Signal, titled “The Trump Administration Accidentally Texted Me Its War Plans.”The others in the chat were senior administration officials discussing the upcoming war operation.Administration leaders on Tuesday denied, including in testimony before Congress, that the chat contained classified information. The magazine then published a report Wednesday by Goldberg and staff writer Shane Harris that purported to include virtually the entire transcript of the chat until Goldberg’s voluntary exit.The administration position was inconsistent with the screenshots published in The Atlantic of detailed and explicit messages in the chat. At the Capitol, concerns were raised even among the administration’s usually obsequious GOP allies in Congress, with U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker saying the information in the chat should have been classified.“The information as published recently appears to me to be of such a sensitive nature that, based on my knowledge, I would have wanted to classify it,” Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, told reporters on the Hill Wednesday.Attack details revealedIn the initial story, Goldberg reported National Security Advisor Michael Waltz on March 11 added the journalist to a group chat on Signal that included Vice President J.D. Vance, Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Waltz and others.Goldberg in the first story withheld details of the chat that he said could have compromised intelligence-gathering and military operations.But after a day of administration figures claiming the Signal chat did not reveal classified material, while smearing Goldberg, the magazine published the entire thread with one redaction: the name of Ratcliffe’s chief of staff, at the request of a CIA spokesperson.The unredacted messages show Hegseth shared plans of the bombing campaign about 30 minutes before the first planes took off on March 15 and two hours before the start of the window of opportunity for hitting a target.“TEAM UPDATE,” Hegseth wrote in the chat on the day of the strike, according to the Atlantic’s Wednesday story. “TIME NOW (1144et): Weather is FAVORABLE. Just CONFIRMED w/CENTCOM we are a GO for mission launch.”In the same message, Hegseth laid out a timeline of the attack, including confirmation that a target was at his expected location.“Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME,” Hegseth wrote.He also noted that the mission’s operational security was “clean.”Two hours and 15 minutes later, Waltz told the group that bombs had destroyed a building where the Houthi “top missile guy” was thought to be present.“The first target – their top missile guy – we had positive ID of him walking into his girlfriend’s building and it’s now collapsed,” Waltz wrote.Tuesday denials led to publishingAt a previously scheduled U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee hearing Tuesday, Gabbard said that no classified information was discussed in the chat.Trump echoed that message and Hegseth said, “Nobody was texting war plans and that’s all I have to say about that.”White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote on social media:“Here are the facts about his latest story: 1. No ‘war plans’ were discussed. 2. No classified material was sent to the thread. 3. The White House Counsel’s Office has provided guidance on a number of different platforms for President Trump’s top officials to communicate as safely and efficiently as possible.”Gabbard and Ratcliffe told the Senate Intelligence Committee they did not recall specific weapons systems or the timing of the operation being discussed in the chat.But the transcript published by The Atlantic showed Hegseth’s down-to-the-minute timeline of the launch of F-18 aircraft.The denials led to the magazine’s decision to publish the full transcript Wednesday, Goldberg and Harris wrote.“The statements by Hegseth, Gabbard, Ratcliffe, and Trump — combined with the assertions made by numerous administration officials that we are lying about the content of the Signal texts — have led us to believe that people should see the texts in order to reach their own conclusions,” they wrote.“There is a clear public interest in disclosing the sort of information that Trump advisers included in nonsecure communications channels, especially because senior administration figures are attempting to downplay the significance of the messages that were shared.”‘No names. No targets.’But Hegseth and other administration officials continued to deny the growing controversy was serious Wednesday.“So, let’s (sic) me get this straight,” Hegseth wrote on X Wednesday. “The Atlantic released the so-called ‘war plans’ and those ‘plans’ include: No names. No targets. No locations. No units. No routes. No sources. No methods. And no classified information.“Those are some really shitty war plans.”Waltz posted a similar message.“No locations,” he wrote. “No sources & methods. NO WAR PLANS. Foreign partners had already been notified that strikes were imminent. BOTTOM LINE:  President Trump is protecting America and our interests.”White House Counselor Alina Habba told reporters shortly after the second Atlantic story posted on Wednesday morning the issue had been overblown.“We stand by Mike Waltz; he's doing a tremendous job,” she said, according to a White House pool report. “I think this is a distraction.""Bipartisan call for investigationLeading members of Congress, though, were treating the matter with more seriousness.Wicker said he and Armed Services ranking Democrat Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island had agreed on next steps, which included a letter to the administration asking for an expedited inspector general report on the matter.He also said they were requesting “a senior person” come to a secure facility on Capitol Hill to provide a classified briefing to the committee to confirm the reporting was accurate.Asked what the consequence should be for Hegseth if the transcript of the chat was accurate, Wicker took a forgiving tone.“I make a lot of mistakes in my life,” he said. “And I’ve found that it’s best when I just own up to it and say ‘I’m human, I made a mistake.’ And I’m glad in this case no real damage was done. I think that’s probably the approach of the administration right up to the president.”He also said that no targets or specific timing were mentioned.Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a moderate who has voiced criticism of Trump more often than most GOP colleagues, wrote in an X post Wednesday that the incident should be a “wake-up call” to prioritize operational security.“I am appalled by the egregious security breach from top administration officials,” she wrote. “Their disregard for stringent safeguards and secure channels could have compromised a high-stakes operation and put our servicemembers at risk. I hope this serves as a wake-up call that operational security must be a top priority for everyone—especially our leaders.”Dems urge Hegseth’s resignationMany Democrats went further, calling for Hegseth to resign over the use of an unclassified messaging platform to discuss impending military action.Gabbard and others noted the Defense secretary can decide what information is classified to argue that the chat did not include classified information.But critics said whether or not the information was technically classified, its disclosure would put service members at greater risk.“Advance strike times are sensitive and classified because they put American military directly at risk,” Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, wrote on social media Wednesday. “The Secretary of Defense was blasting them out to unknown numbers over unclassified channels. It’s sloppy, careless, and dangerous. He should resign.”Warner spokeswoman Rachel Cohen added that, despite the administration's denials, the information revealed in The Atlantic would compromise intelligence sources and methods.“They can keep repeating this but it’s not true,” she wrote, responding to Hegseth’s post. “Those messages, as released by the Atlantic, are source revealing, and include targeting and weapons information that would have, at the very least, been considered at the ‘secret’ classification level.”The top Democrats in the U.S. House and U.S. Senate, Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, both of New York, also called for Hegseth to lose his job.“The secretary of Defense should be fired immediately if he’s not man enough to own up to his mistakes and resign in disgrace,” Jeffries said on MSNBC Wednesday.“I agree he should be fired,” Schumer told reporters at the Capitol.",,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

House Bill 96 prevents government entities from displaying flags on its properties, with exceptions to: 

The U.S. flag
The official flag of a government entity 
U.S. state flags
Military flags 
POW/MIA flags
Tribe flags 
Country flags to commemorate special occasions
Flags of Idaho colleges, universities and schools

The bill already passed the Idaho House of Representatives in a 53-17 vote. The bill now heads to the governor’s desk where he can sign it, let it become law without his signature or veto it. 
The bill sponsor, Sen. Ben Toews, R-Coeur d’Alene, said the bill “isn’t stifling freedom of speech,” and local and state governments should remain neutral. 
Sen. Jim Woodward, R-Sagle, asked if it would impact Bonners Ferry, a town he represents which flies a Canadian flag at the entrance of the city to welcome Canadian visitors. 
“It’s hard to say if that’s a special occasion, I mean being a border town, I think it is understood as something that’s important, and it does allow for official flags of countries other than the United States,” Toews said. “It’s a little bit of a gray area to be honest.”
Woodward joined three other republicans to vote alongside Democrats against this bill, including Sen. Kevin Cook, R-Idaho Falls; Sen. Dave Lent, R-Idaho Falls; and Sen. Jim Guthrie, R-McCammon. 
Sen. Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, said the bill targets her city and the neighborhood she represents that flies pride flags across Harrison Boulevard in North Boise. 
“I understand that in my neighborhood now, when we want to celebrate and unite under this rainbow flag and support our community, that is going to be taken from us by the state,” she said. “This is two blocks off my street.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)Legislators are trying again to ensure equal treatment for the Mi’kmaq Nation. 
Last session, legislation to provide the Mi’kmaq Nation the same rights to sales tax revenue on its land that the other three tribes of the Wabanaki Nations were granted in 2022 received  favorable committee and floor votes, but got caught up in end-of-session procedural fights and ultimately died without final action when lawmakers adjourned. 
That measure was back before the Taxation Committee on Wednesday with the support of Gov. Janet Mills’ administration.
“This bill addresses a clear gap in state tax law,” said bill sponsor Sen. Rachel Talbot Ross (D-Cumberland).
In 2022, the Legislature revised tax laws for the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation to afford them many of the same tax rules that apply to tribal nations throughout the country. This law also formalized regular dialogue practices between the Wabanaki Nations and the state and established a regulatory framework for sports betting. 
The law ended up looking drastically different than the legislation had first been proposed by Talbot Ross. 
Talbot Ross’ bill originally sought to amend aspects of the 1980 Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act, which has left the Wabanaki Nations with authority more akin to municipalities than sovereign nations, putting them on different footing than all other federally recognized tribes. However, the bill was changed as a result of negotiations between three of the tribes and the governor’s office and overhauling the Settlement Act remains an ongoing battle. 
The Mi’kmaq Nation was not referred to in the Settlement Act and only received federal recognition later in 1991. Last session, the Legislature passed a law known as The Mi’kmaq Nation Restoration Act that put the Tribe on par with the rest of the Wabanaki Nations. 
Talbot Ross’ bill this session, LD 982, co-sponsored by Rep. Daniel Sayre (D-Kennebunk), builds upon this previous work and mirrors the earlier attempt to seek parity for the Mi’kmaq Nation when it comes to tax treatment, which had been proposed by State Treasurer Joseph Perry, then representing Bangor in the Maine House
LD 982 would specifically exempt the Mi’kmaq Nation from state sales and income tax for activities occurring on tribal trust or reservation lands and allow the Tribe to generate sales tax revenues from sales on their own lands — the same rights afforded to the other Wabanaki Nations.
“Allowing the Tribe to retain this revenue will strengthen economic opportunity for its citizens and enable greater reinvestment into the surrounding communities,” Talbot Ross said.
Maulian Bryant, executive director of the Wabanaki Alliance, which was formed in 2020 to advocate for the recognition of Wabanaki sovereignty, said the group supports LD 982. 
“The original bill with the taxation provisions was a very significant, important, impactful restoration of sovereignty for the tribes,” Bryant said, “and we are very happy and hopeful at the prospect of the Mi’kmaq Nation being included in this really great act of parity.”

DemasAs Michigan leaders hammer out a new plan to fund road repairs for Michigan’s decades-long neglected infrastructure, the Citizens Research Council of Michigan argued in a report that, along with additional funding, the distribution system for those funds is in dire need for reform.
Michiganders across the state regard the roads they take each day as the worst roads in the country, the report laments, and they’re not too far off as the council found Michigan ranks 30th in the nation for road funding and 40th for the condition of its roads. 

rpt420-Michigan_Road_Funding_Condition 
But as Michigan House Republicans have cleared a $3.1 billion road funding plan through the chamber, the report found that the state’s sub-par roads are not primarily the result of underfunding. Instead, ensuring those funds are used effectively would yield a positive result in fixing the state’s infrastructure.
“Increasing road funding at this time is likely appropriate for various reasons,” the report said. “However, it would be prudent to evaluate policy options to improve the performance of Michigan’s road program – the ability to utilize given funding to achieve quality system conditions.”
Repealing Michigan’s “obsolete” road funding distribution system under Public Act 51 ought to be a prerequisite to a road repair plan, the report says, not plans focused on increasing funding.
Republicans’ $3.1B road funding plan clears the Michigan House

The state’s current formula for determining funding distribution is “practically impossible to understand or audit” the reports says, and the measures for population and road usage are not conducive to determining the rate of repair needed to maintain local infrastructure.
“Public Act 51 is now 74 years old, past retirement age. In fact, the law was originally envisioned as a 15-year construction program and was scheduled to sunset, but the sunset provision was repealed in 2000 after multiple extensions,” the report says. “It would be imprudent to try to address Michigan’s road infrastructure problems by sending additional funding through PA 51. Additional carve-outs and reallocations would likely just make the law more complicated, not more effective. The inability of Michigan policymakers to replace Act 51 is a decades-long failure.”
Changing the Public Act 51 funding formula is not going to be part of the road repair plan, Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) said during a news conference Wednesday. Reforms to get more funds into local roads will come down the pipeline, but as the Legislature reflects on years of little movement on roads solutions, Hall said the state needs a plan the partisanly split legislature can agree on.
“It’s great that the Citizens Research Council has the academic work that they’ve done, but we’ve got to get real votes. That’s how you put plans together. That’s what we’re doing,” Hall said.

On a party-line vote, the Senate Housing Committee passed House Bill 1217, which would set a 7% limit on annual residential rent increases, with some exceptions.
The bill, one of the most controversial moving through Olympia this legislative session, would also prohibit rent increases during the first year of a tenancy. The rules wouldn’t apply to buildings under 12 years old or those owned by nonprofits or public housing authorities. 
Landlords would also need to give written notice 90 days before a rent increase. The policy would cap move-in fees for manufactured housing, but not rentals.
Tenants or the state attorney general’s office could bring litigation over violations of the proposed law.
The committee had already passed the House bill’s Senate companion last month, but it didn’t advance beyond that. So if lawmakers approve the rent stabilization proposal this year, the House version will have to be the vehicle for enshrining it into law.
Sen. Jesse Salomon, D-Shoreline, who didn’t support the previous bill last month, voted for the version passed Wednesday. 
Opponents say the bill would drive developers out of Washington, hurting the state’s push to increase housing supply. And current landlords wouldn’t be able to keep up with inflationary costs for maintenance, they believe.
Sen. Chris Gildon, R-Puyallup, pointed to another proposal from Senate Democrats to allow an increase in annual property tax from the current 1% cap. 
“I have a real fear for our housing market at large over time should both of those policies come to fruition,” Gildon said.
Supporters, meanwhile, argue the rent legislation would give predictability to tenants who could be forced out of their homes by steep hikes, while still giving room for landlords to impose increases.
“As everyone knows, housing is the single greatest cost in a household budget,” said Sen. Emily Alvarado, D-Seattle. “This bill is a simple guardrail for the many, many people in this state who just want to make sure that they can have a little bit of control in that household budget and plan and save.”
The committee on Wednesday added a 2045 expiration date for the policy, changed the proposed rent cap for manufactured homes from 7% to 5% and required an analysis of the bill’s impacts in 10 years. 
Democrats turned down a Republican amendment to remove the exemption for nonprofits and public housing authorities. 
“If this is a good policy, it should apply to all,” said Sen. Keith Goehner, R-Dryden.
Earlier this month, the measure passed the House on a 53-42 vote, with five Democrats joining Republicans in opposition.
After the vote, Senate Majority Leader Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle, indicated the bill may need changes in his chamber to curry votes. Democrats hold a 30-19 majority in the Senate. The bill would need 25 votes to pass. Already, 18 Democrats had signed on in support and Salomon would make 19.
Pedersen pointed to adjusting the 7% cap or lengthening the 12-year exemption period for new buildings as possible tweaks. 
He also floated the idea that landlords could “bank” the rent increases for future years, meaning that if they forgo part or all of the 7% increase in a given year, they could attach the leftover amount to a future rent hike above the current threshold. 
The bill now heads to the Ways and Means Committee, where a similar bill lapsed last year after passing the House. The measure needs to pass the committee by April 8, or it will likely be considered dead for the year.
If the bill passes the Senate and Gov. Bob Ferguson signs it, the provisions would go into effect immediately. The legislative session is scheduled to adjourn April 27.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Legislature’s budget negotiators abandoned plans to provide enough state funding to remove 320 to 500 people with intellectual or developmental disabilities from waiting lists for services.
The six-person House-Senate conference committee of four Republicans and two Democrats began with the Senate’s plan to reduce the waiting list by creating 500 new slots to people eligible for IDD services. The House’s original position would have delivered 320 additional slots to shorten waiting lists of Kansans who qualified for services, but couldn’t get assistance due to insufficient state investment.
On Tuesday evening, however, the GOP-led budget negotiating committee decided to open up only 200 new slots and allocated $4.25 million in the budget to raising payments to organizations delivering services to people with disabilities.
The budget adjustment would benefit InterHab member organizations involved in IDD services, including Big Lakes Developmental Center in Manhattan, Developmental Services of Northwest Kansas in Hays, Envision in Wichita, Johnson County Developmental Supports, New Beginnings in Chanute or Sunflower Diversified Services in Great Bend.
The IDD provisions were included in a sweeping spending bill subject to an up-or-down vote in the House and Senate with no opportunity for lawmakers to propose amendments to the deal.
Rocky Nichols, executive director of the Disability Rights Center of Kansas, said the Legislature’s maneuver to significantly lower new investment in the IDD waiting list came as a surprise.
Addressing waiting lists in Kansas for services to people with disabilities has been an area of strong bipartisanship. In the current budget year, the Legislature reduced the IDD waiting list by expanding access to 500 more people. Nichols and other activists had urged the Legislature to repeat that action by adding another 500 service slots in next year’s budget.
“We are frankly shocked and dismayed that the budget agreement has fewer slots to reduce the IDD waitlist than either the House or Senate versions of the budget,” Nichols said. “Instead, the agreement inexplicably decided to take money previously earmarked to reduce the IDD waitlist and to divert that money to provide higher reimbursement rates for providers.”
During the past six years, Kansas providers of disability services received $234 million in IDD rate increases and $31 million in funding for specific initiatives to improve IDD services.
In that same period, the state appropriated a total of $41 million to create additional IDD slots and to reduce that waitlist.
“This 11th-hour change in the budget both looks bad and is bad,” Nichols said. “It looks bad because the net effect is that providers will enrich their rates at the expense of Kansans on the waitlist. It is bad because people on waitlists will suffer, families will be forced into crisis, and lives will be lost, all simply to increase provider rates.”
The 2024 Legislature provided funding for 500 slots to shrink the IDD waiting list to no greater than 4,800 people. Under the pending 2025 budget bill, the waitlist could be reduced by 200 slots rather than 320 as envisioned by the House or 500 as proposed by the Senate.
House Speaker Dan Hawkins, R-Wichita, in February praised members of the House Social Services Budget Committee for considering a plan to add 500 new IDD slots for the second consecutive year.
“This committee and the Legislature as a whole are hard at work for our Kansas IDD community,” Hawkins said in a social media post. “This continues our path to lower the waitlist.”
Sara Hart Weir, executive director of the Kansas Council on Developmental Disabilities, said the last-minute budget adjustment would delay completion of a proposed five-year strategy to eliminate the IDD waitlist in Kansas.
She said the Legislature, state agencies, disability organizations and providers should work toward this common goal.
“It’s disappointing that we are pinning Kansans with disabilities against rates for providers,” Hart Weir said. “We should be working together to increase funding for all aspects of the disability system.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/PC150326-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Public concerns about menstrual health data privacy have flared in Virginia since the overturn of federal abortion protections and changes to state laws relating to the procedure. Gov. Glenn Youngkin has helped put some of those fears at bay by signing Senate Bill 754 by Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington. 
Her bill protects reproductive health data, often collected in period tracking digital apps, and allows consumers to sue if their data is sold or released without their consent. 
Governor unleashes veto storm to drown progressive legislation

Favola expressed gratitude to Youngkin in a statement. 
“It should go without saying that when a woman has her period or visits a doctor, it is nobody’s business but her own,” Favola added.
As more pregnant people travel to get abortions outside states where the medical procedure is banned or restricted, some states — including Alabama and Texas — have threatened legal repercussions for people who leave the state for an abortion, and for those who aid them.  Last year Youngkin signed a related bill by Favola to protect menstrual health data from search warrants — roughly a year after many, including former President Joe Biden and talk show host Stephen Colbert,  lambasted the governor for opposing it in a previous legislative session. 
Reproductive health is still a hotly debated topic, particularly among partisan lines, as Virginia weighs a proposed constitutional amendment to enshrine reproductive rights more broadly into the state constitution. This week, Youngkin amended a bill that would have shored up the right to contraception. 
Youngkin’s substitute of the bill reinforces two U.S. Supreme Court cases that deal with access to contraception nationwide, while the right-to-contraception proposal would apply specifically to Virginia if those federal cases should be overturned.
After helping overturn federal abortion protections in 2022, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas expressed interest in revisiting cases that upheld contraception protections. As some states have also explored contraceptive restrictions in recent years, reproductive rights advocates and some lawmakers in Virginia have emphasized the benefit of strengthening state law, should federal protections for contraception also be overturned.
While the measure also cleared the legislature last year, Youngkin sought amendments that the bill’s patrons say “gutted” it because it reinstated the federal court cases for which protection hinges on before he ultimately vetoed it. 
Editor’s note: This story has been corrected to reflect that Youngkin amended, not vetoed, a right to contraception bill from the 2025 General Assembly session.

A bill backed by Republican leadership in the state Senate could soon return the commission to all-white. (Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources photo)The first Black Kentuckian to serve on the board overseeing Kentucky’s fish and wildlife management agency says he’s concerned a bill passed by the Republican-controlled legislature is intended to push him off the board. 
Senate Bill 245, which Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear has vetoed, could apply only to Jerry Ferrell this year because he is the only member up for reappointment to the Kentucky Fish and Wildlife Commission. Ferrell has represented Central Kentucky on the commission since 2021.
The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Brandon Smith, R-Hazard, denied the measure is specifically aimed at Ferrell. 
Beshear in his veto message noted that Ferrell — “the first-ever Black member on the commission” — has yet to be confirmed for reappointment by the GOP-controlled Senate. Beshear criticized SB 245 as “legislative game-playing.”

Currently, Fish and Wildlife Commission members continue to serve until the end of the year if reappointed by the governor without being confirmed by the Senate. SB 245 would change that. 
Senate leadership wanted bill, says sponsor
Smith, who is the chair of a legislative committee that reviews appointments to the commission, told the Lantern earlier this month he doesn’t know Ferrell personally. He said Senate leadership had brought him the bill to fix what was considered to be a “loophole” in the process for appointing the volunteer board overseeing the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources (KDFWR).
But Ferrell sees things differently. Earlier this month, he wrote in a post on Facebook that SB 245 “was drafted specifically to terminate my position” and that he “strived to make impartial decisions” on the commission.
  Sen. Brandon Smith, R-Hazard (LRC Public Information)
“Having grown up in Kentucky, I have always cherished hunting and fishing with my father. However, it appears some Trump supporters are determined to see me removed,” he wrote. “I have maintained positive relationships with everyone, and I fail to understand how political affiliations should be an issue in this context. Could there be an ulterior motive?” 
Ferrell, a registered Democrat, told the Lantern he doesn’t have evidence that links him to the bill, but phone calls he’s had with sportsmen who support his reappointment to the commission have led him to believe social media posts he’s made and shared critical of President Donald Trump could be playing a role in whether he continues to serve on the board. 
He said he loves bass and tournament fishing and wants to continue serving on the board. He believes his personal politics should not be a consideration in his work on the commission. The board by state law is required to be bipartisan in makeup, and commission members aren’t identified by political party.
“Politics has nothing to do with fish and wildlife,” Ferrell said. “I want to see other people see me doing the job that they haven’t seen a Black doing before on the commission. And I’m a proud Black American.”
How SB 245 could impact Ferrell — and only Ferrell — this year
The commission is made up of nine unpaid members who oversee the KDFWR’s budget consisting of tens of millions of dollars in hunting and fishing license fees, boat registration fees, and federal grants. State law directs the commission to keep a “watchful eye” over the department, and the commission controls the employment of the KDFWR’s head executive, Commissioner Rich Storm. 
Each commission member represents a different geographic part of Kentucky. Fellow sportspeople vote for commission nominees in district meetings. A list of the top vote-getters is sent to the governor who selects someone from the list. The Senate then decides whether or not to confirm the governor’s appointments or reappointments. Commission members are allowed to serve two four-year terms. 
Politics swirl around who will oversee Kentucky Fish and Wildlife

That confirmation process has been politically contentious in recent years with the GOP-controlled Senate denying a number of Democrat Beshear’s appointments to the commission. 
Those denials have left vacancies on the commission, leading some sportsmen to accuse Republicans of having “weaponized” the confirmation process against the votes and voices of sportspeople. Republicans have pushed back on that criticism, arguing they need to be able to vet each candidate. At least one Republican senator has considered partisan allegiance in whether to confirm a person to the commission. Sportsmen have said the work of the commission on wildlife issues should largely be apolitical. 
Ferrell was appointed by Beshear in 2021 and confirmed by the Senate in 2022. With Ferrell’s term ending at the end of last year, the KDFWR held a district meeting in November to nominate a replacement. 
Kentucky Senate confirms four of Beshear’s five appointees to Fish and Wildlife board

Ferrell was among the top vote getters, and Beshear issued an executive order on Jan. 20 to reappoint him to a second term expiring at the end of 2028. The executive order also appointed three commission members to their first terms. Ferrell is still serving due to state law allowing commission members to serve an additional year if a replacement has not been appointed and confirmed.
On Feb. 18, the last day for senators to file bills, Smith introduced SB 245, which could impact Ferrell’s time on the board by changing  state law so that if the Senate does not confirm a commission reappointment during a legislative session, then the commission member whose reappointment was denied would have to vacate their seat when the legislature adjourns. 
While the bill would affect reappointments in future years, Ferrell is the only commission member whose reappointment confirmation is pending in the Senate this year. With two days left in this session, no senator has filed a resolution to confirm his reappointment. 
If Ferrell’s reappointment is not confirmed and SB 245 becomes law, Ferrell would have to vacate his seat when the legislature adjourns on Friday. 
A pending board confirmation and veto override
For that to happen, the legislature would have to override Beshear’s veto of SB 245 — an easy task for Republicans who hold a supermajority of legislative seats.
Beshear in his veto message said the bill “is not what the sportsmen and sportswomen of Kentucky deserve.” 
“In the current legislative session, the Senate has yet to confirm the reappointment of the first ever Black member on the Commission, despite his confirmation to the position in 2022 and renomination by the sportsmen and sportswomen,” Beshear wrote. “[T]he Senate’s pattern of denying confirmation of the members they select shows the legislature is deferring to someone besides the sportsmen and sportswomen.”

Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester, after confirming some of Beshear’s appointments to the commission last year, told reporters that protecting KDFWR Commissioner Rich Storm from appointees interested in retaliating against Storm was a priority for senators. Storm and Beshear have previously clashed on issues ranging from Storm’s contract to procurement within the KDFWR. 
When asked about the veto of SB 245, Ferrell’s concerns and whether the Senate would confirm Ferrell’s reappointment, Kentucky Senate Republican Majority Caucus spokesperson Angela Billings wrote in an email: “SB 245 reinforces the Senate’s constitutional power of confirmation.”
In a legislative committee earlier this month, Smith told lawmakers there was a need for “decorum” for people serving on boards and commissions confirmed by the Senate.
Storm over lunch sounds apologetic
“The governor has the ability of appointing through his process the individuals that he feels are most qualified, but because we have to weigh in and confirm them and sort of put our credibility on the line, we want to do a little bit deeper dive into some of the backgrounds and just the criteria we want to find in these positions,” Smith told lawmakers. 
  KDFWR Commissioner Rich Storm speaks to lawmakers in February. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer).
Ferrell worries the prospect of him being removed from the seat is a sign of a broader “culture” against diversity. He said he didn’t attend a quarterly meeting of the Fish and Wildlife Commission last week in part because he was upset about the situation. 
He said he had lunch recently with Storm, the KDFWR commissioner, who encouraged him to attend the quarterly meeting. Ferrell said Storm “kind of apologized” to him “about what was going on,” but Ferrell said Storm was vague about what the apology was for. 
Lisa Jackson, a KDFWR spokesperson, said earlier this month that Storm had no comment on the bill because state law prohibits employees of the department from directly or indirectly influencing the appointment of a commission member. 
“I just couldn’t go down and put that happy face on knowing that I’ve got people that adamantly don’t want me there,” Ferrell said. “Anybody that thinks that minorities don’t hunt or fish is crazy, because there’s a lot of us out there, and we enjoy it just like everybody else does. It’s just the times that we’re in that’s concerning me.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Untitled-design-1024x576.png,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Gov. Kevin Stitt named a new appointment Wednesday to the Oklahoma A&M Board of Regents, the governing board that oversees five colleges and universities, including Oklahoma State University. 
Tracy Poole, of Tulsa, would replace Regent Trudy Milner, who was appointed by former Gov. Mary Fallin. Milner’s term was set to expire April 4, but she resigned effective Feb. 6, an OSU spokesperson said. Her resignation came one day after the regents announced the resignation of former OSU president Kayse Shrum. 
If Poole’s appointment is confirmed by the Oklahoma Senate, Stitt will have appointed, or re-appointed, every current member of the governing board. Milner was the only regent remaining appointed by another governor. 
“I am honored to be appointed by Governor Stitt to serve on the OSU A&M Board of Regents,” Poole said in a statement. “Oklahoma State University played a crucial role in shaping my career, and I look forward to giving back and contributing to its continued success by helping foster innovation, entrepreneurship and academic excellence.”
Poole is the founder and managing partner of FortySix Venture Capital, a Tulsa-based early-stage investment firm, and previously practiced law at McAfee & Taft. 
He is also an “experienced energy professional” who founded an upstream oil and gas producer and served as general counsel to a Chicago-based energy hedge fund, according to a press release. 
A graduate of OSU, Poole serves as an advisory board member for the Riata Center for Entrepreneurship and the Spears College of Business School of Entrepreneurship at the university. 
“Tracy’s business expertise and passion for entrepreneurship are going to make him a great addition to the Regents,” Stitt said in a statement. “As a first-generation college graduate, a successful venture capitalist, and active member of the Oklahoma State community, he understands how higher ed changes lives. He will serve our students and our institutions well.”
Sen. Jo Anna Dossett, D-Tulsa, will carry Poole’s nomination in the Oklahoma Senate. The full chamber must confirm his nomination.

(Photo by Google Earth) A Dubuque hotel recently cited for more than two dozen health-and-safety violations, including bed bugs, cockroaches and hallways strewn with garbage, has been cited for additional violations.
In January, a Dubuque city inspector visited the 98-year-old Canfield Hotel at 36 W. 4th St., Dubuque, and cited the business for 14 regulatory violations — an exceptionally large number for a hotel. Two weeks later, the inspector returned and cited the hotel for 12 additional violations.
State records show the inspector, Tim Link, returned to the hotel on March 18 and cited the business for many of the same violations found earlier in the year, including worn carpet, damaged walls, broken window glass, dirty bathrooms, “a large amount of pest-control powder” behind a guest-room bed, peeling paint and several areas that were in need of a “thorough cleaning.”
“Pest control has treated entire premises once and will return,” Link wrote in his report. “Repairs of hallway walls has started, staff are removing garbage regularly. In speaking with owner by phone, he stated he plans to hire housekeeping staff.”

It’s not clear what the next steps are for the city. Link said Tuesday the hotel staff has made progress addressing some of the violations, but added that “I’m not done with them.”
Among the problems reported by Link in January and February were “infested rooms” that had not been adequately treated to eliminate infestations of roaches and bed bugs. Litter and garbage had accumulated in some of the hallways and guest rooms.
At that time, Link also indicated the Canfield Hotel had guests registered for weekly, biweekly and monthly stays — and he noted that those individuals were not receiving linen service or housekeeping services as required by regulations. The draperies in “many rooms” were reported to be visibly dirty, and the bedding for guest rooms was “not maintained clean,” Link stated in his report.
‘The guy is a real tool bag. Don’t answer your phone…’
On Feb. 24, the Iowa Capital Dispatch formally requested access to the city’s copies of its 2025 inspection reports, as well as all attachments and photos, that pertain to the Canfield Hotel.
In response, the city provided a Word document listing the violations found during the January inspection. It also sent the Capital Dispatch a link to access the requested photos, but the link indicates the photos are currently password protected.
The same day the Capital Dispatch made its record request, it called the Dubuque city health department to speak to Public Health Director Mary Rose Corrigan about enforcement efforts at the Canfield Hotel.
Administrative Assistant Connie Mueller said Corrigan was in a meeting and took a message. When Corrigan didn’t call back, the Capital Dispatch contacted Mueller and asked for Corrigan’s cell phone number, which Mueller eventually provided.
City records obtained through the Iowa Open Records Law show Mueller then texted Corrigan to complain she had been “bamboozled” by the reporter.
“He wanted to speak to you,” Mueller texted. “I said you were gone. He wanted your cell number and I told him no and he said if it’s a city-issued device that was public information. The guy is a real tool bag. Don’t answer your phone if (the reporter’s phone number) comes in on it.”
Corrigan responded: “He called me but I didn’t answer — he left a voice mail.”
Corrigan has not responded to subsequent calls from the Capital Dispatch.
State changes law to legalize less frequent inspections
In 2022, the Iowa Capital Dispatch reported that the Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing acknowledged that for the previous eight years, it had violated a law requiring the routine inspection of Iowa’s hotels and motels.
By law, the agency had been required to inspect all hotels within its jurisdiction at least once every two years. The department was instead conducting preopening inspections and complaint investigations, and any others were based on an agency risk assessment.
Last year, the Iowa Legislature approved, and the governor signed into law, legislation that codified the department’s long-standing practice. The bill repealed the requirement for biennial inspections at all hotels. Under current law, Iowa’s hotel and motel inspections are to be conducted “upon receipt of a verified complaint signed by a guest of a hotel.”

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Lawyers for the federal government argued in a court filing this week that the petition challenging the detainment of immigration rights activist Jeanette Vizguerra should be heard in the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, not the district court where a hearing is scheduled for Friday.
At the same time, they defended the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s ability to deport Vizguerra based on a 2013 removal order. ICE confirmed their intention to deport Vizguerra last week.
Vizguerra was arrested during a break from her job at Target on March 17 and has been in ICE custody at an Aurora detention facility since. Her lawyer immediately filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in district court and the court of appeals.
It was U.S. District Judge Nina Wang who ordered that ICE not deport Vizguerra before a hearing and while the court considers the legal arguments.
Federal prosecutors, however, think the district court does not have jurisdiction over the case and it should instead be the purview of the appeals court, citing precedent from other immigration cases and the fact Vizguerra’s lawyer simultaneously filed the petition in the appeals court.
“The fact that Petitioner did file the (petition for further review) with the Tenth Circuit — and the arguments she presents in that court — reinforce the conclusion that the Tenth Circuit, and not this Court, should consider Petitioner’s challenge,” they wrote in a court filing obtained Tuesday evening by Colorado Newsline.
It is not efficient or correct for two federal courts to adjudicate the same claims, they argued.
Lawyers also wrote that the 2013 order of removal that Vizguerra’s arrest was based on is still valid. Her multiple stays of removal, the last of which expired in February 2024, relied on that order.
“In practice, the many years since the 2013 Reinstatement Order was entered, both Petitioner and ICE have acted on the understanding that an order of removal exists. Petitioner repeatedly sought — and often received — stays of removal pursuant to the 2013 Reinstatement Order,” they wrote.
Vizguerra, who came to the country from Mexico in 1997, was originally convicted in 2009 of having a fake Social Security number. An immigration court began her removal proceedings and offered her a voluntary departure in 2011, with the understanding that Vizguerra would leave the country within 60 days.
She filed an appeal to that order, but left the country to see her dying mother in 2012 while the appeal was pending, which the government said essentially constituted a withdrawal of the appeal. Vizguerra reentered the United States in 2013 and was detained between April and June before being released under an order of supervision. The previous removal order was then reinstated in July ahead of her first required check-in with the ICE office in Centennial. Her lawyer at the time chose not to submit a response to that reinstatement.
Vizguerra has remained in the United States since then due to a series of approved stays of removal and by seeking sanctuary in two Denver churches, which made her a national figure on the issue.
Her lawyers argued in their petition that the 2013 reinstated order ran afoul of proper process because ICE signed the order before alerting Vizguerra of its existence and her right to object to it before it became final. Additionally, they say, the 2011 grant of voluntary departure was not the same as a removal order and therefore could not be reinstated.
The government disagrees.
“The fact that the 2011 order of removal granted Petitioner the opportunity to voluntarily depart within 60 days in lieu of being removed did not negate its status as a removal order subject to reinstatement,” they wrote.
Vizguerra’s lawyer did not immediately return a request for comment. Her hearing is scheduled for 1:30 p.m. on Friday.

(Contributed photo)Retired Rhode Island Chief Judge Frank Caprio, who gained fame as a mild-mannered dispenser of justice on the internet, will be the commencement speaker at Providence College this year, the school announced Wednesday.  
Caprio, 88, served for 38 years in the Providence Municipal Court where his public profile rose from starring in the Emmy-nominated “Caught in Providence,” which began airing locally in 2000. The series featured Caprio ruling on cases like traffic or parking violations in a gentle way.
Providence College is the first Rhode island higher education institution to announce its commencement speaker for the 2025 graduation season. The commencement ceremony is scheduled for Sunday, May 18, at 11 a.m. at the Amica Mutual Pavilion in Providence. 
Caprio, who retired in 2023, has more than 26 million followers across different social media platforms, according to a PC news release, and his videos have over 10 billion views collectively. 
He has 2 million followers on both Facebook and Instagram. 
The son of Italian immigrants, Caprio was educated at Providence’s Central High School, where his talents in scholastic wrestling won him the state championship in 1953. Caprio worked three jobs to finance his studies at Providence College, where he earned his bachelor’s degree before going to teach classes in American government at Hope High School. 
While working as a teacher, Caprio went on to Suffolk University School of Law to earn his law degree, and began presiding over Providence courts in 1985. Caprio has been awarded two Honorary Doctorates of Law: one from Suffolk in 1991, and another from PC in 2008. The University of Rhode Island gave him an Honorary Doctorate of Public Service in 2016.    
Caprio previously chaired the Rhode Island Board of Governors for Higher Education, which in 2014 was consolidated into the Rhode Island Board of Education. The current equivalent of the Board of Governors is the Council on Postsecondary Education, and it oversees decision making for the state’s three public institutions of higher learning: the University of Rhode Island, Rhode Island College and the Community College of Rhode Island. He also served on the Providence City Council from 1962 to 1968, and was inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame of 2019.

(Department of Labor)Child labor violations have increased significantly in Minnesota — and across the country — in recent years as a tight labor market has coincided with a surge in unaccompanied migrant children.
The number of underage workers found to be employed in violation of child labor laws increased nearly fivefold in the United States and more than twofold in Minnesota from 2015 to 2023, according to a new report from the left-leaning think tank North Star Policy Action.
The reports’ authors tallied 81 minors involved in federal child labor violations in 2023 in Minnesota, up from 66 in 2022 and 33 in 2021. They did not include violations found by state labor regulators.
One-third of the minors counted in 2022 came from just one case where investigators found children employed by Packers Sanitation Services cleaning hazardous equipment during overnight shifts at the JBS plant in Worthington, the Turkey Valley Farms plant in Marshall and the Buckhead Meat plant in St. Cloud. Altogether, federal regulators found the sanitation contractor illegally employed at least 102 minors as young as 13 years old across the country, three of whom were injured on the job.
The violations are surely an undercount of the extent of the problem — like how police only pull over a fraction of drivers who speed. In the same way, drawing conclusions about the prevalence of illegal child labor from violation data is difficult. An increase in citations could be caused by more violations, more investigations, or both.

The report’s authors, North Star Policy Action Research Director Aaron Rosenthal and Economic Policy Institute analyst Nina Mast, acknowledge the increase in citations could be from heightened enforcement. But they also point to larger economic factors at play that make an increase in child labor likely, such as the chronic labor shortage and influx of underage migrants who likely know little about their rights and have a strong financial incentive not to assert them.
One study cited in the report found a state’s child labor violations increase 10% for every 1% increase in unaccompanied minors. Minnesota has seen a surge in unaccompanied minors since 2021, largely in rural counties near slaughterhouses where they’ve been found working overnights in dangerous jobs.
The authors point out that if the rise in violations is just a reflection of increased enforcement, then the findings justify even greater investment in enforcement since the more the government looks for child labor, the more it finds.
They also note that the U.S. Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division reached a 50-year low in investigator staffing, meaning any increased enforcement of child labor comes at the expense of other important worker protection cases.
The New York Times exposed the vast exploitation of migrant children at factories making name brand products for corporations like General Mills and Frito-Lay. In their effort to quickly move kids out of immigration facilities, the Biden administration and federal agencies ignored warnings that migrant children were working grueling jobs.
North Star Policy Action recommends that Minnesota lawmakers bolster labor protections for children by aligning state and federal law. For instance, Minnesota allows 14 and 15-year-olds to work in some hazardous jobs and later hours than are permitted under federal laws.
They argue this is particularly important given the potential for the Trump administration to roll back child labor laws, with Project 2025 calling for the Department of Labor to permit teenagers to work in hazardous jobs with parental consent.
The organization also advocates for the state to fund more inspectors to bolster enforcement of violations, block government contracts from going to companies with repeated child labor violations and create a youth work permit system that increases parental and employer awareness of child labor laws.
Despite the rise in child labor violations and media attention, Republicans in a number of states have moved to loosen child labor laws, arguing teenagers can benefit from the work experience while also expanding the labor pool.
In 2023, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds signed a law conflicting with federal standards that allows 14- and 15-year-olds to work later shifts and 16- and 17-year-olds to work in roofing, demolition and excavation as part of employer training. The law also allows teens over 16 to sell and serve alcohol.
In Minnesota, state Sen. Rich Draheim, R-Madison Lake, introduced a bill in 2023 to allow 16- and 17-year-olds to work in and around construction sites. It did not gain traction in the Democratic-controlled Legislature.
Florida lawmakers are now weighing a bill that would eliminate restrictions on 16- and 17-year-olds from working before 6:30 a.m. or after 11 p.m., while Gov. Ron DeSantis recently suggested the state’s resorts don’t need immigrants when they can hire teenagers.
North Star Policy Action said work opportunities are important for teenagers to gain experience and earn money, but warned against allowing teens to work jobs that could compromise their health and safety. Three teenagers died working in industrial jobs in the summer of 2023 alone.
“Without proper safeguards in place, however, these opportunities can quickly turn into harmful situations that jeopardize a child’s health, disrupt their education, and undermine their future potential and career prospects,” the authors write.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Picture2-e1693716525998.png,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

The House approved House Bill 528 during Wednesday’s voting session as part of the consent agenda through a voice vote. If enacted, the bill would reduce the penalty for people 21 and older who obtain, purchase, transport, possess, or use psilocybin in New Hampshire from a felony to a simple violation with a small fine and no jail time. On first offense, someone caught with psilocybin could face a fine of up to $100 under this bill; on second offense that rises to $500, and for third-time offenders it could be up to $1,000. Second or third offenses would also rise from a violation to a misdemeanor under this bill.
The drug is currently illegal in New Hampshire under the Controlled Drug Act. Originally the bill’s proponents, including its sponsor Deerfield Republican Rep. Kevin Verville, called for psilocybin to be legalized entirely for people 21 and older. However, the House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee ultimately amended the proposal to simply lessen the punishment.
Earlier this month, the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee voted unanimously in favor of the bill. The legislation still must be approved by both the Senate and governor before it can become law.
“Not only is this not really a dangerous drug, but it also has medicinal benefits that people are unable to take advantage of currently because of its classification under the Controlled Drug Act,” Rep. Alissandra Murray, a Manchester Democrat, said during the committee’s March 7 meeting. “While entirely removing it might be too big a step for this Legislature to take right now, I think this is a good compromise to start with.”
In 2019, psilocybin was outlawed in all 50 U.S. states. However, Oregon became the first state to legalize the drug in 2020. Colorado also legalized it in 2022. It is still illegal in the remaining 48 states. Cannabis is another recreational drug that has seen even more growing acceptance as of late. ​​Cannabis is now legal for medicinal purposes in 39 U.S. states and for recreational use in 24 after once being illegal across the entire country. In New Hampshire, it is still illegal for recreational use. However, it is decriminalized and legal for medicinal purposes. Verville has sponsored another bill, House Bill 75, that would legalize recreational cannabis.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/shrooms-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Courtesy of Idaho governor's office)Idaho Gov. Brad Little signed into law a bill that cuts property taxes and bolsters school districts’ bond issues and levies.
Joined by Idaho Republican legislative leaders at a livestreamed news conference in a Boise neighborhood on Wednesday, Little signed House Bill 304 into law.
The new law reduces Idaho’s state tax revenue by $100 million every year, shifting funds in two ways:

It transfers $50 million to a state fund to reduce property taxes for Idaho homeowners.
And it sends another $50 million to a state fund that helps pay off school districts’ bond issues and levies. 

Little called the bill a “win-win,” saying it builds on $4.6 billion in recent tax relief by the Legislature and Idaho’s “historic public education investments.” 
“America wants what Idaho has: safe communities, strong schools, a bustling economy that offers tremendous opportunities for our people to prosper,” Little said at the news conference. “I’m proud to join the dedicated leaders in the House and Senate for the signing of this important bill.”
The average Idahoan homeowner should see property taxes reduced by 14.6%, said Sen. Scott Grow, R-Eagle, who co-chairs the Legislature’s powerful budget committee. 
Senate President Pro Tempore Kelly Anthon, R-Rupert, said when he came to the Legislature, he told his constituents he’d see if every bill he looked at is good for the Idaho family. And that’s true for this bill, he said. 
“We’re seeing taxes cut historically this year in the Idaho Legislature,” Anthon said. “… These are things that really impact people’s lives.”

 Idaho Legislature enacts $403 million in tax cuts, reducing the state’s general fund revenue

The bill is the third major tax cut bill the Idaho Legislature passed this year, totalling $403 million in annual reductions to Idaho’s state revenue. 

House Bill 40 reduces the corporate and individual income tax rates from 5.695% to 5.3% and reduces state revenue by $253 million per year. When Little signed the bill, the governor’s office described the bill as the largest income tax cut in state history.
House Bill 231 increases the grocery tax credit used to offset the sales tax Idahoans pay on food to $155 per year. To increase the grocery tax credit, House Bill 231 reduces state revenue by $50 million every year.

Another new law this year, House Bill 93, provides a refundable tax credit for education expenses for families, including tuition at private, religious schools. That bill reduces revenue by $50 million – bringing total revenue reductions from those four bills to $453 million.
In February, Little told reporters he was concerned by the amount of revenue that will be reduced by the three major tax cuts and the education tax credit. In his State of the State address in January, Little called for $100 million in tax cuts. 
“If I would have thought we could do $450 (million), I would have proposed $450 (million),” Little said Feb. 25.
Asked on Wednesday if he had concerns there were too many tax cuts this legislative session, Little replied “we’ll see.”
And he referenced praise from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who visited Idaho earlier this week.
“He made the point that Florida is doing great. But the only state doing better than Florida is Idaho,” Little said. “And as long as we keep growing our gross domestic product. … We’ll need to watch it. We’ll need to be vigilant.”
House Bill 304, the property tax cut bill, takes effect immediately through an emergency clause. The Idaho Legislature unanimously passed the bill in the House and Senate.

Eric Wimberger (R-Oconto) and Rep. Joy Goeben (R-Hobart) heard concerns about potential Medicaid cuts and gambling at a listening session Monday in Oneida, Wis. 
A woman at the session said her son receives Medicaid through the Katie Beckett program, which serves children under 19 who live at home and have certain health care needs. She said that “with the $880 billion that is going to be reduced in the federal budget, it is without a doubt going to impact Medicaid in our state.” 
A budget proposal approved by the House in late February requires lawmakers to cut spending to offset tax breaks, likely requiring Medicaid cuts, KFF Health News reported. The committee that oversees spending on Medicaid and Medicare is instructed to cut $880 billion over the next decade.
The Congressional Budget Office found House Republicans’ budget goals would require cuts to Medicaid, CBS News reported on March 6. 
The woman said she’s wondering what’s happening in the state budget to “plan for these shortcomings that are going to be coming from the federal level.” 
“I don’t know on the federal side, what’s going on there,” Wimberger said. “…I can’t imagine that we’d let any sort of tragedy happen to people who—if there’s a cut of any kind, so we’ll have to adjust to it.”
Medicaid is funded by both federal and state governments. Proposals that would reduce the amount of money paid by the federal government would not require states to pay more to make up the difference, and most states will not likely increase their health care spending, according to an opinion article by the president of the health policy research and news outlet KFF.  
Wimberger is a member of the state Legislature’s Joint Committee on Finance, which is responsible for reviewing state appropriations and revenues. The committee will hold listening sessions on April 2 in Kaukauna, April 4 in West Allis, April 28 in Hayward and April 29 in Wausau.
Oneida Nation requests anti-gambling efforts, grant funding
Brandon Stevens, the vice-chairman of the Oneida Nation in northeast Wisconsin, spoke at the listening session. One topic discussed was online and in-person gambling. 
In Wisconsin, tribes have the exclusive right to operate Class III games, through compacts with the state. Class III includes banking card games, electronic games of chance, including slot machines and, generally, high-stakes, casino-style games. 
Tana Aguirre from the Oneida Nation’s intergovernmental affairs and communications office sent the Examiner a statement that covers a few of the tribe’s budget priorities. 
The Oneida Nation is requesting an increase in funding to help address illegal/unregulated gambling activities, according to Aguirre. The tribe requests compliance and/or enforcement measures “to help deal with illegal gambling machines and practices throughout Wisconsin.” 
“We’re paying a premium for exclusivity through the gaming compact [between the tribe and the state]. It’s basically a violation of the compact if they’re allowed to game at a particular level,” Stevens said. 
  Rep. Joy Goeben (R-Hobart)
Aguirre said the Oneida Nation and other tribes want to see increased funding for a tribal elderly transportation grant program. The grant gives the state’s 11 federally recognized tribes financial assistance for transportation services for tribal elders on and off the reservation. 
The Oneida Nation also wants funding to go toward an intergovernmental training program, Aguirre said. 
The program “is meant to enhance the skill set and understanding between state and tribal officials.” It aims to promote the different governments engaging in “meaningful and productive” consultations and discussions. 
Aguirre said that for the items included in his email, the tribe is requesting that funding come from Oneida Nation gaming revenue that the state of Wisconsin receives.
Tribes submit gaming-related payments to the state. A variety of state programs receive state funding from tribal payments, such as gaming regulation in the Department of Administration and law enforcement in the Department of Justice.

""Even if you have a green light, sometimes you have to look both ways and wait, how it is here,"" he said. (Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)Starting on July 1, people riding bicycles in New Mexico will be able to ride through stop signs without coming to a full stop, and stop at red traffic lights and continue even if the light hasn’t turned green — as long as it’s safe to do so.
That’s according to a new state law Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed on Friday.

Senate Bill 73 changes New Mexico’s traffic law to allow cyclists to treat stop signs as yield signs, and to treat red traffic lights as stop signs and proceed if there are no other cars, cyclists or pedestrians.
While it may seem counterintuitive to people who don’t use bicycles, this is already common practice among bicycle riders in New Mexico because a cyclist wants to carry their momentum on the bike, said Sen. Antoinette Sedillo Lopez, who carried the bill, during a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Doing this gets the cyclist out of the blind spot of motorists who have stopped at an intersection, Sedillo Lopez told the committee.
Eric Biedermann, a board member at-large of nonprofit advocacy organization BikeABQ, told the committee being able to treat a stop sign as a yield sign and a traffic light as a stop sign enhances cyclist safety because it reduces their exposure to cars, increases their visibility to cars and reduces the risk of being “right hooked” if a car doesn’t see them or a “left cross” from oncoming traffic.
“There are a number of ways in which being able to proceed through an intersection with a head start before the cars move really enhances cyclist safety,” Biedermann told the committee. He was also speaking on behalf of Bike Santa Fe and Velo Cruces.
The so-called “Idaho stop” — taking its name from the first U.S. state to ease traffic laws for cyclists — resulted in a 14.5% reduction in cyclist injuries a year after the state of Idaho enacted a similar law in 1982, according to a review of Idaho Office of Highway Safety data.
In New Mexico, between 2019 and 2023, 1,457 cyclists had crashes, according to the University of New Mexico Geospatial and Population Studies Center. Of those, 39 were killed, 115 were seriously injured and 694 were able to walk away.
Lynn Pickard, a retired New Mexico Court of Appeals judge and member of Santa Fe Seniors on Bikes, told the committee data show that as many as half of collisions between cars and bikes happen within intersections.
“So anything we can do to get cyclists into and out of the intersections quickly — leaving of course, for us, to determine our own safety if there are other cars there or pedestrians there — would be really helpful for us,” she said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Jason-Culver-3-26-25-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)A controversial bill to overhaul Ohio higher education, ban diversity and inclusion efforts, prohibit faculty from striking, and regulate classroom discussion is heading to Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine’s desk for his signature. 
The Ohio Senate concurred with changes made to Senate Bill 1 by the Ohio House during Wednesday’s session. The vote was 20-11 with only two Republicans voting against it, state Sens. Louis W. Blessing III, of Colerain Township, and Thomas F. Patton, of Strongsville, voting against it. DeWine has previously said he would sign S.B. 1 into law. 
DeWine will have 10 days to sign the bill into law or veto it once he receives it. If DeWine vetoes the bill, lawmakers would need a 3/5 vote from each chamber to override it.

S.B. 1 would set rules around classroom discussion, create post-tenure reviews, put diversity scholarships at risk, create a retrenchment provision that block unions from negotiating on tenure, shorten university board of trustees terms from nine years down to six years, and require students take an American history course, among other things. 
For classroom discussion, the bill would set rules around topics involving “controversial beliefs” such as climate policies, electoral politics, foreign policy, diversity and inclusion programs, immigration policy, marriage, or abortion. S.B. 1 would only affect Ohio’s public universities.  
State Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, introduced S.B. 1, which passed the Ohio Senate last month and the Ohio House last week.
“I am delighted, of course, as I always believed this is a great bill for the state of Ohio, for students and for higher education, so I’m delighted that we’ve been able to get past this next hurdle and send the bill to the governor’s desk,” Cirino said. 
S.B. 1 has received significant pushback. More than 1,500 people have submitted opponent testimony against the bill. Hundreds of students around the state have protested against the bill. Students and faculty have said they would leave Ohio if the bill becomes law. 
“We decided on a different approach than many, many of them would like,” Cirino said when asked about the bill’s overwhelming opposition. “But this isn’t about how many people show up to protest or to testify in hearings. A lot of those students that were showing up where, I believe, they were being paid or getting extra credit. And we don’t make policy here based on the number of people that show up to protest or testify.”
Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon, said the passing of S.B. 1 is long overdue. 
“It’s something that, frankly, should have been done sooner, but I’m happy we put the work in to get to where we are right now,” he said. “I do think it’s something that’s supported by Ohioans.”
Before voting to concur on S.B. 1, lawmakers debated the bill for about 35 minutes. 
“Senate Bill 1 will enrich the learning experience of students at our public universities and colleges — places where our best and brightest will be able to learn without prejudice, speak their minds without being canceled, be honest about their positions without fear of faculty retaliation, and consider all sides of an issue and make up their own minds,” said Sen. Kristina Roegner, R-Hudson.
State Sen. Michele Reynolds, R-Canal Winchester, acknowledged that some people are afraid of what will happen if DEI on college campuses is ended through this bill, but said the time has come to remove DEI labels.
“This is not about censure or erasure,” she said. “It’s not about exclusion. It’s about inclusion that transcends labels, because DEI has become a system that sorts us. It sorts us by race, by gender and by identity, creating a culture where we are defined by our categories instead of our character, where we look at each other’s faces instead of listening to each other’s hearts.”
State Sen. Kyle Koehler, R-Springfield, said this bill ends the micromanaging of instruction in higher education.
“All Ohio college students and parents will now have a more comfortable feeling that their public institution of higher learning will foster an environment of open and free expression for everyone,” he said.
Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood, said not everyone is celebrating the concurrence of S.B. 1. 
“Instead of tackling the real barriers to higher education — skyrocketing tuition costs and student debt — again, the majority are focused on dictating what’s taught in our colleges and universities and who teaches,” she said.
State Sent. Kent Smith, D-Euclid, said this bill will inhibit Ohio universities from attracting top-tier professors.
“If Senate Bill 1 becomes law, this legislation is the worst attack on academic freedom in Ohio in modern history,” Smith said.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Two Iowa Senate subcommittees have moved ahead House-sent bills aimed at making changes to Iowa’s medical schools to increase opportunities for Iowa students and accelerate their learning.
House File 386, which received signatures from subcommittee members Wednesday morning, would direct the University of Iowa and Des Moines University to conduct a study into potentially shrinking the timeline of some four-year programs to three years.
Keith Saunders, chief government relations officer for the Iowa Board of Regents, said during the meeting the board is generally supportive of the bill but called the term “three year medical school” a “misnomer,” as other shortened medical programs have done so through accelerated degrees.
Generally accelerated medical degree programs have worked in the area of family medicine, Saunders said, which is where the UI would focus its research.
“We’re happy to do the study, happy to provide a feasibility study,” Saunders said. “And again, we’re committed to doing everything possible to get as many health care workers into the workforce as possible.”

Des Moines University is registered as monitoring the bill, lobbyist Threase Harms said, but the university has requested it be removed from the legislation.
As an institution with no undergraduate programs or residencies, Harms said it would be very difficult to accelerate the university’s programming, especially with the knowledge that DMU did try to implement three-year programs in the 1980s without success.
“DMU is graduating the most family practice medicine doctors in the country,” Harms said. “We pride ourselves on that, and we have them all throughout the state of Iowa, but we just feel like the three-year escalation doesn’t fit with our current structure, and it doesn’t ensure that those doctors are prepared to go out and deliver those services.”
Each of the subcommittee members said they would move the bill forward with plans to introduce an amendment. Sen. Mike Zimmer, D-DeWitt, said he was in favor of removing DMU after hearing Harms’ remarks, but Sen. Mike Klimesh, R-Spillville, said he wasn’t sure if taking the university out was the best idea and it is important to think about potential cost-saving measures of shorter degree programs.
Sen. David Rowley, R-Spirit Lake, said he wants to encourage collaboration while working on the bill.
“We’ve got to be curious and have curiosity to find out how we could do this better, and I think that takes collaboration, working together with all of us in this room, to find some options or some opportunities out there,” Rowley said.
House File 516, which passed a Senate subcommittee Tuesday, would have the Iowa Board of Regents implement a policy requiring the UI doctor of medicine program and college of dentistry enroll cohorts made up of at least 80% resident students or students who attended an Iowa college or university prior to applying.
Saunders said the programs currently have between 70% and 75% resident students enrolled, and the board is supportive of initiatives that will keep more health care professionals in the state.
Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, said during discussion she has concerns about the bill potentially pushing away students who want to study, and stay, in Iowa.
“I’m willing to sign off on it, but just because somebody didn’t grow up here or go to college here doesn’t mean they don’t have a lot to offer to Iowa,” Trone Garriott said.
Klimesh said he understands where Trone Garriott was coming from in her remarks, but he looks at the legislation as a way to ensure UI medical programs have the best state retention possible. However, he said he plans to introduce an amendment to the bill that would add additional criteria for qualifying students, like those who maybe didn’t grow up in the state but know what rural Iowa is like based on their own upbringing in a neighboring state.
“To be perfectly honest, when I’ve asked folks what the definition of Iowan is, I get air quotes around it sometimes, so I’m not even sure what that is,” Klimesh said. “Maybe defining what an Iowan is and adding additional frameworks might be beneficial.”

(Michael B. Thomas/Getty Images)The Indiana Planned Parenthood affiliate announced the launch of a virtual clinic on Wednesday, touting it as part of an effort to mitigate provider gaps as other options close.
“For many Hoosiers, telehealth isn’t just about convenience — it’s about survival. Indiana faces incredibly pressing sexual health challenges, from high STI rates to maternal health crises, all exacerbated by provider shortages, stigmatization, restrictive policies, and barriers to care in rural communities,” said CEO Rebecca Gibron, who also leads the organization’s efforts in Hawai’i, Alaska and Kentucky.
“Expanding telehealth options means breaking down these barriers, ensuring patients can access compassionate, high-quality care no matter where they live,” Gibron continued in the release. “In a state where reproductive health care is increasingly restricted, investing in telehealth is not just practical—it’s essential to safeguarding the health and dignity of all Hoosiers.”
The Virtual Health Center in Indiana will connect Hoosiers with providers to discuss the following:

Birth control
Emergency contraception
Pregnancy planning
Gender-affirming care
Testing for sexual transmitted infections
Treatment for STIs
Menopause support


The organization’s press release further delved into rural hospital closures and cutbacks to obstetrics services. In Indiana, one-in-four counties are considered to be maternity care deserts, meaning they lack access to obstetric services at hospitals or free-standing clinics. Planned Parenthood pitched the virtual clinic as a way to address those gaps in care, pointing to a report from the Power to Decide on contraceptive deserts that found 428,540 women of reproductive age lacked options in Indiana. Prenatal care is shown to improve care outcomes for both mothers and babies, screening for birth defects and providing timely health care interventions.
STIs are also increasing nationwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, costings billions each year in treatment and lifelong medical costs. In Indiana, cases of gonorrhea have ticked up slightly while syphilis has more than doubled.
The Planned Parenthood virtual clinic will complement the 11 physical health centers located throughout the state. Appointments can be scheduled online by entering a resident’s state and selecting telehealth.

Dan McKee's plan. (Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Peter DiPippo is a state employee with growing frustrations over software problems delaying some workers’ pay raises and with the leaders whose missteps always seem to fall to their subordinates.
So Gov. Dan McKee’s proposal to raise the salaries of 11 cabinet heads did not sit well with DiPippo, a program specialist for the Rhode Island Department of Health and president of one of the many local unions representing state employees. 
“I find it difficult to see justification for director-level salary increases when classified employees are still facing delays in getting their raises,” DiPippo said during a public hearing on Wednesday.
The 36-minute hearing, held at the William E. Powers Department of Administration building with a virtual participation option, drew about 30 attendees — hardly a fire and brimstone affair.
But the chorus of criticism sounded by union leaders and local residents rang clear: no raises, not now.
Rhode Island Department of Transportation Director Peter Alviti Jr. came under extra scrutiny, with opponents linking his leadership to the Washington Bridge closure and rebuild — which has not gone according to plan, cost or schedule.
“I, like many others, do not have confidence in Director Alviti’s leadership,” Jonathan Coppe, a Providence resident, said. “Until we get more transparency from RIDOT, we should oppose a raise for Director Alviti.”
Alviti’s proposed 2% raise is not the highest — nine of the 11 department heads are in line for 5% raises. 
DiPippo applied the ancient proverb that “a fish rots from the head,” to the troubled state transportation department. In his view, Alviti is the head, and does not deserve a raise, especially when the workers under him are not receiving the same consideration.
“More damage has been done to the reputation of state employees by directors within the state than has ever been done by members here,” DiPippo said.
The Rhode Island Department of Transportation did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday.
A three-year contract reached in August offered a 5% wage increase to state union employees in the current fiscal year, with subsequent raises of 4% and 3% in the next two years. 
But state workers are still struggling with growing workloads and pay far less than neighboring states, creating retention issues that compromise services for residents, said Matthew Gunnip, a case worker with the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth and Families and president of SEIU Local 580.
“At DCYF, we see real-life consequences from not having the workers we need,” Gunnip said. 
He called on cabinet leaders in line for raises, including DCYF Director Ashley Deckert to “lead by example” and not take the raises McKee is offering them until their workers also get pay bumps.
The usual cloud of tension surrounding the annual pay bumps for top state appointees has swelled this year, with concern coming from state legislative leaders. House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi suggested in a radio interview earlier this week that the salary hikes contradicted the austerity budget he and other officials have been warning of for the upcoming fiscal year. State budget crunchers project a $250 million structural deficit for fiscal 2026.
Yet McKee’s office insisted he intends to “stay the course” on the salary increases, which total $82,000, setting the stage for a potential showdown between the executive branch and the legislature. State law empowers the Rhode Island General Assembly to reject proposed cabinet raises by a joint resolution; without such action, the pay bumps take effect within 30 days.
Shekarchi and Senate President Dominick Ruggerio have not said whether they intend to pursue legislation blocking the cabinet salary increases. 
Senate Minority Leader Jessica de la Cruz indicated she would support action to reject raises. House Minority Leader Mike Chippendale did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Rep. Enrique Sanchez, a Providence Democrat, again signaled his opposition to the proposal during Wednesday’s hearing.
“I represent one of the poorest districts in the state,” Sanchez said. “When they see these proposed salary increases, people get frustrated. There’s contempt.”
Sanchez continued, “It’s just not the right time.”
McKee’s office did not immediately respond to inquiries for additional comment on Wednesday.

(Getty Images)This story was updated throughout to add statements from the governor’s office and providers.
As Republicans in the New Hampshire House of Representative work to trim hundreds of millions of dollars from the state budget, a group of lawmakers has identified the New Hampshire Family Planning Program as a service to cut.
The New Hampshire Family Planning Program provides residents free and low-cost STD testing and treatment, birth control, cancer screenings, pregnancy tests, and counseling. It costs the state roughly $840,000 to operate each year, according to state budget documents. It receives almost $1 million annually from the federal government.
This comes amid the lengthy state budgeting process. In February, Gov. Kelly Ayotte proposed a nearly $16 billion budget for the next two years. Now, the state House of Representatives is in the process of reviewing, debating, and amending that budget. Ayotte’s proposal relied on optimistic economic projections that predicted a quick comeback from years of lagging business tax revenue. However, the House was less bullish; the House Ways and Means Committee predicted revenues would be hundreds of millions of dollars less than the governor did. Now, the House is working to identify places to cut the budget to fit it to their projections. 
During a work session Tuesday, Republicans in House Finance Division III, one of three subcommittees working on that task, identified the Family Planning Program as a place to cut. That subcommittee voted, 5-4, along party lines to recommend the program be eliminated.
“Yes, I understand there are those that feel it shouldn’t be cut,” Rep. Maureen Mooney, a Republican from Merrimack who serves as vice chair of the subcommittee. “All of these are difficult decisions. Considering the situation, considering we have an obligation to work with the money we have, the money that Ways and Means projects, we have to take some drastic measures.”
Mooney emphasized that the state is in “a very difficult budget year.”
Republicans in the subcommittee did this against the wishes of their Democratic counterparts.
“I think this is devastating,” Rep. Laura Telerski, the House Deputy Democratic leader and the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, said. “I think that just after 53 years of success with a program that this is problematic. We have low unwanted teen pregnancies. We’re experiencing right now an outbreak in STDs, and I just think this is not where we need to cut.”
Indeed, New Hampshire has the lowest pregnancy rate — 4.6 per 1,000 — for girls ages 15-19 of any state in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as of 2022, the most recent data available. And 2022 saw the highest incidence of gonorrhea and syphilis ever recorded (though chlamydia and HIV incidence remained stable while AIDS decreased) in New Hampshire, according to the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services.
The move has also sparked concern from the vendors New Hampshire contracted to provide the services.
“We are very concerned about this proposal,” Sue Durkin, co-CEO of Lamprey Health Care in Nashua, said in a statement to the Bulletin. “We have over 1,000 patients who receive these services. This proposal put their access to reproductive health services, medications, and needed health screenings at risk.”
Amoskeag Health in Manchester said that “in the past year alone, 416 unique patients benefited from reproductive and sexual health care that they otherwise would not have had access to” thanks to the program.
“At Amoskeag Health, the New Hampshire Family Planning Program plays a pivotal role in ensuring the health and well-being of growing families,” Kris McCracken, president and CEO of Amoskeag Health, said in a statement to the Bulletin. “This essential program supports pre-conception care and prenatal screenings, helping to foster healthy pregnancies and newborns. In addition, the program provides over 100 women with long-acting reversible contraception (LARC), a method proven to reduce the risk of unintended pregnancies. … Through this program, we also educate our youth, teaching teens about healthy relationships and how to avoid coerced sexual encounters. These educational initiatives are critical in empowering young people to make informed decisions including abstinence, a valid birth control option. Eliminating funding for this program would likely lead to an increase in teen pregnancies and unwanted pregnancies, particularly in families already struggling financially. Such a change would place an even greater strain on these families and could force many into difficult choices, including the decision to terminate pregnancies due to a lack of resources and support.”
Jeanne Agri, the CEO of Community Action Program, which administers the program in Merrimack and Belknap counties said in a statement: “A loss of funding for the New Hampshire Family Planning Program would have serious and immediate consequences for access to essential healthcare services across the state. This program supports critical care such as contraceptive services, prenatal care, STI and cancer screenings, and comprehensive reproductive health education. For many individuals, family planning clinics serve as their primary — if not sole — source of healthcare. Eliminating or reducing this support would create substantial barriers, including longer travel distances, extended wait times at overburdened clinics, and the complete loss of access to care for some.”
Before recommending the program be cut, the subcommittee briefly considered simply reducing funding to $5,000 a year in hopes that the Senate would be able to find the funding for the program when it reviews the budget later on in the process. They decided against that course of action.
In order for this proposal to officially be added to the budget, the entire House will also have to vote to approve it. Then, the entire budget will have to be passed by the Legislature and signed by the governor with this amendment included for it to become law.
Asked about this proposal, John Corbett, the governor’s spokesman, said in a statement to the Bulletin that “Governor Ayotte has always protected funding for preventative health care services for women and accordingly supported these resources in her budget.”
The proposal has also drawn ire from left-leaning reproductive health groups.
“Eliminating New Hampshire’s Family Planning Program is extremely shortsighted,” Kayla Montgomery, vice president of public affairs for Planned Parenthood New Hampshire Action Fund, said in a statement to the Bulletin. “This program saves the state in public health costs and ensures Granite Staters with lower incomes receive essential preventive health care like birth control, STD testing and treatment, and cancer screenings. Health care organizations throughout the state are already stressed, and gutting the New Hampshire family planning program will only worsen health care outcomes in this state.”
Planned Parenthood of Northern New England has sought for years to become part of the program as one of its vendors providing services. However, the state’s Republican-led executive council has continually rejected their bids over objections to the fact that the organization also provides abortions.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/pregnantwoman-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Canva image)Gov. Jeff Landry has made public moves to cut state government spending in recent weeks, following the lead of President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency  and its dramatic reductions at the federal level.  

Shortly after Trump announced the creation of DOGE last year, Landry followed with his own government efficiency task force, which is officially called the Fiscal Responsibility Program but which the governor’s office has started to refer to as “La. DOGE” recently. 
Yet for all of the talk about cost-cutting, Landry’s own budget proposal includes one major increase in spending that could overtake the savings measures he has floated. 
Louisiana’s heath care budget is set to increase almost $1.5 billion next fiscal year under the spending plan Landry unveiled a few weeks ago. Medicaid is fueling the growth, accounting for $19 billion of Landry’s proposed $21.4 billion health care budget. 
Medicaid provides government-backed health insurance to low-income families, pregnant people, seniors in nursing homes and those with disabilities. In Louisiana, approximately 1.6 million people, or a third of the state’s population, get health insurance through the program.
A billion-dollar-plus increase in health care spending isn’t unheard of in Louisiana, but Landry’s $1.5 billion jump comes at a time when Republicans in Congress and Trump may force unprecedented cuts to Medicaid spending.
Louisiana is also running approximately $100 million over its Medicaid budget for the current budget cycle that ends June 30, according to a letter Louisiana’s interim health secretary Drew Maranto sent to legislators. 

As a conservative, Landry was expected to take a more skeptical approach to public health care spending when he came into office last year, especially compared with his predecessor, Democrat John Bel Edwards. 
Yet Landry’s $1.5 billion growth proposal would be the second largest increase in Louisiana health care spending since 2017, the year after Medicaid expansion took place. It’s greater than most years Edwards was in office, from 2016-24. 
The only larger jump in state health care funding recently took place in 2021, when the federal government plowed money into Louisiana for the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The Landry administration attributes much of his proposed health care increase to costs it can’t control. 
Required costs
The six private health insurance companies that run most of Louisiana’s Medicaid program said they had more money because their Medicaid enrollees used more expensive health care services than expected. Maranto specifically mentioned the rising costs of prescription drugs in an interview Tuesday. 
Former health secretary Michael Harrington, who held Maranto’s job until last week, also said in an interview earlier this month that the state has brought some increased Medicaid costs upon itself. 
For example, lawmakers and voters approved a state constitutional amendment 11 years ago that requires nursing homes, whose owners are large political donors, to receive a Medicaid rate increase at least every other year, even when their services don’t change. In Landry’s latest budget proposal, this provision has resulted in an additional $105.4 million being set aside for nursing homes, which already receive over $1 billion each year.
Louisiana also isn’t alone in seeing soaring Medicaid costs. All states are seeing Medicaid expenses go up this year, in part because Medicaid enrollees appear to be sicker than expected, according to the Associated Press. 
“This is no simple bullet that is going to fix this for Louisiana anymore than any other part of the country,” said Steven Procopio, president of the independent Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana. 
Even with a $1.5 billion increase, the Landry administration insists it has taken steps to control spending in the state health department. It cut approximately $11 million worth of contracts and eliminated almost 60 of the health department’s 7,700 employment positions in an effort to  reduce spending, according to the governor’s staff. 
“They seem like they have gotten a handle on things a little bit better,” Patrick Goldsmith, deputy commissioner of the Louisiana Division of Administration, said about the health department last week.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
Additional expenses
But Landry has also made choices that increased Medicaid spending by hundreds of millions of dollars annually. 
At the urging of state lawmakers, the governor’s latest budget proposal includes an extra $258.4 million to increase physician payments for seeing Medicaid patients up to at least 85% of the rates used by Medicare, the government health insurance program for seniors. 
Harrington and Louisiana Surgeon General Ralph Abraham have said doctors must be paid more to treat Medicaid patients. Currently, Medicaid enrollees have trouble finding physicians because the program’s reimbursement rates are too low. Medicare payments are typically higher, and doctors are more willing to take that insurance. 
The governor also unilaterally raised Medicaid reimbursement rates by $22 million per year for seven smaller hospitals in rural areas, including four owned by Rock Bordelon, a Landry campaign donor and hunting buddy of Donald Trump Jr. Landry increased similar rates by over $40 million per year to University Medical Center in New Orleans. 
The governor’s team has also asked the federal government for permission to raise another physician payment that would allow more doctors to charge closer to a commercial insurance rate for seeing Medicaid patients. 
This second round of extra physician spending hasn’t been factored into the state budget yet. But if the proposal gains approval, it could add hundreds of millions of more federal dollars to Landry’s existing Medicaid spending. 
Federal funding concerns
Overall, Louisiana’s Medicaid budget is largely dependent on federal funds. Of the $19 billion Landry has proposed spending on Medicaid next year, $14.2 billion would be expected to come from the federal government. 
For years, money coming from Washington was less likely to be cut than state funds, but Trump and congressional Republicans are eyeing Medicaid for significant reductions this year.

The House GOP is looking to siphon off as much as $880 billion from the health care program to help pay for tax cuts. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, who is from north Louisiana, and Trump have said they don’t intend to cut Medicaid services directly, but experts say it would be nearly impossible to meet their spending goals without limiting the program. 
Congress might be able to avoid making cuts to Medicaid directly by transferring more of its cost burdens to states. Louisiana would likely not be able to afford to replace a significant portion of its federal Medicaid money that is lost. 
By comparison, the total amount of federal and state money Landry intends to spend on higher education, state police, the Office of Motor Vehicles and the prison system combined in the next fiscal year is $5.3 billion. It’s not even half of the $14.2 billion in Medicaid funding the federal government is expected to provide. 
Without the federal money, state officials would have to look at cutting optional Medicaid services, including those for people with disabilities, or lowering the reimbursement rates for physicians Landy is currently trying to raise, among other measures. 
“I think states should be very worried about a cost shift from the federal government,” said Kelly Whitener, an associate professor at Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy for Children and Families. 

“If the federal government cuts Medicaid and cuts Medicaid significantly as they are considering, states are going to be ones that have to make the decisions about what services are going to be cut, what provider services are going to be cut,” she said in an interview.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/doctor-and-child-1024x683.png,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)Election administration experts say that President Donald Trump’s executive order seeking to require that people prove their U.S. citizenship to register to vote is unlikely to survive legal challenges, but even if it did, it would not apply to Wisconsin’s April 1 election. 
On Tuesday, Trump signed the order that purports to pull federal funding from the Election Assistance Commission for states that do not require that voters prove their U.S. citizenship to vote in federal elections. The order also attempts to give Elon Musk’s DOGE access to states’ voter registration lists and gives the Department of Homeland Security the authority to verify the citizenship status of voters and make the prosecution of non-citizen voting a priority at the Department of Justice. The order also demands that election administrators use paper ballots or paper ballot trails.
In recent years, Trump and Republicans have become increasingly focused on alleged non-citizen voting. Since Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen, Republicans in Congress have worked to pass the SAVE Act, which contains similar provisions to the Trump order. Last year in Wisconsin, voters approved a Republican-authored constitutional amendment to prevent non-citizens from voting in local, state or federal elections — despite it already being against the law for non-citizens to vote. 
Voting rights advocates have frequently cautioned that the provisions included in the Trump order and the SAVE act would potentially disenfranchise millions of married American women who have a different last name on their current ID than on proof of citizenship documents like a birth certificate. Estimates say this could prevent more than 69 million women from voting. 
“Let’s keep it real: this order is not about protecting elections; it is about making it harder for voters — particularly women voters — to participate in them,” Celina Stewart, Chief Executive Officer of the League of Women Voters of the United States, said in a statement. “This executive order is an assault on our republic and a dangerous attempt to silence American voters. The President continues to overstep his authority and brazenly disregard settled law in this country. To be very clear — the League of Women Voters is prepared to fight back and defend our democracy.”
Trump issued the order just one week before Wisconsin’s April 1 election and days after he endorsed Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel in the race for a seat on the state Supreme Court. 
“President Donald Trump’s sudden, overbroad and sweeping executive order issued yesterday, just one week before Wisconsin’s nationally important and closely watched State Supreme Court election on April 1st is likely unconstitutional and destined to be rejected by federal and state courts and the U.S. Congress in part or completely,” Jay Heck, executive director of Common Cause Wisconsin said after the order’s release. Heck also sent out a press release telling Wisconsin voters that the order does not apply to the April 1 election.
Ann Jacobs, the Democratic chair of the Wisconsin Elections Commission, wrote on social media that there are a number of reasons why the order won’t apply to the election next week. The order only applies to federal elections and there are no federal offices on the ballot — only elections for state and local offices. And the order is not set to go into effect for 30 days, long after April 1. 
Jacobs also said that the order focuses on provisions on the National Voting Rights Act (NVRA). Also known as the “Motor voter” law, the NVRA requires most states to offer people the ability to register to vote at state motor vehicle agencies, by mail or at certain state or local offices. The law also requires states to maintain up-to-date voter registration lists. 
Wisconsin is one of six states that is exempt from the NVRA because it allows people to register to vote in-person at the polls on Election Day, so, Jacobs said, any provisions of the Trump order purporting to use the authority of the NVRA aren’t applicable to Wisconsin. Jacobs also pointed out that Wisconsin is prohibited from even using an NVRA-specific voter registration form because of a Waukesha County court ruling against its use. 
Jacobs added that Wisconsin already uses paper ballots or paper voting trails to keep a record of every ballot cast in the state. 
“It is disappointing that the federal government is attempting to make people worry about voting this close to an important election,” Jacobs wrote. “I hope this is not a ham-fisted attempt to shore up a failing bid for the [Wisconsin Supreme Court] by the candidate currently behind in the polls.”

Diana DeGette speaks at the Colorado Democratic Party watch party on Nov. 5, 2024. (Andrew Fraieli for Colorado Newsline)U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette, a Denver Democrat, called for Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and National Security Advisory Michael Waltz to resign after release of the full transcript of a Signal chat that accidentally included a journalist. 
Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, reported Monday that sensitive details of pending U.S. military action were sent in a group chat on Signal, an encrypted commercial messaging app, of senior Trump administration officials that Waltz accidentally added him to. The Atlantic on Wednesday published the full transcript of the conversation, which included minute-by-minute attack plans ahead of U.S. bombings in Yemen earlier this month. Administration officials had minimized the severity of the breach. 
DeGette said “at minimum” Hegseth and Waltz must resign, and she demanded Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe be investigated for perjury after denying on Wednesday that classified information was shared in the chat. DeGette said “it may well be that all of these officials need to be fired.” 
“The level of incompetence shown by the Secretary of Defense and National Security Advisor is staggering. This is a systemic failure by some of the highest-ranking officials in our government, and if the information shared on this unsecured platform fell into the hands of an adversary, it would have put American servicemembers’ lives at risk,” DeGette said in a statement. “There must be accountability, and their failure to take responsibility while gaslighting the public about what exactly happened demands answers.”

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)When Jovon Graham started working as a cook at Waffle House in Orangeburg in 2023, he was making less than $12 an hour.
That’s less than $25,000 a year, assuming his manager scheduled him for full, 40-hour work weeks.
He couldn’t afford a car and had to walk to and from work, often with aching, blistered feet after a long shift. To make ends meet, he stayed with his sister and his grandmother.
“It was basically impossible to live on my own,” Graham said during a panel discussion Tuesday in front of some 70 labor union members gathered in West Columbia.
Graham no longer works for Waffle House but was part of the push for unionization at the restaurant and still organizes for the Union of Southern Service Workers.
While the Palmetto State has enjoyed robust employment growth since the COVID-19 pandemic, one in five South Carolina workers still earn less than $15 per hour, putting the number of low wage workers in the state above the national average and that of the South as a whole, according to a report commissioned by labor unions in the state.
And of the top 10 fastest growing jobs over the next decade — such as home health workers and warehouse stock movers and fillers — less than half pay more than $20.30 per hour — the state’s median wage.
That’s according to the analysis of federal Bureau of Labor Statistics data by the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, known as the AFL-CIO, in South Carolina.
“Employment in this state didn’t drop, but the wages didn’t match that,” said Kim Smith, state vice president of the conglomeration of 63 unions representing workers that include airline pilots, postal employees and paper and steel mill workers.
AFL-CIO chapters across the country have previously published similar reports in a push to increase membership. Tuesday’s report marks a first for South Carolina, the third least unionized state in the nation behind South Dakota and North Carolina.
The state had 61,000 union members in 2024, according to the latest federal labor data.
That’s up from 49,000 in 2023. Union membership for the state was at its peak in 1991, when 5.2% of the workforce was unionized.
The report prepared for the union group by the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C., based think tank, highlighted two of the state’s largest industry sectors: tourism and auto manufacturing.
One in 10 South Carolinians work in hospitality, the report said, citing statistics from the South Carolina Department of Parks, Recreation, and Tourism.
“In places like Myrtle Beach, tourism is the largest sector of the economy,” it read. “Many of those who work in hospitality, however, don’t make enough to live in these communities.”
The median income for a hotel desk clerk is about $28,600 a year. But researchers estimated the cost of living in Myrtle Beach for a single adult with no children at more than $46,000.
That compares to $45,000 in Greenville, $50,000 in Columbia and $55,000 in Charleston, according to the report.
“For those workers trying to support families, the economic strain is even greater,” the authors wrote.
In the four years after the pandemic, hospitality workers’ paychecks in 40 states, including South Carolina, increased by more than the national average and actually outpaced the rate of inflation, according to a separate Economic Policy Institute report.
“Mostly what you’re seeing is the effect of a tighter labor market,” Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute told SC Daily Gazette affiliate Stateline last year. “More competition, more scarcity of workers, means employers have to pay more regardless of what state you live in.”
South Carolina hospitality wages jumped nearly 33%, while the sector with the highest wages, federal government, grew less than 11%.
At the same time, that only amounts to about $477 a week for the average hospitality worker.  And low-wage workers cannot count on a worker-friendly job market to boost pay indefinitely, according to the Economic Policy Institute.
Hospitality workers’ wages are rising faster than high earners’ in most states

“We have working poor in this country,” Smith said.
On the other end of the spectrum, the report said, automotive manufacturing jobs pay more — a median wage of $31 per hour — but those paychecks have not kept pace with inflation and have $175 less in weekly buying power than they did a decade earlier.
“This is a remarkable trend — that a fast-growing industry with many employers needing to rapidly staff new facilities would face so little pressure to raise pay,” the report’s authors write.
Finally, the report highlights the inequality of job growth across the state.
Of the more than 174,000 new jobs added in South Carolina between January 2020 and December 2023, more than 77% were concentrated in just four metro areas: Charleston, Greenville, Myrtle Beach and Columbia.
That means those living in rural areas must spend more time and money commuting for work. And public transit is rarely an option.
Meanwhile, more than four in 10 South Carolinians live outside those top four metro areas that have collectively received more than 77% of all new jobs.
In the past five years, states with lower wages and a lower cost of living saw the biggest growth in jobs. South Carolina newly ranked eighth-highest, according to a Stateline analysis last May of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Meanwhile, high-wage, high-cost states such as California, New York and Massachusetts fell out of the top 10 to the very bottom in job creation, according to the analysis.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2864-1024x635.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

She did not answer questions seeking the amount of money or programs that would be effected.

However, during an agency bill in the Senate Health and Provider Services Committee on Wednesday, Sen. Ed. Charbonneau directly asked about the dollars, saying “We are all worried about things happening in Washington (D.C.).”
“I heard something … that could have a pretty devastating, pretty immediate effect on the Department of Health,” said the Valparaiso Republican. “Have you heard anything about it?”
Rachel Swartwood, the legislative and external affairs director at IDOH, told the committee that the agency first received news on Tuesday, saying “we’re still evaluating that and digging into the full impact, but we think it’s in the world of $40 million.”
“We are working with our team to evaluate what’s going on,” Swartwood said. “Our goal is to ensure no direct services to Hoosiers are disrupted and we will keep you updated.”
Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, asked whether the funding mostly affected county-level departments, to which Swartwood said the agency didn’t yet know.
Allen County health officials said they are not impacted. Inquiries to other counties were not immediately returned.
NBC News reported the clawed-back funds were largely being used for COVID testing, vaccination, community health workers as well as initiatives to address COVID health disparities.

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator)The state’s higher education oversight board unanimously voted Wednesday to recommend moving the University of New Orleans, which has struggled with enrollment and finances, back into the LSU System.
Legislation is required to finalize the move, which would reverse action taken 14 years ago to place UNO into the University of Louisiana System. 
The Louisiana Board of Regents’ recommendation comes after Louisiana’s top two state lawmakers — Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, and House Speaker Phillip DeVillier, R-Eunice — asked members in February to study the feasibility of the move.
The idea for moving UNO back to the LSU System originated from Henry, the lawmaker said in an interview Wednesday, rather than with leaders from either of the universities.  
“It’s really just rebranding of the school,” Henry said. “I think LSU and purple and gold is the best play.” 
Legislation to transfer UNO to the LSU System will be filed this year, Henry said, although he wasn’t sure yet which New Orleans-area lawmaker would sponsor it. The exact timeline for transferring the university has not yet been established, although it could happen as soon as the fall semester. 
“We needed to do something quickly so that existing students don’t transfer out, and students that are applying know that that school is going to be there for the foreseeable future,” Henry said. 
The Board of Regents recommended forming a transition team to steer the move and hiring a third-party firm for an in-depth audit. In addition to legislative approval, the move would require approval from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, the accrediting body for both UNO and LSU. 
“I look forward to reviewing the findings and having further discussions with my colleagues on the board on how the LSU enterprise can welcome UNO back into the family,” LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard said in a statement to the Illuminator.

The university’s possible return to LSU’s control is in response to UNO’s acute budget crisis. The school faces a $10 million budget shortfall and has implemented a spending freeze, layoffs and staff furloughs in an attempt to make ends meet. 
UNO administrators have kept open the possibility of further layoffs and furloughs. The university’s budget crisis is largely tied to enrollment. The school had a student body of around 17,000 before Hurricane Katrina, with an immediate drop to around 6,000 after the storm. For the fall 2024 semester, its total enrollment was 6,488. 
Regents noted every school within the LSU System has reported enrollment increases for the past few years, in defiance of nationwide trends of declining enrollment. 
While every board member ultimately voted to approve the move, several expressed concern about the lack of detail from LSU. 
A nearly 150-page report on the feasibility of moving UNO back to the LSU System hit on every detail of UNO’s budget crisis and governance history but contained little about what benefit the university could expect to receive from LSU. 
Neither Ballard nor LSU President William Tate attended the board meeting. Board members Rico Alvendia and Rémy Starns, who is also the state’s public defender, attended the meeting. Both expressed support for UNO but provided no specifics. 
Henry said that LSU is better equipped to handle the challenges UNO is facing. In addition to better marketing, Henry said he believed LSU could better help UNO align its faculty count with its current student population. 
“I think this is a first step,” Henry said. “We’ll give it a couple years. Hopefully it’ll be successful.”
At the time of the system switch in 2011, UNO alumni and boosters applauded the plan, as many felt the university was overshadowed in the LSU System.
UNO would be the only institution in the LSU System classified as an R2 university, meaning it has high levels of research activity, second only to LSU’s main campus, which is a R1 school with the highest research activity rating. 
In the University of Louisiana System, there are two other schools with research-level rankings: the University of Louisiana Lafayette, an R1, and Louisiana Tech, an R2. 
UNO would also be the only other school in the LSU System with an NCAA Division I athletics program.

Dick Durbin of Illinois as well as Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire were the only three members of their party to vote for Makary.Shaheen said during an interview Wednesday that while she has reservations about how the Trump administration might try to change access to medication abortion, she felt Makary was qualified to lead the FDA.“Well, I'm very concerned about what this administration might do about mifepristone,” Shaheen said. “But, I thought it was important to have someone in that role who has the scientific background and ability to run the agency.”Hassan declined to answer questions about her vote when asked about it Wednesday afternoon by States Newsroom. Her office declined to send a written statement from the senator, offering only a response from a spokesperson. “The opioid epidemic has devasted communities across New Hampshire, and the FDA has made mistakes over the years that fueled this epidemic,” the spokesperson wrote in an email. “Senator Hassan voted for Dr. Makary as Commissioner of the FDA following his clear commitment to ensuring that the agency learns from its past mistakes and acts aggressively to tackle this crisis.""Senate confirmation came just weeks after the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, or HELP, Committee voted to advance Makary and Bhattacharya.Sen. John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., voted in committee to send Makary’s nomination to the floor, but switched to opposing his confirmation on Tuesday.Hickenlooper said during a brief interview with States Newsroom on Wednesday that he ultimately couldn’t support Makary over his comments about medication abortion. But he said nothing significant happened between his yes vote in committee and his no vote on the floor.“I agonized over it. I could have easily gone back and voted yes,"" Hickenlooper said. “You know, at some point when I see him, I'll apologize and say, 'You know, that was a hard vote for me. But I really wish you would have been more demonstrative about specifically mifepristone, because I think that's a big issue that the FDA is going to take on.’”Hickenlooper said he spoke with his staff and his wife over Makary’s comments about access to medication abortion before he cast his no vote on the Senate floor.“I realized that he serves at the pleasure of the president, so what the president says he's probably going to have to do,"" Hickenlooper said. ""But for me, I just became more and more uncomfortable that he wouldn't make a few statements to say that, you know, this is not something that is a medical reinterpretation for political purposes. He should have said something.”Abortion pillMakary will have considerable authority at the FDA to determine if access to medication abortion remains as it is now, if the agency changes prescribing guidelines, or even pulls its approval.During his confirmation hearing in early March, Makary testified he hadn’t yet decided how he would approach that aspect of the job.“I have no preconceived plans on mifepristone policy except to take a solid, hard look at the data and to meet with the professional career scientists who have reviewed the data at the FDA,” Makary said at the time.Medication abortion is a two-drug regimen consisting of mifepristone and misoprostol that accounts for about 63% of all pregnancy terminations within the United States, according to research from the Guttmacher Institute.The FDA originally approved mifepristone in 2000 and changed its prescribing guidelines in 2016 and 2021. It is currently approved for use up to 10 weeks gestation and can be prescribed via telehealth and shipped to patients.Sixteen major medical organizations — including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Association and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine — affirmed to the U.S. Supreme Court last year that mifepristone is safe and effective.“The scientific evidence is overwhelming: major adverse events occur in less than 0.32% of patients,” the medical organizations wrote in a 45-page brief. “The risk of death is almost non-existent.”Goals for NIHBhattacharya testified during his confirmation hearing that he has five goals for the NIH, including focusing the agency’s research on chronic diseases and funding the “most innovative biomedical research agenda possible.”“The NIH is the crown jewel of American biomedical sciences, with a long and illustrious history of supporting breakthroughs in biology and medicine,” Bhattacharya said at the time. “I have the utmost respect for the NIH scientists and staff over the decades who have contributed to this success.”But, he said, “American biomedical sciences are at a crossroads” following the coronavirus pandemic.Bhattacharya said during his hearing he would ensure NIH’s scientific research is replicable, that it has a culture that respects “free speech in science and scientific dissent” and that it regulates “risky research that has the possibility of causing a pandemic.”“While the vast majority of biomedical research poses no risk of harm to research subjects or the public, the NIH must ensure that it never supports work that might cause harm.”",,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(File shot via Florida Department of Corrections)Florida does not offer parole for most inmates incarcerated in its correctional facilities. But under a bill that passed in a House committee on Wednesday, more of those approximately 3,000 inmates who are eligible might have a better chance of being released.
The measure sponsored by Tampa Democratic Rep. Dianne Hart would revise requirements for objective parole guidelines developed by the Florida Commission on Offender Review (FCOR). They would be based on the seriousness of the inmate’s offense and the likelihood of favorable parole outcome by identifying an inmate’s use of vocation, education, and self-betterment programs.
“It allows the inmate to have an idea on when he can anticipate a release date, if ever,” Hart told the House Criminal Justice Subcommittee. “In doing so, we believe that this will change the morale of the inmates because they’re working towards something. And if they won’t be released, FCOR should have the backbone to say, ‘I’m sorry. The crime you committed, I will not be releasing you.'”
Paul Figueroa, president of the Hillsborough County Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, supports the legislation. 
“Having certain criteria that can be reviewed determining what an inmate has done to better themselves can only help who is being admitted back into society,” he said.
Limited reach
While advocates applaud the measure, the fact is that the overwhelming majority of Florida inmates would not be eligible for parole, even if the measure passes both chambers and makes its way to the governor’s desk.
That’s because the state of Florida eliminated parole for most inmates in 1983, becoming one of at least 16 states that do not allow certain offenders to serve the remainder of their court-impose sentences in the community under strict supervision. 
More than 88,000 inmates are incarcerated in Florida prisons. However, according the  Florida Department of Corrections 2023 annual report, just 3,498 inmates were eligible for parole.
Although parole for most offenders ended, those who committed first-degree life and capital felonies remained parole-eligible until 1995. It’s inmates sentenced before that date who are eligible for the Corrections Transition Program, with those inmates chosen by the Commission on Offender Review.
“We need parole in Florida,” said criminal justice reform advocate Kim White. “Rehabilitation does work when we they can get the programs. We just need to give people a chance to show that they are proving themselves inside before they get out, and that they are worthy to be released back into society.”
The measure was passed unanimously in the committee.
“I’m a strong believer in law and order,” said Volusia County Republican Webster Barnaby. 
“I’m also a strong believer that we must be compassionate as lawmakers, recognizing that there are individuals who are incarcerated in our correctional facilities that, in my opinion, clearly would benefit with parole, and it’s time. It’s time in Florida that we have the courage to look the public in the eye and say, ‘We need parole in our prison systems in the state of Florida.'”
The bill says that at least once a year, the commission must review the objective parole guidelines and make any revisions considered necessary by virtue of statistical analyses. Upon completion of that review, a report would go to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Hart’s bill now will go before the Judiciary Committee before making it to the House floor. A similar proposal in the Senate filed by Palm Beach County Democrat Mack Bernard (SB 964) has also passed unanimously in its first committee. It has two more stops before it would get consideration on the Senate floor.

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The Oklahoma Attorney General’s Office could soon have the power to investigate delayed or denied open records requests after the state House advanced legislation Tuesday. 
House Bill 2163 establishes the Public Access Counselor Unit within the Attorney General’s Office and allows people to file a report with the office with a written request. The measure is not expected to have an impact on the state budget. 
Rep. John Pfeiffer, R-Orlando, who authored the legislation, said he hopes this will give private individuals, the media and lawmakers a path to speed up the release of public records. 
“The way it is now in statute, the only recourse is to take the matter to district court. This will put an intermediary into the process to reduce time and court cost,” he said in a statement. “This would result in better transparency and accountability.”
Under the measure, the public access counselor can determine if the denied request is a violation of state law and has seven business days to forward the request to the public body and ask them to provide the records requested. The public body must then respond to the counselor. 
The attorney general would examine the request and response by the public body and issue an advisement. The public body would be required to take necessary action to reasonably comply with the Open Records Act or respond to the requester. 
The bill authorizes the attorney general to issue advisory opinions on compliance with the Open Records Act and to investigate and prosecute any civil or criminal action relating to violations of the act.
People requesting public records for commercial purposes would not be able to ask the office for a review. 
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond supported the House’s passage of the bill and said it was an “important transparency measure.” 
“Oklahomans have a right to know how their hard-earned tax dollars are being spent and what their elected officials are doing to improve their lives,” he said in a statement. 
Drummond previously issued a statement urging House lawmakers to pass the measure. 
The bill is now eligible to be heard by the Oklahoma Senate after it was passed 80-9, with bipartisan support and opposition.

Mike Kehoe speaks Wednesday before signing a bill that puts the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department under control of a state board. (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent)The St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department will again be governed by a state board instead of local officials under a bill signed Wednesday by Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe.
The change, reversing a statewide vote from 2012 that put the board under local control, is needed, supporters say, because of high crime rates in the state’s second largest city. Asked what would happen if crime does not decrease, Kehoe said no bill, on its own, will reduce crime. 
“You can’t legislate lower crime, but what you can do is give law enforcement the tools it takes,” he said.
The bill restores the governing system that controlled the department from 1861 until the 2012 vote. With Kehoe’s signature, St. Louis joins Kansas City as the only major metropolitan police force in the country under control of a state board rather than local officials.
The Board of Police Commissioners will have six members — the mayor of St. Louis and five people appointed by the governor and subject to state Senate confirmation.
The bill directs Kehoe to name an interim director of the department within 30 days and the five commissioners within 90 days.
The bill passed on party-line votes in the House and Senate, with Democrats opposing the move with arguments that it was racist because Black Democrats hold the major offices in St. Louis and unneeded because crime is decreasing.
Critics point to statistics showing a drop in violent crime in St. Louis under local leadership. They say Kansas City has fared no better despite being under state control since the 1930s.
“State takeover is not based in reality, and only shows that Gov. Kehoe and the legislature are willing to throw out facts, reason, and the will of the people in order to give the safety of our city away to special interests,” St. Louis Mayor Tishaura Jones said in a news release.
Crime continues to fall in St. Louis, Jones said, and targeted violence prevention programs have reduced homicides by more than half in 2024 compared to 2023.
“From the very beginning, this bill has been a sham, and the governor’s signature represents nothing but disrespect for every Missouri voter who supported local control,” Jones said.
Senate Democrats filibustered the bill, winning additions of provisions banning the shackling of pregnant prisoners, establishing a fund for exonerated prisoners to receive restitution from the state and limiting what jails and prisons can charge inmates for phone calls.
Republicans also agreed to remove a provision that broadened the definition of rioting, a change Democrats feared would have wide ranging unintended consequences.
The bill also requires Missouri law enforcement agencies to report the immigration status of suspected criminal offenders to the state’s Department of Public Safety. It also expands the definition of a “dangerous felony” — crimes that require offenders to serve 85% of their sentence before parole —- to include the offense of first degree child endangerment and adds having fentanyl in the presence of a minor to the list of actions that endanger a child.
While legislative Republicans overwhelmingly supported reverting to state control of the St. Louis police, a recent poll suggests Missouri voters aren’t as enthusiastic for the move. And they would like it even less if state control was extended to their local law enforcement agency.
The St. Louis University/YouGov poll, which surveyed 900 likely voters in late February, found that 47% of voters supported local control of St. Louis police, 39% preferred state control and 14% stated they were not sure.
The results were similar when respondents were asked about Kansas City police, with 48% favoring local control. When asked whether state control should be extended to Springfield, the state’s third largest city, 55% said they preferred local control of police in that city.
And when asked about state control of their local police department, only 22% said that was their preference.
“In our February poll, 53% of Missouri voters rated crime in their community as fair or poor,” poll director Steven Rogers said in a news release. “But it seems that voters want their local cities to handle these crime problems — not the state.”
Other provisions in the bill were more popular. The poll showed 68% of voters support requiring law enforcement agencies to report criminal offenders’ citizenship status, while 87% said they support tougher felonies for possession of fentanyl in the presence of children.
The promises — and criticism — of the bill magnify its potential for success and failure. 
State Rep. Brad Christ, a St. Louis County Republican, said the measure will reassure businesses and residents who have been leaving St. Louis that the city will get better.
“I truly believe it’s the beginning of the ascent of St Louis, and what it was and what it could become,” Christ said.
The bill is a power-grab that will not make the city safer, said Kristin Bowen, leader of the Missouri chapter of Moms Demand Action.
“Gov. Kehoe’s decision to strip St. Louis of its ability to control its own police force is a dangerous and shameless political stunt, driven by extremist Republican lawmakers hellbent on undermining communities they have no interest in protecting,” Bowen said. “This move is as cowardly as it is destructive.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kehoe-police-bill-20250326-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014
,DC,2025-03-26 17:08:14+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Democratic attorneys general face off with Trump administration over rehiring fired feds,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/democratic-attorneys-general-face-trump-administration-over-rehiring-fired-feds,,"BALTIMORE — A federal judge in Maryland said Wednesday he will briefly extend his temporary order requiring the Trump administration to reinstate federal jobs for 24,000 fired probationary employees while he considers whether to make it last until the case is decided.U.S. District Judge James Bredar in the District of Maryland told the plaintiffs and government he will need more details by 10 a.m. Eastern Thursday before he can decide whether the case merits a preliminary injunction to stop all firings and require reinstatements. Such an action would likely last until a final judgment in the case is reached.The temporary restraining order affecting the fired federal workers expires Thursday night, but Bredar told the parties he expects to extend it briefly while he considers new information.President Donald Trump and White House adviser Elon Musk began directing agencies in early February to fire tens of thousands of federal workers who were in the first year or two of their positions, or had been recently promoted.Wednesday’s hearing in Baltimore centered on a lawsuit filed March 6 by Democratic attorneys general in 19 states and the District of Columbia, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.The attorneys general argued the mass firings led by Trump and Musk harmed states because the federal government did not provide the legally required advance notice that gives states time to prepare “rapid response activities” ahead of an influx of unemployed residents. The states have asked Bredar to issue a preliminary injunction to prohibit the government from conducting any further reductions in force, also referred to as RIFs.‘Great reluctance’ to grant preliminary injunctionBut Bredar had tough questions Wednesday for lawyers representing the states and U.S. Department of Justice.Bredar asked Virginia Williamson, counsel for the state of Maryland, why he should issue a nationwide preliminary injunction when the “majority of states have not joined this lawsuit.”“That’s the issue that has to be faced,” he said.Bredar expressed a preference for a more narrow injunction and ordered Williamson to submit more information within 24 hours that proves the need for a broader request.“This court has great reluctance to issue a national injunction. You’re going to have to show me it’s essential to remedy harms (for your clients),” he said.Eric Hamilton, representing the federal government, testified that the states lack standing, and that their argument is “unusual” in that their grievance is lack of warning about the firings — but they seek a remedy of giving employees their jobs back.Bredar replied that the problem wouldn’t exist if the workers were returned to their status quo of being employed.“If there’s no fire, there’s no need for the fire department to respond,” he told Hamilton.Hamilton also argued that burdens placed on the government for having to rehire thousands of employees “are so much greater” than any financial injuries the firings caused for the states.Bredar snapped back that the firings were “sudden and dramatic.”“It’s not appropriate to flip that around. If you were worried about that, you shouldn’t have done it in the first place. I’m not buying that one,” the judge said.When Bredar asked Hamilton why rehiring employees is precluded as a remedy, Hamilton argued there’s “not much precedent” for federal courts to issue orders to agencies about personnel decisions.Second judge to order rehiringBredar issued a temporary restraining order March 13 immediately reinstating employment for just over 24,000 federal probationary workers across dozens of federal departments and agencies.Agencies affected by the order included Agriculture, Commerce, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Labor, Transportation, Treasury and Veterans Affairs, as well as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Environmental Protection Agency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, General Services Administration, Small Business Administration and the U.S. Agency for International Development, according to court filings.Bredar was the second federal judge on that date to order the Trump administration to rehire fired federal workers.The government has appealed both rulings to their respective circuit courts.In a status report due to Bredar on March 17, representatives for the federal agencies detailed the “substantial burdens” of rehiring the employees. At the time of the report, the agency heads placed almost 19,000 out of the 24,418 fired on paid administrative leave rather than placing them back on active duty status.The required court filings marked the first time the government had provided a comprehensive list of the federal workforce downsizing that spanned February into March.The agency representatives submitted updated status reports to Bredar Tuesday, reaffirming that many of the employees remain on paid administrative leave.‘No secret of their contempt’ for civil serviceIn their original complaint, the attorneys general argued that Trump and administration officials “have made no secret of their contempt for the roughly 2 million committed professionals who form the federal civil service. Nor have they disguised their plans to terminate vast numbers of civil servants, starting with tens of thousands of probationary employees.”The firings have subjected communities across the U.S. “to chaos” and will cost the states money in lost tax revenue and social services for unemployed residents, they wrote. “These costs arise in the administration of programs aimed at providing connections to social services, like health care and food assistance,” they argued.The government responded that the 19 states and District of Columbia have no standing in the case and ultimately can’t prove irreparable harm. They also maintained that the executive branch has the right to fire probationary employees.“The action has no hope of success, because third parties cannot interject themselves into the employment relationship between the United States and government workers, which is governed by a comprehensive statutory scheme that provides an exclusive remedial avenue to challenge adverse personnel actions,” the government argued.Bredar was appointed to the U.S. District Court bench by former President Barack Obama in 2010 and confirmed by voice vote in the Senate.Before beginning his legal career in Colorado, Bredar worked as a National Park Service ranger, according to his biography published by the U.S. courts. Bredar worked as a prosecutor in Moffat County, Colorado, then as an assistant U.S. attorney and assistant federal public defender in Denver.In 1992, he was appointed federal public defender for the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. He was appointed a U.S. magistrate judge in 1998.",,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

FRANKFORT — Kentucky is investing $300,000 into space research that Senate President Robert Stivers said sets the state up as “a leader in all areas.” 
The money — which was allocated in the 2024 legislative session’s Senate Bill 1 — is a 10% match for a $3.1 million NASA grant announced Wednesday. 
The money will allow the Louisville nonprofit National Stem Cell Foundation to continue researching the way brain cells behave in microgravity in the hopes of finding better treatments — and cures — for Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s. 
The total grant will support three missions to the International Space Station (ISS) through 2027 and fund more research on the ground. Since 2019, the foundation has sent organoids, which it describes as “tiny 3D replicas of an organ that mimic cell behavior,” to the orbiting laboratory across six missions.

Once the cells are in space, scientists can better see how they  change over time and use the information to produce treatments.
Dr. Paula Grisanti, the CEO of the National Stem Cell Foundation, said the research is all about “leveraging the accelerated environment of microgravity” to find cures. 
“Solving the puzzle of these diseases will have a knock-on effect for these and other neurodegenerative diseases that include ALS and a number of rare childhood disorders,” she said. 
“This is truly cutting edge research,” Stivers said. He also pointed to the “serious health challenges” facing Kentucky. 
The money allocated for this research “reinforces our dedication to improving health outcomes, enhancing quality of life, and increasing longevity,” he said. “By helping people live longer, healthier, and more productive lives, we are strengthening families, communities, and the future of the Commonwealth.”

Mackenzie Wallace, the director of public policy at the Alzheimer’s Association, said new research is much needed and appreciated — more than 81,000 Kentuckians live with an Alzheimer’s diagnosis. 
“Those numbers are probably likely to be higher, because it’s not always easy to get a diagnosis,” Wallace told the Lantern. “We also know that, to go with that, there’s about 175,000 caregivers that are providing hundreds of hours and millions of dollars in unpaid care to take care of those Kentuckians that are living with the disease. So, it has a great impact on the Commonwealth.” 
Kentucky also has about 5,000 people with MS and 12,000 with Parkinson’s. There’s no cure for Alzheimer’s, though new treatments have proven promising when used in the early stages of the disease.  
“This (research) makes me very excited for what could continue to be coming down the pipeline, and … what can continue to be happening right here in Kentucky, which is probably the most exciting piece of all,” Wallace said.

Geraldine Thompson has passed on to others.
Ocoee Democratic Rep. LaVon Bracy Davis came up with the chant that took hold of the Wednesday press conference, calling for the Republican-controlled Legislature to pass a Florida Voting Rights Act. Bracy Davis plans to run for Thompson’s former seat in Orange County, with her family’s blessing.

“At Sen. Thompson’s funeral, one of the speakers mentioned, ‘Who’s next?’ And I thought long and hard about it. It’s us,” Bracy Davis told the Florida Phoenix. “It’s those that are still here, those that are still trying to fight for democracy, equality, and justice. And it’s our time and it’s our turn.”
Thompson, who spent most of the past two decades serving in both chambers of the Legislature, died in office on Feb. 13 following complications from knee surgery.
Bracy Davis is sponsoring a bill, HB 1409, the late senator filed last year, which would establish same-day voting registration, make Election Day a state holiday, require election materials to be offered in other languages, and dismantle the state election police.
Meanwhile, Republicans are focused on further restricting the citizen-led ballot initiative process, following the defeat of the abortion-rights and recreational marijuana constitutional amendments.
The bill also honors Florida civil rights trailblazers Harry T. and Harriette V. Moore, who established the Brevard County branch of the NAACP and worked to register hundreds of thousands of Black people to vote. The couple died when a bomb exploded in their house on Christmas night, 1951. While the FBI investigated members of the Ku Klux Klan in connection with the bombing, no one was ever convicted.
The federal Voting Rights Act was gutted. States now want their own versions.

“The idea behind creating a Voting Rights Act to honor the first martyrs of the civil rights movement came about because a few of the speakers from here today went to an event that Sen. Thompson was holding where she told the story about the Moores, and we left that event so inspired by her words and her wisdom that we wanted to memorialize them,” said Abdelilah Skhir, a senior strategist for the ACLU of Florida. “And so we set a goal of creating the most ambitious pro-voter bill ever filed in Florida, and we accomplished that with Sen. Thompson.”
Other speakers at the press conference condemned a state attorney’s decision to drop the charges against the 18-year-old Trump supporter who brandished a machete near an early voting site in northeast Florida.
Martin Harris, a policy associate with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, said he was at the polling location where that happened.
“It’s really concerning the lack of accountability from the state attorney’s office,” he said in an interview with the Phoenix. “I’ve convened with voting rights organizations here in Florida to try to uplift this horrible situation so that it can be prevented in the future, but just the lack of accountability is ridiculous.”

For the Day Eagle Hope Project, federal money has helped volunteers deliver fresh produce and meat to families in need across the remote Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in northern Montana — while putting cash into the hands of farmers, ranchers and meat processors.
The nonprofit generally has less than $300,000 to spend per year. So the $200,000 from a U.S. Department of Agriculture local food buying program drastically raised both the quantity and quality of the food it could distribute.
“They were a major, major contributor to our food,” said Tescha Hawley, who directs the organization, which aims to improve physical, mental and spiritual health.

The USDA recently nixed more than $1 billion from two programs that helped food banks and school meal programs buy local foods, including $660 million for schoolchildren. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins recently described the programs as “nonessential.”
But the move has left hundreds of school systems and food banks reeling. They already face rising food prices and are struggling to help community members with growing food insecurity.

Created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs aimed to build more resilient supply chains of domestic food by connecting schools and food pantries with small ranches, farms and dairies. The program was initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but later expanded by the Biden administration.
The federal programs stimulated the purchase of locally grown fruits, vegetables, dairy and meats — benefiting both the smaller farmers who received fair market pay for their products and the organizations granted funds to buy high quality foods.
The noncompetitive grants sent hundreds of millions of dollars to all 50 states, the District of Columbia and 84 tribal governments, boosting business for more than 8,000 farmers and providing local food to almost as many food banks. The Trump administration is killing the programs, despite Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s campaign against processed food, which he says is “poisoning” Americans.
Without ongoing funding, Hawley said, she would have to rely on cheaper, less nutritious food.
“It’s simple, right? I can get a truck … in here with all highly processed food, no problem,” she said.
Schools are facing a similar challenge: While officials running breakfast and lunch programs would prefer to buy more local products, those are often expensive. And with underfunding, high food costs and labor struggles, school lunch programs are already stretched thin.
In Milan, Tennessee, the federal funds allowed the local school system to buy minimally processed beef from a local stockyard, and broccoli, purple hull peas, tomatoes and melons from local growers.
Vickie Dunaway, who supervises the school system’s food services, told the Tennessee Lookout the federal cuts mean “going backwards” on purchasing healthier foods.
“That will obviously have to be cut out, because our budget will not withstand being able to purchase local,” she said. “Purchasing local, minimally processed food is way more expensive than buying from a distributor.”

A ‘devastating’ cut to food banks

Late last year, USDA said the programs had already spent more than $1 billion on local foods, and announced an expansion of the two programs with an additional $1.13 billion. USDA has killed that $1.13 billion expansion; it is still reimbursing the previously committed funds.
The Trump administration, which has sought to dramatically slash the size of the federal government, told recipients earlier this month that the programs “no longer effectuate the goals of the agency.”
In a statement to Stateline, the USDA said the current administration is “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
“The COVID era is over — USDA’s approach to nutrition programs will reflect that reality moving forward,” the statement said.










The only thing we’ll be able to do is just ration what little we have — to spread it as thinly as possible over the number of households we provide food to.


– Eric Cooper, president and CEO of the San Antonio Food Bank


The nonpartisan National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, which represents the ag department leaders of all 50 states, last month lobbied the federal government to continue the local foods program with permanent funding and ease procurement regulations for school meal programs. Arkansas Secretary of Agriculture Wes Ward, president of the association, said in a statement that the local food programs aid both producers and consumers.
“Investing in local and regional food systems not only strengthens the connections between farmers and their local communities, it bolsters supply chain resiliency as well,” his statement read.
In New Mexico, the program allowed food banks to buy some 900,000 pounds of locally grown food from more than 200 farmers since 2023. Before the program was terminated, the state was expecting close to $3 million in additional funding, Source New Mexico reported.

Jill Dixon, executive director of The Food Depot in northern New Mexico, called the cuts “devastating.”
In Texas, the San Antonio Food Bank counted on USDA’s local food program to help round out the food boxes it provides to families in need. The food bank, which serves more than 100,000 people across 29 Texas counties, largely relies on donated foods from hotels, restaurants and grocery stores.
“The challenge is I might get peanut butter donated, but I don’t have the jelly, or I might have pasta donated, but I don’t have the marinara,” said Eric Cooper, president and CEO of the food bank. “This program allowed us to purchase those items that we didn’t get that then helped round out the food box, or really complement the food that was being donated to give families the ability to make meals.”
The program initially provided the food bank nearly $3 million in grant funding — about 20% of what the organization spends each year on bulk food purchases. It expected a similar amount this year, before USDA’s announcement.
Cooper said cuts come even as the need for assistance rises. Food prices have squeezed families, and mass layoffs of federal workers portend more demand for food assistance in the coming months, he said.
“And we’ll be caught in the middle. And you know, that’s an incredibly uncomfortable place to be. The only thing we’ll be able to do is just ration what little we have — to spread it as thinly as possible over the number of households we provide food to.”

A boost for school lunches

For years, school meal programs have struggled with tight margins. Not only do they have to meet strict nutritional guidelines, but schools also face lagging reimbursement from the federal government and spend millions covering the cost of students’ unpaid meal debt.
At the 1,600-student Monticello School District in Arkansas, that debt is approaching $60,000.
So $50,000 from USDA’s local food program was a significant boost to the bottom line.
“That was such a help,” said Amanda West, the district’s child nutrition director.
The southeast Arkansas district used grant money to buy locally grown ground beef. The beef went into dishes including taco salad, meatloaf and spaghetti.
West said staff and students immediately noticed a difference in taste from conventionally purchased meats. And though the local product cost more, West said it also yielded more because it was not full of additives that cause the meat to shrink when cooked.
West, who is the president of the Arkansas School Nutrition Association, noted that her state is home to the nation’s highest rates of food insecurity.

West had hoped to see the local foods program help turn that tide by bringing more stability to school meal programs and growing the state economy by boosting local farmers, ranchers and distributors.
“We’re all upset about it. I hate that we’re not receiving it because grocery prices are 30, 40% higher than what they were a few years ago, and it really hurts our budget,” she said. “It helped a lot of districts, including mine, and it would be amazing if we could get it back.”
On top of the local foods program cuts, congressional Republicans are considering billions in potential cuts to free and reduced-price school meal programs — cuts the School Nutrition Association says could potentially affect millions of American students.
The federal government partially subsidizes breakfast, lunch and after-school snack programs at rates calculated by the income level of students’ families.
The School Nutrition Association, which represents 50,000 school meal providers across the country, said the school meals are the healthiest many American children receive. But that group says federal reimbursements are far from adequate, leaving members worried about the future of their meal programs.
In a recent association survey of more than 1,390 school meal directors, more than 90% reported serious or moderate concern over the financial sustainability of their school meal programs three years from now.

Andy Beshear decided to let a bill become law that not only allows Kentucky schools to make up days lost to bad winter weather and floods, but also protects a controversial online school from enrollment caps imposed by state education officials. 
Beshear allowed House Bill 241 to become law without his signature. The bill’s passage in the General Assembly was in doubt for a time after the Senate added a provision to protect the Kentucky Virtual Academy’ after the Kentucky Department of Education sought to curb its enrollment due to poor student performance and failure to meet staffing requirements.
The bill was introduced to provide relief to Kentucky school districts running out of their 10 NTI days, or non-traditional instruction days, this school year. Even before Kentucky was hit with widespread floods in mid-February, some schools had closed and temporarily moved to virtual instruction due to bad winter weather or sickness. 
Leading up to the veto period, a free conference committee made up of House and Senate members reached an agreement on the bill that allows public schools to waive five required days and make up for lost instruction by lengthening the school day, while the free conference committee also agreed to “guardrails” to limit enrollment at the Kentucky Virtual Academy.
A governor’s office press release said Beshear’s action “is due to the General Assembly’s contradiction of their own actions and attitudes toward in-person learning.” In 2021, lawmakers approved legislation ending a mask mandate in K-12 schools and limited school districts to 10 NTI days a school year. 
“The General Assembly previously mandated that children return to in-person learning during the pandemic, yet now they are promoting all-virtual learning,” the release said. 
When Rep. Timmy Truett, R-McKee, originally presented the bill to the House Primary and Secondary Education Committee, he said most educators know virtual learning is “not as good as in-seat instruction.” He is an elementary school principal himself. 
“I’m telling you firsthand — it is not,” Truett said. “It’s not, but it does beat the alternative. When you’re off school for two weeks because of weather or not going to see your kids for a month because of flooding, a virtual instruction day is so much more valuable than not seeing your kids at all.”
Truett also said that he didn’t think the Republican-controlled General Assembly would approve a bill that just increased the number of NTI days each school district gets. One committee member, Rep. Felica Rabourn, R-Turners Station, voted against the bill at the time and said she strongly opposed giving more NTI days and would prefer schools “have zero.” 
Kentucky school districts are typically allowed no more than 10 NTI days in a school year.
However, Senate Republicans argued for their addition which would have blocked state-imposed limits on enrollment at the Kentucky Virtual Academy, which is based out of the Cloverport Independent Schools. They cited testimony from parents of students who are enrolled in the online program. 
Concerns about the Kentucky Virtual School have been reported by the Louisville Courier Journal and Lexington Herald-Leader, which highlighted numerous accusations and lawsuits raised against Stride, a for-profit company that has a contract to run the virtual academy. While it serves students across the state through online instruction, the academy is attached to the district in Breckinridge County.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/flood2_001-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Getty Images)Electricity demand for a controversial Indiana economic development project has doubled, according to a recent filing with the transmission operator serving most of the Midwest.
The Limitless Exploration/Advanced Pace (LEAP) Research and Innovation District, led by the Indiana Economic Development Corp. (IEDC), is among the costliest economic development projects the state has attempted. Land buys and water supply struggles have dominated LEAP discussions, but electricity supply is quickly rising to the forefront.
Wabash Valley Power Alliance filed an “expedited project review request” earlier this month with the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, writing that “additional load has committed” to the district.
“The total demand in the district is estimated to be 1200 (megawatts). This represents a 600 (megawatt) increase to a prior approved submission,” the power alliance continued.
Eli Lilly & Co. is LEAP’s sole confirmed tenant. The homegrown pharmaceutical giant plans to invest $13 billion into a research and medicine-manufacturing facility, creating an estimated 1,300 jobs.
It may get company at LEAP. Meta, Facebook’s parent company, struck a “tentative deal” with the city of Lebanon in November for an initial $800 million investment.
IEDC spokeswoman Erin Sweitzer said the additional load is what’s needed to build out the Eli Lilly and Meta projects. No other tenants have been added at this point.
To meet the need, the power alliance plans to connect into existing lines in Whitestown. It described plans to construct more than 30 miles of new line, two circuit-breaker configurations, a new substation and a station. There was no estimated cost on the project, which has a projected in-service date of June 2029.
The expedited request was required to make that deadline, according to the filing. Waiting for a 2026 approval “does not allow enough time to get the network infrastructure in service by the requested date,” the power alliance wrote.
An initial request last year for 600 megawatts was expected to cost $222 million and be in service by the end of 2026.

Ralph Norman says he’ll likely join the expectedly crowded governor’s race, calling it his only opportunity to try for the state’s highest profile office.
With the office really up for grabs once every eight years, 2026 represents his lone opportunity to make that bid, the Fifth District congressman told the SC Daily Gazette on Tuesday.
“I can do this now,” said the 71-year-old, adding he has no desire to run in 2034 for a job that would continue well into his 80s.
Asked how seriously he was considering entering the race, Norman characterized it as a 65% likelihood.
Fox News and Punchbowl News, an online national politics publication, had previously reported the Rock Hill Republican’s interest in the office.
“When the opportunity is there, you have to look at it,” said Norman, who did not give a timeline on an official decision.
Norman could be part of a crowded field for the Republican nomination to succeed Gov. Henry McMaster, who is term-limited by law.
At 77, McMaster is South Carolina’s oldest governor ever. He’s also the state’s longest-serving elected governor, since he initially ascended to the job in 2017 after then-Gov. Nikki Haley joined the first Trump administration, giving him almost two years in the role before his first election to the office.
There is no one officially in the governor’s race yet.
But Norman’s potential opponents include a colleague in Congress, First District Rep. Nancy Mace. Others widely expected to run are Lt. Gov. Pam Evette and Attorney General Alan Wilson. State Sens. Josh Kimbrell and Sean Bennett have also said they’re considering a bid.
Norman said a competitive race is good for the state.
“It brings out the best in people,” he told the Gazette.
Filing for the election doesn’t start until March 2026, although campaigns will be announced well before then. By law, candidates have to file ethics disclosures once they start raising money. Norman said he’s had discussions with political consultants evaluating the race.
Norman, a Rock Hill developer, won his first elected office to the South Carolina House in 2004 and then launched a failed bid for Congress. He lost to longtime incumbent Rep. John Spratt in November 2006.
He re-gained his seat at the Statehouse in 2009 via a special election.
He won his congressional seat in a 2017 special election after then-Rep. Mick Mulvaney resigned to serve as President Donald Trump’s budget director. That race gave him experience in a crowded GOP primary, as he ultimately emerged the winner of a seven-way race.
He easily won a fourth full term in November in the ruby red Fifth District, which is anchored in his home county of York and stretches from Spartanburg County southeast to Sumter County. Still, he would need to work on his statewide recognition, according to results of a Winthrop Poll released earlier this month, which showed many self-identified Republicans were not familiar with him.
Before running for office, Norman grew his father’s construction business, the Warren Norman Company, into one of the state’s most successful commercial real estate firms. He is by far the wealthiest member of South Carolina’s delegation, according to annual disclosures.
He believes his blend of business and politics would be a bonus as the state’s CEO.
“You have to make sure every dollar is spent right,” he said.
In Congress, he sits on the House Budget, Rules and Financial Services Committees and is a key member of the chamber’s uber-conservative Freedom Caucus, which he helped launch in the South Carolina House.
Some of his votes that gained him national attention include in initially working to block Kevin McCarthy as speaker in 2023, before switching to support him, then in January opposing the re-election of Speaker Mike Johnson, before backing him.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SC6-1-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

Almost over night, a remote yet beautiful square mile of land deep within the nation’s interior became the third largest city in Wyoming, populated by people who were rounded up in raids and sent packing, hemmed in by guard towers and floodlights.
Hysteria, patriotism and racism — all things the U.S. government later acknowledged — allowed President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to invoke the act after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and then an executive order that allowed federal, state and local authorities to round up anyone of Japanese descent living on the West coast and send them to camps like Heart Mountain.
Though two-thirds of the people were American citizens of Japanese-American descent, their homes and business were lost, and they survived Wyoming’s rugged weather with whatever they could cram into a suitcase.
Current U.S. President Donald J. Trump recently invoked the act, which was passed in 1798, revoking protection status for Venezuelan immigrants who were living here legally, declaring a multi-national drug cartel to be running gangs in America. The presidential action is now tied up in a host of court action, including whether residents who were here legally can have their status revoked without due process, and whether the executive branch can invoke the act when not at war or without approval of Congress.
Heart Mountain, run by the nonpartisan Heart Mountain Foundation, is just a dozen miles from the Montana border, created from Roosevelt’s order. The museum points out that the camps happened under a Democratic president, while apologies and reparations came from Republicans. It’s not silent about what happened at the camp, nor what it could mean that the same acts and policies are being resurrected today, even if used in a different context.
“We need to acknowledge that it’s not about responding to Donald Trump,” Heart Mountain Executive Director Aura Sunada Newlin said on a recent tour. “Immigration policy is something our country has struggled with for a long time. We have not treated immigrants with a lot of humanity.”
She said places and museums like Heart Mountain help “humanize history” so that people understand something abstract — like political policies — and how it affects people in America and their families.
“We have to be willing to discuss these challenging issues,” she said.
History and Heart Mountain
In 1812, when the Alien Enemies Act was first used, the concern was for British sympathizers. In 1918, as many as 6,500 Germans suspected of being alien enemies were rounded up. And, during World War II the act was invoked to round-up and imprison citizens and foreign nationals alike who shared a common Japanese heritage.
Heart Mountain, an out-of-sight place, has a few scattered buildings that stand as a reminder of what happened the last time a president invoked the power to round up people based on nationality or race.
  The entry into the Heart Mountain Museum which chronicles the confinement of Japanese Americans from the West coast in Wyoming during World War II (Photo by Darrell Ehrlick of the Daily Montanan).
Heart Mountain was so hastily constructed that the “green lumber” used for military style barracks hadn’t fully dried. By the time it cured in the wind-blown high mountain region, about a dozen miles from the Montana border, gaps in the barracks could span a half-inch, leading to the joke that the camps had both hot and cold-running dust.
Residents who were used to warmer coastal climates weren’t quite prepared for the harsh winters or the pounding summer sun.
Heart Mountain became the largest “camps” of the Wartime Relocation Administration, which rounded up first- and second-generation immigrants from the west coast states and sent them deep into the Rocky Mountain interior near Powell, Wyoming. At its height, more than 11,000 residents lost their homes, businesses and even pets in the name of national security. Another detention camp was located in Missoula, a camp that was created even before Roosevelt’s executive order.
In an official apology issued by the U.S. government decades later, the federal government admitted the reason for the camps wasn’t safety, security or even threats of espionage, instead it was racism and political incompetence that created the camps that dotted the American interior.
Such camps had been contemplated for years by then, by leaders such as Roosevelt. White Americans had regarded their Japanese-American counterparts in places like California and Oregon with suspicion for their growing prosperity, and willingness to take jobs others weren’t.
When World War II ended by dropping devastating bombs on Imperial Japan, the camps disbanded and residents were forced to resume their lives, often feeling shame about the three-year hiatus that ripped some families apart.
Today, not many of the buildings from the original Heart Mountain site remain. A few barracks and the towering smokestack from the hospital and infirmary rise to challenge the summit of Heart Mountain. Ironically, most of the barracks that were built were displaced themselves, sold for $1 each to returning soldiers who needed homes after the end of World War II. Those barracks are still parts of homesteads, farms and ranches today. The town site that included schools, a newspaper, mess halls and a furniture manufacturing building has returned to a field not unlike the others that surround it. Down the hill, close to a guard tower with razor wire that is still standing, a Smithsonian-affiliated museum tells stories about hysteria, racism, distrust and families who were traumatized after being rounded up and relocated.
A legacy, pilgrimage, and lasting effects

Executive Director Sunada Newlin doesn’t just know the history of this place because she’s studied it — she’s lived with it her whole life, even though she was born decades after the camp closed. Her grandparents were some the residents, even though they had lived in Wyoming, coming first to work as railroad laborers and miners. Still, her family was placed there, and in a display that highlights some of camp’s residents’ military service during World War II are items from her grandfather’s time in the U.S. Army. He was serving his country while his family was incarcerated. And, in another twist of historical irony, a unit of Japanese-American soldiers fighting in Europe would help liberate the German Nazi concentration camp of Dachau, while family members in America were imprisoned.
The museum and its legacy includes the Simpson-Mineta Institute, names for recently deceased former Wyoming Sen. Alan K. Simpson and Norman Mineta, who became lifelong friends after meeting each other as youth in Boy Scouts — Simpson a ranch kid from the area, and Mineta one of those incarcerated there. Despite the political differences, Simpson was a Republican and Mineta a Democrat, they came together to form a friendship and ongoing dialogue about solutions. The Institute is looking to continue that legacy of dialogue, and Sunada Newlin said that’s one of the ways that Heart Mountain can become something more than a place to chronicle inhumanity.
However, the lasting effects of an immigration policy nearly 80 years ago still reverberate. Every summer, Heart Mountain hosts a “pilgrimage” where families and the descendants of families come back to remember what happened, as well as work through the aftermath, which left many families devastated and broken, losing a lifetime of work and property.
“We’ve moved away from reminding people that two-thirds of the people who came here were American citizens because the fact is that we shouldn’t have done this to anyone,” Sunada Newlin said. “Just because some weren’t citizens doesn’t mean it was right.”
Sunada Newlin said that learning more and understanding about generational trauma has been helpful. For many of the camp’s incarcerees, their time in Wyoming wasn’t discussed, but that doesn’t mean the families weren’t affected. Children, many born at Heart Mountain, were encouraged to assimilate, abandon any Japanese traditions, and work even harder to fit into American society. Those effects still ripple, she said, even as the latest generation of Japanese-Americans seems ready to claim proudly its history, converting their family’s history and ties to the camps as a point of pride rather than shame.

Her grandfather was incarcerated at the camp, yet still fought for America during World War II (Photo by Darrell Ehrlick of the Daily Montanan).
“This place of pain and loss, we’re relearning that part of our history and there’s a lot of healing that needs to be done,” Sunada Newlin said.
She said part of that pain comes from not doing anything wrong, yet being punished.
“The message was: You’re dangerous,” Sunada Newlin said. “And in the Japanese culture, you’re not supposed to do anything that would bring shame upon your culture or family.”
She said that most of the incarcerees believed the best way to demonstrate their patriotism was through compliance, largely “for the sake of their children.” However, Heart Mountain’s history — nearly 14,000 people would call it home for some of the war’s duration — includes the largest number of draft resisters from any Japanese camp. Those resistors became a unique challenge for the government: They said they were willing to serve in the United States military as long as their rights and property were restored.
The purpose of the museum and preserving the space isn’t just to commemorate an ignoble part of the country’s history, rather the aftermath and how it affects its citizens. Sunada Newlin said that the perception that Japanese-Americans who had be incarcerated just resumed their lives is only somewhat true, even though Japanese-Americans have also become a sort of “model minority.”
“That idea itself has become real toxic,” Sunada Newlin said.
 ‘We have to talk about the hard things’

The idea that thousands of people returned to a normal life belies the number of suicides, addiction and broken families that resulted. She said it’s also about connecting with other fractured communities. Newlin said the irony of Heart Mountain is that it became significant to Japanese-Americans, even as it holds a different significance for the Apsaalooke (Crow) people who consider the mountain sacred, but were displaced by European settlers. That’s why Heart Mountain also holds regular ceremonies with Native leaders, including smudging to honor the place that holds deep connections to very different cultural groups.
“A lot of our response when people come to see this place is: I didn’t know about it,” Sunada Newlin said. “Adults are horrified because they didn’t know America did this. It’s also interesting because when school-age kids come here, they get it instantly. They understand picking on groups, on bullying.”
One of the many historical displays that seems to have an outsized effect on students is stories of Japanese-Americans having to leave their pets behind.
“To push the negative stuff under the carpet is why most people don’t know we exist,” Sunada Newlin said. “We have to talk about the hard things in the past so we don’t do this again.”
She said some who come to the museum feel anger, others shame, and some even get defensive, citing the horrific treatment of American soldiers by Imperial Japan during the Bataan Death March.
“Guilt is not a very productive approach. The only way to address what went wrong is to empower the next generation to do something different,” Sunada Newlin said. “It would be sad if this is nothing more than gathering stories. This is a place to find hope for the future, and that future is bringing together communities that wouldn’t necessarily come together.”
For example, recently the center sponsored a friendship and week-long experience for youth members of the Apsaalooke tribe and descendants of Heart Mountain to spend time camping and learning about each other’s culture. Sunada Newlin said they had more in common than they realized.
“It gave them a cause they could own,” she said of the younger generation.
Sunada Newlin and her staff also hope that taking the first step — seeing a museum dedicated to the poor, illegal treatment of citizens by the U.S. government, will give visitors courage to tackle other difficult issues.

The spotlight was recently donated to museum and was used at night to track residents as they needed to use the bathroom or go between buildings (Photo by Darrell Ehrlick of the Daily Montanan).
“We want to be the place where we’re inviting people to have constructive dialogue about very difficult subjects,” Sunada Newlin said. That could range from race, immigration and national security.
“If they were problems that are easily fixed, we would have fixed them a long time ago,” Sunada Newlin said.
Still, as a person whose own family is deeply tied to Heart Mountain, and even as she has led the organization for three years, she was shocked to hear many of the past justifications and plans that led to Heart Mountain be used for a new generation, as migrants are being deported, detained and rounded-up.
“It’s troubling to me personally and for our foundation,” she said. “It’s not necessarily surprising or new. The level is new. The truth is that there’s always been a danger, and so we want to educate as widely as we can.”
As many different visitors that come through doors react, there is one thing that neither Newlin or assistant director Rebecca McKinley, haven’t heard.
“No one has said, ‘This could never happen again,’” McKinley said.

The Senate Judiciary Committee voted unanimously to pass SB 72, which heads next to the Rules Committee, headed by former Senate President Kathleen Passidomo. The companion bill, HB 61, has been referred to two committees but hasn’t been heard.
Sponsored by Sen. Lori Berman, SB 72 would allow candidates to use campaign funds to cover childcare expenses accrued due to campaign-related activities such as participating in events, canvassing, debates, and meetings with constituents or donors. Candidates would provide to the state Division of Elections clear records of all childcare expenses paid for with campaign funds including dates, times, and descriptions of the events engaged in.
A candidate would need to retain receipts or invoices from the eligible childcare provider, along with proof of payment, for at least three years and disclose the expenses in their regular campaign finance reports.
Sen. Tom Leek, coming off one of the most expensive Republican primaries for a state Senate seat, asked Berman whether the bill would allow candidates to use campaign funds to offset childcare if it’s something they routinely pay for anyway.
“If someone has a job and is working throughout the day but also campaigning throughout the day at various times, is a days’ child care a campaign-related expense?” he asked.
Berman replied, “Most likely, not” and added that a candidate would have to apportion the costs of daycare stemming from campaign-related events.
 “You cannot allocate the entire day if you are doing other activities,” Berman said.
What about a person who works full time and pays for childcare but decides to quit their job and run for office, Leek queried. “Is that childcare then a campaign-related expense?” 
Berman again said that the costs of the care could only be submitted for campaign-related events.
“You have to provide all the receipts for the time you had childcare and it has to be specific to that event you did campaign,” Berrman said.
Leek asked Berman who would decide whether the childcare was campaign-related or “campaign plus?”
Berman replied: “I guess the same people who are making the guardrails now for any other campaign expenses.”
A ‘little concerned’
Passidomo, who chairs the powerful Rules Committee, asked Berman whether the bill would allow candidates to pay family members for providing childcare. Passidomo said she supports the concept but remains a “little concerned.” She heard from a campaign donor miffed because they have to pay for childcare costs to attend campaign events but a candidate would be allowed to use donations to cover their costs.
“I understand it, because of all the young people and I like to see them running for office,” Passidomo said. “But I don’t want it to be taken advantage of and, honestly, it will be unless it’s tightly drafted.”
Leek agreed but stressed that his concerns transcend the childcare issue.
“I’m worried about the funnel that is campaign-related expenses. Not only here, but everywhere. People push things through,” he said. Leek added that he “wouldn’t mind” a change that would prevent a candidate from claiming childcare expenses paid to relatives.
Thirty-nine states allow use of campaign contributions for childcare, according to the Vote Mama Foundation, which researches political participation by mothers of young children.
Berman said she will review some of the laws and rulings in those states as she moves forward.
“I’m very much willing to work and tighten up things in the bill to make sure that it’s not abused,” she said.
Berman, who served eight years in the Florida House before winning election to the Senate in 2018, told the Phoenix she waited to run for the Florida Legislature until her son was older. He was 17 when she was first elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2010.

,DC,2025-03-26 16:01:34+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Looming X-date for U.S. default on the debt projected to arrive this summer,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/looming-x-date-us-default-debt-projected-arrive-summer,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump and Congress have until August or September to reach agreement and act on the debt limit, the Congressional Budget Office forecast Wednesday.Otherwise the United States would default for the first time in history, likely leading to a global financial crisis.The nonpartisan CBO projection is similar to an estimate published earlier this week by the Bipartisan Policy Center think tank, which expects the X-date will occur between mid-July and early October.The previous debt limit suspension expired in January, but the Treasury Department has been able to keep paying all the government’s bills through accounting maneuvers called extraordinary measures. When those run out, the country would hit the X-date and a default would begin.The four-page CBO report says the default range “is uncertain” because how much money the federal government brings in as well as how much it spends at a given time is difficult to track. “If the government’s borrowing needs are significantly greater than CBO projects, the Treasury’s resources could be exhausted in late May or sometime in June, before tax payments due in mid-June are received or before additional extraordinary measures become available on June 30,” the report states. “Conversely, if borrowing needs fall short of the amounts in CBO’s projections, the extraordinary measures will permit the Treasury to continue financing government activities longer than expected.”GOP bill on tapRepublicans in Congress are hoping to approve a massive bill in the months ahead that would extend the 2017 tax law, creating $4.5 trillion in new deficits. The package is also supposed to appropriate hundreds of billions of dollars to the Department of Defense and border security initiatives.GOP lawmakers hope to pay for some of those increases in the deficit through spending cuts, but are far from agreement on how best to do that.The debt limit allows the Treasury Department to borrow money to pay all of the country’s bills in full and on time. The federal government must borrow money to pay for spending that Congress has approved that isn’t funded by taxes or other fees.During the last full fiscal year, that imbalance between revenue and spending, also called the deficit, totalled $1.8 trillion. Over decades, annual deficits have added up to a $36.2 trillion national debt.Congress failing to raise or suspend the debt limit before the default date would limit the Treasury Department to spending only the cash it had on hand, a scenario with much broader implications than a partial government shutdown.A default could lead the federal government to delay or simply never make payments on thousands of federal accounts, including Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, troop pay, federal employee salaries and much more.The Treasury Department writes on its website that not raising the debt limit by a specific dollar amount or suspending the debt limit through a future date “would have catastrophic economic consequences.”A Government Accountability Office report lists off several negative repercussions of a default, including that it could trigger runs on banks and money market funds, that it would likely reduce lending to households and businesses, that it would lead to a substantial downgrade to the country’s sovereign credit rating and that it would likely lead to a significant and potentially long-lasting recession.Treasury projection in MayTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent plans to send his department’s default date projection to Congress in May, though he wrote in a March letter that lawmakers should get to work sooner rather than later.“The period of time that cash and extraordinary measures may last is subject to considerable uncertainty due to a variety of factors, including the unpredictability of tax receipts and the normal changes of forecasting the payments and receipts of the U.S. government months into the future,” Bessent wrote. “We expect to provide an update during the first half of May, after the majority of receipts from the April income tax filing season have been received.”Bessent then urged lawmakers “to act promptly to protect the full faith and credit of the United States.”Republican leaders in Congress and the Trump administration have just a few more months to decide how they want to handle this year’s debt limit debate.House Republicans included a proposal in their budget resolution to raise the debt limit by $4 trillion later this year, when GOP lawmakers draft the bill to extend the 2017 tax cuts. But the Senate has yet to agree to that blueprint.Republicans raising the debt limit through the complicated budget reconciliation process would require support from nearly every GOP lawmaker in Congress, since the party holds a paper-thin majority in the House and just 53 seats in the Senate.Nearly two years ago, when Congress sent the last debt limit bill to the White House, 71 House Republicans and 31 GOP senators voted against approval.The other option is for Republicans and Democrats to negotiate a bipartisan agreement on the debt limit that can get the support of at least 60 senators to move past the legislative filibuster.",,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

The unprecedented storm caused an estimated $60 billion in damage and left thousands of homes and businesses in need of repair or a complete rebuild.
This week to mark the “anniversary,” NC Newsline spoke with state Rep. Lindsey Prather (D-Buncombe) who, like many others, has worked tirelessly since September to make sure the region she represents is not forgotten.
The drinking water has been restored. Major roadways have reopened. Cell phone service and internet access are once again widely available. But progress looks very different from locale to locale across the region.
  Rep. Lindsey Prather (Photo: NCGA)
“Some places, you can see a big difference. A lot of the debris has been removed, places are back open, parking lots are open, people are shopping. And then in other places, there’s still, feet-high boulders and there’s still some, you know, a few roads that are closed. I-40 still isn’t fully open at the Tennessee line. So, it really does look a lot different in a lot of places,” Prather said.
One bright spot that came out of the tragedy is the way that the community came together, according to Prather.
“We haven’t lost that. There have been community groups popping up like every week, mutual aid organizations popping up every week and those long-term efforts are really taking place, and it gives me a lot of hope for the next couple of years as we continue to recover.”
Prather said North Carolina expects about $15 billion in recovery funds to come from the federal government. And with the most recent relief bill from Raleigh, the state has spent nearly $1.5 billion.
“We know that we’re going to have to get more from the federal government and we’re also going to have to get more from the state government as well. We have a rainy-day fund at the state level and we’re going to have to start tapping into that because this was a very rainy day.”
Housing remains a chief concern. More than 3,900 households are receiving rental assistance according to the state Department of Public Safety. More than $28.7 million has been paid in disaster unemployment assistance.
There is an urgency to restore both stable housing and the employment picture.
House Bill 47 — the most recent relief bill that Gov. Josh Stein signed into law last week — failed to include small business grants, which industry leaders and business owners have pleaded for.
Veteran western North Carolina journalist Sara Murphy recently chronicled that many child care centers remain closed with young children reeling from the disruption.
Murphy shared with Newsline that until the childcare outlook improves, many parents are going to have difficulty returning to work themselves.
“It’s one thing to promise money, and it’s another to actually facilitate and expedite that delivery. And that’s the key here, because every day you wait, that’s another family who maybe decide they can’t stay another day in this region,” said Murphy.
“The motto of Buncombe County is ‘People to Match Our Mountains.’ The beauty and strength of this region is our community. We don’t want to lose people because of funding that is promised but hasn’t been delivered on time,” she said.
So even as a sense of normalcy can be felt with Helene in the rearview mirror, Prather understands her resilient community will be in recovery mode for years to come.
“As a legislator, I’m really trying to send the message down in Raleigh that the recovery funds for direct disaster relief are incredibly important, and we’ve got to get that stuff done and out on the ground. But we cannot let that overshadow the other long-term issues that we have been and will continue to face like child care, like housing, like women’s health resources in rural areas. We’ve got to make sure that we’re walking and chewing gum at the same time.”

Heaven help us.","Alina Habba is our new chief federal prosecutor and she very recently told accused sex trafficker and rapist Andrew Tate that she's a ""big fan"" of his. Heaven help us. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)It’s not every day we get a chief federal prosecutor who has admitted being a big fan of an alleged sex trafficker and rapist, but here we are.
There are lots of reasons to be concerned about Alina Habba, whom President Trump named as the new interim U.S. attorney for New Jersey on Monday. But chief among those is her drooling over online influencer Andrew Tate.
“I’m a big fan,” Habba told Tate when both appeared on a podcast in January.
When Habba told Tate this, she knew that Tate and his brother had been accused by Romanian authorities of trafficking women, forcing them to appear in pornographic videos that were posted online, and that the two men face charges of “sexual aggression” in the United Kingdom.
“I’m a big fan.”
I’m not going to try to understand the appeal of someone like Andrew Tate, who seems transparently odious. A writer at conservative site The Federalist who claims to have rebuked his moral pitfalls nonetheless argues Tate speaks about masculinity in a way that “boys desperately need to hear.” I assume she’s not talking about Tate’s “Pimping Hoes” podcast, but who knows nowadays.
But even assuming it’s true that Tate has tapped into the minds of boys who need to feel good about themselves, he’s been accused of sexual assault in multiple countries, including the United States (a woman suing him in Florida alleges he lured her to Romania and coerced her into sex work). Why would our new federal prosecutor consider herself a big fan of him? What is she a big fan of?
Perhaps sensing her comments would be a big problem, about two weeks ago, Habba talked to Jan Jekielek of the Epoch Times and tried to walk back her Andrew Tate fangirling — while still claiming that she hadn’t said what she said.
“What I said was — it’s some great manipulation — so the Tate brothers, you know, have a tremendous social media presence in terms of, and what we were discussing were politics in the U.K. He was talking about running. And I am always passionate about people that are vocal against certain things,” she said.
She’s passionate about people who are vocal against certain things, got it. Love the clarity.
Lauren Hersh, national director of anti-trafficking organization World Without Exploitation, told me she was “deeply concerned” about Habba’s interaction with Tate. Hersh said it’s troubling that an attorney who is going to be our state’s new chief prosecutor “would respond to Andrew Tate with any sort of praise.”
“For me it’s less about the gushing and more about the fact this is a person who’s tasked with holding accountable those who exploit. If this is her perspective on someone who is a self-admitted misogynist with very serious allegations of exploitation, I’m concerned how she will hold accountable those who exploit in the state of New Jersey. That’s really the crux of this for me,” she said.
I asked the U.S. Attorney’s Office to comment and I did not hear back. At the White House on Monday, Habba called New Jersey a “neglected state,” citing crime in places like Newark and Camden. Perhaps we don’t have enough sex traffickers for her to gush over.
Reaction to Habba’s appointment from Democrats here in New Jersey has been mixed. Sen. Cory Booker has yet to issue a statement. On News12 Tuesday, Gov. Phil Murphy was respectful, though he seemed irked that Habba implied New Jersey is infested with crime.
“I wish her well. She seems like a very significant talent,” Murphy said. “This is historically a nonpartisan position, so I’m expecting and assume she’ll continue that tradition.”
No mention of her playing footsie with an alleged sex trafficker. Luckily, Sen. Andy Kim knows enough to be horrified.
“The announcement of Alina Habba to be interim US Attorney in New Jersey is an unacceptable partisan choice that will leave New Jersey ill-prepared to take on dangerous challenges like gun violence and drug trafficking. We must do better to keep our communities safe,” Kim said in a statement.

(Photo by Kyle Martin for the North Dakota Monitor)Summit Carbon Solutions is asking North Dakota judges to dismiss appeals in different legal challenges to its five-state carbon capture and storage project.
Attorneys for Summit and North Dakota landowners argued a Summit request for dismissal in a Burleigh County Court on Tuesday. Landowners have appealed the legality of the North Dakota Industrial Commission’s order granting Summit permission to pump carbon dioxide into underground sequestration sites in Mercer, Oliver and Morton counties.
Summit also has filed motions to dismiss appeals related to the North Dakota Public Service Commission’s pipeline route permit.
Summit, based in Iowa, is attempting to move carbon captured at ethanol plants in five states to the underground storage site in North Dakota through a network of pipelines.

The case heard Tuesday in Burleigh County involves landowners who have objected to the storage plan. Summit’s motion to dismiss argues that landowner attorney Derrick Braaten did not notify parties properly and that the case does not belong in Burleigh County but instead belongs in one of the counties where the storage wells are planned.
“This is not the only case where Summit is making these arguments,” Braaten said.
The hourlong hearing on Tuesday focused on procedural issues and not the merits of the appeal. Landowners contend the state Department of Mineral Resources withheld information about Summit’s models that would predict where the carbon dioxide would move when the gas is pumped underground.
Braaten also is involved in appeals on the PSC decision involving Burleigh County, Emmons County, the city of Bismarck and multiple landowners. In those cases, Summit also says not all parties were notified properly.
Among the issues being challenged are the PSC ruling that state zoning rules trump county zoning ordinances on pipelines and that the PSC did not give enough weight to the safety of residents along the proposed route.
A hearing on one motion to dismiss was held Monday and another is set for April 22.
Each of the three cases has a different judge.
No ruling has been issued in either of the motions argued this week.

This story was originally reported by Marissa Martinez of The 19th.  Meet Marissa and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
The federal government employed around 3 million people last year. But by next year’s Equal Pay Day, progress on wage transparency and equity could drop dramatically for the country’s largest employer — a warning sign for the nation’s private sector workers.
Tuesday’s Equal Pay Day, meant to highlight wage inequality across gender and race, falls during an unprecedented period of governmental upheaval. Between unprecedented mass layoffs, President Donald Trump’s reshaping of labor boards, and a targeted backlash to diversity advancements, many gains made among the federal workforce could disappear, experts say.
“It’s not unusual to have different emphases across Republican and Democratic administrations, different levels of enforcement,” said Jocelyn Frye, president of the National Partnership for Women & Families, a national nonpartisan organization that advocates for family policy. “What’s different this time around, unlike the first Trump administration and [any other] since [former President Lyndon B.] Johnson’s administration, they have sought to eliminate the underlying executive actions and infrastructure that is critical to doing robust enforcement.”
During Trump’s first term, he directed the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), a labor board dedicated to investigating discrimination charges, to stop collecting pay data on race and gender from large companies — which a federal judge overruled soon after. He also rolled back the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces executive order, which required federal contractors to comply with 14 labor and civil rights laws, including a paycheck transparency rule.
Trump’s latest attempts to reshape and freeze agencies like the EEOC and National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which handles unionization processes, are yet another step away from addressing wage discrimination complaints from the nation’s workforce.
“If you don’t have the ability to track or try to prove or enforce non-discrimination laws, that’s going to be worse,” said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), a left-leaning think tank. “Those [cuts] are hugely detrimental. They’re going in the wrong direction.”
The so-called Department of Government Efficiency, billionaire Elon Musk’s cost-cutting effort, has fired an estimated 32,000 employees so far, in addition to the 75,000 who have taken deferred buyouts. The group has not published any comprehensive data about those who have been dismissed, including their gender or race.
Coupled with mass layoffs is the administration’s move to aggressively weed out diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts in the federal government, including firings of high-profile women, Democrats and people of color. This could squash any future conversations about pay equity under this White House, said Kelly Dittmar, director of research for the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. The arguments to address inequalities are about systemic changes, rather than individual cases — a theme the current administration has been pushing back on for months, she added.
“There’s no expectation that they would prioritize this issue. They haven’t before,” Dittmar said. “There’s very little pressure from their base to do so. And in the current climate, which I do think is even different than the first [term]… they’re doubling down on [a backlash to diversity] for a whole host of reasons.”

While data is not yet available for Trump’s current staff, women working under his first year in office earned 69 cents to every $1 a man made, wider than the national wage gap at the time of 82 cents per dollar. His first term saw an estimated 37 percent pay gap among staffers, per the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank — a large jump from the last year of former President Barack Obama’s administration, which was estimated to be somewhere under 20 percent.
The White House did not respond to a request for comment about any current or future policies concerning wage equality. Congress requires the administration to publicly share salary information annually on July 1.
Former President Joe Biden got closer to narrowing the gap, particularly toward the end of his term, with a $93,752 average salary for women compared to $94,639 for men. His administration’s efforts to combat inequality included raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour in 2022 for 370,000 federal employees and contractors. He also issued a new rule that barred more than 80 federal agencies from considering workers’ current or past pay in setting their salaries, a practice that has suppressed wages for women by carrying inequities from one job to the next.
Women comprised around 56 percent of Biden’s senior staff, an increase from Obama and Trump’s administrations. Women are already less likely to be Republican, and fewer conservative women work in politics, furthering the current administration’s potential divide, Dittmar said.

Government jobs have traditionally had more transparency in wage gaps compared to the private sector, Dittmar said, with clearer guidelines about seniority and salaries. Addressing the inequities at the federal level has the additional benefit of giving other industries clues and examples of progress, she said.
And the recent tampering with labor board functions sends a very different message to the private sector than previous administrations, Frye said: Nobody is monitoring business practices.
“Nobody is watching, and nobody is paying attention to whether or not you’re discriminating,” Frye said. “It’s hard to say what exactly the private sector pay practices will look like because nobody is going to be scrutinizing it terribly closely. And they know that, and we know that.”
Equal Pay Day has traditionally been held on the symbolic day a woman would have to work to have earned as much as a White man during just the prior year. Wage gaps across the country have decreased between men and women of all races, according to data from the Economic Policy Institute. In 2024, women were paid 18 percent less on average than men, controlling for all factors.
For every White man who earned $1 in 2023, Black women earned 64 cents, Latina women earned 51 cents, Native American women earned 52 cents, and AAPI women earned 82 cents, according to the National Partnership for Women and Families.
The progress after the pandemic shutdown years showcased a tight labor market, according to Gould. This is likely to change over the next year based on the recent waves of federal layoffs and future job insecurity. When unemployment is low, companies have less discretion in hiring, and are more likely to make their offers competitive to entice workers, she said.
But a potential incoming recession means historically disadvantaged workers get hurt first, Gould added.

Signed Tuesday, the directive orders the federal Election Assistance Commission, which distributes grants to states, to start requiring proof of citizenship for those registering to vote within 30 days or face a cutoff in funds.
“If the election denier-in chief tries to interfere with any citizen’s right to vote, with this or any other action, we’ll see him in court,” said Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat who is running for governor in 2026.
The order aligns with the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, or SAVE, that has been a priority for House Republicans to pass and is the latest salvo in Trump‘s false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen due to voter fraud, specifically alleging without evidence that widespread noncitizen voting is occurring in federal elections.
Also condemning the order is Common Cause Michigan, a nonpartisan pro-democracy watchdog group, which encouraged state lawmakers to reassert their right to control Michigan elections.
“A president does not set election law for Michigan and never will. Trump’s executive action is just another transparent attempt to enact baseless voter suppression here in Michigan. Whether it is the block the ballot resolution Michigan Republicans are advancing or this executive order, voter suppression is unwelcome in Michigan, and we will fight it tooth and nail,” said Quentin Turner, Common Cause Michigan Executive Director.
Trump’s order follows a similar attempt by GOP legislators in Michigan who introduced House Joint Resolution B in late January, which House Democrats condemned as a de facto poll tax.
That critique was echoed by Deputy Secretary of State Aghogho Edevbie, a Democrat who is running to replace Benson as Secretary of State.
“Trump is attempting to implement the SAVE Act, via executive fiat, rather than through the legislative process. This is a modern day poll tax as this would impose a cost to vote, because the required documents are usually not free,” posted Edevbie.

Kristi Noem speaks during a bill signing ceremony March 6, 2024, at the Capitol in Pierre as Lt. Gov. Larry Rhoden looks on. (David Bordewyk/South Dakota NewsMedia Association)For a condemnation of Kristi Noem’s performance as governor, just look at what her former lieutenant governor is doing.
You won’t get him to admit that, of course. Larry Rhoden insists Noem did “great things” for South Dakota.
Yet Rhoden has also positioned himself as Governor Reset after taking inspiration from a Native American tribal leader, Chairman J. Garrett Renville of the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate.
Noem’s departure to serve in President Donald Trump’s Cabinet was imminent when Renville delivered a State of the Tribes address to the Legislature on Jan. 15.
“Today, let’s reset,” Renville said, sensing an opportunity for better state-tribal relations. “Today, let’s rebuild. Today, let’s start to listen and actually hear.”
Rhoden could have fired back. That’s what Noem did two years ago after Crow Creek Tribal Chairman Peter Lengkeek used his State of the Tribes address to call for better state-tribal collaboration. Her office retaliated against Lengkeek with an 800-word email to the media saying his speech was a “message of division” that perpetuated “false narratives.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
When Rhoden delivered his first address to the Legislature as governor on Jan. 28, he chose to respond differently than Noem. He quoted Renville’s reset invitation and accepted it.
“I could not agree more,” Rhoden said. “We’ve had our ups and downs over the years, but I am asking our tribal leaders to make a fresh start with me.”
Then he took the reset theme and ran with it, using it repeatedly in his public communications.
“I see so much division today — even between those within the same political party,” Rhoden said in a Feb. 28 press release. “As South Dakotans, we need to regain perspective and unite. We need to talk with each other and not at each other. We need to reset.”
During his first two months as governor, Rhoden pushed the reset button so often that his fingers must be cramped and blistered.
He pushed reset on Noem’s penchant for filling her staff with out-of-state ideologues, instead choosing two lifelong South Dakotans with deep experience in state government — Matt Michels and Tony Venhuizen — for two of his first and most important hires (Michels as senior adviser and counsel, and Venhuizen as lieutenant governor).
He pushed reset on Noem’s combative relationship with the media, holding more press conferences during his first two months in office than Noem did during her last two years.
He pushed reset on several years of sharply rising property taxes by quickly ushering his own plan into law, after Noem failed to even propose an idea.
He pushed reset on property rights by signing a ban on eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipelines, after Noem let the issue fester and divide her party to such an extent that 14 Republican legislators lost to challengers in the June primary election.
He pushed reset on Noem’s vindictive attempt to cut state support for South Dakota Public Broadcasting, and he appears ready to sign a budget restoring full funding.
He pushed reset on Noem’s usurpation of legislative power with his signing of three bills — proposed by Chris Karr, a top-ranking state senator — that require greater legislative oversight of state budget transfers, building projects and leases.
And he pushed reset on Noem’s prison debacle by forming a “Project Prison Reset” task force to study South Dakota’s correctional system, after Noem spent and obligated a total of $54 million pursuing an $825 million prison construction plan that lost support during this year’s legislative session.










We need to talk with each other and not at each other. We need to reset.


– Gov. Larry Rhoden


In other areas, Rhoden has missed opportunities for resets by following Noem’s misguided lead. He signed bills allowing concealed pistols at colleges and bars. He approved legislation inviting self-appointed toilet police to clog up the courts with lawsuits accusing people of using the wrong restroom. He praised President Donald Trump’s Oval Office tantrum against the president of Ukraine.
But even those who disagree with some of Rhoden’s decisions would have to admit he’s showing how much governors can do, and how quickly they can get it done, when they focus on the job they’ve got and strive for civility instead of sowing division.
Noem declared last year in the title of her infamous book — the one with the slain dog and goat and the imaginary meeting with Kim Jong Un — that Trump broke politics for the better and there’s “No Going Back.”
How richly ironic it is, then, that her handpicked successor has been “going back” ever since she left, by resetting the state to its pre-Noem brand of politics and accomplishing more in two months than she did in some whole years of her administration.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5-0K4A1118-1024x715.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)For the Day Eagle Hope Project, federal money has helped volunteers deliver fresh produce and meat to families in need across the remote Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in northern Montana — while putting cash into the hands of farmers, ranchers and meat processors.
The nonprofit generally has less than $300,000 to spend per year. So the $200,000 from a U.S. Department of Agriculture local food buying program drastically raised both the quantity and quality of the food it could distribute.
“They were a major, major contributor to our food,” said Tescha Hawley, who directs the organization, which aims to improve physical, mental and spiritual health.
The USDA recently nixed more than $1 billion from two programs that helped food banks and school meal programs buy local foods, including $660 million for schoolchildren. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins recently described the programs as “nonessential.”
But the move has left hundreds of school systems and food banks reeling. They already face rising food prices and are struggling to help community members with growing food insecurity.
Created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs aimed to build more resilient supply chains of domestic food by connecting schools and food pantries with small ranches, farms and dairies. The program was initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but later expanded by the Biden administration.
The federal programs stimulated the purchase of locally grown fruits, vegetables, dairy and meats — benefiting both the smaller farmers who received fair market pay for their products and the organizations granted funds to buy high quality foods.
The noncompetitive grants sent hundreds of millions of dollars to all 50 states, the District of Columbia and 84 tribal governments, boosting business for more than 8,000 farmers and providing local food to almost as many food banks. The Trump administration is killing the programs, despite Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s campaign against processed food, which he says is “poisoning” Americans.
Without ongoing funding, Hawley said, she would have to rely on cheaper, less nutritious food.
“It’s simple, right? I can get a truck … in here with all highly processed food, no problem,” she said.
USDA cuts programs bringing local food into schools, food banks

Schools are facing a similar challenge: While officials running breakfast and lunch programs would prefer to buy more local products, those are often expensive. And with underfunding, high food costs and labor struggles, school lunch programs are already stretched thin.
In Milan, Tennessee, the federal funds allowed the local school system to buy minimally processed beef from a local stockyard, and broccoli, purple hull peas, tomatoes and melons from local growers.
Vickie Dunaway, who supervises the school system’s food services, told the Tennessee Lookout the federal cuts mean “going backwards” on purchasing healthier foods.
“That will obviously have to be cut out, because our budget will not withstand being able to purchase local,” she said. “Purchasing local, minimally processed food is way more expensive than buying from a distributor.”’
A ‘devastating’ cut to food banks
Late last year, USDA said the programs had already spent more than $1 billion on local foods, and announced an expansion of the two programs with an additional $1.13 billion. USDA has killed that $1.13 billion expansion; it is still reimbursing the previously committed funds.
The Trump administration, which has sought to dramatically slash the size of the federal government, told recipients earlier this month that the programs “no longer effectuate the goals of the agency.”
In a statement to Stateline, the USDA said the current administration is “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
“The COVID era is over — USDA’s approach to nutrition programs will reflect that reality moving forward,” the statement said.










The only thing we’ll be able to do is just ration what little we have — to spread it as thinly as possible over the number of households we provide food to.


– Eric Cooper, president and CEO of the San Antonio Food Bank


The nonpartisan National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, which represents the ag department leaders of all 50 states, last month lobbied the federal government to continue the local foods program with permanent funding and ease procurement regulations for school meal programs. Arkansas Secretary of Agriculture Wes Ward, president of the association, said in a statement that the local food programs aid both producers and consumers.
“Investing in local and regional food systems not only strengthens the connections between farmers and their local communities, it bolsters supply chain resiliency as well,” his statement read.
In New Mexico, the program allowed food banks to buy some 900,000 pounds of locally grown food from more than 200 farmers since 2023. Before the program was terminated, the state was expecting close to $3 million in additional funding, Source New Mexico reported.
Jill Dixon, executive director of The Food Depot in northern New Mexico, called the cuts “devastating.”
In Texas, the San Antonio Food Bank counted on USDA’s local food program to help round out the food boxes it provides to families in need. The food bank, which serves more than 100,000 people across 29 Texas counties, largely relies on donated foods from hotels, restaurants and grocery stores.
“The challenge is I might get peanut butter donated, but I don’t have the jelly, or I might have pasta donated, but I don’t have the marinara,” said Eric Cooper, president and CEO of the food bank. “This program allowed us to purchase those items that we didn’t get that then helped round out the food box, or really complement the food that was being donated to give families the ability to make meals.”
The program initially provided the food bank nearly $3 million in grant funding — about 20% of what the organization spends each year on bulk food purchases. It expected a similar amount this year, before USDA’s announcement.
Cooper said cuts come even as the need for assistance rises. Food prices have squeezed families, and mass layoffs of federal workers portend more demand for food assistance in the coming months, he said.
“And we’ll be caught in the middle. And you know, that’s an incredibly uncomfortable place to be. The only thing we’ll be able to do is just ration what little we have — to spread it as thinly as possible over the number of households we provide food to.”

A boost for school lunches
For years, school meal programs have struggled with tight margins. Not only do they have to meet strict nutritional guidelines, but schools also face lagging reimbursement from the federal government and spend millions covering the cost of students’ unpaid meal debt.
At the 1,600-student Monticello School District in Arkansas, that debt is approaching $60,000.
So $50,000 from USDA’s local food program was a significant boost to the bottom line.
“That was such a help,” said Amanda West, the district’s child nutrition director.
The southeast Arkansas district used grant money to buy locally grown ground beef. The beef went into dishes including taco salad, meatloaf and spaghetti.
West said staff and students immediately noticed a difference in taste from conventionally purchased meats. And though the local product cost more, West said it also yielded more because it was not full of additives that cause the meat to shrink when cooked.
West, who is the president of the Arkansas School Nutrition Association, noted that her state is home to the nation’s highest rates of food insecurity.
West had hoped to see the local foods program help turn that tide by bringing more stability to school meal programs and growing the state economy by boosting local farmers, ranchers and distributors.
“We’re all upset about it. I hate that we’re not receiving it because grocery prices are 30, 40% higher than what they were a few years ago, and it really hurts our budget,” she said. “It helped a lot of districts, including mine, and it would be amazing if we could get it back.”
On top of the local foods program cuts, congressional Republicans are considering billions in potential cuts to free and reduced-price school meal programs — cuts the School Nutrition Association says could potentially affect millions of American students.
The federal government partially subsidizes breakfast, lunch and after-school snack programs at rates calculated by the income level of students’ families.
The School Nutrition Association, which represents 50,000 school meal providers across the country, said the school meals are the healthiest many American children receive. But that group says federal reimbursements are far from adequate, leaving members worried about the future of their meal programs.
In a recent association survey of more than 1,390 school meal directors, more than 90% reported serious or moderate concern over the financial sustainability of their school meal programs three years from now.

Free.,U.S. Supreme Court in 7-2 ruling upholds Biden administration regulation on ghost guns,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-7-2-ruling-upholds-biden-administration-regulation-ghost-guns,,"This report was updated at 2:30 p.m. EDT.WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court Wednesday overwhelmingly upheld a Biden-era regulation governing kits that can be assembled into untraceable firearms, also known as ghost guns.In the 7-2 decision, Justice Neil Gorsuch, the author of the opinion, said that the regulation from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is “not inconsistent"" with the Gun Control Act of 1968. The rule was written during the administration of former President Joe Biden.In his opinion, Gorsuch said that the Gun Control Act allows the ATF to regulate ""any weapon . . . which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive.""“Neither the rule of lenity nor constitutional avoidance applies where, as here, the statute’s text, context, and structure make clear it reaches some weapon parts kits and unfinished frames or receivers,” he continued.Conservative Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas wrote a dissent.The case, Bondi v. VanDerStok, renamed to reflect Trump administration Attorney General Pam Bondi, raised the question before the high court as to whether a 2022 rule issued by ATF overstepped in expanding the definition of “firearms” to include “ghost guns” under a federal firearms law.Wednesday’s ruling falls out of line with recent gun-related cases before the conservative-led Supreme Court that struck down a ban on bump stocks and struck down a New York law that banned concealed carry.The nine justices initially heard oral arguments back in October.Ghost guns are firearms without serial numbers. The kits can easily be bought online and quickly assembled in parts.Law enforcement officials use serial numbers to track guns that are used in crimes and have raised concerns about how ghost guns can impede investigations involving firearms.The regulation that was challenged by gun advocacy groups did not ban ghost guns, but instead required manufacturers of those firearm kits or parts to add a serial number to the products, as well as conduct background checks on potential buyers.The ATF rule also clarified those kits are considered covered by the 1968 Gun Control Act under the definition of a “firearm.”‘Buy Build Shoot’ kitsGorsuch noted in his opinion that the statute in the Gun Control Act gives the ATF the authority to regulate any weapon designed to “expel a projectile by the action of an explosive” through two requirements.The first is that there needs to be a “weapon.” The second is that “weapon” has to meet one of three criteria.“It must be able to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive, designed to do so, or susceptible of ready conversion to operate that way,” he said.The appeals court interpreted the ATF regulation as invalid because “no weapon parts kit” can meet those two requirements. Gorsuch said the high court did not agree.“We disagree because, to our eyes, at least some kits will satisfy both,” he said.In the Supreme Court's reasoning, Gorsuch pointed to an example of a ghost gun kit – a Polymer80’s “Buy Build Shoot” kit.He noted the kit came with all the tools needed to build a “Glock-variant semiautomatic pistol.”“And it is so easy to assemble that, in an ATF test, an individual who had never before encountered the kit was able to produce a gun from it in 21 minutes using only ‘common’ tools and instructions found in publicly available YouTube videos,” Gorsuch said.He said when assessing if the “Buy Build Shoot” kit applies to the two requirements, he first questioned if the word “weapon” could apply to a kit.“Reflecting as much, everyday speakers sometimes use artifact nouns to refer to unfinished objects—at least when their intended function is clear,” he wrote. “A friend might speak of the table he just bought at IKEA, even though hours of assembly remain ahead of him.”Gorsuch said the same logic can apply to the kit.“But even as sold, the kit comes with all necessary components, and its intended function as instrument of combat is obvious,” he said. “Really, the kit’s name says it all: “Buy Build Shoot.”As for the second requirement, Gorsuch noted the kit met it because “a person without any specialized knowledge can convert a starter gun into a working firearm using everyday tools in less than an hour.”Thomas dissentJustice Thomas argued that firearm kits do not meet “the statutory definition of ‘firearm.’”Thomas also wrote the opinion on a 2022 decision that greatly expanded the Second Amendment by determining the New York concealed carry law violated the 14th Amendment of the Constitution.“The majority instead blesses the Government’s overreach based on a series of errors regarding both the standard of review and the interpretation of the statute,” he wrote in his dissent Wednesday. “Congress could have authorized ATF to regulate any part of a firearm or any object readily convertible into one. But, it did not.”He argued that the ATF regulation rewrites what a “frame” and ""receiver"" is on a weapon. Thomas wrote that ghost guns do not meet this definition because they are “unfinished.”Thomas also pushed back against the majority opinion on how easy it is to assemble a firearm through a kit.“Special tools and an indeterminate amount of time are required to convert an unfinished weapon-parts kit into a functional weapon,” he said. “Thus, even assuming that the ordinary meaning of ‘weapon’ does not resolve whether the term includes weapon-parts kits, at minimum the term ‘weapon’ cannot encompass weapon-parts kits in ‘the same way’ it covers disassembled firearms.”",,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

The House rejected her amendment on a party-line vote. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — House Republicans refused to consider a plea from Democratic Rep. Valdenia Winn to send a message that there is no place for racism in the state of Kansas.
Winn, a Kansas City Democrat, proposed an amendment to House Bill 2299, which declares that antisemitism is against the public policy of the state. She wanted to expand the language to condemn all forms of racism and discrimination.
“This is not rocket science,” Winn said during a March 19 debate in the House. “This is not trigonometry. This is basic.”
Republicans wouldn’t hear it.
Rep. Susan Estes, a Wichita Republican, objected to Winn’s proposal under a House rule that says amendments have to be “germane” to the existing bill. That sent members of the rules committee into a scramble to conceive a reason to reject the Democrat’s idea.
The way Rep. Susan Humphries explained it, the test for whether an amendment is germane is whether the amendment would expand the scope of the bill, a test rarely applied to amendments proposed by Republicans. The Wichita Republican, who serves as rules chair, explained the situation through a metaphor: You can’t expand a bill about apples to be about all fruit. Under that standard, she ruled, the House could not consider Winn’s proposal.
“I am not opposed to having an act that declares racism to be against public policy,” Humphries said. “Like, let’s do that if we feel like it’s needed. That wording, that expanding from antisemitism to discrimination and racism is an expanding and super close call. But this amendment is not germane.”
Republicans determine which bills get a hearing and whether they advance, making it unlikely that Winn could get anywhere with a standalone bill that dealt with racism.
Rep. Stephanie Clayton, an Overland Park Democrat, argued the amendment was germane because “anyone who had the most rudimentary knowledge of history would understand is that antisemitism is racism.”
“So when we’re talking about apples, oranges, fruit, squares, rectangles, whatever analogy you want to use for what is broad and what isn’t, racism and antisemitism are the same thing, ergo, this amendment is germane,” Clayton said.
Winn said her amendment “does not dilute the bill. It does not say an apple is not a fruit, and all these other things.”
“Let’s make Kansans clear of our intent, that there’s no place for discrimination and/or antisemitism and/or racism in the state of Kansas,” Winn said. “That’s all the amendment. There’s no ‘gotcha’ here, any place, there’s nothing else. It’s simple, people.”
Winn challenged Humphries’ ruling, but the House supported Humphries’ ruling with an 86-36 party-line vote. The House then passed the bill by a 116-8 vote.
Estes introduced the bill, and the House Education Committee that she chairs sponsored the bill. It relies on a definition of antisemitism established by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.
The bill outlaws encouragement, support, praise, participation in or threat of violence or vandalism against Jewish people or property. It makes it illegal for people to wear a mask to conceal their identity while intending to harass or discriminate against Jewish students, faculty or employees on school property. And it bans antisemitic curriculum in any domestic or study abroad programs or classes.
Rep. Pat Proctor, a Leavenworth Republican, said he struggled with the bill, having spent 25 years in the Army fighting for freedoms, including free speech.
But, he said, he was bothered by the recent vandalism of a Catholic church in Wichita.
“And it occurred to me that if that had been Christians attacking a mosque, it would have been all over the country. It would have been on CNN, it would have been on Fox News, it would have been on MSNBC, and all over the country, everybody screaming in outrage, an attack on Muslims, but because it was an attack on Christians, you heard nary a word,” Proctor said.
Vandalism and threats of violence are not free speech, he said.
“Why is it OK for folks to attack Jewish students because they support some people on the other side of the world — but it’s not OK, hypothetically, for somebody to be attacking a mosque?” Proctor said.
The Kansas chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations issued a statement of solidarity with the Catholic community following the vandalism at St. Patrick’s Catholic Church.
Rep. John Carmichael, a Wichita Democrat whose district includes the church, disputed Proctor’s assessment of the news coverage.
“It was not ignored,” Carmichael said. “The FBI was on the scene that very day, investigating on the basis that this was motivated by religious animus, and I guess the representative from Leavenworth perhaps listens to Fox News. I listened to CNN, and I heard plenty about it on the national news.”

(Photo by John Cole/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)PHILADELPHIA — Describing it as the “center of the universe in this community,” Gov. Josh Shapiro visited Al-Aqsa Islamic Society on Tuesday evening to announce a $5 million grant for the community center.
“I know that right now, as we’re facing, tumult overseas and we’re facing a lot of rising hate here at home, institutions are more important than ever before, and having community centers like this are more important than ever before,” Shapiro said to the room full of people sharing iftar, the meal eaten in the evening to break their Ramadan fast.
The Redevelopment Assistance Capital Program (RACP) grant is the largest grant in the history of the commonwealth given to a Muslim organization, according to Shapiro’s office. The expansion will result in 12 new classrooms, a gym, and more spaces to bring the community together.

Asif Hussain, Chairman of the Board of Al-Aqsa Islamic Society, says the goal is to have an “academic center of excellence” in the school, Al-Aqsa Academy. Currently, he said the K-12 school has about 300 students and they have a wait list as the community has grown in recent years.
“The idea would be to have a primary, secondary, and high school all in one building, and for students who are enrolled in primary education to stay for graduation, and this become a very important part of their development and their future endeavors,” Hussain said. He added the school currently has a 100% college placement rate and he would “love to see” 3,000 students enrolled.
A lot of the children and teenagers are African and Middle Eastern and come from impoverished backgrounds, Hussain said, and that all of the students at the school receive scholarships and financial aid to help pay for their tuition.
He said the school utilizes the Educational Improvement Tax Credit Program (EITC) as part of the scholarships given to students, which he’s described as “very helpful.”

Shapiro said his administration has increased funding for education “to a level never seen in the Commonwealth.”
“These are really wonderful kids,” he said. “I think it’s important to invest in centers of community.”
Shapiro said at the governor’s residence recently, he heard from members of the Muslim community expressing “fear because of the policies and the approach of the Trump administration.”
“Tomorrow (Wednesday) night, I’ll be hosting an iftar at the governor’s residence, and I expect that will come up in conversation,” Shapiro added. “It does in nearly every room I’m in, especially with the Muslim community.”
Shapiro described it as a “moment” where he thinks communities are “fearful of the federal government.”
“And that’s deeply concerning to me, and I want the Muslim community to know that they are welcome here in Pennsylvania,” Shapiro said. “They are warmly embraced in Pennsylvania, that I’ve got their back and I’m going to protect them.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/0-1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Leann Ray/West Virginia Watch)This story first appeared on West Virginia Watch. 
West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, signed a bill Monday that will ban a list of artificial food dyes from being included in food items sold in grocery stores or in school lunches.
Republican lawmakers behind the measure have said the synthetic red, blue, green and yellow dyes are unnecessary and harmful. They’ve linked them to behavioral issues in children.
“West Virginia ranks at the bottom of many public health metrics, which is why there’s no better place to lead the ‘Make America Healthy Again’ mission,” Morrisey said. “By eliminating harmful chemicals from our food, we’re taking steps toward improving the health of our residents and protecting our children from significant long-term health and learning challenges.”
Several states are considering similar legislation, and West Virginia is the first state to pass a sweeping synthetic food dye ban.
House Bill 2354 bans the use of seven artificial dyes — Red No. 3, Red No. 40, Yellow No. 5, Yellow No. 6, Blue No. 1, Blue No. 2 and Green No. 3 — in school meals beginning Aug 1.
The dyes would be prohibited along with the preservatives butylated hydroxyanisole and propylparaben, in drugs and food items for sale in the state beginning Jan. 1, 2028.
“This extended deadline allows companies ample time to adjust, protecting consumers from price increases,” a news release from the governor’s office said.
The state’s food and beverage industry pushed back on the measure, warning that it would lead to increased grocery prices and empty shelves. Alternative ingredients don’t exist to scale, the industry said.
Del. Evan Worrell, R-Cabell, maintained that the food industry was using “scare tactics” to fight the bill.
“While there are many steps to take to improve our health outcomes, this bill starts by not allowing manufacturers to choose ‘poison for profit’ in our food supply,” he said. “I applaud the governor for signing the food dye bill into law. The governor believes in the [Make America Healthy Again] movement, as I do, and we are taking steps to improve the quality of health in West Virginia.”
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has told food executives that removing artificial food dyes is an urgent priority.
“Thank you to the Legislature, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the entire Trump Administration for helping us launch this movement right here in West Virginia,” Morrisey said.

Photo by Will Jacott/Minnesota Reformer. Every one of us deserves to be able to see a doctor for an injury, to afford our medications, and take our kids to check-ups — no exceptions. None of us should have to choose between getting the health care we need and paying for groceries or car repairs. 
For nearly 60 years, Medicaid has served as the safety net for folks needing health care. Medicaid, known as Medical Assistance or MA in Minnesota, ensures that when facing tough times, each of us can get essential health care we need.  
But this lifeline to care is threatened by proposed federal cuts to Medicaid. Last month, the U.S. House passed a budget resolution calling for at least $880 billion over 10 years in cuts in the committee that governs Medicaid spending. Thankfully, it’s just a resolution and doesn’t have the force of law — yet. 
One budget-cutting policy that Congress and the White House are considering is work reporting requirements, which requires some Medicaid recipients to report the number of hours they worked in the past month.  
In Minnesota, nearly 1.4 million of us get care through MA. These are babies, pregnant people, children, students receiving mental health care, adults living on low incomes or who are between jobs, people with disabilities, and older adults in nursing homes or getting care at home. 
The large majority of working-age Minnesota adults who get health care coverage through MA are working. In fact, 2 out of 3 working-age enrollees — adults aged 19-64 — work. Most of those who don’t either have a disability, are caregivers, or are in school. 
So, work requirements aren’t needed because people are already working if they can. 
Then what do these requirements do, and how do they reduce Medicaid funding?
Looking at other states’ experiences shows that these monthly reporting tasks erect barriers to getting consistent health care coverage. Too often, people wind up losing consistent coverage simply because they can’t navigate the red tape. They may miss reporting deadlines or have not received the required paperwork because they moved, for example. They subsequently lose their health care through Medicaid just because of paperwork errors even though they meet the criteria to qualify for it. 
Minnesota rightly rejected work reporting requirements seven years ago, understanding that most people getting health care through MA are already working. They also knew that making people jump through reporting hoops only creates barriers for Minnesotans trying to get their medications, receive early diagnoses, or treat chronic health problems. 
Affordable, consistent health care is essential to ensuring we can work, go to school, care for children, and build thriving lives and communities. 
Our elected representatives shouldn’t be making it harder to get the care we need. 
They should be working toward solutions that allow all of us to care for ourselves and our families and contribute to our communities.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HospitalEmergencyWithAmbulance-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

Jamie Burger is introduced to the Missouri Senate on the first day of the 2025 legislative session in January (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).A bill in the Missouri Senate’s education committee concerning religion in the classroom had senators, faith-based leaders and school advocates at odds Tuesday.
If passed, Senate Bill 594 would require classrooms to display a poster of at least 11 inches by 14 inches with the Ten Commandments in “large, easily readable font” beginning Jan. 1, 2026.
Missouri students would see the words “I AM THE LORD thy God” followed by the Ten Commandments posted in every public and charter school classroom they enter.
“I honestly believe that when prayer went out of schools, and religion was removed from schools, that guns came in and violence came in,” the bill sponsor, state Sen. Jamie Burger, a Benton Republican, said during the hearing.
In opposition to the bill, Democratic state Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern of Kansas City expressed concern about the costs of potential litigation. She also opposed the bill on principle. “This goes against the very founding of our nation,” she said.
Burger disagreed. After a back and forth, he said, “You know one thing, I think, when they talk about separation of church and state, I think they were talking about, we don’t want any church ran by the state. That’s my feelings. That’s my interpretation.”
Faith leaders testified both in support of and opposition to the bill — and people on both sides took issue with the version of the Ten Commandments included in the bill.
Faiths that adhere to the Ten Commandments, including Judaism, Catholicism and Lutheranism, have different versions of it, so the bill would “take sides in a deeply theological debate,” said Brian Kaylor, a Baptist minister and president of Word & Way, an online publication.
“This bill would make many students feel like second-class citizens in their own classrooms, just because they come from a religious tradition that lists the Ten Commandments differently, they adhere to a religious faith that does not even include the Ten Commandments, or they have no faith at all,” he added.
Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry signed a similar bill into law last year. A federal judge blocked the law in November, and the state appealed the court’s decision.
In 1980’s Stone v. Graham decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled a similar law in Kentucky violated the establishment clause of the First Amendment, which states “Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion.”
For Sage Coram of the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri, the bill violates the U.S. and Missouri constitutions. Children are required to attend school, and SB 594 could pressure students into adopting the state’s preferred religion, usurping parents’ right to choose what religious doctrine, if any, to instill in their children, Coram said at the hearing.
Bev Ehlen of Liberty Link Missouri supported the bill but asked that “kill” be replaced with “murder” in “Thou shalt not kill.”
State Sen. Rick Brattin, a Republican from Harrisonville, who chairs the education committee, spoke at length in favor of the measure. He cited his belief that the U.S. was founded as a Christian nation.
“We just need to be willing to plant that flag,” Brattin said, “that God, and the God of the Ten Commandments, is who gave us this amazing nation, and we need to be able to reflect and look at that.”

Unlike other automated ticketing legislation expected to be heard this session, which would allow for a wider use of traffic cameras in interested jurisdictions, the intent of Assembly Bill 402 is to reduce accidents in work zones, said the bill’s sponsor, Clark County Democratic Assemblymember Selena Torres-Fossett. 
“This is very limited in scope to only in construction work zones when workers are actually working,” said Torres-Fossett. 
The bill, heard by the Assembly Committee on Growth and Infrastructure, would authorize traffic monitoring cameras in construction work zones when workers are present. Driving 10 mph or more over the posted temporary traffic control zone speed limit would trigger enforcement. 
An amendment presented by Torres-Fossett on Tuesday mandates signs to inform drivers they are entering a zone with automated enforcement along with the posted speed limit.
AB 402, along with other bills seeking harsher traffic enforcement, comes as lawmakers are seeking to respond to the growing number of traffic-related accidents and fatalities across the state. 
While discussing the topic during the interim session, lawmakers and traffic experts agreed changing roadway infrastructure could also curb accidents and reduce roadway fatalities. But those solutions aren’t often funded.
Alexis Motarez, a lobbyist with the Nevada chapter Association of General Contractors, told lawmakers Tuesday that roadways are getting more dangerous in general, with work zones especially hazardous. And deadly. 
Data from the Nevada Department of Transportation shows “that in the past five years alone there have been over 7,000 crashes in Nevada in workzones leading to the tragic loss of 17 lives,” Motarez said in testimony to lawmakers in favor of the legislation. 
“At its core, AB 402 is about one simple but essential goal: to protect the lives of construction workers who risk their safety everyday to build and maintain our highways,” she said. “Road construction is already a dangerous job. With the ever present threat of impaired, distracted and aggressive driving the risks only increase.”
Nick Shepack, the Nevada state director of the Fines and Fees Justice Center, said the organization is wary of automated enforcement in any form and encouraged the state to look for alternatives to citations and monetary penalties.
If the lawmakers did move forward with the legislation to use speed cameras in construction zones, they should consider making it a pilot program, he said.
“You could have a pilot program that could go up immediately into every construction zone but then you’d be forced to address any unintended consequences” of the enforcement program,Shepack said.
The bill mandates law enforcement agencies be tasked with storing data and images collected and prevents the technology vendors from handling driver information. 
Data collected about enforcement is mandated to be reported to the Legislature every October. 
In previous legislative hearings, Shepack has warned that automated enforcement has been used as a revenue stream for jurisdictions across the country. 
Torres-Fossett said the amendment presented Tuesday would also direct any funds collected through enforcement be directed toward public infrastructure.  
“The goal is that we make no money doing this,” she said. “The goal is that people drive the speed limit.”
If passed, a citation would be mailed to the owner of the car, who would have 120 days to respond, which was lengthened from 90 days to account for delays in mail. 
Torres-Fossett said she is working on an amendment to further clarify issues around whether municipalities or law enforcement would mail out tickets. 
Several state lawmakers questioned how enforcement would work, how the automation would determine if the owner of the car was actually driving and how people could challenge infractions. An amended version of the bill authorizes the ticket to be removed if a person can prove they weren’t driving at the time of the ticket. 
“What happens in a situation when you have two registered owners,” asked Assemblymember Shea Backus.
Torres-Fossett wasn’t able to answer and said it was something she’d look into.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)For the Day Eagle Hope Project, federal money has helped volunteers deliver fresh produce and meat to families in need across the remote Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in northern Montana — while putting cash into the hands of farmers, ranchers and meat processors.
The nonprofit generally has less than $300,000 to spend per year. So the $200,000 from a U.S. Department of Agriculture local food buying program drastically raised both the quantity and quality of the food it could distribute.
“They were a major, major contributor to our food,” said Tescha Hawley, who directs the organization, which aims to improve physical, mental and spiritual health.
The USDA recently nixed more than $1 billion from two programs that helped food banks and school meal programs buy local foods, including $660 million for schoolchildren. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins recently described the programs as “nonessential.”
But the move has left hundreds of school systems and food banks reeling. They already face rising food prices and are struggling to help community members with growing food insecurity.
Created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs aimed to build more resilient supply chains of domestic food by connecting schools and food pantries with small ranches, farms and dairies. The program was initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but later expanded by the Biden administration.
The federal programs stimulated the purchase of locally grown fruits, vegetables, dairy and meats — benefiting both the smaller farmers who received fair market pay for their products and the organizations granted funds to buy high quality foods.
The noncompetitive grants sent hundreds of millions of dollars to all 50 states, the District of Columbia and 84 tribal governments, boosting business for more than 8,000 farmers and providing local food to almost as many food banks. The Trump administration is killing the programs, despite Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s campaign against processed food, which he says is “poisoning” Americans.
Without ongoing funding, Hawley said, she would have to rely on cheaper, less nutritious food.
“It’s simple, right? I can get a truck … in here with all highly processed food, no problem,” she said.
Schools are facing a similar challenge: While officials running breakfast and lunch programs would prefer to buy more local products, those are often expensive. And with underfunding, high food costs and labor struggles, school lunch programs are already stretched thin.
In Milan, Tennessee, the federal funds allowed the local school system to buy minimally processed beef from a local stockyard, and broccoli, purple hull peas, tomatoes and melons from local growers.
Vickie Dunaway, who supervises the school system’s food services, told the Tennessee Lookout the federal cuts mean “going backwards” on purchasing healthier foods.
“That will obviously have to be cut out, because our budget will not withstand being able to purchase local,” she said. “Purchasing local, minimally processed food is way more expensive than buying from a distributor.”
 A ‘devastating’ cut to food banks

Late last year, USDA said the programs had already spent more than $1 billion on local foods, and announced an expansion of the two programs with an additional $1.13 billion. USDA has killed that $1.13 billion expansion; it is still reimbursing the previously committed funds.
The Trump administration, which has sought to dramatically slash the size of the federal government, told recipients earlier this month that the programs “no longer effectuate the goals of the agency.”
In a statement to Stateline, the USDA said the current administration is “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
“The COVID era is over — USDA’s approach to nutrition programs will reflect that reality moving forward,” the statement said.
The nonpartisan National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, which represents the ag department leaders of all 50 states, last month lobbied the federal government to continue the local foods program with permanent funding and ease procurement regulations for school meal programs. Arkansas Secretary of Agriculture Wes Ward, president of the association, said in a statement that the local food programs aid both producers and consumers.
“Investing in local and regional food systems not only strengthens the connections between farmers and their local communities, it bolsters supply chain resiliency as well,” his statement read.
In New Mexico, the program allowed food banks to buy some 900,000 pounds of locally grown food from more than 200 farmers since 2023. Before the program was terminated, the state was expecting close to $3 million in additional funding, Source New Mexico reported.
Jill Dixon, executive director of The Food Depot in northern New Mexico, called the cuts “devastating.”
In Texas, the San Antonio Food Bank counted on USDA’s local food program to help round out the food boxes it provides to families in need. The food bank, which serves more than 100,000 people across 29 Texas counties, largely relies on donated foods from hotels, restaurants and grocery stores.
“The challenge is I might get peanut butter donated, but I don’t have the jelly, or I might have pasta donated, but I don’t have the marinara,” said Eric Cooper, president and CEO of the food bank. “This program allowed us to purchase those items that we didn’t get that then helped round out the food box, or really complement the food that was being donated to give families the ability to make meals.”
The program initially provided the food bank nearly $3 million in grant funding — about 20% of what the organization spends each year on bulk food purchases. It expected a similar amount this year, before USDA’s announcement.
Cooper said cuts come even as the need for assistance rises. Food prices have squeezed families, and mass layoffs of federal workers portend more demand for food assistance in the coming months, he said.
“And we’ll be caught in the middle. And you know, that’s an incredibly uncomfortable place to be. The only thing we’ll be able to do is just ration what little we have — to spread it as thinly as possible over the number of households we provide food to.”
 A boost for school lunches

For years, school meal programs have struggled with tight margins. Not only do they have to meet strict nutritional guidelines, but schools also face lagging reimbursement from the federal government and spend millions covering the cost of students’ unpaid meal debt.
At the 1,600-student Monticello School District in Arkansas, that debt is approaching $60,000.
So $50,000 from USDA’s local food program was a significant boost to the bottom line.
“That was such a help,” said Amanda West, the district’s child nutrition director.
The southeast Arkansas district used grant money to buy locally grown ground beef. The beef went into dishes including taco salad, meatloaf and spaghetti.
West said staff and students immediately noticed a difference in taste from conventionally purchased meats. And though the local product cost more, West said it also yielded more because it was not full of additives that cause the meat to shrink when cooked.
West, who is the president of the Arkansas School Nutrition Association, noted that her state is home to the nation’s highest rates of food insecurity.
West had hoped to see the local foods program help turn that tide by bringing more stability to school meal programs and growing the state economy by boosting local farmers, ranchers and distributors.
“We’re all upset about it. I hate that we’re not receiving it because grocery prices are 30, 40% higher than what they were a few years ago, and it really hurts our budget,” she said. “It helped a lot of districts, including mine, and it would be amazing if we could get it back.”
On top of the local foods program cuts, congressional Republicans are considering billions in potential cuts to free and reduced-price school meal programs — cuts the School Nutrition Association says could potentially affect millions of American students.
The federal government partially subsidizes breakfast, lunch and after-school snack programs at rates calculated by the income level of students’ families.
The School Nutrition Association, which represents 50,000 school meal providers across the country, said the school meals are the healthiest many American children receive. But that group says federal reimbursements are far from adequate, leaving members worried about the future of their meal programs.
In a recent association survey of more than 1,390 school meal directors, more than 90% reported serious or moderate concern over the financial sustainability of their school meal programs three years from now.

Saying it “threatens academic freedom,” Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear has issued a veto to a Republican-backed bill that some Kentucky professors warned would erode academic tenure at the state’s public universities and colleges.  
Rep. James Tipton, R-Taylorsville, argued House Bill 424,  was not about tenure in higher education but instead “employment contracts” between universities and academic employees. If it becomes law, the bill would give universities and colleges the ability to remove faculty members and presidents for not meeting “performance and productivity requirements” set by the institutions’ boards.
In his veto message issued Tuesday, Beshear said Kentucky should focus on ways to “attract, recruit and retain the best and brightest minds at Kentucky’s universities and colleges,” which includes having faith in “our university administrations and faculty to negotiate and offer competitive employment contracts.” 
“In a time of increased federal encroachment into the public education, this bill will limit employment protections of our postsecondary institution teachers,” the governor wrote. “This bill will limit Kentucky’s ability to hire the best people and threatens academic freedom.” 
However, as Republicans hold supermajorities in the House and Senate, they have the votes to override the governor’s veto when they return to Frankfort Thursday and Friday to finish the 2025 legislative session. The bill passed both chambers largely on party lines. 
Over the weekend, United Campus Workers of Kentucky issued an open letter and petition to Beshear asking him to veto the legislation. In their message, the group says the bill would have “no guardrails in place to preserve the peer-driven academic review processes that have long protected academic freedom and tenure protections from partisan political interference.” Several UCW members previously testified against the legislation when it was heard in Tipton’s House committee. 
The American Association of University Professors and PEN America also denounced the bill in statements ahead of Beshear’s veto. 
Tipton said during House floor debate on the bill he believed the legislation would create “a more efficient, more effective system of public education for students across the commonwealth.” 
Kentucky isn’t the only state where legislation has been introduced that could jeopardize the integrity of academic tenure for professors.

(Photo courtesy of ISO New England)The head of New England’s energy grid underscored the importance of offshore wind for the future of the region’s power supply during a congressional subcommittee hearing on Tuesday, emphasizing the impact of President Donald Trump administration’s early action to halt such efforts.
Thanks to new approaches in transmission system planning and better tools for quantifying risks in a quickly changing system, the short term outlook for New England’s energy market and reliability is “generally favorable,” said Gordon Van Welie, president and chief executive officer of the Independent System Operator of New England, known as ISO-NE.
But, Van Welie also warned of “serious challenges” ahead.
On his first day in office, Trump issued an executive order for a temporary halt in new or renewed offshore wind leases in all areas of the outer continental shelf. It also included a review of the federal government’s leasing and permitting process for existing wind projects.
While Maine Republicans have formally praised the action, even asking the president to go further by stopping all current offshore wind development, Van Welie said those actions have created uncertainty for the region’s energy future.
“The region, and the ISO, are counting on the addition of large quantities of offshore wind to maintain resource and energy adequacy,” Van Welie told the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Energy during the discussion on grid reliability.
Offshore wind has been seen as a reliable and abundant source of domestic energy, Van Welie said. Maine alone is aiming to develop 3,000 megawatts of offshore wind in the Gulf of Maine by 2040.
Van Welie said the region will need these new resources to meet growing electricity demand, so it is important to have a policy and regulatory framework that will allow those resources to come online.
Additionally, the on-again, off-again tariffs Trump has imposed on Canada could affect both the price and availability of power in New England. Though it is unclear how the additional tax would apply to electricity, Van Welie said there could be reliability issues if electricity were to stop coming into the region from Canada.
The Natural Resources Council of Maine said Van Welie’s comments reinforce how essential offshore wind is for New England’s energy future.
“The strong, consistent winds off our coast will provide the large amount of energy we’ll need to power the future, while generating thousands of new jobs, protecting wildlife, and stimulating economic development up and down the coast,” said NRCM Climate and Clean Energy Director Jack Shapiro.
As Maine has set clean energy and climate goals, developing offshore wind as a power source has been at the crux of meeting those ambitions. The Governor’s Energy Office recently released a technical report showing that while it is possible to meet the state’s goal of 100% clean energy by 2040, wind and solar are key components of meeting increased electrification demands from plug-in cars and heating options.

Two deaths were reported so far this year, with one investigated by the Alaska State [&#8230;]","Dr Robert Lawrence, Alaska chief medical officer (left), Travis Welch, director of corrections health and rehabilitation services (center), and Dr Tim Ballard, DOC chief medical officer (right) present before the House State Affairs Committee on March 4, 2025. (KTOO Gavel Alaska Screenshot)The Alaska Department of Corrections has had at least 67 people die in-custody of state prisons and jails since 2020, with at least 17 deaths reported as suicides, according to the department. 
There were at least 14 deaths last year. Two deaths were reported so far this year, with one investigated by the Alaska State Troopers and reported as a suicide. 
On average, 4,500 people are incarcerated each year in Alaska’s 13 facilities, which includes individuals under arrest and awaiting trial or sentencing, known as pretrial, and those who are serving sentences. Of those in custody, an estimated 42% of men and 60% of women are pretrial, according to state data.  
Alaska state medical and corrections officials pointed to “natural causes,” including acute and chronic disease and illnesses, as the leading cause of in-custody deaths – or 68% of reported deaths since 2015. 
State officials gave a presentation to lawmakers with the House State Affairs Committee on March 4, describing causes of death from 2015 to 2024, as well as demographics and mitigation efforts. 
“We do see a higher number of people who may have never seen a doctor,” said Travis Welch, director of the Division of Health and Rehabilitation Services for the Department of Corrections. 
As a result of mental illness or substance use disorder, they may “lack the ability to make a doctor’s appointment and go in and see a doctor or a dentist. So the population that we’re serving is acute, and probably one of the more acute populations within the state of Alaska,” Welch said.

	Officials presented data on the causes of in-custody deaths. Of the 68% of in-custody deaths reported as natural causes, 43% were reportedly from heart or lung diseases, 22% cancer, 13% infectious disease, 10% unknown, 6% liver disease, 4% kidney disease, and 2% substance related.     


The health issues within state prisons mirror Alaska’s health trends, Welch said. “When we have high rates of heart disease, for example, in the state of Alaska, we’re going to see a concentrated amount of heart disease within our facilities and those we’re caring for,” he said. 
Rep. Kevin McCabe, R-Big Lake, asked about expedited release processes for those who are sick or nearing end of life, like medical parole. Welch said that is ultimately up to the courts. 
“We always try to house people in the least restrictive environment,” Welch said. “And when people are towards the end of their life, statute does allow for people to be released if they meet certain statutory requirements… we’re the information providers to the courts, and then the courts actually make the decision on people being released.”
There have been at least 114 deaths from 2015 to 2024, according to department data.  According to the department, 78 were due natural causes, 30 were suicides, four due to accidental causes, two were homicides, and one cause of death from 2024 is still pending.  (Insert chart)
Of those, DOC reports 102 men, and 12 women died in custody, reflecting the larger statewide prison demographics. According to department data, 47% were white, 37% Alaska Native, 7% Black, 4% Native American, 2% Hispanic and 2% Asian.
“Every year, there are anywhere from four deaths up to 18 deaths,” said Dr. Robert Lawrence, Alaska’s state chief medical officer, who was the former chief medical officer for the Department of Corrections. “There’s somewhere between 11 and 12 individuals who will die during the period that they are in custody. That average has not changed. What has changed over time are the causes of death.” 
Lawrence said that prior to 2015, about a quarter of deaths were due to overdose or related to symptoms of substance withdrawal. He said after the department deployed new screening and withdrawal treatment protocols, those deaths decreased substantially. “From 2017, for the next five years, there were zero deaths in that early withdrawal period,” Lawrence said. “Because of identifying the problem, coming up with a mitigation strategy, and then training staff to address that.”
He said fentanyl is still a problem in the prison system, “but even still, those numbers (of deaths) remain quite low.”
In 2022, a record 18 reported deaths sparked public outcry, an investigation by the ACLU of Alaska, and a wrongful death lawsuit against the department. Seven of the 18 deaths were reported as suicides. 
Rep. Ashley Carrick, D-Fairbanks and state affairs committee chair, asked whether the department sees suicide rates also increasing.  
Dr. Tim Ballard, current chief medical officer for DOC, said the suicide rate has been going down “slightly,” and that staff training and awareness for suicide prevention is ongoing.

	“One of the key things that we looked at was training, and what can we do to better prepare our staff to identify folks that may be at risk, and how to respond and do appropriate referrals,” said Adam Rutherford, deputy director for health and rehabilitation services. “We also increased scenario-based training within our facilities as well. We use tools to replicate suicide attempts and how to respond appropriately from both the security side of the house and medical side of the house as well.”    


Rutherford listed mitigation efforts, including adding medical bags and more cameras across facilities; installing jump barriers; and implementing larger windows for “segregation” units or solitary confinement, for suicide watch. 
“So we want to be able to see folks. We want visibility. We want folks to be able to see out. We don’t want them to feel like they’re enclosed,” he said. 
Rutherford said aging prison facilities are also an issue. “Our facilities are old, and let’s face it, corrections (facilities) nationally weren’t built to be behavioral health treatment facilities, and that’s really what our systems have become,” he said.
In the presentation, officials reported that 65% of the prison population are living with a mental illness, and 80% have a substance use disorder.  
Rutherford said the department reviews each in-custody incident, either suicide attempt or death, in order to make improvements. “And it really is a process of looking at that continuous quality improvement, what changes can we make, and encouraging our staff to have that input and that feedback. And that’s had a significant impact,” he said. 
Carrick asked about the protocol for notifying loved ones of those who have died, citing complaints from bereaved family members. “A lot of times people feel like it was a void,” she said. “They didn’t know what was going on. They didn’t know there was a problem, and then all of a sudden, their loved one is gone.”
“Full transparency, we often struggle because we often don’t necessarily have a point of contact,” Rutherford said, and that the department has to adhere to the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act privacy laws. 
“It’s very difficult to make sure that we can navigate through what we’re legally allowed to disclose and what we can’t,” Lawrence added.
Rep. Andi Story, D-Juneau, emphasized it would be good practice for the department to have contact information for family members and release of information agreements in place. “If that is not a standard practice, can that be a standard practice?” she asked. 
Lawmakers had more questions around suicide watch, solitary confinement, detoxification protocols, and other issues as the hourlong hearing time ended, and planned to submit those questions to the department. 
“It is a very sensitive subject, and very, very close to home for a lot of Alaskans,” said Carrick in a phone interview after the hearing. “And I was grateful we were able to talk about it respectfully, and to have the Department of Corrections in front of us.”
Carrick said she sees deferred maintenance and facilities upgrades as a priority for improving prison conditions, safety and mental health services.
“Inmates have access to certain mental health services, and they have rights for health care while they’re in custody,” Carrick said. “However, that pretrial population doesn’t necessarily have any established, ongoing, mitigating mental health care. 
“It’s unclear to me how accessible to the sentenced population, even long-term ongoing mental health services are,” she said. “I think the department is trying to offer what services it can, but I do think that our budget’s not reflective of the number of staff we need” to provide needed services. 
Carrick said she’s concerned about the high number of suicides, and support services available. 
“I don’t think any person in state custody should ever be dying of suicide,” she said. 
Carrick noted that Department of Corrections health care costs are expensive, and she wants to see better management of those services to meet prison population needs. 
“I think the public should be aware of what the real costs are for incarceration,” she said. “And at the same time, I’m someone who firmly believes that taking care of every individual that is in state custody is the state’s responsibility, and we should not have lacking medical or mental health care for these individuals while they are incarcerated.”
The hearing took place one day after another in custody death was reported on March 3: 42-year-old Reginald Childers Jr. of Kodiak was found dead in his cell at the Anchorage Correctional Complex. The Alaska State Troopers announced the death was a suicide. 
State officials did not address any individual death incidents, investigations or outstanding lawsuits against the department at the hearing. 
Carrick said she plans to hold more hearings with corrections officials on in-custody deaths, and contributing issues across the state’s prison system, like prison wages, living conditions, “access to meaningful activities or employment while in corrections, access to other services, like class services, visitation services,” she said. “A lot of these are major challenges in an understaffed and overcrowded prison system.”
Carrick said there are clear improvements to be made across facilities, and the department.
“I want folks that are incarcerated to actually come out of that experience with the tools and the skills needed to productively reenter society,” she said. “We’re not really setting any trends for extraordinary success right now, and I’d really like to see us, even potentially in the future, be a leader in what successful rehabilitation and reentry can look like.”

A Defense Department page mentioning South Carolina hero Freddie Stowers has been restored after it had been removed amid the department’s efforts to eliminate content singling out contributions by women and minority groups.
Cpl. Stowers, who died in battle, was the first Black American to be awarded the Medal of Honor for “extraordinary heroism” in World War I.
Stowers apparently suffered the same fate as baseball legend Jackie Robinson and thousands of others who were removed from the Defense Department’s website because of the Trump administration’s strident, unreasoning opposition to diversity, equity and inclusion.
Stories about the Tuskegee Airmen, the Navajo code talkers and a Native American Marine who helped raise the flag at Iwo Jima were among the webpages removed.
Photos of the Enola Gay, the B-29 that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, were flagged for removal, seemingly because of the word “gay” in its name.
Some of those pages are being restored following a public outcry, but many may be lost forever.
Last week, the page mentioning Stowers titled “Intrepid African American Soldiers Broke Barriers, Paved the Way,” read “404 Page Not Found.” The letters “dei” were added to the URL.

Even now, Stowers merits only a few lines on the restored webpage.
The Medal of Honor is the United States’s highest military recognition for valor.
Tuesday marked the National Medal of Honor Day, which is recognized every March 25 on the USS Yorktown in Charleston Harbor, home to the Congressional Medal of Honor Society.
The Defense Department’s website purges are a national outrage, but for South Carolinians the case of Freddie Stowers hits close to home — literally close to my home.
Stowers, who died on the battlefield in 1918 at the age of 22, was a native of Anderson County, where I have lived the majority of my life.
There’s a fine statue of Stowers at Anderson University about a two-minute drive from my home.
There’s a moving tribute to Stowers at the Anderson County Museum.
Stowers’ elimination from the Department of Defense website was really a second erasure for Stowers, both due to his race.
Recommended for the Medal of Honor in 1918, Stowers’ recommendation languished for 73 years, until he was finally recognized in 1991 by President George H.W. Bush.
Many historians and others, including his great niece, believe Stowers’ heroism — and that of many other Black Americans — was shamefully overlooked in a segregated Army.
‘Extraordinary heroism’
Stowers, grandson of a slave, grew up in a hard-working farm family in the tiny community of Sandy Springs.
Drafted in October 1917 at the age of 21, Cpl. Stowers would serve as a squad leader in an all-Black regiment.
Stowers’ Medal of Honor citation, read to his surviving sisters Georgina and Mary in a White House ceremony, eloquently expresses his valor on the day he was killed in the line of duty:
“The president of the United States of America, in the name of Congress, takes pride in presenting the Medal of Honor (posthumously) to Cpl. Freddie Stowers, United States Army, for exceptional heroism on Sept. 28, 1918, while serving as a squad leader in Company C, 371st Infantry Regiment, 93d Infantry Division. Cpl. Stowers’ company was the lead company during the attack on Hill 188, Champagne Marne Sector, France, during World War I.
“A few minutes after the attack began, the enemy ceased firing and began climbing up onto the parapets of the trenches, holding up their arms as if wishing to surrender. The enemy’s actions caused the American forces to cease-fire and to come out into the open.
“As the company started forward and when within about 100 meters of the trench line, the enemy jumped back into their trenches and greeted Cpl. Stowers’ company with interlocking bands of machine gun fire and mortar fire causing well over 50% casualties.
“Faced with incredible enemy resistance, Cpl. Stowers took charge, setting such a courageous example of personal bravery and leadership that he inspired his men to follow him in the attack. With extraordinary heroism and complete disregard of personal danger under devastating fire, he crawled forward leading his squad toward an enemy machine gun nest, which was causing heavy casualties to his company.
“After fierce fighting, the machine gun position was destroyed, and the enemy soldiers were killed. Displaying great courage and intrepidity, Cpl. Stowers continued to press the attack against a determined enemy. While crawling forward and urging his men to continue the attack on a second trench line, he was gravely wounded by machine gun fire.
“Although Cpl. Stowers was mortally wounded, he pressed forward, urging on the members of his squad, until he died. Inspired by the heroism and display of bravery of Cpl. Stowers, his company continued the attack against incredible odds, contributing to the capture of Hill 188 and causing heavy enemy casualties.

“Cpl. Stowers’ conspicuous gallantry, extraordinary heroism and supreme devotion to his men were well above and beyond the call of duty, follow the finest traditions of military service and reflect the utmost credit on him and the United States Army.”
Stowers was the first of only two African Americans to receive the Medal of Honor for conspicuous heroism in World War I.
Lt. Col. Taylor Voorhis Beattie, in an article for the magazine Military History, compared Stowers to the World War I hero Sgt. Alvin York, immortalized in a classic 1941 film starring Gary Cooper.
Both York and Stowers were poor, devout Southern farm boys who grew up with limited educational and economic opportunities but were drafted into the U.S. Army and earned the Medal of Honor for their inspirational courage under fire.
Stowers’ life and sacrifice are an important part of our state’s and nation’s history and deserve to be amplified, not erased.
As a Pentagon spokesman said Friday in addressing what he called a mistake: “History is not DEI.”

Karen Stubbs Church, assistant secretary over Louisiana’s Office of Behavioral Health, told a Louisiana Senate budget committee the state received notice Monday night that as many as six of the state’s federal health grants had been canceled. 
Church was not specific about what programs the threatened grants support, only to say the money is used for “crisis services.”
The message from the federal government was “difficult to interpret,” she said. For example, two of the six grants the federal government appeared to be seeking to end might have already expired. 

“There is still a lot of confusion,” Church told legislators. “We’re still working out the impact.” 
Speaking at the same hearing, Deputy Health Secretary Pete Croughan said Louisiana could have lost as much as $10 million from the grants, though the funding was always temporary. It was already expected to end later this year. 
The money originally flowed to Louisiana through the American Rescue Plan, a massive congressional bill originally passed to help deal with fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
President Donald Trump’s administration has made drastic cuts to several types of federal grant programs and attempted to lay off thousands of government employees since he took office in January. 
Among Trump’s targets for large cuts is the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The agency oversees suicide hotlines, programs for opioid addicts and funding for drug courts around the country. It was expected to lose as much as 50% of its staff, according to The New York Times.
The agency is part of the larger U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which Trump appointed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to run earlier this year.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)As part of a batch of 75 bills he signed Monday, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox approved SB73, which layers on new requirements for ballot initiative seekers. 
Now law, SB73 requires initiative backers to include in their application for the initiative a detailed description of how the proposed law would be funded and if it would require a new tax. 
That provision of the bill took effect the moment Cox signed it. 
The governor did not issue a statement along with his signature of SB73. But proponents of setting new rules for ballot initiatives — including Sen. Lincoln Fillmore, R-South Jordan, who sponsored SB73 — argued during the Utah Legislature’s 2025 session that Utah voters need to know the fiscal impact of proposed ballot initiatives. 
Critics, including the anti-gerrymandering group Better Boundaries, opposed the bill as another piece of legislation that makes it even more difficult for Utahns to exercise their ballot initiative power in a state where it’s already hard enough. 
Utah lawmakers move to set higher bar for ballot initiatives — but voters will have a say in 2026

“It’s disappointing to see legislative leaders take on a problem that doesn’t exist,” Elizabeth Rasmussen, Better Boundaries’ new executive director, said in a prepared statement issued Tuesday. 
Earlier this week, Better Boundaries announced Rasmussen had taken the place of the group’s former executive director, Katie Wright. 
“Regardless of political affiliation, citizens should have a fair and accessible path to bring forward initiatives,” Rasmussen added. “SB73 adds costly, complicated barriers that make it harder for regular people to participate. At Better Boundaries, we’ll continue working with Utahns to protect this constitutional process and ensure it remains open, fair, and grounded in Utah’s values.”
Fillmore, on the Senate floor during debate over SB73 in January, defended his bill, saying it’s “not in any way an effort to limit the ability of citizens to engage in their constitutionally granted legislative power.”
“But it is also very important that when citizens exercise their legislative power, that they do so with their eyes wide open about what the consequences of those decisions are,” Fillmore said. He added the Legislature has a “constitutional mandate to balance the budget,” and “the citizens ought to know in advance what we’re sacrificing” for a new voter-approved law. 
Anti-initiative or ‘informed’? Utah Senate OKs bill adding new requirements on voter initiatives

While the provision in SB73 requiring initiative backers to include more information about how the proposed law would be funded took effect upon the governor’s signature, another provision won’t take effect until much later — Jan. 1, 2027. However, lawmakers wrote it that way with the intention of leaving time for voters to adjust it, if a proposed constitutional amendment that’s also set for the November 2026 ballot gets approved. 
That delayed provision requires initiative backers to follow the same publication requirements that lawmakers do when they put proposed constitutional amendments on the ballot, which could increase the cost of ballot initiatives by an estimated $1.4 million. However, that could change. 
Currently, the Utah Constitution requires that constitutional amendments be published in newspapers statewide for 60 days before the next election. Lawmakers want voters to consider changing that, which would impact not just proposed constitutional amendments, but also ballot initiatives. Here’s why: 
Utah lawmakers also passed a resolution and a companion bill that could remove that newspaper publication requirement from the Utah Constitution and leave it up to lawmakers to decide how voters should be notified before an election. They included:
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX

HJR10 places this question on the November 2026 ballot for voters to consider: Should the Utah Constitution be changed to strike the language requiring that proposed constitutional amendments must be published “in at least one newspaper in every county of the state where a newspaper is published, for two months” immediately preceding the election, and should the constitution instead say those proposed amendments be published “in a manner provided by statute, for 60 calendar days” immediately preceding the next general election? 
If voters approve the question from HJR10, then another bill — HB481 (which is currently waiting the governor’s signature ) — would take effect, setting a state law that requires proposed constitutional amendments and ballot initiatives be published as a “class A” notice on the Utah Public Notice website or a government’s official website for “60 calendar days immediately preceding” the next general election. 

Voters will decide: Should some initiatives require 60% vote?
Another proposed constitutional amendment slated to appear on the 2026 ballot would set a higher bar for certain ballot initiatives. Like SB73, it also targets ballot initiatives that would come with a price tag. 
Utah lawmakers also approved SJR2, which puts a question on the 2026 ballot for voters to either approve or reject: Should ballot initiatives that would require a new tax or a tax hike only be allowed to take effect if at least 60% of voters approve it? 
Currently, the Utah Constitution only requires a simple majority vote for ballot initiatives to be enacted as new laws. But that resolution’s sponsor, Fillmore, argued it should take more than support from 50.1% of voters to “raise taxes on the other 49.9%.” 
Unlike bills, joint resolutions don’t need the governor’s approval, so SJR3 and HJR10 will be enacted without his signature. It will be up to voters to decide what comes next.

State officials and advocates warn the cuts could cut vulnerable Alabamians off from essential health care services and strain the state’s already limited health care system.
“There’s just no way to do those cuts in Alabama without significantly harming children, seniors, and people with disabilities,” Robyn Hyden, executive director of Alabama Arise, an advocacy group focused on poverty issues, said of the proposed cuts.

The Alabama Medicaid Agency’s state allocation is expected to surpass $1 billion for the first time in the next fiscal year. If the agency has to make up over $800 million in federal funds, it could easily take the state’s allocation to $2 billion.
Alabama relies heavily on federal funding to sustain its health care infrastructure. The federal government pays for about 73% of Alabama’s Medicaid program, which currently covers more than one million residents, including nearly 57% of children and nearly 70% of nursing home residents. 
If federal funding is reduced, the state would have to either find a new revenue stream, raise taxes or make cuts to Medicaid services.
Unlike most states, Alabama has not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, and it has one of the most restrictive eligibility criteria in the nation. Adults without dependent children do not qualify for Medicaid, and parents can only receive coverage if they earn less than 18% of the federal poverty level, or about $4,797 a year for a family of three.
Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, chair of the Senate Finance and Taxation General Fund committee, said in an interview Monday that if the cuts are enacted, Alabama could be forced to scale back services or reduce eligibility, saying “that’s the biggest” way to cut costs.
The state’s ability to shift funding from other areas is limited. Unlike most states, Alabama maintains separate budgets for education and general government spending. That would make it nearly impossible to reallocate education funds to cover Medicaid shortfalls. 
Albritton said that money could be shifted from other agencies, like the Department of Transportation, to avoid a significant reduction in Medicaid services. The Alabama Department of Corrections receives the second largest allocation after Medicaid out of the General Fund. But reallocation from the state’s prison system — facing numerous lawsuits over violence and overcrowding — will not happen, at least “not willingly,” he said.
Although Albritton said KFF’s estimates are worst-case scenarios, calling it “draconian,” he said “something like that is going to happen.”
“Whatever degree, it’s going to have an adverse effect on our budgetary process, and it’s going to affect us hugely,” he said. “We don’t know what’s going to happen.”
One policy consideration is implementing work requirements for Medicaid recipients. Although supporters of work requirements say that they encourage self-sufficiency, critics note that the vast majority of Medicaid recipients already work and say requirements create unnecessary hurdles that could push thousands of eligible people off Medicaid rolls.
“Even people who are eligible would get cut because of an inability to comply with a lot of red tape and bureaucracy,” Hyden said.
With a GOP-controlled Congress pushing for spending reductions, Alabama’s lawmakers could face a balancing act. Albritton feels people are “unaware” of what may be coming. The state has been flush with federal funds over the past few years, he said, with people living “fat, dumb and happy for a long time.”
“But there is no way to get around the point that the federal candy-time is over with and how we’re going to deal with that is questionable. And we’re not dealing with it at this point,” Albritton said.
Hyden said she’s had conversations with U.S. lawmakers and asking them to oppose the cuts. She said that they seem to hear the concerns “loud and clear” and know that cuts to Medicaid are “politically unacceptable, very unpopular.”
“We’ve been told by members of Congress they don’t want to see widespread coverage loss,” Hyden said. “But I’m unsure how they can do funding cuts without having that impact.”

 SB 1, sponsored by Sen. Sam Givhan, would allow full-time employees at public schools who are injured on the job to use accrued sick leave for recovery. According to the State Department of Education, public education employees earn one sick day per month. The benefit would go into effect as soon as it is passed and signed by Gov. Kay Ivey. 
Givhan said at a Senate Finance and Taxation Education Committee meeting in February that the legislation is his top priority.

“So many people are surprised to learn that our state education employees do not have workers compensation coverage for on the job injuries,” he said on Feb. 12. “I did want SB 1 status for this bill.”
As originally filed, the legislation did not create a funding source for the benefit. The bill now creates the Public Education Employee Injury Compensation Trust Fund in the State Treasury with a startup cost of at least $15.6 million. 
The House committee unanimously adopted a Senate floor amendment from February that added community college employees and specified the processes for claiming the benefit.
Republicans in the House Ways and Means Education Committee last week pushed for the bill to be carried over due to concerns about the differences between the proposed benefit for educators and the existing benefit for state employees. Rep. David Faulkner, R-Mountain Brook, said he is supportive of the bill, but still needed more time to understand the legislation.
“I would like this to have time to have those discussions in depth rather than trying to rush into something,” Faulkner said. 
Faulkner also mentioned he is working on an amendment to clarify sections of the legislation on the appeals process and how it relates to physicians.
Rep. Terri Collins, R-Decatur, also supported carrying the bill over because the committee did not have the full bill.
“We can’t even look at how the amendment fits in here because we only have four pages of the bill and so that to me is another reason I also would like to second the amendment just to carry it over for one more meeting,” she said.
Democrats on the committee pushed for a vote. Rep. Kelvin Lawrence, D-Hayneville, said educators have gone without the benefit for too long.
“I don’t know of any other profession in the state of Alabama that doesn’t offer workman comps to their employees,” Lawrence said. 
Rep. Barbara Drummond, D-Mobile agreed with Lawrence. She said the legislators could use this week to work out concerns with the legislation. The Legislature is out this week and will reconvene on April 1. 
“We can get those answers and go ahead and get this bill moving,” she said. 
Givhan sponsored a similar bill last session that passed the Senate but did not come out of the House. House Minority Leader Anthony Daniels, D-Huntsville, a member of the committee, advocated for a vote.
“We’ve been dealing with this issue for a couple years now. If we’re getting down to the finish line and deciding that we want to delay this and stand in the way of progress and opportunity for our educators, then shame on us,” Daniels said. “We talk about how important this is, but our actions are not showing that.”
Chairman Danny Garrett, R-Decatur, carried the bill over without a vote.
“I just want to you know appreciate the comments of everybody, but I kind of reject the idea that this is something we have to do today with a gun to our head,” Garrett said.
Garrett said the bill will be “first up” when the Legislature returns.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)Secretary of State Shenna Bellows announced her run for governor in 2026, becoming the first major Democratic candidate to throw her hat in the ring.
Gov. Janet Mills is serving her final term that will end in two years, marking the end of eight years of Democratic control. Maine has not consecutively elected governors of the same party since the 1950s. While many current and former officials — including U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, and Hannah Pingree, who runs Mills’ Office of Policy Innovation and Future — are rumored to be considering a run, Bellows is the first to announce it.
Earlier this month, former Maine Senate President Troy Jackson told the Bangor Daily News that he’s officially exploring entering the race while South Portland resident Kenneth Forrest Pinet has filed paperwork for the June 9, 2026 primary.
During her address early Wednesday at the official launch event at the Hancock Community Center, Bellows said “we need leaders who will meet the moment.”
“Because while we’re paying our taxes or helping our parents measure out their medication, our country is being demolished by a greedy, unelected billionaire who thinks his dollars are more powerful than our voices…Who thinks the value of his stock portfolio matters more than the values of our community.”
Bellows has served as Maine’s first female secretary of state since 2021. She garnered national attention last year for initially disqualifying President Donald Trump from the 2024 Republican primary. She’s currently serving her third term as Secretary of State, during which she has focused on making voting more accessible.
“With so much at stake, we need a governor from Maine and for Maine — someone who understands what families here are going through, because they’ve lived it,” Bellow said in a statement. 
“Growing up in Hancock,” she continued, “my family didn’t have much and we struggled to pay the bills, but we worked for everything we had. It’s that perspective that will allow me to fight for families, workers, small businesses and children every single day as governor.”
Bellows, who now lives in Manchester, has worked in Democratic politics in Maine for more than a decade. Bellows served in the Maine Senate from 2016 to 2020, representing 11 towns in southern Kennebec County. She also served as Senate chair of the Labor and Housing Committee and was on the Judiciary Committee. Before her tenure as a state legislator, she ran as the Democratic nominee against U.S. Sen. Susan Collins for U.S. Senate in 2014.
Before running against Collins, Bellows served as executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine. Throughout her career, she’s consulted for and worked with several advocacy organizations including Sierra Club’s Maine Chapter, Consumers for Affordable Healthcare and the Maine Women’s Lobby. She also worked on campaigns to pass marriage equality in Maine, and co-chaired a successful 2011 statewide ballot campaign to restore same-day voter registration. 
As Secretary of State, her office has focused on modernizing technology, implementing online voter registration and automatic voter registration at the Bureau of Motor Vehicles, among other initiatives. In 2022, Maine had the highest voter participation in the nation, and the November 2024 election yet again saw record turnout.

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Florida teens are contracting sexually transmitted infections at rates higher than in the past decade, and a bill advancing in the Republican-controlled Legislature would require them to tell their parents to secure treatment.
Minors in Florida are entitled to privacy with doctors and medical providers to receive treatment for STIs, substance abuse, and mental health problems. In some cases, doctors can prescribe birth control to minors without their parents’ written consent.
Vero Beach Republican Sen. Erin Grall wants to eliminate those exceptions and grant parents access to all their kids’ medical records, including approving any health surveys or questionnaires they may fill out. This means that healthcare providers wouldn’t be able to treat a minor with an STI without a parent’s permission.


Senator sees exceptions as marginalizing parents
The staunch anti-abortion senator is labeling the statutory exceptions providing teens privacy with their doctors a parental rights problem in SB 1288.
“It’s tragic to me that so many people have had to experience such pain at the hands of their parents, but I believe that as a society, we have marginalized parents in a way that has led to that behavior, and it’s my hope that we see that change,” Grall said during the Senate Pre-K-12 Committee meeting, which the bill passed with four senators in opposition, including a Republican.
Grall said she found bothersome her own experience taking her daughter to the doctors’ office, where the child was given a survey about suicide. She told lawmakers that repeatedly asking children if they had ever considered suicide could cause them to start thinking about it.
“War on reproductive freedoms”
During nearly an hour of testimony, sexual assault survivors and reproductive health advocates say the bill was dangerous for kids who can’t confide in their parents at risk, leading to an increase in teen pregnancies and STIs.
Statewide rates of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis among 13 to 17-year-olds are the highest they have been since 2008, according to 2023 data from the Florida Department of Health. Those infections can be cured with antibiotics, but worsen if left untreated for longer.
“This is war on our reproductive freedoms, but what I was really shocked to hear is that we are now attacking the mental health of our children,” said Sarah Parker, a member of the public providing testimony who said she had been sexually assaulted as a child. “We know that children are abused and raped in the system. Let’s not pretend these things are not happening. Just say you don’t care and be transparent.”

Florida statute is clearer about teens’ ability to receive treatment for STIs, substance abuse, and mental health services without parental consent than it is about granting access to birth control. However, physicians can prescribe birth control to a minor if their medical opinion is that the patient would suffer health hazards otherwise.
Nearly all of Grall’s Republican colleagues agreed, but Miami Republican Sen. Alexis Calatayud opposed the bill, insisting that the requirement become parental notification and not consent. Grall said she wasn’t willing to make that change.
“We have to consider how we protect vulnerable populations, and we cannot hope the best for them with the policy without creating some sort of protections for them,” Calatayud said.

Could there be an increase in teen pregnancies?
The state has been making strides toward reducing the number of teen pregnancies. Between 2004 and 2023, the rate of teen pregnancies among minors fell from 13.8 to 3.6 per 1,000 women in the state, according to FDH data.
Those numbers don’t capture how Florida’s reproductive care landscape has changed since the six-week abortion ban went into effect in May, but doctors already had to get parental consent or permission from a judge to provide abortions to minors.
Grall, who sponsored the law restricting abortions in most cases after six weeks’ gestation, said she wasn’t concerned about an increase in teen pregnancies and that minors could still report abuse to law enforcement or other mandated reporters.

With a shorter timeframe for minors to secure an abortion before six weeks’ gestation, pro-abortion advocates say access to birth control is essential.
“This bill helps no one and causes undue harm to young Floridians, who, under the current abortion ban, would be forced to carry out unwanted teen pregnancies due to lack of access to education, birth control, and testing,” said Tsi Day Smyth, chief deputy director of Voices of Florida. “I was here when y’all decided that parents do not have the authority to make these sorts of decisions when it comes to their kids’ gender-affirming care, and now you’re saying that they do have the authority to make these decisions when it comes to reproductive care. Pick a lane, please.”
The lack of sex education in public schools across the state also worsens the potential damage of the bill if kids don’t know how they can contract STIs, critics of the proposal said.
“At the end of the day, failing to educate young people, hampering our ability to conduct risk assessment surveys, and restricting access to family planning is a recipe for disaster for young people in Florida,” said Michelle Grimsley Shindano, director of Public Policy for the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates, in a press release.
Health care providers could face disciplinary actions if they disobey parental consent requirements, such as probation and suspension or revocation of their licenses, according to a legislative analysis of the bill. They could also have to pay fines of up to $10,000 per violation.
January Littlejohn, the Leon County mother whom First Lady Melania Trump invited to President Donald Trump’s speech to a joint session of Congress, was one of five people speaking in support of the bill. The parental rights advocate recently lost her appeal in the dismissal of her suit against the county’s school board and superintendent over a dispute relating to her child wanting to use pronouns and express a gender identity she didn’t approve of, according to the Tallahassee Democrat.
“Bottom line is, we cannot continue to presume all parents to be a risk of abuse with no due process, and continue to cut them out of medical and mental health care decisions for their children, because it is us, the parents, that know and love our children better than anyone else,” she said.
SB 1288 is not the only bill Grall filed angering pro-abortion advocates this legislative session. The Republican senator also wants parents to claim damages in the wrongful death of a fetus at any stage of development, which critics say would establish fetal personhood.

Rep. Jim Pressel, R-Rolling Prairie, said the major add-in targets “excessive” and unreasonable charges on towing invoices, especially for commercial vehicles like semitrailers.
Numerous trucking company representatives who testified at the Statehouse on Tuesday described thousands of dollars billed for “hidden” administrative fees and fuel surcharges — even when wrecked trucks were towed just a few miles down the road.

Because law enforcement typically decides which towing companies are called to accidents, truckers aren’t able to choose the service provider. And even when issues arise over unfair towing bills, logistics companies said they’re forced to pay the high fees in order to regain possession of both their trucks and trailers, which often contain time-sensitive loads.
“When we are number one in the nation for predatory towing when it comes to commercial vehicles, that’s not acceptable in my mind,” said Pressel, who authored the underlying bill.
“This bill really kind of gets us into a place where we can try and have a common sense approach that is fair with both parties,” he continued. “It’s a mediation tool.”
House Bill 1390 originally just dealt with BMV agency matters, like insurance verification, specialty license plates and registration stickers. After multiple amendments approved Tuesday by the Senate transportation committee, the bill now wraps in towing, as well as a ban on “outdoor” marijuana advertising.
The legislation was OK’d 6-1 by the Senate panel and heads next to the Senate Appropriations Committee.
There was hesitation from multiple senators, however, specifically around the bill’s creation of a state board to handle towing complaints. 
Concerned lawmakers acknowledged “serious issues” over unreasonable charges, but questioned whether the bill was “the right answer.”
“I don’t think this hits the target,” said Sen. Gary Byrne, R-Byrneville, the lone “no” vote on the bill. “I’m a small business owner myself. I’m going to pay the bill. I’m going to deal with the company through the court system. … That can already happen. … I just believe that there’re some other avenues besides creating this board.”
Addressing towing issues
Within the amended language are multiple provisions.
One would mandate that local law enforcement agencies establish a “towing rotation” policy to cycle through vetted and approved towing companies that are called to accidents, or enter into contracts with specific companies for emergency towing.
Some local agencies already maintain lists of towing companies. When an accident occurs, police call the next tow truck in the rotation. The goal is to clear scenes quickly and prevent favoritism by randomly selecting tow companies.
Under the bill, policies or contracts must define service rates, response times, storage requirements and conditions for suspension and removal of approved towing companies.
Similar provisions apply to Indiana State Police — which already has a robust rotation system. The bill stipulates that the department would have to review its towing service rate sheet at least once per year.

Another section sets fee regulations for emergency and private towing, with periodic rate reviews by law enforcement agencies to ensure “reasonableness.” Additional fees beyond those outlined in contracts between companies and law enforcement would be prohibited, according to the bill. Contracts also can’t include a minimum number of hours for a towing service to be invoiced.
Other pieces of the updated bill would allow owners to retrieve vehicles after paying 70% of the towing invoice and filing a towing complaint. Storage fees charged by towing companies would also be limited.
But most of the contention centered around a proposed “Towing Complaint Advisory Board,” a seven-person, governor-appointed panel responsible for reviewing complaints, particularly those related to excessive charges.
The Indiana attorney general would be tasked with creating a towing complaint form, and consumers would be able to challenge fees exceeding $1,000 for smaller vehicles and $20,000 for large ones. It would ultimately be up to the board to decide if charges are fair. The attorney general’s office would oversee any payment remittance.
Proponents of the bill said that board would address the few “ineffective” and “untimely” mechanisms that currently exist for refuting exorbitant charges.
“The states that seem to be ahead of us, much better than us, almost all of them have a process like is in here with the complaint board … to evaluate and determine what’s fair and what’s not,” said Gary Langston, president of the Indiana Motor Truck Association. “The towing and recovery industry is vital to us, to the trucking industry. Just like any industry, there are people who do a good job, and people who don’t. We’re only focused on those who are taking advantage of the situation. Because these things are happening every day.”

Three Hoosier trucking companies testified before the committee, detailing recent bills from towing companies.
Jessica Warnke, president and CEO of Anderson-based Carter Express, recalled when her company had a preferred, nearby tow truck on scene shortly after one of her company’s semis slid off the road. State police told Carter Express they couldn’t use that towing company, though, because it wasn’t next in the rotation.
Carter Express was later charged more than $17,000 by another towing company for a two-hour job, including a roughly $5,700-minimum charge for labor and equipment; $2,100 in administrative fees; and $1,600 for four days of storage. She said the incident happened on a Saturday, but an invoice wasn’t provided until the following Tuesday. The bill had to be paid before Carter Express could retrieve its truck and trailer.
“Really, the crux of the issue here is that the freight on our trailers is not ours: it’s our customer’s. We run mainly automotive freight, and we do just-in-time service, so those parts on those trailers are waiting to be put on a production line. I could shut down an entire production facility by having a trailer in an impound lot for four days,” Warnke said. “I don’t have a choice but to pay that invoice as soon as it’s given to me so that I can get that freight back.”
“We operate very lean,” she added. “I don’t have extra people on my staff. I don’t have general counsel. I don’t have lawyers … to help me figure out how to file a complaint. And where do I even file that complaint? Is it worth an attorney’s fee to go to small claims court? Some of these issues this bill would address will help me not have to worry about all that red tape.”
Towing companies on the defense
Karrie Driscol, president of the Indiana Towing and Wrecker Association, offered the only oppositional testimony, maintaining that Pressel’s bill “is not the way to solve this problem.”
Driscol cited state data showing 33,000 tows across Indiana each year. She said only 200 towing invoice complaints have been submitted to the attorney general’s office since 2019.
She said, too, that Hoosier towing companies are presently “stuck with 50% of the vehicles that no one ever claims.”
“We’re not getting paid on 50% of these accident calls … and we have to dispose of those loads. We have to pay to get rid of that stuff,” Driscol said. If 30% of fees are “tied up” during the complaint process, “that is going to affect towers across the state.”
“The problem that we’re seeing isn’t as large as what it is being put out here as,” she continued. “I will tell you that there are problems in the towing industry. There are those out there that are doing silly things. But there are ways to solve it.”










The problem that we're seeing isn't as large as what it is being put out here as.


– Karrie Driscol, president of the Indiana Towing and Wrecker Association


Driscol said her association would rather further collaborate with law enforcement to work out better rates.
“Why do we need a board to determine what’s what’s going to happen — and what not going to happen?” she asked. “If we’re going to create a board, we need to take the time and do it right. Don’t make a sloppy mistake — that’s what this board is going to do.”
Earlier in the session, legislation regulating vehicle towing tripped up House Republicans for more than two weeks before it eventually died.
House Bill 1493 would’ve forced towing companies to create service rate sheets, display them “conspicuously” and show them to owners present when their vehicles are being towed.
It also would’ve required that any property owner’s future contract with a towing company contain removal and storage rates alongside other provisions, and mandated that towing companies give vehicles back within 24 hours of getting partial payment. Other pieces would’ve regulated emergency towing services, created a statewide towing complaint process, and banned overcharging and paid referrals.
The measure made it through committee on a unanimous vote, but languished on the House’s daily agenda for eight straight session meetings as House Republicans filed competing amendments. It wasn’t taken up before a critical deadline.
Another take on towing regulations, House Bill 1108, failed to get out of committee.

For decades, women have worked diligently to carve out a space in the construction workforce, where discrimination and sexual harassment have kept the predominantly male industry, well, male.
Across the country, they organized for recognition. First in small committees that cropped up in places like Fort Worth, Texas, where in 1953, women came together to create their own support network later called the National Association of Women in Construction. Over the years they worked with their unions and created nonprofits in places like Oregon, Wisconsin, Vermont, Florida and Chicago to advocate for issues affecting women like how to change the hostile workplace culture, and deal with the persistent lack of child care for the early hours they often work.
The government created its own policies to ensure federal contractors were doing their due diligence to recruit and hire from a diverse workforce. But the Biden administration in particular was a boon to the movement, said Jayne Vellinga, executive director of Chicago Women in Trades, a nonprofit aimed at bringing more women into construction jobs.
Under Biden, the Commerce Department announced its goal to bring a million women into construction jobs, and created a requirement that recipients of large federal grants for semiconductor manufacturing include a plan for child care. The administration had also passed two laws aimed at boosting infrastructure in the country, which created a demand for skilled workers.
It was the perfect storm of opportunity and funding to expand their programming to bring more women into the workforce. “Our placement numbers have never been higher,” Vellinga said. But when Donald Trump returned to the White House, the forward momentum collapsed almost overnight. In a fiery inauguration speech, he declared he would dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in the government and create what he calls a color-blind, merit-based society. He promptly issued two executive orders calling DEI policies immoral and illegal and vowed to claw back funding.
Just two days later, CWIT received word that all of its federal grants were under review. These grants constitute 40% of CWIT’s budget, and the loss would jeopardize the future of the nonprofit’s work.
“We have complete whiplash,” Vellinga said.
Additionally, the tariffs have disrupted the construction industry, leading to a potential slowdown in projects and consequentially less need for workers, she said.

The nonprofit, whose participants overwhelmingly identify as Black and Latina women, offers pre-apprenticeship training covering topics like workplace safety and basic technical skills. It also partners with unions and industry leaders to advocate for workplaces free of discrimination and harassment, and trains employers in how to make construction sites more inclusive of women.
It’s work that is desperately needed in an industry where one in four women say they are always or frequently harassed, and where one in five LGBTQ+ workers say the same, according to findings from the Institute for Women’s Policy and Research. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued a report in 2023, which found that discrimination was still rampant in the industry, citing several instances of employers not hiring people because of their gender or race.
But that report has been erased from the website, and Vellinga said she feels like the reality of who is being discriminated against is being erased, too. “This narrative that women are taking jobs away from more qualified people has never been true. They are qualified and just asking companies to overcome whatever biases to give them a fair shot.”
The efforts taken to dismantle their work might also not be legal. In February, the nonprofit filed a lawsuit against the administration and several agencies, including the Department of Labor, seeking to declare the DEI executive orders unconstitutional. They are also suing on the grounds that the clawback of federal funds is outside of the jurisdiction of the Executive Branch since they are approved by Congress, and that it’s also infringing on their First Amendment right to free speech.
“What the Trump administration is trying to do is say that for you to receive this federal funding you have to adopt the administration’s viewpoint that DEI is impermissible, and you have to agree with our political agenda,” said Gaylynn Burroughs, a lawyer from the National Women’s Law Center, one of the organizations that is representing the CWIT in court. “The government is not allowed to do that.”
Catherine Fisk, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said in effect the orders chill constitutionally protected speech and threaten legal action against organizations who cannot know what it is that they are prohibited from doing because it’s so vague. “That is both a First Amendment violation that is broadly prohibiting advocacy and a due process violation,” she said: “The government is threatening to punish people without being clear of what they are being punished for.”
The 19th reached out to the Department of Labor, The Office of Management and Budget and the Department of Justice, which were all named as defendants, but did not hear back by press time.
Promoting diversity, equity and inclusion is not illegal, and these executive orders are a way to attack ideals fundamental to American society, Burroughs said. “When you peel it back, what we’re really talking about is the ability for people to not be discriminated against,” she said. “We do a disservice when we’re saying that it’s an attack on DEI. It’s an attack on civil rights, on workplace anti-discrimination.”
She continued: “The message that is being conveyed is, if you are not a white heterosexual man, and you are in public life, or you are in a job where you are successful, that you must have gotten there because of some unfair advantage, and that is really a poisonous way of thinking.”
In addition to endangering federal funding for DEI work, the Trump administration also rescinded an executive order that had been in place since 1965. The order prohibited federal contractors from discriminating in its hiring practices and required them to take affirmative actions to ensure that it was trying to recruit and hire women and people of color for its jobs, which are paid for with taxpayer dollars and in theory should be accessible to anyone who is qualified. Because some groups have been so effectively shut out of certain jobs, that work can look like providing opportunities for specific groups like women to learn skills and receive training to be competitive applicants in the job pool.
To help enforce the 1965 order, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs could perform audits on job sites to also ensure the workplaces were protecting employers equal rights. Jenny Yang, the former director of the office under Biden, said in some cases an audit has uncovered that women don’t have proper fitting personal protective equipment which can pose a safety risk, or are being harassed or discriminated against in other ways.
“Having an OFCCP investigator auditing those practices is what often catalyzes change because workers see that the federal government is there,” she said. It also offers workers an opportunity to report issues with their workplace anonymously versus having to file a complaint against their employer, which can open them up to retribution.
The agency has also played a role in correcting pay discrimination by conducting pay audits, said Yang. From 2014 to 2024 the agency obtained $261 million for employees and job seekers who were discriminated against. That money went to over 250,000 employees and applicants. That number included about 25,000 White people and men, who were alleged to have been discriminated against. “Our anti discrimination laws protect everyone,” Yang said.
But now that agency is being whittled down to a ghost of itself, with reports that the Department of Labor plans to lay off 90% of staff. The order announcing the rescindment said the work going forward would only apply to veterans and people with disabilities.
“The rescission of the executive order will have devastating consequences for workers and especially for women in the trades, many who have said they wouldn’t have an opportunity to support their families because of the discrimination many women face in that industry,” said Yang.
That’s because the opportunities afforded to women without college degrees pay much differently than those offered to men. It’s a phenomena known as occupation segregation, said Vellinga. “Our culture does not value the caretaking role, the roles that women have traditionally played, as much as they have valued the roles that men have traditionally played,” she said.
An example she likes to use is the difference between how the country pays certified nursing assistants, of which 88% are women, versus carpenters. Neither job requires a college degree, and both are physically demanding. But the median wage for nurse assistants is just $40,000 compared to $61,000 for carpenters according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Carpenters are also more likely to have pensions.
Now she fears that with a loss of protections in the workplace, and a fear from employers to even engage in DEI, those opportunities for women will just dry up. And her organization’s ability to bridge the gap in employment will be crippled.
If their federal funds are canceled they won’t be able to offer as many trainings, they won’t be able to work with employers to create workplaces free of discrimination and harassment, and they won’t be able to do as much outreach to educate women and girls that these opportunities even exist in the first place.
“For an organization who has spent decades trying to change a culture, we are still so far from the finish line,” Vellinga said. Nearly 96% of construction workers, to this day, are men. “It is really incredible that you could not acknowledge that reality.”

Congressional Republicans approved a budget resolution last month to reduce federal spending by $2 trillion as they seek $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. The resolution tasks the committee overseeing Medicaid to cut at least $880 billion over 10 years and the committee overseeing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to cut at least $230 billion. 
Medicaid cuts could result in 21,600 jobs lost, with SNAP cuts costing another 2,400 jobs, according to a report released Tuesday from the Commonwealth Fund and George Washington University. Those would include jobs in health care and food-related industries.
Federal Medicaid cuts could leave Missouri with huge budget shortfall

In addition to job losses, the report estimates Missouri in 2026 could lose over $1.6 billion in federal Medicaid funding and $356 million in federal SNAP funding. 
“The ripple effect will hit the entire health care system and impact everyone — not just those with Medicaid,” said Joseph Betancourt, president of the Commonwealth Fund, in a statement, “driving more people to emergency rooms and further straining an already overburdened system.”
The budget reductions, job losses and ripple effects could result in $4 billion in lost economic output for the state, the report estimates, and over $500 million in reduced tax revenue.
“Cuts of this magnitude will not be harmless,” said Leighton Ku, lead author of the report and director of the Center for Health Policy Research and professor of health policy and management at George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health, in a statement.
“In fact, such drastic reductions would harm millions of families and also trigger widespread economic instability and major job losses,” Ku said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Another report out this week, by the health policy organization KFF, focuses on the potential magnitude of Medicaid cuts on state budgets.
If the $880 billion in cuts were distributed evenly across states over 10 years, that would represent a cut of 39%, as a share of state Medicaid spending per Missouri resident, according to KFF.
The impact of those cuts would be felt more acutely in rural areas of Missouri. 
Timothy McBride, co-director of the Center for Health Economics and Policy at the Institute for Public Health at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, said during a briefing on Medicaid in mid-March that financial margins for rural hospitals are “razor-thin.”
“Even in the urban hospitals, they’re probably just a few percentage points, but in rural hospitals, they can be just a percentage point or 2 or negative,” McBride said. “So if you take away the Medicaid dollars, they’re certainly going to go negative. And if you wonder why rural hospitals close, that’s why.”
Medicaid cuts rippling through rural America could bring hospital closures, job losses

States’ options would be to increase taxes, cut other spending programs, cut benefits or pay providers less, according to KFF. Missouri expanded Medicaid to low-income adults in an initiative petition, enshrining eligibility in the constitution, and significant tax increases must be placed on the ballot, meaning either option would require a statewide vote. 
Congress hasn’t yet decided on specific proposals to achieve the proposed cuts. 
Some Republicans have opposed cuts to Medicaid, citing the effect on their constituents. That includes U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, who told reporters earlier this month: “… I’m not going to vote for something that ends up cutting benefits for people who are working and who qualify for Medicaid.”
According to a KFF survey last year, roughly 70% of Americans want Medicaid to continue as it is today. 
Last month, the director of the state Medicaid program told lawmakers the changes could “present a challenge” for the state budget.
One in every five Missourians is enrolled in Medicaid, or over 1.2 million people. 
Nearly 40% of all Missouri children are covered by Medicaid, which also pays for two-thirds of all nursing home care and 38% of all births.
Medicaid pays for two-thirds of all nursing home care in the state and 38% of all births. 
There are 321,003 families receiving SNAP benefits as of January.

Tarra Simmons, D-Bremerton, is the first formerly incarcerated legislator in Washington state. (Photo courtesy of Legislative Support Services)Lawmakers have sprung to the defense of a Washington state lawmaker who faced a protest at her home over the weekend.
Rep. Tarra Simmons estimated 20-25 protesters showed up at her Bremerton home on Saturday. The Democratic lawmaker held two town hall events that day in her district and was planning to stop at home after the first, but said she got calls from neighbors about the demonstration, so stayed away.
“I believe that people should have a right to free speech and assembly, I just wish they’d do it at my office or the Capitol,” Simmons said Tuesday.
Matthew Adams, who ran for Bremerton City Council in 2021, took credit for the hourlong protest. He said the demonstrators stayed on public property. “We were pretty respectful,” he added. 
He said they focused on Simmons because of her approach to public safety. Simmons, who was formerly incarcerated on theft, drug and firearm charges, has been a staunch advocate for strengthening rights and improving conditions for people in the criminal justice system, including those in prison.
“Criminals come to our homes, so why can’t we go to theirs?” Adams said Tuesday. 
Some of the signs at the protest included a mugshot of Simmons. Another called her a “Tarra-ist.” 
Elected in 2020, Simmons said her legislative career has been about eliminating the stigma people continue to face long after leaving prison. Her criminal record has been expunged. 
“This harassment could lead people to relapse and recidivate,” she said. “Lack of opportunity and constant harassment of people who have been incarcerated is what I’m trying to fight.”
The tactics drew condemnation from both sides of the aisle. 
“I think it is out of line for people to be targeted at their private homes for their political views,” said House Majority Leader Joe Fitzgibbon, D-West Seattle. 
House Minority Leader Drew Stokesbary, R-Auburn, agreed. “I don’t think it’s morally right to be harassing folks in their own home and making them feel unsafe,” he said. But he also called Simmons “soft on crime.”
One of her proposals, House Bill 1125, would pave the way for felony offenders to petition for a new prison sentence. But the House didn’t pass the measure before a deadline, so it is likely dead for the year.
“By protesting at her house, you lose the very good message, which is that Tarra Simmons wants to let criminals out of jail early, and, instead, how the protest was conducted was the story, and I don’t think that’s wise,” Stokesbary said.
Stokesbary hopes Democratic leaders condemn protests at the homes of Republican lawmakers, citing Washington Education Association demonstrations over the past decade.
After the protest at her home, demonstrators took to Simmons’ town hall in Bremerton, which she attended with her seatmates. 
Adams said he called her a “scumbag” there. He said he likes Democratic Rep. Greg Nance, who is also from Kitsap County, but not Simmons.
Adams said he doesn’t plan to hold another similar protest, saying he thought this one was effective.
In recent years, Lt. Gov. Denny Heck has championed bringing greater civility to politics. He spearheaded the development of the Project for Civic Health with the University of Washington, Henry M. Jackson Foundation and William D. Ruckelshaus Center.  
A report from the group found governing has gotten harder at the local level, with more than one mayor reporting protesters outside their homes. One had that happen during a wedding.

A crackdown on illegal massage parlors was also amended in.,"Sen. Aaron Freeman, R-Indianapolis, leads a committee meeting on Tuesday, March 25, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A testy Indiana senator on Monday repeatedly reminded committee members and witnesses alike of the “realities” of working at the Statehouse — after he significantly weakened a human trafficking awareness proposal. Detailed language cracking down on illegal massage parlors was also added, but could see further amendments.
“I get (that) you want all of it,” Sen. Aaron Freeman, R-Indianapolis said. “Understand (that) … a lot of businesses and their associations have come to see me and explain to me why this isn’t workable, and I’m trying to find a solution to keep it moving.”
Later, he told a witness, “There are realities, and there are things that are required to get bills to move.”

The National Human Trafficking Hotline, which operates 24/7 and in more than 200 languages, is at 1-888-373-7888. Suspected trafficking can also be reported.

House Bill 1416 originally ordered state-run rest stops and private gas stations to display posters describing human trafficking, outlining indicators, and providing contract information for the National Human Trafficking Hotline and a local law enforcement agency. Other provisions would’ve required restaurants and hotels to post similar written notices for employees to see and provide staff with state-approved awareness training.
Freeman’s amendment made gas station posters optional and deleted the training mandates — to the distaste of some committee members. It was accepted on a 6-3 vote.
Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, noted that many Hoosier establishments already voluntarily post awareness materials. She added that “when industry takes care of these issues,” a mandate isn’t necessary.
Democrats and a lone Republican disagreed.
“I think one sheet of paper isn’t going to break the bank for the gas stations … and if it saves one human life, I think it’s more than worth it,” said Sen. Sue Glick, R-LaGrange.
Freeman, meanwhile, told his committee that most days, he leaves the Statehouse frustrated.
“This building is the most exhilarating place to work, and it is the most mind-numbingly frustrating place to work, all on the same day. This building is about what’s possible, and this is what’s possible — today, anyway,” he concluded.
Freeman also allowed a colleague to call an amendment cracking down on illegal massage businesses — just two weeks after five women were arrested on prosecution-related charges at three Michigan City parlors, WNDU-TV reported.

“My law enforcement community back home asked me to do something. They’re frustrated, my mayors are frustrated, and they feel this is the best, easiest, most non-intrusive way to do it,” Sen. Mike Bohacek, R-Michiana Shores, said. He said current law only allows for pricey stings.
His amendment initially extended the poster requirements to massage parlors. It also blocks massage parlor advertisements from websites that also accept promotions for prostitution, escort and sexual services. Another addition bars “sexual conduct” and condoms at the parlors, and prohibits people from making arrangements there for sex elsewhere.
Employees would have to be fully clothed in opaque materials that don’t expose female nipples or show “covered male genitals in a discernibly turgid state.” Parlors would have to display photographs of their employees, accompanied by any massage therapist license numbers, in the reception area — and windows into reception areas couldn’t be more than half-blocked.
Other provisions ban parlors from housing any people, introduce detailed record-keeping requirements, let law enforcement officers inspect reception areas for compliance and allow for license suspensions.
Freeman asked if Bohacek would agree to changing “shall” provisions within the package of changes to “may” provisions.
“I cannot imagine a single illicit massage parlor that would ever do this,” Bohacek said, prompting Freeman to remark, “I’ve tried for 20 minutes to avoid saying what I’m about to say. I’ve tried to find some way to move this bill … I continue to try.”
Freeman later threatened to hold the legislation from a vote, calling it a “challenge.” Sen. Greg Taylor, D-Indianapolis, said he “can’t understand what the challenge would be to protect people from human trafficking.”

The committee agreed to make the amendment’s poster mandate voluntary, then adopted it on a 7-1 vote.
Witnesses representing survivors’ groups said they preferred the posters to be mandatory, while lobbyists for restaurants, hotels and convenience stores thanked lawmakers for the edits.
“One out of 100 trafficking victims survive,” said Evyn Wimer, an advocate working with Raindrops Rising Foundation. “How many more might make it out if they knew that they had a choice, if they saw a flyer in a bathroom stall and memorized a phone number?”
The legislation heads to the Senate floor after a unanimous, 9-0 vote — despite grumbling.

(Photo by Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images)“We didn’t start the fire,” singer Billy Joel tells us. “It was always burning since the world’s been turning.” Ten years ago today, however, Hoosiers started a new kind of flare-up that has been searing America’s political and social landscapes ever since.
The spark came on March 26, 2015, when then-Gov. Mike Pence signed the Indiana Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) in a “private ceremony” that created needless suspicion. In fact, RFRA was a law (full text here) nearly identical to laws previously passed in 18 other states, modeled on a 1993 federal law sponsored by Democrats and signed by President Bill Clinton.
Like the existing laws, Indiana’s RFRA established a legal defense for individuals against ordinances or legal actions that might force them to violate their religious beliefs. It neither mentions nor has anything specifically to do with gay marriage. In early 2015, however, as Americans awaited the Obergefell v. Hodges Supreme Court ruling, the involvement of some gay marriage opponents in the RFRA signing suggested a link.
A prominent Indiana University law professor (and gay marriage supporter) made clear several weeks before its passage that the law is “anything but a ‘license to discriminate.’”
The backlash
Hell broke loose in any case, centered on a claim spread by activists through social media that, yes, Indiana’s RFRA effectively licensed individuals and businesses to discriminate against people on the basis of their sexuality.
Traditional media outlets largely bought into it. As a national reporter told me at the time, what mattered was “what people believed.” CEOs, celebrities, basketball coaches—anyone with a Twitter account or a press spokesperson — echoed condemnation of a law that apparently none of them had read.
Foreshadowing much that was to come in America, facts and nuance took back seats to manufactured anger. Impassioned if badly misled protesters appeared at the Indiana Statehouse for tense standoffs, and unrest consumed Hoosier boardrooms, schools, and workplaces for days. Some other states — including Connecticut, which has the same law on its books — bizarrely instituted bans on government-funded travel to Indiana.
A small pizza shop was found in tiny Walkerton, where a member of the family that owned the shop said that they would not cater a gay wedding. Though no similar establishment in the state came forward or was found, signs appeared on the doors of countless other businesses declaring that “all are welcome,” as if all had not been welcome before.
Boycotts were threatened by businesses and convention sponsors, raising fears that the economic impact on Indiana could reach hundreds of millions of dollars. Pence made matters worse with an appearance on ABC News, during which he struggled to explain what RFRA did and didn’t do. He and other Republicans could have made clear that religious freedom and the rights of minorities have almost always gone together in free societies. In this instance, protecting religious freedom for a handful of dissenters made gay marriage more likely to be accepted by American society as a whole.
The legacy
In late March and early April 2015, however, the most strident voices carried the day, drowning out hope of reconciliation around a better social contract. Ultimately, the fires were quenched with a second law (Senate Enrolled Act 50) — also signed by Pence — stipulating that religious freedom is not a defense against legal actions alleging discrimination by a service provider. That constitutionally wobbly outcome advanced no one’s liberties while leaving behind seething tensions.
Yet for too many people, the main takeaway was to do it again.
After RFRA-like infernos, Indiana witnessed the brazenly unjust defenestration of leaders at Newfields and the Indianapolis Public Library. On other issues the benign “All Are Welcome” signs gave way to the arrogant “In This House” and “Slate of Hate” signs, which make every walk down the street a reminder of our troubled civil society. Hardly a legislative session in Indianapolis goes by without tribal protests that skirt consensus-seeking in favor of cheap slogans. And just as in 2015, no one’s circumstances get better as a result.
On matters as diverse as pandemic policies, Gaza, policing, abortion, and transgender youth, it has been like this across much of America since Indiana showed the terrible way.
On this somber anniversary, let us not be afraid to acknowledge what happened, muster our silent majorities, and seek an opportunity for renewal. Next time, we could show the rest of America how to put fires out rather than how to start them.

(Ciattarelli photo by Amanda Burns/Spadea photo by Hal Brown)MATAWAN — Bright red MAGA mugs. Hats emblazoned with the word “Fight!” Trump bobbleheads. Dangly Trump earrings.
A table filled with Donald Trump-themed merchandise greeted Republican voters at Palms Plaza catering hall in Matawan last week as they gathered to hear from GOP gubernatorial hopeful Bill Spadea, a former radio talk show host.
Spadea, one of five men running in the June 10 primary to win their party’s nomination for governor, spoke for 20 minutes in a room decorated in red, white, and blue, telling voters he’s been aligned with Trump since the president launched his first campaign for the White House in 2015.
One of his rivals for the Republican nod, Spadea noted, is former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, who has spoken critically of Trump in the past and once campaigned with erstwhile Trump opponent Nikki Haley.
“When you’ve got a Republican who’s willing to spend eight years attacking Donald Trump, writing checks as recently as this last primary in 2024 to Chris Christie, and then to turn around and pretend now that he’s pro-Trump, you’ve got a guy that is willing to say anything for a vote,” Spadea said. “And you can’t trust somebody who will do that.”

Spadea and Ciattarelli, a former assemblyman, are sparring this year for the allegiance of Trump supporters and racing to prove their MAGA bona fides in a state where the GOP hopes it can bounce back after losing two gubernatorial races in a row.
The fight over Trump’s base — and potentially the president’s endorsement — was evident last week when Ciattarelli posted pictures on social media of him standing next to a grinning Trump at the president’s Bedminster country club. The following day, according to the New Jersey Globe, Spadea met with Trump there.
Ashley Koning, director of Rutgers University’s Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling, said it’s obvious both men would love to win the votes of Trump supporters — but there’s a “big question mark” about whether their pitch to appeal to them could hurt in November’s general election, when one of them could be facing one of six Democrats hoping to succeed a term-limited Gov. Phil Murphy.
“It may be a more narrow focus on winning the primary because they think right now Trump would be a benefit to their campaign. In a couple months from now, it could be an entirely different story,” Koning said.
The last time Republicans held power in Trenton was in early 2018, before Gov. Chris Christie left office. Republicans haven’t controlled a chamber of the Legislature since 2001.
Ciattarelli and Spadea agree on plenty of policies. Both have said they would end the state’s “sanctuary status” for undocumented immigrants on their first day in office, suspend bail reform, and review public education curriculum they say has become overly sexualized. But they also represent two different wings of the Republican party in New Jersey.
Ciattarelli has long been seen as a moderate Republican. He lost the GOP nod for governor in 2017, won it in 2021, but then lost in the general election to Murphy. He has embraced Trump in recent months after criticizing him in 2016 and 2020. Spadea, meanwhile, has made a name for himself as a conservative firebrand after hosting a radio show on New Jersey 101.5 for nearly a decade. He’s long been critical of Murphy and Democratic policies.
Ciattarelli also appeared last week in Monmouth County, home to the second-largest number of registered Republicans in the state. Speaking to voters at the Gramercy at Lakeside Manor in Hazlet Thursday, Ciattarelli mentioned Trump briefly during his initial remarks, saying he saw how Trump unified his party last year by winning all the nation’s swing states and coming closer to winning New Jersey than any Republican presidential hopeful has in decades. But after that, Ciattarelli barely mentioned the president.
Ciattarelli said he has two very different opponents in this year’s race for governor: one who calls Trump supporters a cult (a reference to anti-Trump Republican state Sen. Jon Bramnick) and one who calls “anybody who disagrees with him a RINO,” a Republican in name only.
“That’s division and subtraction,” Ciattarelli said. “I’m somebody who believes in the power of addition, and it’s my job to bring a very positive energy to the campaign.”
He highlighted the “stark difference” between Republicans’ and Democrats’ priorities, and focused on the importance of flipping more seats in the Legislature to bring Republicans back into power. This year, all 80 Assembly seats are up for grabs. Democrats in that body hold a 52-28 majority.
Another Republican hoping to become our next governor is Mario Kranjac, a former Englewood Cliffs mayor who brands himself as a “forever Trumper.” Kranjac in an interview said he — not Spadea, not Ciattarelli — is the Republican candidate most aligned with Trump, pointing to his record as a mayor and a business owner. When he was first elected mayor of Englewood Cliffs in 2015, he was the first Republican to win the job in 40 years.
He said his opponents’ inconsistent support for Trump won’t help them because “Trump voters are too smart to vote for people who don’t have fixed values and beliefs.”
“They have to poll, and put their finger up in the wind to figure out what they believe in. I’ve always had fixed values and fixed beliefs,” he said. “I don’t need to have other people influence where I stand.”
A January poll of the governor’s race from Emerson College found that while most Republicans are undecided, Ciattarelli has 26% support, compared to Spadea’s 13%. An early March Farleigh Dickinson University poll measuring name recognition and favorability gave Ciattarelli a commanding but tenuous lead over his rivals (Kranjac wasn’t included in either poll).
“We’re talking about a statewide election for the highest office in our state, and I think we don’t know the answer yet of what Republicans are thinking and what Republicans want,” Koning said. “Do they want someone who’s going to completely align with the Trump administration on both fiscal and social policy, or will they want somebody who kind of differentiates themself?”
Spadea — who, like Ciattarelli, has criticized Trump in the past, calling his first administration a failure — told the New Jersey Monitor that the Republican Party has become a big tent now that “the politics caught up with our principles.” But Ciattarelli’s late-game shift shows he’s an “opportunist,” Spadea said.
“It’s going to hurt him because it just shows he’s a typical politician who will just say anything for a vote,” Spadea said. “And I think he’s exposed himself because people aren’t buying it.”
Asked to respond, Ciattarelli said his job is to attract all Republicans, and he thinks Trump supporters will choose him over Spadea because “they’re going to align themselves with the person who can win.”
When asked about Spadea’s jabs at Ciattarelli’s slow support for Trump, Ciattarelli replied, “Bill’s initials are B.S. for a reason.”

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Last year, pharmacist Harry Webb said his three-store chain of Webb’s Family Pharmacy filled a collective 161,000 prescriptions for over 10,000 patients. But independent pharmacies like his are closing at an alarming rate across the county, with many owners pointing the finger at Pharmacy Benefit Managers, or PBMs. 
“The PBM business is a shell game. Quite frankly, what we are getting paid is not what they’re billing,” Webb told a House committee on Tuesday. “Independent pharmacies are at the bottom … when it comes to getting reimbursed.”
“I’m not seeking special treatment,” Webb told lawmakers. “I’m just trying to get fair reimbursement.”
Webb was joined by a handful of other owners and association leaders to urge House committee members to push forward Senate Bill 140, a proposal that would implement several new regulations on PBMs. 
Specifically, it would require the entities to ensure network adequacy and prohibit perceived conflicts of interest between a PBM, insurer or retail pharmacy.
Such vertical integration has been the subject of a federal investigation, which concluded that pharmacy middlemen are raising prices and committing other anti-competitive practices, such as reimbursing their own retail pharmacies at higher rates than independent stores.
 
According to committee testimony, Indiana has roughly 450 chain pharmacy retail stores compared to about 200 supermarket-based or outlet locations. There are approximately 125 independent pharmacies located throughout the state.


Opponent Joey Fox said that restrictions on ownership ties between PBMs and other corporations, “flies in the face” of free market principles. 
“We believe that the key question to ask everybody is, ‘Do we want health care spending to go up, or do we want it to go down?’ Every other effort by this body has been aimed at getting health care spending to go down,” Fox said. “This bill, unequivocally and unquestionably, causes health care spending to go up.”
Fox testified on behalf of the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, which advocates on behalf of the nation’s major PBMs. Costs like a dispensing fee, which would guarantee some payments to independent pharmacies from PBMs, would ultimately just get passed along to policy holders like employers, Fox said. 
“This bill makes it illegal for us to offer a better deal on drug prices to employers,” Fox said.
The underlying bill attracted several hefty amendments, including one that would allow the State Personnel Department to pursue a contract to run a PBM for state employees and government insurance beneficiaries. 
None of the amendments were accepted by the committee on Tuesday, however, nor did the bill advance.

Why? It’s like the bank robber Willie Sutton said when someone asked him why he robbed banks, “That’s where the money is.”
Just in case that’s the plan, let me tell you a story.
Sometime in 1990 a young man sat on a couch in my house and asked for help. He had a brain tumor. He was there because an older friend of his brought him and insisted that I was somebody who could help him. I wasn’t so sure. I was in my first term as a state representative and was just feeling my way around. I didn’t yet understand the power that having a title gave to a person. Louie, the older man, did.
He knew not only that that title gave me the power to help, it also gave me the responsibility to help.
The young man worked at a local lumber mill “pulling chain”—removing and sorting boards coming off a chain conveyor at a very rapid rate. Sometimes, because of the tumor, he would black out, and the boards would come whizzing past him. His workmates covered for him during these spells and took on his share of the work until he snapped out of it and resumed working.
He had no medical insurance. He couldn’t afford it, and even if he could have afforded it, it wouldn’t have paid for the operation to remove the tumor because it was a “pre-existing condition” that no insurance company would then cover. 
At that time the only way a person who needed expensive medical care, but couldn’t pay for it, was to get on a program called Social Security Disability Insurance. It usually took three years and required hiring a lawyer. 
He was in a hard place. The only good news was that the tumor wasn’t cancerous and would be easy to remove. But it was still growing, and his blackouts would get worse.
I decided to call a person I knew slightly who worked for Montana’s Sen. Max Baucus and ask for her advice. Holly Luck answered and I explained the situation. She asked to talk with the young man, so I handed him the phone, but he didn’t take it. He couldn’t take it. He had blacked out. 
When he came to, I gave him Holly’s number to call. He did, and the Senator’s office quickly got him on Social Security Disability Insurance, he had the surgery and was able to go back to work as a productive part of the American workforce.
That’s the way it was before the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid Expansion. There were a lot of stories like that. Keeping people healthy keeps them working and contributing to a healthy economy. If we want that for America, the choice between subsidizing billionaires and keeping American workers working should be pretty clear.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-168258400-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Dan Forer | Getty Images)State Superintendent candidate Brittany Kinser said Tuesday she would support Milwaukee schools and advocate for reform to the state funding formula if elected, but declined to explain what she would specifically advocate for, saying that she needs more information and isn’t an expert.
Kinser, an education consultant, is challenging incumbent Jill Underly for the nonpartisan position in the April 1 election. The state superintendent is responsible for overseeing the state’s 421 public school districts, leading the state Department of Public Instruction and has a seat on the University of Wisconsin Board of Regent.
At an hour-long event hosted by the Milwaukee Press Club, the Rotary Club of Milwaukee and WisPolitics, Kinser answered questions from WisPolitics President Jeff Mayers and the audience about her stances. Both DPI candidates were invited to take part, but Underly declined. The two candidates participated in a conversation hosted by other groups last week.
Kinser has outraised her opponent partially due to the contributions she’s brought in from the Republican Party. According to recent campaign finance filings, Kinser raised $1,859,360 from Feb. 4 through Mar. 17. The Republican Party of Wisconsin contributed $1.65 million, and other political organizations $8,380, while individuals contributed $200,980. 
Underly raised $1,063,866 in the same time period, with $850,000 coming from the Democratic Party of Wisconsin.
Mayers asked Kinser, who has previously called herself a moderate, whether the support makes her “uncomfortable” because she is being cast “as the conservative Republican individual” in the race.
“I’m very thankful for all of my supporters. I’m thankful for the Republicans, the Democrats, the independents who have supported me,” Kinser said.
Kinser spoke to some of the issues that Milwaukee Public Schools, the state’s largest school district, has faced in recent years, including the financial crisis that led to audits by the state, recent results from the “nation’s report card” that show wide racial achievement gaps in the district, and reports of lead in schools. Kinser, who has worked in the charter school sector in Milwaukee in the past and is from Wauwatosa, has repeatedly criticized her opponent for problems in the district.
Kinser said she thinks some of the problems are a result of the governance and leadership of the district and said she is excited about the recently hired MPS superintendent. 
Brenda Cassellius, a former superintendent of Boston Public Schools and former Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Education, started her tenure earlier this month — taking over a vacancy left by the former superintendent who resigned after details emerged of a financial crisis at the district.
“We all need to support her because her successes are children’s success, so we need to make sure that she has the support she needs,” Kinser said. 
She said she hasn’t spoken to Cassellius yet.
“I’ve been a little busy, but I hope to meet her,” Kinser said. “If I get elected, she’ll be definitely on the top of my list to reach out to.”
Kinser said that she hopes Cassellius will “create very clear goals on what she wants to see with operations and academics, financials, and that she can meet those goals.” If the problems persist after some time, that would be the time for the state to step in, she said. 
Kinser said she hasn’t supported splitting up the district — as Republicans have proposed in the past — but she would be open to discussing the possibility. 
“I think that would actually cause more bureaucracy,” Kinser said. “If that’s what the community wanted, I’d be supportive as long as we could show the kids would have better results, that kids can learn how to read, they’re not going to be poisoned by lead — all of those things.”
Kinser said she wants to open a DPI office in Milwaukee to work with the district. 
When it comes to funding, Kinser said MPS gets a lot of money per child, but said special education is underfunded. 
“I want to make sure we have an increase,” Kinser said. She has said that she thinks the current reimbursement model for special education costs is outdated and would want to look to other states to see if there is another way to do it.
Kinser again said that she would want to help modernize the state funding formula, but she didn’t provide specific suggestions. She said she would want to look at other states and consult with others when asked about her ideas for modernizing the funding formula. She named Florida, Colorado as states with funding models she would want to look at.
“I would hire someone to help me do this work because I am not a financial expert in school funding and so would have to look and see what they’re doing in other states,” Kinser said.
She also emphasized that the ultimate decision wouldn’t be made by the state superintendent.
“We could provide ideas. The Legislature and the governor have to sign off. I’m not a lawmaker,” Kinser said. “People talk about this role as if it were a lawmaker.”
While the state superintendent recommends an education budget, the final proposal comes from the governor’s office. For the 2025-27 budget, which state lawmakers will take up starting in April, Underly submitted a proposal to increase public education by $4 billion. Gov. Tony Evers trimmed that back to more than $3 billion before submitting his draft budget. 
Kinser declined to weigh in on whether Evers’ recommendation was “right or wrong.” 
“I haven’t created my own state budget,” said Kinser, who is making her first run for public office. “I just started this 100 days ago, but I would want to make sure that it’s something that is possible because you want to be taken seriously by the Legislature and the governor.”
Across the state, many school districts have held referendum votes in the last couple of years to increase local property taxes, covering budget shortfalls. 
Kinser said she agrees there are too many referendums, but also said she hadn’t thought about whether the state is relying too much on property taxes for school funding. Asked if the state should rely more on sales tax or the income tax to fund schools, Kinser said she thinks the state would probably need to rely on both.
“I don’t know. Like I’m telling you, I’m not an expert in that,” Kinser said. “I promise to learn more about it [and] try to find the best way for communities, but I don’t want to say something that I’m not an expert in.” 
She added that she would seek advice on such matters. “I promise to have experts around me to answer these questions that you’re [asking], talk with Republicans, Democrats, independents, anyone that owns a home, that has children, worried about their kids,” Kinser said. 
Kinser has never held a teacher’s license in Wisconsin, and she recently updated her Wisconsin administrator’s license after a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report that her license had lapsed in 2024.
She emphasized that there is no requirement in state law that the state superintendent hold a teacher’s or administrator’s license
“We’re not trying to be a teacher or a principal in the school. You don’t need that. You just need to be a citizen of Wisconsin,” Kinser said. She added that she has a varied background with experience as a special education teacher as well as a charter school principal and leader, but that getting licensed in Wisconsin was difficult.
Kinser, who supports school choice and has lobbied for increased funding to voucher schools, was also asked about a report from the Journal Sentinel published Tuesday morning. The report found that a Milwaukee-based virtual private school received millions of dollars from the state despite being virtual — blurring the lines between the state voucher program, which uses state funds to send students to private and charter schools, and homeschooling, which isn’t eligible for state funding.
“Does that bother you as an educator that there’s this virtual school that’s getting this much state money?” Mayer asked.
“I would have to look into this,” Kinser said. “I did not read the article today. I was not made aware. Sounds like there’s some controversy there.”

Kevin Stitt, $10,000 per month to provide “crisis communications support” amid the fallout of the abrupt resignation of a popular university president. 
The regents hired Pinkston Group to also provide “reputation management and other consulting as needed” just days before announcing former Oklahoma State University President Kayse Shrum had abruptly resigned Feb. 3, according to a contract obtained by Oklahoma Voice.
Oklahoma State University’s public records division released a copy of the year-long contract, which runs from Feb. 1 through Jan. 31, 2026, in response to an open records request filed last month. It wasn’t immediately clear which funding source would be used to pay for the contract, which will cost at least $120,000 annually.
Pinkston Group’s senior vice president Donelle Harder has close ties to Stitt, an OSU graduate, and is part of the team fulfilling the contract. She previously worked as an adviser to Stitt, as vice president of the Oklahoma Oil and Gas Association, and as a spokesperson for former U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe. 
While she spoke on behalf of the regents following their special board meeting Feb. 7 after Shrum’s departure and the appointment of Jim Hess as interim OSU president, records show the contract with the D.C.-based public relations firm had not formally been signed. The contract was signed by Pinkston’s chief executive officer Feb. 19 and the OSU A&M Board of Regents’ CEO on Feb. 21. 
But a request for proposals provided by OSU indicates that the governing board had begun searching for “as-needed reputation management and crisis management support” in December. 
The request outlines a need for services for the regents and the institutions under their governance. While OSU and its campuses “represent a significant portion of reputational and crisis management needs,” the services are also available to the other institutions under the board’s jurisdiction: Langston University, Oklahoma Panhandle State University, Northeastern Oklahoma A&M College, and Connors State College, according to the proposal.
“The OSU Department of Brand Management oversees the OSU System’s marketing and communications strategy and supports the advancement of OSU’s land-grant mission and strategic initiatives,” said Mack Burke, spokesperson for OSU, in a statement. “While the Department of Brand Management works in partnership with the OSU/A&M Board of Regents, its support of the board is limited to pertinent OSU activities.”
While OSU did not provide its budget for its in-house communications division Tuesday afternoon, university officials said that in addition to public relations staff, the department also employs designers, photographers and web developers.
When asked for comment, Harder provided a statement from her employer.
Christian Pinkston, founder and CEO of the firm, said in a statement that the group participated in a competitive request for proposal process and was selected as an approved vendor in late January and worked with the governing board while the contract was formalized. 
“We have a specialized practice providing support to governing boards and universities across the country,” he said in a statement. “Our Senior Vice President, Donelle Harder, is on the leadership team of this practice with extensive expertise in the field. Our Oklahoma City team, alongside Donelle Harder, is honored to serve the OSU/A&M Board of Regents over the next year, bringing our experience and commitment to excellence in communications.” 
In addition to the monthly cost of the contract, the regents will also reimburse Pinkston for “press releases, travel, third party fees, and all other reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket expenses incurred.”

Vasquez and U.S. Sen. Heinrich good marks.,"U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez, delivering remarks to the New Mexico Legislature earlier this year. (Photo by Eddie Moore/Albuquerque Journal)U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez, a New Mexico Democrat representing the state’s 2nd congressional district, landed 12th on the bipartisan list of 12 freshmen representatives “exceeding expectations” in the recently concluded 118th Congress. The list comes as part of the nonpartisan Center for Effective Lawmaking’s annual Legislative Effectiveness Scores, released this week.
Each member included on the list “had at least one of their sponsored bills become law or at least had the language from one of their sponsored bills substantially incorporated into another measure that ultimately became law,” the report said.
Vasquez sponsored 26 “substantive” bills, according to his score, three of which received action in committee and one of which became law. While none of Vasquez’s bills became law themselves, the center credits lawmakers when language from their bills is adopted elsewhere. In Vasquez’s case, that refers to  H.R. 8417 – the “Rural Installation Job Protection Act,”  which became part of the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act, Colin Achilles, the center’s associate director, told Source via email.
In a statement provided to Source, Vasquez said it was “an honor to be recognized among the top freshmen lawmakers delivering results. From fighting for affordable housing and rural broadband to protecting public lands and securing resources for New Mexico communities, I’ve worked hard to ensure our district’s needs are front and center in Congress. This recognition reflects a commitment to putting people over politics and proving that even in a divided Congress, progress is possible when we lead with purpose.”
The report itself says that “research suggests that performance in a legislator’s freshman term is highly correlated with subsequent lawmaking effectiveness, as well as with their overall career trajectory,” the report noted. “We might expect to see these Representatives continuing to be effective lawmakers and setting the agendas of the Democratic and Republican parties in the future.”
According to the Center, it utilizes 15 metrics to generate scores for all members of the U.S. House and Senate, analyzing the bills members of Congress sponsor; their trajectory through the lawmaking process; and the substantive nature of the policy proposals.
All of the state’s all-Democratic delegation at least met expectations, according to the report. In the U.S. House, Vasquez ranked 50 out of 220 U.S. representatives. U.S. Reps. Melanie Stansbury and Teresa Leger Fernández, of the 1st and 3rd Congressional districts, ranked at 144 and 66, respectively.
In the U.S. Senate, U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich exceeded expectations, while U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján met them, the report said. Heinrich ranked 11 out of 51 —narrowly missing the top 10 list for U.S. Senate Democrats — introducing 61 substantive bills, two of which became law; Luján ranked 38 out of 51, and introduced 66 substantive bills, none of which became law.
The report concluded that while the 118th Congress began slowly, in the end, hundreds of bills became laws. Moreover, despite “the challenges of divided government, internal disruptions, and a contentious presidential election year, many of the same lawmakers who succeeded in advancing their proposals in previous Congresses continued their patterns of highly effective lawmaking.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20250130-news-congress-3.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

Mike Braun signs his first bill into law during a Statehouse ceremony on Tuesday, March 25, 2025. (Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana Gov. Mike Braun signed his first bill into law Tuesday, establishing a new online agricultural portal for Hoosier farmers.
House Bill 1149, authored by Rep. Kendall Culp, R-Rensselaer, creates an online hub coined by Braun as a “one-stop-shop” for farmers to communicate with state government and “get information they need to be successful.”
The governor additionally said the new law will help farmers “avoid red tape.”
“Hoosier farmers feed America and power our economy, and this bill makes their important job a little bit easier,” Braun told reporters at a Statehouse bill signing ceremony.
The Indiana State Department of Agriculture is tasked with creating and maintaining the new online portal. Its features will provide Hoosier farmers with centralized funding information, including a searchable database of grants with deadlines and eligibility; regulatory checklists to help avoid violations when entering new markets; tools for tracking lost farmland; and communication channels to provide feedback on federal regulations and state-level agricultural services.
The bill was part of Braun’s “Freedom and Opportunity” agriculture agenda. 
Six other measures were signed into law on Tuesday, including a bill to update Indiana’s “25-foot rule” — first passed into law in 2023 — which allows law enforcement officers to move witnesses back 25 feet from an active crime scene.
In response to lawsuits filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana and others, House Enrolled Act 1122 clarifies that officers can only invoke the rule if they have a “reasonable belief” that a person’s presence will interfere with their lawful duties.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana legislation to study relocation of a poor-performing casino’s license could also lead to a rare license expansion — and regulators have already gotten started.
One witness at a Tuesday hearing called the study itself “destabilizing” for the industry.
“The way that companies would look at this, is studying it would imply that there’s an interest in moving it … or creating another one,” said Jim Purucker, a lobbyist representing Caesars Entertainment and its three Hoosier casinos.
He said it’s “very fair” for licensees “to suggest that there’s a move afoot.”
Senate Bill 43 previously required the Indiana Gaming Commission to contract out for a study to “identify the top three regions in the state” for a license relocation.
After the committee accepted an amendment by consent Tuesday, that analysis would only take place “subject to available funding.” It narrowed the study to two regions — but expanded it by striking relocation-specific language.

“I think if you just look at a map of casinos in the state, it’s pretty clear the biggest hole in the market is northeast Indiana. … The other thing that has been floated multiple times over the years has been an Indianapolis casino,” Rep. Ethan Manning said.
He authored the amendment and chairs the committee.
“I think it leaves us a possibility of studying that. … I’m not even sure there would be an appropriate third region to study,” Manning, R-Logansport, continued. Still, he noted that the legislation doesn’t dictate locations, and the contractor would choose.
Purucker said the study is “tremendously destabilizing” for the industry and called it “another factor” in capital expenditure decisions.
“It’s just not how we treat any other industry,” Purucker said. “We don’t talk about, you know, how we want to put other competitors in place with other industries.”
Manning, however, said more information is preferable.
“It’d be good to … have professionals do the study rather than just (us) just deciding things without the data,” he told Purucker.
Rep. Kyle Miller, D-Fort Wayne, said it’s also “entirely possible” that researchers conclude a 14th license “isn’t valuable to the state.”
Senate Bill 43 began as an empty vehicle bill — and was only overhauled after the early death of a measure relocating a struggling casino operating near the Indiana-Kentucky border.

Full House Resorts hoped Senate Bill 293 would let it move the Rising Star Casino Resort 150 miles north to New Haven, in northeast Indiana. But a Senate committee’s chair killed the proposal after listening to about 20 opponents, who feared gambling addictions and other risks to their community.
Rep. Justin Moed, D-Indianapolis, asked Sen. Andy Zay — who authored both bills — whether he’d support the study if its recommendations were to point outside northeast Indiana.
“Yeah. I mean, we’re here to represent the whole state, and I think that’s the genesis of this conversation,” Zay, R-Huntington, replied. “We have a way under-performing license that really has brought this conversation on … I think it’s incumbent upon us to look at our 13 licenses and mak(e) sure that those are being maximized, wherever that would be.”
The committee approved the amended bill on a unanimous, 11-0 vote.
Regulators would also now have to present their findings to the State Budget Committee by November, a month later than previously proposed.
The Indiana Gaming Commission has already made headway on the draft’s mandates.
In a request for quotations — with submissions due March 14 — regulators wrote, “This study is being sought in response to currently pending legislation,” and listed requirements copied from the bill “as currently written.”
The commission re-emphasized the bill’s pending nature while answering some of the questions asked by interested, in another document obtained by the Capital Chronicle.
“Greater clarity might be possible once the Bill is finalized,” regulators wrote.

The weekly distribution has been seeing a continual growth of clients and now serves over 300 people in line every week.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)For the Day Eagle Hope Project, federal money has helped volunteers deliver fresh produce and meat to families in need across the remote Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in northern Montana — while putting cash into the hands of farmers, ranchers and meat processors.
The nonprofit generally has less than $300,000 to spend per year. So the $200,000 from a U.S. Department of Agriculture local food buying program drastically raised both the quantity and quality of the food it could distribute.
“They were a major, major contributor to our food,” said Tescha Hawley, who directs the organization, which aims to improve physical, mental and spiritual health.
The USDA recently nixed more than $1 billion from two programs that helped food banks and school meal programs buy local foods, including $660 million for schoolchildren. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins recently described the programs as “nonessential.”
But the move has left hundreds of school systems and food banks reeling. They already face rising food prices and are struggling to help community members with growing food insecurity.
Created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs aimed to build more resilient supply chains of domestic food by connecting schools and food pantries with small ranches, farms and dairies. The program was initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but later expanded by the Biden administration.
The federal programs stimulated the purchase of locally grown fruits, vegetables, dairy and meats — benefiting both the smaller farmers who received fair market pay for their products and the organizations granted funds to buy high quality foods.
The noncompetitive grants sent hundreds of millions of dollars to all 50 states, the District of Columbia and 84 tribal governments, boosting business for more than 8,000 farmers and providing local food to almost as many food banks. The Trump administration is killing the programs, despite Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s campaign against processed food, which he says is “poisoning” Americans.
Without ongoing funding, Hawley said, she would have to rely on cheaper, less nutritious food.
“It’s simple, right? I can get a truck … in here with all highly processed food, no problem,” she said.
Schools are facing a similar challenge: While officials running breakfast and lunch programs would prefer to buy more local products, those are often expensive. And with underfunding, high food costs and labor struggles, school lunch programs are already stretched thin.
In Milan, Tennessee, the federal funds allowed the local school system to buy minimally processed beef from a local stockyard, and broccoli, purple hull peas, tomatoes and melons from local growers.
Vickie Dunaway, who supervises the school system’s food services, told the Tennessee Lookout the federal cuts mean “going backwards” on purchasing healthier foods.
“That will obviously have to be cut out, because our budget will not withstand being able to purchase local,” she said. “Purchasing local, minimally processed food is way more expensive than buying from a distributor.”
 A ‘devastating’ cut to food banks

Late last year, USDA said the programs had already spent more than $1 billion on local foods, and announced an expansion of the two programs with an additional $1.13 billion. USDA has killed that $1.13 billion expansion; it is still reimbursing the previously committed funds.
The Trump administration, which has sought to dramatically slash the size of the federal government, told recipients earlier this month that the programs “no longer effectuate the goals of the agency.”
In a statement to Stateline, the USDA said the current administration is “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
“The COVID era is over — USDA’s approach to nutrition programs will reflect that reality moving forward,” the statement said.










The only thing we’ll be able to do is just ration what little we have — to spread it as thinly as possible over the number of households we provide food to.


– Eric Cooper, president and CEO of the San Antonio Food Bank


The nonpartisan National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, which represents the ag department leaders of all 50 states, last month lobbied the federal government to continue the local foods program with permanent funding and ease procurement regulations for school meal programs. Arkansas Secretary of Agriculture Wes Ward, president of the association, said in a statement that the local food programs aid both producers and consumers.
“Investing in local and regional food systems not only strengthens the connections between farmers and their local communities, it bolsters supply chain resiliency as well,” his statement read.
In New Mexico, the program allowed food banks to buy some 900,000 pounds of locally grown food from more than 200 farmers since 2023. Before the program was terminated, the state was expecting close to $3 million in additional funding, Source New Mexico reported.
Jill Dixon, executive director of The Food Depot in northern New Mexico, called the cuts “devastating.”
In Texas, the San Antonio Food Bank counted on USDA’s local food program to help round out the food boxes it provides to families in need. The food bank, which serves more than 100,000 people across 29 Texas counties, largely relies on donated foods from hotels, restaurants and grocery stores.
“The challenge is I might get peanut butter donated, but I don’t have the jelly, or I might have pasta donated, but I don’t have the marinara,” said Eric Cooper, president and CEO of the food bank. “This program allowed us to purchase those items that we didn’t get that then helped round out the food box, or really complement the food that was being donated to give families the ability to make meals.”
The program initially provided the food bank nearly $3 million in grant funding — about 20% of what the organization spends each year on bulk food purchases. It expected a similar amount this year, before USDA’s announcement.
Cooper said cuts come even as the need for assistance rises. Food prices have squeezed families, and mass layoffs of federal workers portend more demand for food assistance in the coming months, he said.
“And we’ll be caught in the middle. And you know, that’s an incredibly uncomfortable place to be. The only thing we’ll be able to do is just ration what little we have — to spread it as thinly as possible over the number of households we provide food to.”

 A boost for school lunches

For years, school meal programs have struggled with tight margins. Not only do they have to meet strict nutritional guidelines, but schools also face lagging reimbursement from the federal government and spend millions covering the cost of students’ unpaid meal debt.
At the 1,600-student Monticello School District in Arkansas, that debt is approaching $60,000.
So $50,000 from USDA’s local food program was a significant boost to the bottom line.
“That was such a help,” said Amanda West, the district’s child nutrition director.
The southeast Arkansas district used grant money to buy locally grown ground beef. The beef went into dishes including taco salad, meatloaf and spaghetti.
West said staff and students immediately noticed a difference in taste from conventionally purchased meats. And though the local product cost more, West said it also yielded more because it was not full of additives that cause the meat to shrink when cooked.
West, who is the president of the Arkansas School Nutrition Association, noted that her state is home to the nation’s highest rates of food insecurity.
West had hoped to see the local foods program help turn that tide by bringing more stability to school meal programs and growing the state economy by boosting local farmers, ranchers and distributors.
“We’re all upset about it. I hate that we’re not receiving it because grocery prices are 30, 40% higher than what they were a few years ago, and it really hurts our budget,” she said. “It helped a lot of districts, including mine, and it would be amazing if we could get it back.”
On top of the local foods program cuts, congressional Republicans are considering billions in potential cuts to free and reduced-price school meal programs — cuts the School Nutrition Association says could potentially affect millions of American students.
The federal government partially subsidizes breakfast, lunch and after-school snack programs at rates calculated by the income level of students’ families.
The School Nutrition Association, which represents 50,000 school meal providers across the country, said the school meals are the healthiest many American children receive. But that group says federal reimbursements are far from adequate, leaving members worried about the future of their meal programs.
In a recent association survey of more than 1,390 school meal directors, more than 90% reported serious or moderate concern over the financial sustainability of their school meal programs three years from now.

House Republicans beware; we are coming for your seats.”Democrats, who have been publicly fighting each other lately about how best to oppose Trump’s agenda, barely lost the House during the 2024 elections. Republicans secured 220 seats, compared to Democrats’ 215.EMILYs List cites several reasons it doesn’t believe the 46 Republicans should stay in office, though all of the issues highlighted have to do with abortion access and reproductive rights.For example, it notes which of the GOP lawmakers signed a 62-page amicus curiae brief filed to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2021 that urged the justices to overturn Roe v. Wade, eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion.The brief description of each Republican also cites which members have sponsored bills that would implement nationwide abortion bans and which GOP lawmakers voted against approving a bill that would have guaranteed people the right to use contraception without government interference.The GOP House members that EMILYs List hopes to unseat represent congressional districts considered toss-ups, by the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter, as well as districts that lean more favorably toward one party or the other.EMILYs List is one of several left-leaning organizations that will focus their efforts during the next 19 months on securing Democratic wins come November 2026. History will likely be on Democrats' side during the midterm elections, since the political party that doesn’t control the White House typically wins control of the House. That, however, is far from a guarantee.Polling from NBC News, released in mid-March, shows that just 7% of voters have a “very positive” view of the Democratic Party with another 27% responding they have a positive opinion.Here are the House GOP members on the list, organized by state.Alaska: Nick BegichArizona: David Schweikert and Juan CiscomaniCalifornia: Kevin Kiley, David Valadao, Young Kim and Ken CalvertColorado: Jeff Hurd, Jeff Crank and Gabe EvansFlorida: Aaron Bean, Cory Mills, Anna Paulina Luna and Laurel LeeIowa: Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Ashley Hinson and Zach NunnKentucky: Andy BarrMichigan: Bill Huizenga, Tom Barrett and John JamesMinnesota: Brad FinstadMissouri: Ann WagnerMontana: Ryan ZinkeNebraska: Mike Flood and Don BaconNew Jersey: Jeff Van Drew and Tom KeanNew York: Nick LaLota and Mike LawlerNorth Carolina: Chuck EdwardsOhio: Max Miller, Michael Turner and Mike CareyPennsylvania: Brian Fitzpatrick, Ryan Mackenzie, Robert Bresnahan and Scott PerrySouth Carolina: Nancy Mace and Joe WilsonVirginia: Rob Wittman, Jen Kiggans and John McGuireWashington: Michael BaumgartnerWisconsin: Bryan Steil and Derrick Van Orden",,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

The legislation, criminalizing the act of being in Tennessee without legal immigration status, would come with both jail time and an eviction notice from the state. Judges would be required to issue 72-hour warnings to leave Tennessee to anyone charged or convicted of the crime.
The first offense would be a misdemeanor, but would rise to a felony if someone is charged a second or subsequent time.
“This bill is a measured, responsible step towards protecting Tennessee communities, enforcing the rule of law and demagnetizing our state to illegal immigration,” Rep. Lee Reeves, a Republican from Franklin, told members of the House Departments & Agencies Subcommittee.
Sen. Jack Johnson, also a Franklin Republican, is the measure’s other sponsor.

Immigrant rights advocates called the measure an “incredibly inhumane bill that puts lives and families at risk” and undermines the U.S. Constitution.
“It takes people who have been living here peacefully and contributing to their communities, sometimes for decades, and puts a target on their back based on who they are, where they are from, and whether the federal government has decided to give them a pathway to citizenship or not,” Judith Clerjeune, advocacy director for Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition said in a statement.
Immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility. State and local law enforcement may enter into agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to enforce federal immigration laws, but a Supreme Court ruling more than a decade ago established that states cannot usurp the federal government’s exclusive power to enact immigration enforcement laws.
The bill is considered a trigger law. If approved, it would only going into effect if one of three things happens:
If the Supreme Court overturns its decision in Arizona v. United States, the 2012 case that found Arizona’s attempt to create new state immigration crimes was unconstitutional, the law would automatically take effect on the next January 1 or July 1.
Alternatively, the bill could take effect after the ratification of a U.S. Constitutional amendment giving states the right to regulate immigration.
The third condition — if other states enact similar illegal entry laws that have been allowed to remain in effect for 60 days — would also trigger the measure to take effect in Tennessee.
The substance of the bill, originally filed as a so-called caption bill with placeholder language, was revealed in an amendment filed Tuesday.
Republicans on the House Departments & Agencies Subcommittee approved the measure with no questions or debate in a 7-1 vote along party lines.

Bo Watson, a North Chattanooga Republican, told lawmakers there won't be any investment income left next year to tap. (Photo: John Partipilo)Tennessee is using the last of its investment income from federal COVID stimulus money to balance its budget this year, leading some lawmakers to issue warnings about the governor’s spending strategy. 
Gov. Bill Lee’s supplemental budget plan for next year depends on $200 million the state set aside to spend during the COVID-19 pandemic but never did. Those funds accompany an additional $500 million that’s already part of the governor’s $59.6 billion budget proposal, which lawmakers must approve before adjourning this spring.
This budget maneuver has allowed Lee for several years to spend hundreds of millions of dollars more than would normally be available. Investment earnings usually come in around $5 million. But the federal stimulus funds are nearly depleted.
“We tried to make the point … don’t get too comfortable with this money because it’s way above what we would customarily get,” said Republican Sen. Bo Watson of North Chattanooga, chairman of the finance committee.
The governor’s extra spending is shrinking year after year, as Lee’s $345 million supplemental budget plan for fiscal 2025-26 marks a sharp reduction from a year ago when it hit $656 million.
Tennessee budget officials predicted that the state’s budget would not grow this year, and according to the Finance and Administration commissioner, state revenue is on track to come in as projected. Officials estimated 2% growth for next year.
The state budget took a hit last year when the legislature approved a franchise and excise tax cut and refund for businesses that’s expected to cost some $1.4 billion up front and an additional $400 million per year.
 “I think the state’s got long-term problems down the road because we cut revenue sources and we’re not dealing with outstanding big-ticket needs like road funding and education funding,” Democratic Sen. Jeff Yarbro of Nashville said Tuesday after hearing the governor’s budget update.
During Lee’s tenure, Tennessee’s budget has soared from a combination of the state’s growing economy, access to online sales tax revenue and federal pandemic funds. 
Next year, the governor wants to take the unusual step of borrowing heavily to build roads before costs increase, according to Finance and Administration Commissioner Jim Bryson.

What is Lee proposing in his supplemental budget?
In addition to Treasury investment earnings, the supplemental budget moves $23.6 million of the money set aside for Lee’s private-school voucher program to provide money to a variety of nonprofit groups and favored projects. 
Nearly $14.5 million in the budget plan released Tuesday is earmarked to offset school district losses related to the private-school voucher program, and $20 million goes toward charter school facilities.
Another $5.5 million will be used to pay for the Department of Safety and Homeland Security’s immigration enforcement bureau, which was enacted during this year’s special session to complement federal crackdowns on immigrants without permanent legal status.
More than $20.6 million from TennCare’s shared savings account with the federal government will be used to reimburse hospitals for treatment of indigent patients. 
Another $28 million from shared savings is set to go to nursing homes that provide care for needy people. The state has accumulated nearly $1 billion in that TennCare account designed to serve low-income residents.
The governor’s plan continues to provide money to the Men of Valor, a prison ministry that Lee participated in, and a host of nonprofit groups the governor favors.
For instance, $1 million is targeted for the Church of Christ of God in Memphis, but Bryson couldn’t explain why the church is to receive the money.
Yarbro said lawmakers need a “clearer statement” on the benefit of funding the litany of organizations statewide.
“There are more nonprofits that are being supported by this governor just because of what seem to be relationships,” Yarbro said.
Watson called it “a lot of nickel and dime stuff” and said the administration will explain it “on the back end.”
Other spending items
In addition, Lee is backing $10 million for the state’s artificial intelligence initiative and $3 million for an audit of Memphis-Shelby County Schools. 
Some of the AI money will go toward the state’s initial investments in artificial intelligence to improve services, Watson said, but he added that some of the funds will go toward technology.
Another $12 million targets an Economic and Community Development FastTrack Project in Sumner County, which involves a water line from Portland to Westmoreland.
The city of Chattanooga would receive $15 million for a waterfront project. The Andrew Jackson Foundation would land a $6.2 million grant, and $5 million would go toward the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame.
Youth Villages Memphis Allies would receive $10 million. The state’s court system indigent representation program would receive $17 million.
Lee’s plan deposits $25 million into a response and recovery fund, and $10 million would go toward relocating the Unicoi County Hospital that was severely damaged by Hurricane Helene last fall.
The governor’s plan puts $3 million toward a summer food program for children, even though the state opted against renewing federal funds to feed kids. Yarbro called that idea “bad budgeting and bad morality.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BO-WATSON002-1024x763.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Jon Cherry/Getty Images)More than a dozen states in the past two years have launched or expanded programs that allow families to use taxpayer dollars to send their students to private schools. Now, President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress want to supercharge those efforts.
Trump in January issued an executive order directing several federal agencies to allow states, tribes and military families to tap into federal money for so-called school choice opportunities. Those can come in the form of education savings accounts, voucher programs, tax credits or scholarships. Trump’s order also aims to expand access to public charter schools, which are free from some of the rules that apply to traditional public schools.
Meanwhile in Congress, 24 Republican senators have signed on to legislation that would provide $10 billion in annual tax credits to individuals and corporations who make charitable contributions to organizations that provide private-school scholarships. A Nebraska Republican introduced a companion measure in the House.
Already this year, Idaho, Tennessee and Wyoming have approved school choice programs, and bills are advancing in Kansas, New Hampshire, Ohio, South Carolina and Texas. A bill in Mississippi died before advancing. Most of the measures still in play would open programs to all families regardless of income, though some states would cap the total amount of money available.

Supporters of school choice say it gives parents control of their kids’ education — and an escape hatch if they are dissatisfied with their local public school. Many conservatives, religious institutions and private schools are in favor of school choice, along with some people of color who live in districts with underperforming public schools.
“Every child is different. They learn in different environments. There are just so many factors, that I believe that parents should be the ones that make the decision on where their child is going to do the best and have the most success,” said Indiana Republican state Sen. Linda Rogers. A former educator, Rogers has sponsored a bill in her state that would provide additional money to charter schools, which are considered to be a form of school choice.
Opponents, including teachers unions, public school professionals and many rural lawmakers of both parties, say such measures undermine traditional public schools by shifting money away from them.
“When we start to take from public schools, we’re hurting our kids, our lower-income kids. They will not prosper from this legislation,” Tennessee Democratic state Rep. Ronnie Glynn said during the floor debate on a far-reaching voucher bill in his state.
Joshua Cowen, a professor of education policy at Michigan State University, said vouchers are a budget-buster for states.
“Vouchers don’t shift costs — they add costs,” Cowen said in a phone interview. “Most voucher recipients were already in private schools, meaning states are paying for education they previously didn’t have to fund.”
The switch to remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, which gave parents a front-row seat to watch what their children were — or were not — learning in their classes, contributed to the recent school choice momentum. So did parent frustration over prolonged public school closures.










I believe that parents should be the ones that make the decision on where their child is going to do the best and have the most success.


“Parents got a good look into sort of what was happening in schools,” said Bella DiMarco, a senior K-12 education policy analyst at FutureEd, an independent think tank at Georgetown University. “There was a lot of talk during the pandemic around school choice … of what public schools aren’t doing for their kids.”
The first modern school voucher program, created in Milwaukee in 1990, was a bipartisan effort to help lower-income families afford private schools. In recent years, more states have moved from school choice programs focused on certain groups, such as low-income students or students with disabilities, to universal programs open to students of all backgrounds.
“Historically, the programs were always sort of targeted to students in need,” DiMarco said. “But in the last couple of years, the new push has been for these universal programs.”
Currently, more than 30 states and Washington, D.C., have at least one school choice program. More than a dozen states now offer universal or near-universal access, allowing K–12 students to participate in school choice regardless of income.
EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice, estimates that 1.2 million students are attending private schools this school year with the help of public tax credits, scholarships or vouchers.
Different strategies
States that enacted school choice programs this year have pursued different strategies.
The program Idaho enacted last month, for example, will provide an annual tax credit of $5,000 per child ($7,500 for students with disabilities) to help cover private education expenses.










Most voucher recipients were already in private schools, meaning states are paying for education they previously didn’t have to fund.

Tennessee’s new program will provide 20,000 scholarships of roughly $7,000 each. During its first year, half of the Tennessee scholarships will be reserved for households earning less than $173,000 for a family of four, but that restriction will be removed in subsequent years.
About 65% of the Tennessee vouchers are expected to be awarded to students who already attend private schools, according to a legislative analysis.
Critics say the cost of the program will grow quickly, creating a hole in the state’s budget. Tennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee, who pushed hard for the proposal, suggested that Trump’s executive order might provide additional resources. Lee told reporters he hasn’t yet analyzed the order, “but I think there’s opportunity there.”

“The president wants to support states like ours who are advocating for school choice,” Lee said in a news conference after lawmakers approved the measure. Lee was at the White House on Thursday when Trump signed an order calling for the U.S. Department of Education to be dismantled.
Texas lawmakers also are actively debating a voucher program, a longtime priority for Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who worked to defeat resistant rural Republicans in last year’s state legislative elections and who also attended the White House event. The Senate passed a bill that would provide $10,000 per student ($11,500 for students with disabilities) annually through education savings accounts. A similar House proposal is under review.
Kansas is considering a universal refundable tax credit — $8,000 per child for accredited private school tuition and $4,000 for non-accredited private schools. The program starts with a $125 million cap, increasing annually if participation hits certain thresholds.
Ballot box defeats
School choice opponents question the wisdom of sending taxpayer dollars to schools that may lack certified teachers, follow nonstandardized curricula or discriminate in admissions. Many private schools have testing standards, maintain religious requirements or exclude LGBTQ+ students or those with certain disabilities, for example.
In some Republican-led states that have expanded school choice, Democrats have filed bills to increase oversight and place restrictions on these programs. A bill in Tennessee would require background checks for teachers at private schools that receive voucher money. And an Iowa bill would require that property tax statements include information on how much money education savings accounts subtracted from local public schools.
As voucher programs have grown, they have attracted greater scrutiny.

ProPublica, an investigative journalism outlet, last year found that Arizona’s universal voucher program has mostly benefited wealthier families. Some Arizona parents have tried to use voucher money to pay for dune buggies and expensive Lego sets, according to press reports.
Critics also note that despite recent legislative successes, school ballot initiatives fared poorly at the ballot box last fall.
Voters in Colorado rejected a measure that sought to enshrine school choice rights in the state constitution.
In Nebraska, voters partially repealed a state-funded private school scholarship program.
And in Kentucky, voters overwhelmingly rejected a constitutional amendment that would have allowed the use of public money to support private schools, with 65% of voters — and a majority in every county — opposed.
“There’s a handful of these billionaires that have been pushing vouchers for 30 years,” said Cowen, the Michigan State University professor. “The school choice movement is not necessarily driven by public demand, but rather by wealthy donors and political maneuvering.”

But for a lot of people, the impact of one can significantly influence the other, especially when living paycheck to paycheck. Here’s how an unexpected vehicle expense can lead to housing instability and even eviction. 
For the majority, having reliable transportation is crucial to keeping stable employment. Public transit might not be reliable due to an individual’s working hours or job location. If a vehicle suddenly breaks down and cannot be repaired quickly, that can cause someone to miss work, leading to a loss of income and increased financial strain. 
Unexpected costs like car repairs can happen without warning and need to be paid immediately. For many people, it’s a choice between paying for the repair or paying rent. 
At Jesse Tree, a homelessness prevention agency serving households in Ada and Canyon counties, unexpected vehicle expenses are one of the more common explanations for a household’s financial crisis, which leads to the risk of eviction. Based on a 2024 survey of 753 clients performed by Jesse Tree case managers, 21.38% said that they struggle with transportation barriers. 
The average emergency expense is around $1,000. Emergency savings funds are often a luxury that most individuals do not have, especially if they are living paycheck to paycheck. 
Without savings, any unexpected expense can lead to a vicious cycle of using credit, borrowing money, or relying on payday loans with high-interest rates. Relying on loans makes it harder to pay off debt and recover from financial setbacks, leading to more instability. With the additional expense of loans, people may also struggle to meet other financial obligations, such as rent or pay for basic needs like food, clothing and hygiene items. 
Some folks do not have access to financial safety nets like family support or emergency funds. If a significant vehicle repair cost arises, they may not have any backup resources to help cover their expenses. Without an emergency fund or external support, people may face long-term financial instability, increasing the possibility that they might lose their home. 
An unexpected vehicle expense isn’t just a burden; it’s often a catalyst that sets off a chain of events leading to greater financial instability. The combination of missing work, not prioritizing rent, accumulating debt, and lacking safety nets can make it incredibly difficult for someone to keep up with housing costs. For many people, their car is more than a convenience — it’s a lifeline to work. Without it, they can quickly find themselves at risk of losing their home.

Don Bacon of Nebraska. (Courtesy of House Majority Forward) LINCOLN — A national advertising vendor pulled a billboard ad targeting U.S. Rep. Don Bacon from a Democratic-aligned group after the National Republican Congressional Committee, or NRCC, pressured them with a threat of legal action. 
Last week, the NRCC succeeded in removing some similar House Majority Forward ads running in four of six swing districts held by House Republicans that the group targeted. 
The NRCC told the Examiner last week they were trying to find the vendor who handled the anti-Bacon ads and would “get them taken down.” The group called the ads “defamatory” because of the claim of Bacon voting to “cut” Medicaid. 
Bacon has said the ads were “dishonest” on social media.  The House Majority Forward ad referred to Bacon’s vote for a proposed GOP budget, which included a level of cuts that a non-partisan federal budget office said earlier this month can’t happen without cutting Medicare or Medicaid. 
Bacon and others claim the cuts can happen without touching Medicaid and other social programs, but they have not specified what they would cut. 
On Monday, the NRCC sent the ad vendor, Link Media, a cease and desist letter. The NRCC shared a reply to its letter saying that Link Media would “no longer run the advertising content.” 
“But [we] will allow them to submit revised content that accurately reflects the circumstances. If they decide to resubmit, I will review the content to determine that it is accurate,” a Link Media spokesperson wrote in the reply, which was obtained by the Examiner.
The vendor did not immediately return messages seeking comment.
House Majority Forward said in a statement Wednesday that the removal of the ad “is unfortunately a decision not based in fact, but one made due to coercion and threats from anti-free speech Republicans.”
The cease-and-desist letter the NRCC sent Link Media is similar to one it sent last week to Lamar Advertising Co. It shows the NRCC telling the ad vendor, “If you proceed with displaying the false message that these six Members of Congress voted to ‘CUT MEDICAID,’ you will be liable for the defamatory messages spread to voters in each district.” 
The House Majority Forward ad had said, “Don Bacon voted to cut Medicaid” to give billionaires like Elon Musk tax cuts.  The anti-Bacon billboards from House Majority Forward were part of a larger campaign by the DNC and other Democratic-aligned groups to soften six “vulnerable” House Republicans representing swing districts. The ads emphasized Musk and his U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team’s efforts to cut federal programs and end some federal agencies.
All three Nebraska House Republicans voted yes for the proposed GOP budget that would expand the 2017 Trump tax cuts and cut up to $2 trillion in spending.

(Photo: Greg Childress)A bill to expand so-called “missing middle housing” statewide was one of four bills introduced in the state Senate on Tuesday as part of lawmakers’ strategy to address North Carolina’s housing crisis.
“Missing middle housing” refers to buildings with multiple units such as townhomes, duplexes and fourplexes that are placed into residential neighborhoods and serve as a middle ground between single-family homes and large apartment complexes.
Senate Bill 497 (“Expand Middle Housing”) has bipartisan support. It was filed by Sen. Tim Moffitt, a Henderson County Republican and Sen. Julie Mayfield, a Buncombe County Democrat.
Under SB 497, a “local government shall allow all middle housing types in areas zoned for residential use, including those that allow for the development of detached single-family dwellings,” the bill reads.
SB 497 also prohibits local governments from discouraging “development of middle housing through unreasonable costs or delay, including zoning, development, siting, or design review standards that restrict middle housing types to less than three stories, or a floor area ratio of less than one.”
SB 497 comes as the state faces a five-year housing inventory gap of 764,478 units (322,360 rental units and 442,118 for-sale units), according to a recent statewide report commissioned by the NC Chamber Foundation, NC REALTORS and the N.C. Homebuilders Association.
Missing middle housing has stirred controversy in Raleigh where the City Council passed a plan to allow for denser housing — townhomes and duplexes, for example — to be built in some neighborhoods of traditional single-family homes.
Critics argue that such housing changes the character of neighborhoods and lowers property values. They also contend “missing middle housing” can cause parking issues.
Carolina Forward, a nonpartisan, nonprofit policy organization, celebrated the four bills in a social media post. The organization also warned of expected pushback from community groups opposed to “missing middle housing.”
“The NIMBY lobby is going to fight these pretty hard in the legislature. But support is growing to expand housing in North Carolina,” Carolina Forward said on X.
Moffitt and Mayfield also introduced three other bills to increase the state’s housing supply:

Senate Bill 499 to allow housing development “by right” in any area currently zoned only for commercial, office or retail use. The bill also allows the conversion of a building or portion of a building from commercial use to residential use.
Senate Bill 495 to permit accessory dwelling units (ADUs) statewide.
Senate Bill 492 to allow single exit-stairways in apartment construction of up to eight stories. Supporters see this change as a way to increase the supply of multifamily housing because requiring more than one exit-stairway in small apartments building make them more expensive. Meanwhile, critics cite safety concerns.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)An attempt to bridge the differences between House and Senate lawmakers in an annexation compromise is likely dead after the author criticized the process and rebuked committee members on Tuesday. 
Sen. Jim Buck, R-Kokomo, has repeatedly authored legislation to rein in what he describes as an “abusive” form of annexation that’s “tilted in favor of the municipalities.” 
  Rep. Dave Hall, R-Norman, introduces an amendment in committee on March 25, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
“As time goes on, this hunger on the part of the municipality has not lessened for annexation. In fact, it’s growing to the point that we’re finding ourselves in areas where there’s non-contiguous annexation,” said Buck. 
But Buck criticized an attempt to meld two bills into an annexation compromise, saying he had only been alerted of the effort the previous night. The introduced amendment, which the committee adopted by consent, was a “strip and insert,” a process that replaces all of the bill’s language with a new proposal. 
“… is it the ruling of the House that you can strip a Senate bill without the author’s consent? Somebody needs to make that ruling, because you just did that in committee,” said Buck, who served in the House prior to his tenure in the Senate. “… I dare say, if I did that to one of your bills, you’d be hot. I think it’s a very, very poor precedent.”
Rep. Dave Hall, R-Norman, called it a mistake not to involve Buck earlier, saying “I didn’t know that it was going to be a strip-and-insert amendment until (the Legislative Services Agency) told me.” 
“I would imagine it’s probably dead at this point,” Hall said about Senate Bill 126. “I really want to work with Sen. Buck and the other stakeholders, because I think we made some compromise. I think there’s a middle ground. Hopefully, we can still find it.” 
 Down in Monroe County

The heart of the issue hits close to home for Hall, whose district encompasses much of Monroe County. A recent effort to incorporate county landowners into the City of Bloomington has erupted into a contentious legal fight potentially headed for the Indiana Supreme Court. 
Under the current process, 65% of the proposed annexed area’s landowners must sign off on a remonstrance to oppose it. Buck’s version would flip the burden by requiring cities to have the support of 51% of the area’s property owners before initiating, elminating so-called “involuntary annexation.”
Alternatively, a municipality getting approval from property owners controlling 75% of the assessed value of the area would also meet the threshold under Buck’s proposal.
Monroe County residents appeared to support Buck’s underlying bill but took issue with the annexation compromise authored by Hall. 
Margaret Clements, the founder and president of County Resident Against Annexation, said the city pressured county residents to accept annexation in return for providing sewage services. Homes have been built by developers outside of Bloomington limits with sewage hookups, leaving buyers with no other choice than to join the municipality. 
Leading House Republican introduces his own property tax plan

“The property owner doesn’t really want to be annexed. They’re being forced to sign a voluntary annexation agreement so they can flush their toilets,” said Clements.
Monroe County Commissioner Julie Thomas said the amendment “muddies the waters,” saying that “Monroe County residents have suffered under the proposed Bloomington annexation” because the 65% bar meant residents had to shoulder legal costs. 
“The other thing to keep in mind is any changes to property tax revenues,” said Thomas. “One of my concerns is that (current property tax proposals are) going to make cities even more eager to annex because they’ll get that income tax.”
Others shared concerns that a municipality could “leapfrog” its borders by using one non-contiguous area to incorporate another non-contiguous area. 
Both versions would end involuntary annexation and eliminate remonstrance waivers, but Hall introduced the ability for cities to add non-contiguous land to their rolls so long as they had the full support of various parties and the property was less than two miles from city boundaries. 
“I was trying to find a compromise to where, when you take something away from a city like involuntary annexation — which I wholeheartedly disagree with — you want to offer something in return,” said Hall. 
A dozen different municipalities have approached the General Assembly seeking exceptions to annexation laws so far, with a 13th — Alexandria — asking for its own exception later that same committee. 
“Personally, I don’t think we need to really be involved in every single one of those if we have commissioner agreement, landowner agreement and municipality agreement,” Hall said. 
 Accelerating Indiana Muncipalities

But Buck panned the annexation compromise, saying “it’s going to be worse than what we currently have when you talk about non-contiguous annexation.”
“Non-continguous annexation is a dream of (Accelerating Indiana Municipalities) because it allows them to go out with new construction and new development without having to pay attention to their inner city,” said Buck. “You’re going to end up with a little daisy chain form of annexation.”
AIM, acknowledged their work on the amendment in committee but said “we don’t get everything we want” while testifying as “neutral” on the annexation compromise.
“It’s a workable compromise, in our opinion, with respect to the language on the non-contiguous annexations. It’s for both commercial and residential so this can be a great economic development tool,” said Campbell Ricci, the policy and financial resources director for the organization.

“Obviously, we’ve been coming up here and testifying against the end of municipal annexation for many, many years and want to come to the table and try to find some sort of solution to make this workable.” 
The 2024 municipal officials handbook from AIM describes annexation as a way to extend city boundaries — and, by extension, public services like sewage and law enforcement — in response to population changes, suburban sprawl or the location of new developments. 
Annexation can be “involuntary,” meaning it is initiated by the city, or through a voluntary petition filed by resident property owners. Exceptions to contiguity requirements can include municipally owned or operated property like an airport, a wastewater treatment facility, landfill, golf course, hospital, police station or solar electric generating facility.

The state’s primary medical school is adding 22 family medicine residency slots because of $2.5 million allocated by the Legislature in February, UAMS announced in a news release.
UAMS will use the money as “start-up funds” for the first three years of the residency programs in Crossett and El Dorado, which includes an obstetrics fellowship, Chancellor Dr. Cam Patterson wrote in the university’s funding request to the Joint Budget Committee’s PEER Review subcommittee. The panel approved the request Feb. 26 with no discussion or dissent, and the full committee approved it the following day.
The number of students graduating from Arkansas medical schools has outpaced the state’s number of residencies in recent years, but Arkansas leaders in medical education have been working to add more slots at hospitals throughout the state.
Most physicians practice in the same state where they complete their residencies, and UAMS sponsors roughly 85% of residencies statewide, said Dr. Molly Gathright, executive associate dean for Graduate Medical Education in UAMS’ College of Medicine.
Arkansas leaders work to close gap between medical school graduates and in-state residencies

The health system announced in May 2023 that it would train residents at the South Arkansas Regional Hospital in El Dorado in partnership with a local nonprofit. Last week’s news release said UAMS plans to obtain accreditation for the El Dorado facility this year and enroll its first residents in the summer of 2026. The Crossett facility enrolled its first residents last year.
“Expanding training opportunities in this region helps address health care needs and strengthens the local workforce,” Gathright said in a statement to the Advocate. “At the same time, every residency program plays a vital role in improving access to care across the state, and our goal is to support a broad distribution of training opportunities to meet diverse community needs.”
In addition to its main Little Rock campus and the Crossett campus, UAMS trains residents at six other regional campuses throughout the state: Batesville, Fayetteville, Fort Smith, Jonesboro, Pine Bluff and Texarkana. A seventh residency program in Magnolia closed in 2022.
Adding medical residencies to a community boosts the local economy, according to a study released this month by Heartland Forward. The Bentonville-based research organization estimates that gradually adding 275 new medical residents over six years — about 46 per year — would create an additional $465 million in economic activity for Arkansas.
Republican U.S. Sen. John Boozman, an optometrist from Rogers, sponsored multiple bipartisan bills during the last session of Congress to create more residency slots nationwide and retain the doctors that train in those positions, particularly in rural areas. The legislation stalled in committee.
UAMS’ Fayetteville and Crossett locations specifically train family medicine specialists to practice in rural areas. Some of Arkansas’ rural counties do not have hospitals, according to the Arkansas Foundation for Medical Care.

Residents who train in El Dorado and Crossett will be “immersed in south Arkansas-based rural clinical settings,” though they will complete some of their training in Little Rock at both UAMS and Arkansas Children’s Hospital, according to the health system’s announcement last week.
“The current structure of our UAMS sponsored rural training programs — one year in an urban hospital followed by two years at a rural training site — ensures residents gain broad clinical experience while becoming fully immersed in rural practice,” Gathright said. “The hope is that this model increases the likelihood that they will stay and provide care in these communities, improving access for low-income patients and those who must travel long distances for medical services.”
Ashley County, where Crossett is the largest city, had fewer than five full-time primary care physicians per 10,000 people as of 2021, a slight decrease from 2020, according to data from the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement.
Additionally, Arkansas has a shortage of maternal health care providers, particularly in rural areas. Gathright said the obstetrics fellowship funded by the $2.5 million grant will be “crucial to improving access to care” in rural South Arkansas. The fellowship will open July 1 in El Dorado.

EMILYs List plans to target three Republican members of the U.S. House from Michigan in the 2026 midterms.
The group, which backs women candidates who support abortion rights, announced Wednesday that U.S. Reps. Bill Huizenga (R-Zeeland), Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte) and John James (R-Shelby Twp.) are key targets for Democrats to flip.
They are among 46 House Republicans being targeted nationwide, with EMILYs List president Jessica Mackler saying in a statement that the group will be “putting their extremism on blast.”
A press release points to the three members’ support of the short-term spending plan passed by House Republicans, which the group says could undermine health care for more than 100,000 constituents in each member’s district, as well as the fact that all three have previously been endorsed by President Donald Trump.
Additionally, the group noted all three lawmakers voted in January for the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, a bill they say would penalize doctors for providing life-saving care.
Sara Spain, a spokesperson for EMILYs List, said that people are currently “feeling a lot of pain.”
“It’s very clear that American people are really looking for leaders who are coming from their communities, who are understanding the struggles and aren’t going to be this rubber stamp for Trump’s Project 2025 extremism to kind of help us out of the crisis that we’re facing,” Spain said.
The efforts go beyond advertising, Spain said, as EMILYs List works to recruit candidates to challenge the incumbent Republicans.
“Something EMILYs List really prioritizes, especially in races like these that are key flips, is doing everything we can to meet voters in a unique way,” Spain said.
Mike Marinella, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee sent Michigan Advance the following statement after the details of EMILYs List program had been released.
“House Republicans are on offense while Democrats flounder with no message, no strategy, and no leadership. They can put out all the lists they want, but voters rejected their radical agenda in 2024, and they’ll do it again in 2026,” said Marinella.

North Carolina is among the states considering legislation designed to regulate health insurers’ prior authorization and claims reviews. (Chris Carlson | The Associated Press)Health insurance companies are under increasing scrutiny for allegedly using artificial intelligence bots and algorithms to swiftly deny patients routine or lifesaving care — without a human actually reviewing their claims.
The high-profile killing late last year of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has focused even more attention on so-called prior authorization, the process by which patients and doctors must ask health insurers to approve medical procedures or drugs before proceeding. There had been protests and outrage over the company’s practices for months before Thompson’s death, and UnitedHealthcare has been accused in a class-action lawsuit of using AI to wrongfully deny claims.
As more patients and doctors voice their frustrations, states are responding with legislation designed to regulate prior authorization and claims reviews. So far this year, lawmakers in more than a dozen states are considering measures that would, for example, limit the use of AI in reviewing claims; exclude certain prescription medications from prior authorization rules; ensure that emergency mental health care is not delayed for more than 48 hours; and require that insurers’ review boards include licensed physicians, dentists or pharmacists with clinical experience.
Insurers have long required doctors to obtain their approval before they’ll pay for certain drugs, treatments and procedures. They argue it is necessary to rein in health care costs and limit unnecessary services. But many doctors and patients say the practice has gotten out of hand, causing delays and denials of care that are harming and even killing people.
In a survey last year by the American Medical Association, 93% of doctors said that insurers’ prior authorization practices delayed “necessary care” for their patients. Twenty-nine percent said such delays had led to a “serious adverse event,” such as hospitalization, permanent injury or death.
In 2023, insurers selling plans on the marketplaces created under the Affordable Care Act denied a combined average of 20% of all claims. Of the 73 million in-network claims they denied, only 1% were appealed, according to KFF, a health policy research group.
The federal role
Under the Biden administration, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice took a firmer hand against health care corporations alleged to be engaging in behavior resulting in limited and more expensive care for patients. The administration also approved rules requiring that beginning in 2026, Medicare and Medicaid plans create a streamlined electronic process for reviewing claims, making decisions more quickly and providing specific reasons for denying care.
But it’s difficult to hold insurers accountable, according to Timothy McBride, a health policy analyst and co-director of a program at the Institute for Public Health at Washington University in St. Louis.
“Each part of the health care industry — hospitals, pharmaceuticals, insurers — they all have a lot of concentrated power,” McBride said in a phone interview. “And unless somebody actually takes it on directly, it’s going to stay that way. I think the Biden administration tried to take it on, but didn’t make a lot of progress.”
It’s unclear whether the Trump administration and Congress will reverse course. During his confirmation hearing on March 14, Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, defended the use of artificial intelligence in reviewing claims.
“AI can be used for good or for evil, and it to a large extent depends on who’s using it and for what purpose,” Oz told members of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee. “I think AI could play a vital role in accelerating preauthorization.”
In the past, Trump has supported measures to help patients, such as increasing hospital price transparency and lowering prescription drug prices, McBride noted. But “Republicans and conservatives generally are anti-regulation,” he said. “My gut feeling would be that they back off on the Biden push on this.”
States have limited power to act on their own. They have authority only over state-regulated health plans, which include Medicaid, plans for state workers and policies residents purchase from the ACA marketplaces. About 90 million people are covered that way. State laws do not apply to the 156 million workers, retirees and dependents who get their coverage through employer-sponsored health plans, which are regulated through a federal law known as ERISA.
Furthermore, health insurance companies are large and have deep pockets, allowing them to easily absorb state fines.
But Kaye Pestaina, the director of the program on patient and consumer protection at KFF, said states have an important role to play.
“Much of the focus around prior authorization at the federal level has kind of originated from state protections, so I imagine there will be continual activity by state legislatures to come at the problem,” Pestaina told Stateline.
What states are doing
Pestaina said states are trying a number of solutions. For example, states such as Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania have given their insurance regulators more authority to directly access claims denial information, in order to overturn decisions or potentially enforce state rules. And these efforts have largely had bipartisan support.











There is a role for some oversight to make sure that things are covered. But right now, I think the system is out of balance.


– North Carolina Republican state Rep. Timothy Reeder



In Pennsylvania, Republican state Sen. Kristin Phillips-Hill pushed through bipartisan legislation in 2022 to streamline prior authorization practices for state-regulated health plans after hearing numerous complaints from patients and doctors.
The legislation created an Independent External Review organization that allows Pennsylvanians to submit an online form to request a review if their insurer denies a service or treatment. If the review organization decides the service should be covered, the insurer must do so. Before then, patients could turn only to a federal review process, which may have been more challenging to navigate and taken more time.
“Our reforms created clear rules, clear timelines for the prior authorization process, and it removed ambiguity or uncertainty from the system that at times, insurers could exploit and providers could be confused over,” Phillips-Hill told Stateline. “Prior to that reform, if you had a denial from your insurer, you had very little recourse.”
The program began in January 2024, and in its first year the Pennsylvania Insurance Department overturned half of 517 denials, which amounted to claims from 259 people.
Jonathan Greer, president and CEO of the Insurance Federation of Pennsylvania, said his trade group worked with lawmakers to come to an agreement on how to change the prior authorization process in a way that worked for insurers and patient advocates. Greer says he thinks Pennsylvania could be a model for other states.
“Prior authorization, I think unfairly, has been characterized as a reason to say ‘no’ by insurers,” Greer said. “The purpose of prior authorization is to make sure that you know the care that you get is consistent with the care that you need.”
In North Carolina, Republican state Rep. Timothy Reeder is hopeful that his prior authorization bill will make it across the finish line this year. Reeder’s bill would set tight deadlines on insurers’ claim decisions and require companies to have licensed practitioners on their claim review boards. Insurers would also have to publicize a list of services they require authorization for.
“I’m not saying that we need to get rid of it completely,” Reeder told Stateline. “There is a role for some oversight to make sure that things are covered. But right now, I think the system is out of balance.”
But some state laws have proven to be less effective than advertised.
In 2021, Texas enacted a first-of-its-kind law creating a “gold card” standard, under which physicians whose care recommendations are approved by insurers at least 90% of the time are exempt from the prior authorization process. But as of the end of 2023, only 3% of Texas physicians had earned gold card status, according to the Texas Medical Association.
That’s why the group is pushing legislation that would require insurers to report which preauthorization exemptions they granted and denied and how many claims went to independent review. Dr. Zeke Silva of the Texas Medical Association’s legislative council said it would be “in the same spirit” as what Pennsylvania has done.
“Our focus with the [Texas Medical Association] is our physicians being able to provide the best care possible. And we want that to be free of burden,” Silva told Stateline. “We want to minimize third parties coming in and inappropriately denying care that our physicians and our patients think is in their best interest.”

(Getty Images)Are you angry about politics right now? Seething? You’re not alone. According to the Mood of the Nation Poll by researchers at Penn State, 9 in 10 Americans can name a recent news event or something about American politics that made them angry.
Political scientists Steven Webster, Elizabeth Connors and I have investigated what happens to people’s social networks – their friends, family and neighbors – when partisan anger takes over. For example, suppose your neighbor is a member of the opposite political party. You’ve always watered their plants when they go on vacation. Given the news these days and how angry you’re feeling, what will you say when they ask for help during their next trip?
We found that when someone is angry with the opposite party, they avoid people with those views. That can include not assisting neighbors with various tasks, avoiding social gatherings attended by people from the other side, and refusing to date people who vote differently. It means being disappointed if your son or daughter marries a supporter of the opposing party, and even severing close friendships or distancing yourself from close relatives.
We see that political anger disrupts ordinary life – coffee with a friend – as well as more major life decisions. Political anger breaks our social networks.
People rely on their relationships to understand our world – and to vote. The more we isolate ourselves from people who see things differently, the easier it is to misunderstand them, pushing us to separate even more.
 Stereotype vs. reality

During the Obama administration, my collaborators and I asked a nationally representative sample of voters to describe their stereotypes about the opposite party. Our questions were intended to tap into perceptions of the other side’s lifestyles and cultural values, in addition to policy attitudes.
First, we wanted to establish each side’s actual views. Our 2012-2016 study asked around 1,300 Americans whether they agreed with statements that are often associated with one party or the other – including creationism, guns, taxes and eco-friendliness.
For example, 42.5% of all Republicans we surveyed agreed with the statement that “this country would be safer if every law-abiding citizen possessed a firearm,” versus 25.1% of independents and 14.2% of Democrats. Meanwhile, 38.7% of Democrats agreed that “this country would be better if every citizen drove an electric car,” compared with 22% of independents and 11.4% of Republicans.
Two months later, we went back to the same voters and asked them a different question: What percentage of Democrats and Republicans did they think would agree with these statements?
We saw dramatic evidence of stereotypes. For example, only 19% of Democrats agreed that all Americans should pay more taxes, but more than 80% of Republicans believed the percentage to be higher. The same pattern occurred with electric cars and firearms. Just over 42% of Republicans agreed that all “law-abiding” citizens should have a gun, but the typical Democrat believed the percentage to be 60%-80%.
Americans do not understand each other across the red-blue divide. Importantly, respondents with more ideologically extreme views themselves had less accurate perceptions of the other party.
 Avoiding the Joneses

The more extreme our beliefs become, the harder it will be to understand our neighbors.
Suppose you are a Republican. You learn that your Democratic neighbors believe that everyone should drive an electric car, marijuana should be legal in all states, and universal health care should be available to all citizens. Or suppose you are a Democrat, and you learn that your Republican neighbors believe that humans and dinosaurs walked the Earth at the same time, that elementary school students should be required to recite the Pledge of Allegiance every morning, and that a fence should be built between the U.S. and Mexico.
Would you want to be friends?
These hypothetical neighbors have stereotypical beliefs – and most Americans say they do not want those neighbors in their social networks. Specifically, according to our 2023 study, they reported not wanting to become friends, not having this neighbor over for a family meal, and not feeling comfortable allowing their children to play with the neighbor’s kids, among other activities.
Stereotypes don’t just drive individual people and families apart; they make neighborhoods less cohesive. We ascribe stereotypical beliefs to people who are members of the opposite party – and then we react to these stereotypes, not to our neighbors themselves.
 Social citizens

Cutting off those in-person relationships isn’t just a problem for safety and friendliness around the block. It’s a problem for democracy because Americans need relationships with people whose politics are different than their own.
A majority of Americans have social circles that are politically homogeneous. Even in 2020, 53% of Republicans said that their network was exclusively composed of Donald Trump supporters, and 55% of Democrats said that their network was exclusively composed of Joe Biden supporters.
In her book “Through the Grapevine,” political scientist Taylor Carlson documents that approximately 1 in 3 American voters mostly learn about politics from socially transmitted information: news they get from talking with friends or scrolling on social media. Relying on these sources is particularly problematic in social networks that are homogeneous, as exposure to information from someone in your own party can lead people to have more extreme positions. Carlson’s work highlights that voters who rely on friends to shape their views rely upon a resource that is heavily biased.
In my own book “The Social Citizen,” I investigated the influence peers have on political decisions, from voting and donating to identifying with a political party. For example, if a neighbor knocks on your door and asks you to turn out to vote, you are 4%-11% more likely to go cast a ballot than if a stranger knocked on your door.
 Democracy in action

What can we do to remedy the fractures? We need to understand each other.
The U.S. has a long tradition of political dialogue. Indeed, after a brutal election tested their friendship, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson did not exchange letters for 11 years. But the pair resumed their correspondence in 1812 with Adams’ statement – later echoed by Jefferson – “You and I, ought not to die, before We have explained ourselves to each other.”
What Adams and Jefferson understood in the 19th century still applies to the divisions in American society today: Reconciliation requires understanding. These conversations are frequently painful and hard; data scientists have noted that Thanksgiving dinners with guests who cross party lines are frequently shorter. But as my own research shows, we are most able to persuade people with whom we have the closest ties.
Democracy challenges us to participate in more ways than simply by voting. It challenges everyone to understand those around us and seek what is in the collective best interest.
And we have the most influence over people in our social networks. So that friend you’re really angry with about their politics? It’s time to give them a call and have a conversation.

I was born with severe hemophilia, a disorder that prevents my blood from clotting properly. Without medication, my joints swell uncontrollably, my elbows, knees, and ankles becoming the size of cantaloupes. The increase in pressure due to blood flooding the joint cavity results in unimaginable pain and permanent damage to my joints. Without medication, my life expectancy is just 25 years old.
But with access to life-saving treatment, my reality is completely different. I am a devoted husband and father. I’m a college graduate — Go Buffaloes! — and a former educator, having taught science to at-risk youth in Denver and Aurora public schools. I love Colorado’s great outdoors, and, at 40 years old, I am thriving. But that is only because I have access to the medication I need.
House Bill 25-1094 will hold pharmacy benefit managers accountable and rein in the sky-high costs of prescription drugs. PBMs are middlemen in the drug pricing system, quietly working behind the scenes but exerting enormous influence over the cost of our medications. They were originally created to help reduce drug prices, but today they profit by jacking up prices instead of passing savings on to patients. While it becomes harder and harder for patients like me to afford medications, PBM profits have skyrocketed by 438% over the past decade.

I have lived through the consequences of this broken system. I have been denied access to the medication I need. I have been told to try and fail on less costly treatments — medications that simply won’t stop the bleeding. The uncertainty and stress that come with fighting for access to treatment take a toll, not just on me but on my family as well.
I am far from alone in this struggle. Millions of Americans with chronic conditions — whether it’s hemophilia, multiple sclerosis, arthritis or epilepsy — face the same uphill battle against an industry designed to maximize profits at the expense of patients.
The bottom line is simple: PBMs should not be allowed to profit off higher drug prices. HB-1094 would change this by requiring PBMs to operate with transparency and prioritize savings for patients, rather than padding their own bottom lines. The bill would ensure that PBMs make money from a transparent, flat-dollar service fee instead of a percentage of the drug’s price, removing the incentive to push for higher costs.
For patients like me, this is not just a policy debate — it’s a matter of life and death. If I lose access to my medication, I lose everything. I am living proof of what happens when people with chronic conditions receive the care they need: We contribute to our communities, our families, and our state. But when that care is out of reach, the consequences are devastating.
Colorado has an opportunity to stand up for patients and ensure that no one has to suffer or sacrifice their future because of an unjust system. HB-1094 is not just about reforming PBMs — it’s about making sure every Coloradan has a fair shot at a healthy life.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)North Carolina could lose more than 35,000 jobs stemming from potential cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, according to a report by the Commonwealth Fund released Tuesday morning.
The Commonwealth Fund, a health care foundation focused on underserved communities, partnered with George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health to analyze the potential state-by-state impacts of a congressional budget plan that is widely expected to require cuts to Medicaid and other federal aid programs like SNAP, colloquially known as “food stamps.”
The report found significant impacts to state revenue and local economies, projecting the loss of more than a million jobs across the U.S. in 2026, including 35,500 jobs in North Carolina. The state would lose out on more than $3 billion in federal aid under the projections, leading to a forecast hit of roughly $3.6 billion to the state GDP and more than $250 million in lost tax dollars.
Those projected losses result because the money from federal aid programs like Medicaid and SNAP flow directly into local economies, creating revenue for hospitals, grocery stores, and other local businesses, allowing them to create jobs for their communities. Without that revenue, the Commonwealth Fund report projects that these businesses would no longer be able to support tens of thousands of employees, further straining a job market still reeling from the mass layoff of federal employees.
“Medicaid and SNAP programs are not just designed to strengthen individual health and nutrition — they support the economic wellbeing of communities and businesses nationwide,” said Leighton Ku, the report’s lead author. “Such drastic reductions would harm millions of families and also trigger widespread economic instability and major job losses.”
While specific cuts to federal assistance programs have not been announced by the Trump administration, budget resolutions passed by the Republican-led Senate and House call for between hundreds of billions and trillions in cuts to federal spending, respectively. Tuesday’s report draws on the House figure, which calls for $880 billion in cuts by the House committee overseeing the Medicaid program and $230 billion by the committee that oversees SNAP.
The study describes a costly “ripple effect” in which loss of revenue to health care facilities and food providers triggers layoffs that further reduce economic activity in the affected communities, leading to further losses and layoffs that could inflict even more pain on a U.S. economy that is already showing signs of flagging.
Joseph Betancourt, president of the Commonwealth Fund, called Medicaid and SNAP “foundational to people’s health and well-being” and warned of a devastating economic impact should forecast cuts go through.
“Slashing these programs will worsen health outcomes for all Americans, and particularly for people with chronic conditions who rely on Medicaid for ongoing care. Similarly, cutting SNAP will push more families into financial distress, making it harder for them to afford basic necessities,” he said. “The ripple effect will hit the entire health care system and impact everyone — not just those with Medicaid — driving more people to emergency rooms and further straining an already overburdened system.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/medicaidsign-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

Glenn Youngkin has once again thwarted a bipartisan effort to establish a regulated and taxed adult-use cannabis retail market in Virginia, vetoing a key proposal that would have created the framework for such a system. He also rejected measures designed to modify sentences for individuals convicted of marijuana-related offenses and protect legal cannabis users [&#8230;]","Cannabis plant. (Photo by Getty Images)Gov. Glenn Youngkin has once again thwarted a bipartisan effort to establish a regulated and taxed adult-use cannabis retail market in Virginia, vetoing a key proposal that would have created the framework for such a system. He also rejected measures designed to modify sentences for individuals convicted of marijuana-related offenses and protect legal cannabis users from discrimination in child custody battles.
Youngkin’s vetoes dealt another blow to cannabis reform advocates, who argue that the governor’s opposition to these measures continues to favor the status quo of unregulated marijuana sales. Cannabis is legal in Virginia for personal use, but the state still lacks a retail system that would allow legal, regulated and taxed sales.
The centerpiece of the vetoed legislation was House Bill 2485, sponsored by Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, who expressed disappointment over Youngkin’s second veto of a bill that he said would have not only generated millions of dollars for substance abuse treatment and law enforcement but also provided a safe, regulated market for cannabis.

“It’s wrong to allow the criminals to keep making money in this illicit market while pushing dangerous products,” Krizek said in a phone interview Tuesday, adding that a regulated cannabis system could boost state revenue by $300 million annually. 
“Virginians deserve a well-regulated and tested market that is taking into account the issues that the governor is concerned with, which is why cannabis regulation will be a key issue in the upcoming gubernatorial campaign.”
Krizek’s legislation, which is identical to Senate Bill 970, sponsored by Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, proposed a timeline for issuing licenses for marijuana cultivation, processing, distribution and retail. It also tasked the Virginia Cannabis Control Authority to oversee the new industry. Licenses could have been issued as early as September 2025, with the first retail sales expected no sooner than May 2026. 
Virginia made history in 2021 as the first Southern state to legalize small-scale marijuana possession and home cultivation for adults. But while cannabis is legal for personal use, the state has never finalized a plan for commercial sales. With no legal retail market in place, an unregulated underground market has flourished, contributing to safety and health concerns.
Del. Chris Obenshain, R-Montgomery, a local prosecutor and one of the two Republicans in the House to support Krizek’s proposal, expressed his commitment to sensible cannabis regulation in Virginia. “I have been an advocate for common sense legislation to regulate the adult cannabis market in Virginia,” he said. 
Obenshain acknowledged the bipartisan support the bill garnered this year but also noted that many colleagues still had genuine concerns. 
“I’ll continue working in a bipartisan fashion until we find the right balance on legislation that can keep Virginians safe while also eliminating the confusing legal regime and proliferation of potentially dangerous products that currently exists,” he added.
Youngkin, who rejected a similar bipartisan measure last year, said in his veto statement that states following this path have seen “adverse effects on children’s and adolescents’ health and safety, increased gang activity and violent crime, significant deterioration in mental health, decreased road safety, and significant costs associated with retail marijuana that far exceed tax revenue.”
The governor further stated that a regulated, legal market place “does not eliminate the illegal black-market sale of cannabis, nor guarantee product safety.”
For advocates like Chelsea Higgs Wise, executive director of Marijuana Justice, Youngkin’s rejection is a major setback for public health in Virginia. 
“We’re looking at at least another year before we are able to provide Virginia with a tested and regulated market, which would center Virginia’s public health for many consumers,” Wise said. 
“Meanwhile, the underground market continues to expand, and federally legal, hemp-derived products flood the state, putting residents at risk. And now this governor this week has just sent a big message to Virginia consumers that our health is not a priority, that keeping our kids safe, keeping us safe, is not a priority for him.” 
 Justice for past offenders?

Another piece of legislation, HB 2555 by Del. Rozia Henson, D-Woodbridge, would have allowed individuals convicted of certain marijuana-related felonies before 2021 — when marijuana was legalized in Virginia — to receive automatic hearings for sentence modifications if they were still incarcerated or under supervision. 
This bill would have applied to convictions for offenses like marijuana possession, manufacturing, or distribution committed before the state’s marijuana legalization laws took effect.

Youngkin vetoed the proposal, arguing that it “places an undue burden on courts, prosecutors, and victims,” and could allow sentence reductions for individuals convicted of serious crimes, such as fentanyl distribution or selling marijuana to minors. He further emphasized the importance of maintaining public safety and avoiding judicial complications in such cases.
Stephanie Shepard, director of advocacy for the Last Prisoner Project, expressed her frustration with the governor’s move. 
“This veto ignores the families still suffering from prohibitionist laws repealed three years ago. Virginia ended cannabis prohibition in 2021, yet many remain incarcerated for offenses that are no longer crimes. This bill was a crucial step toward justice — one the governor has now denied.”
Wise echoed these sentiments, noting that the bill had already been modified to exclude individuals convicted of violent crimes. 
“We did change the bill this year to remove people that had violent crimes associated with their sentencing,” she said. “Even with these adjustments, the governor still claims it would be too burdensome on the courts.”
 Protecting parents’ rights

Finally, HB 2613, sponsored by Del. Nadarius Clark, D-Suffolk, would have ensured that parents’ legal use of cannabis — or other authorized substances—would not be used against them in custody or visitation determinations. 
The bill sought to prevent investigations for child abuse or neglect solely based on lawful behavior, such as legal cannabis possession or prescribed medication use. It would have required local social services departments to update their policies to reflect these changes.
Youngkin’s veto statement echoed concerns about child safety, warning that the bill would “risk exposing children to harm.” He argued that legal marijuana use could lead to increased incidents of child endangerment, citing concerns over children ingesting cannabis-infused products.
For Wise, the bill’s veto was a missed opportunity for much-needed reform.

“This is a technical fix that should have happened in 2021,” she said. “And it’s not just about marijuana; it’s about ensuring parents aren’t penalized for using authorized substances like methadone or prescription drugs.”
Despite Youngkin’s vetoes, which continue to highlight his resistance to a fully legalized and regulated cannabis market, public support for reform remains strong. 
A 2024 Roanoke College poll found that 63% of Virginians back policies that would help small cannabis businesses compete with larger pharmaceutical companies and medical dispensaries. 
Even with the latest setbacks, Democratic lawmakers, a small number of Republicans, and cannabis reform advocates are pushing for a renewed effort to establish a retail cannabis market, underscoring the need for consumer protection, tax revenue generation and the reduction of illegal sales.
In a silver lining for advocates, the General Assembly passed House Joint Resolution 497, also sponsored by Krizek, establishing a joint commission to oversee what advocates believe to be a transition to an inevitable legal retail cannabis market in Virginia. 
The creation of this commission, which does not require the governor’s approval, is set to begin its work this summer and operate until July 1, 2028. It provides a platform for public comment and engagement, ensuring that voices from across the state are heard as the transition moves forward.
“We’ll be able to talk to the legislators in both chambers, and we’ll continue to make edits on our current proposal, so that whatever governor comes in for next year, we will all be on the same page about what we want for Virginia,” Wise said. “And that’s our win for this session.” 
And when asked if he plans to introduce the cannabis legislation for a third time next year, Krizek responded with determination: “You bet,” he said. “I think, no matter who the governor is, I feel like we’re going to make it happen. I’m going to make it happen.”

Glenn Youngkin agreed with Virginia lawmakers’ plan to create the Hunger-Free Campus Food Pantry Grant Program to provide college students with food at no cost, signing the bill Monday.
Few Va. universities have studied food insecurity among students, though 80% say it’s an issue

Senate Bill 1016 and House Bill 2240, sponsored by Sen. Danica Roem, D-Manassas, and Del. Rae Cousins, D-Richmond, initiated the program, allocating $500,000 to support food pantries to eligible public and nonprofit private colleges. 
“This is a win for the students and advocates who spoke up at the Virginia Capitol this year, especially for the Hunger-Free Campus Food Pantry Grant Program,” Roem posted on Bluesky. 
Last year, following a directive from lawmakers, the State Council of Higher Education in Virginia conducted a study on food insecurity levels at the state’s colleges and universities.
However, the study’s results were unclear since many institutions did not track the issue, and the social stigma surrounding hunger keeps some students from seeking help. A survey completed by 35 of 39 institutions responded that on-campus food insecurity was a “somewhat” or “very problematic” issue. 
SCHEV will award the grants to schools that establish an on-campus food pantry or partner with local food banks to connect students with resources in the area. Grants will require institutions to demonstrate that they have an ongoing food pantry or are partnering with a local food bank to be considered eligible.
Students will not be required to prove food insecurity to access pantry services. Institutions that meet the criteria will earn the “Hunger-Free Campus Food Pantry” designation, with funds available to support on-campus hunger initiatives. 
Any unused funds will roll over into the next fiscal year. A report on the program’s progress is due July 1, 2026.
Youngkin did not comment directly on the legislation after signing 599 bills before the Monday deadline.
Cousins said she’s happy to see that the governor signed the bill.
“I think it’s an indication of the bipartisan support that Senator Roem and I had for this legislation to address food insecurity on college and university campuses,” Cousins said. “So what this means is that there will now be some actual state support and funding for food pantry programs that are … now being run by students and community members on college and university campuses. So I’m just really happy to see all of us kind of work together in a bipartisan way to address that issue.”

Sen. Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk) said she thought there were “worthy” projects in the proposal but criticized the $3.85 billion in bonding to pay for the projects.
“This is more new bonding in this capital budget than the last five capital budgets combined, and I think to get to a more appropriate level, further discussion is needed,” Felzkowski said. “We need to hear from stakeholders and the public and that just hasn’t happened.” 
Sen. Andre Jacque (R-New Franken) said that he thinks lawmakers and Evers will be able to find some agreement, but argued that “shoehorning” money at the moment for projects will “limit the ability to have some of those discussions, or in some cases might prejudice the [Joint Finance] Committee against whatever we might do here.” 
Evers’ ambitious proposal for reforming the state’s prisons would include infrastructure upgrades and capital improvements to Waupun Correctional Institution, Lincoln Hills School, Stanley Correctional Institution, Sanger B. Powers Correctional Center and John C. Burke Correctional Center. The projects are planned to be carried out one after the other and culminate in the closing of the Green Bay Correctional Institution.
Felzkowski said she was “very saddened” about the corrections proposal and called it a “missed opportunity” for a bipartisan solution. 
“There’s quite a few of us in this Legislature who have worked diligently for corrections reform, and so much of the DOC capital budget rests on the changes to policy around corrections reform,” Felzkowski told Evers. Republican lawmakers have expressed opposition to proposals in the corrections budget that would increase early release. 
“We could have been brought in earlier to discuss the changes or even when you had brought in a consultant around corrections, I would have loved to have been able to work with them and to help bring my side of the aisle into the reform process,” Felzkowski said. 
The Joint Finance Committee, which is responsible for writing the budget, will kick off its work next week with briefings from the University of Wisconsin System and the Department of Corrections. Public listening sessions will then take place starting next week with lawmakers traveling to Kaukauna on April 2 and West Allis on April 4.

A budget resolution being considered by Congress would set funding targets for the next decade, and proposals have called for at least $880 billion in cuts from programs covered by the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee and the House Agriculture Committee, including the nutrition program, SNAP.
“The principal entitlement programs under these committees are Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program … which indicates that these two programs are the principal targets for budget cutbacks,” researchers at The Commonwealth Fund said in a new report released Tuesday laying out the impacts of those cuts on state economies.
A separate analysis released in February by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities stated that, of the at least $230 billion in federal cuts proposed through 2034 from programs in the jurisdiction of the House Agriculture Committee, reductions are “expected to come largely or entirely from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and to be used to help pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest business owners and households.”
“Lawmakers cannot cut $230 billion – or anything close to that amount – from SNAP without slashing benefits, restricting eligibility, or some combination of both,” the center analysis stated.

The population to be impacted the most by these cuts is one that’s already fighting to afford food and supplementing their SNAP benefits with visits to strained food banks.
“I can’t imagine, in our current state environment, what the state would do if they had to take on any other burden for the SNAP program,” said Hope Lane-Gavin, director of nutrition policy and programs for the Ohio Association of Food Banks.
County job and family services agencies are understaffed and underfunded, struggling for help from the state to stay afloat as it is, Lane-Gavin said. And that’s to say nothing of the food banks that are trying to weather the onslaught of Ohioans who need help.
“We continue to break records in numbers of people served, in first-time people served, in amount of food served,” she told the Capital Journal.
As of last month, the Ohio Department of Job & Family Services reported nearly 1.5 million SNAP recipients in Ohio, accounting for more than $258 million in regular funding allotments to the recipients.
Broken down by federal congressional district, the 11th U.S. House District in Northeast Ohio has the largest amount of recipients in the state, with more than 20% of the district’s population receiving assistance from SNAP. The 2nd U.S. House District in Southeast Ohio has the second most recipients, with nearly 16% of its population participating in the program.
With the average SNAP benefit in Ohio sitting at $5.92 per person per day, Lane-Gavin said supplements from food banks are necessary to keep food on the table for many Ohioans, and a cut to funding for SNAP and other assistance would be devastating.
“We can’t afford it; we don’t have the food,” Lane-Gavin said.
The cuts are just proposals at this point, and congressional leaders haven’t laid out specific plans, but a House Budget Committee document gave options for cuts, including a dozen to the SNAP program, according to the Commonwealth Fund research.
Those options included reducing SNAP benefits by eliminating an update to the Thrifty Food Plan, a USDA-developed food plan that estimates the cost of a healthy diet. There are several food plans, but the Thrifty Food Plan develops diet plans based on the lowest cost, representing a “nutritious, practical, cost-effective diet prepared at home for a ‘reference’ family,” defined as a male and female with two children between the ages of 6 and 11.
Other options included in the committee document included expanding a SNAP work requirement.
A proposed budget reduction for SNAP represents a nearly 21% cut in benefits, the Commonwealth Fund found, with $22 billion lost in 2026 alone.
“State economies would be seriously harmed by SNAP cutbacks,” the fund stated. “Their aggregate (gross domestic products) would be nearly $18 billion lower, and total economic output would be $30 billion lower.”
Ohio-level numbers from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities forecast a nearly $8 billion cut from Ohio’s SNAP program between 2026 and 2034, with more than 10,000 SNAP-authorized retailers at risk of losing revenue.
The Commonwealth Fund anticipates about 143,000 jobs lost in the country, including 78,000 “direct job losses in food-related sectors such as agriculture, retail grocery and food processing.”

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images)For the Day Eagle Hope Project, federal money has helped volunteers deliver fresh produce and meat to families in need across the remote Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in northern Montana — while putting cash into the hands of farmers, ranchers and meat processors.
The nonprofit generally has less than $300,000 to spend per year. So the $200,000 from a U.S. Department of Agriculture local food buying program drastically raised both the quantity and quality of the food it could distribute.
“They were a major, major contributor to our food,” said Tescha Hawley, who directs the organization, which aims to improve physical, mental and spiritual health.
The USDA recently nixed more than $1 billion from two programs that helped food banks and school meal programs buy local foods, including $660 million for schoolchildren. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins recently described the programs as “nonessential.”
But the move has left hundreds of school systems and food banks reeling. They already face rising food prices and are struggling to help community members with growing food insecurity.
State lawmakers embrace RFK Jr.’s health policies

Created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs aimed to build more resilient supply chains of domestic food by connecting schools and food pantries with small ranches, farms and dairies. The program was initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but later expanded by the Biden administration.
The federal programs stimulated the purchase of locally grown fruits, vegetables, dairy and meats — benefiting both the smaller farmers who received fair market pay for their products and the organizations granted funds to buy high quality foods.
The noncompetitive grants sent hundreds of millions of dollars to all 50 states, the District of Columbia and 84 tribal governments, boosting business for more than 8,000 farmers and providing local food to almost as many food banks. The Trump administration is killing the programs, despite Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s campaign against processed food, which he says is “poisoning” Americans.
Without ongoing funding, Hawley said, she would have to rely on cheaper, less nutritious food.
“It’s simple, right? I can get a truck … in here with all highly processed food, no problem,” she said.
Schools are facing a similar challenge: While officials running breakfast and lunch programs would prefer to buy more local products, those are often expensive. And with underfunding, high food costs and labor struggles, school lunch programs are already stretched thin.
In Milan, Tennessee, the federal funds allowed the local school system to buy minimally processed beef from a local stockyard, and broccoli, purple hull peas, tomatoes and melons from local growers.
Vickie Dunaway, who supervises the school system’s food services, told the Tennessee Lookout the federal cuts mean “going backwards” on purchasing healthier foods.
“That will obviously have to be cut out, because our budget will not withstand being able to purchase local,” she said. “Purchasing local, minimally processed food is way more expensive than buying from a distributor.”
A ‘devastating’ cut to food banks
Late last year, USDA said the programs had already spent more than $1 billion on local foods, and announced an expansion of the two programs with an additional $1.13 billion. USDA has killed that $1.13 billion expansion; it is still reimbursing the previously committed funds.
The Trump administration, which has sought to dramatically slash the size of the federal government, told recipients earlier this month that the programs “no longer effectuate the goals of the agency.”
In a statement to Stateline, the USDA said the current administration is “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
“The COVID era is over — USDA’s approach to nutrition programs will reflect that reality moving forward,” the statement said.










The only thing we’ll be able to do is just ration what little we have — to spread it as thinly as possible over the number of households we provide food to.


– Eric Cooper, president and CEO of the San Antonio Food Bank


The nonpartisan National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, which represents the ag department leaders of all 50 states, last month lobbied the federal government to continue the local foods program with permanent funding and ease procurement regulations for school meal programs. Arkansas Secretary of Agriculture Wes Ward, president of the association, said in a statement that the local food programs aid both producers and consumers.
“Investing in local and regional food systems not only strengthens the connections between farmers and their local communities, it bolsters supply chain resiliency as well,” his statement read.
In New Mexico, the program allowed food banks to buy some 900,000 pounds of locally grown food from more than 200 farmers since 2023. Before the program was terminated, the state was expecting close to $3 million in additional funding, Source New Mexico reported.
‘The lifeblood of the community’: States invest to save rural grocery stores

Jill Dixon, executive director of The Food Depot in northern New Mexico, called the cuts “devastating.”
In Texas, the San Antonio Food Bank counted on USDA’s local food program to help round out the food boxes it provides to families in need. The food bank, which serves more than 100,000 people across 29 Texas counties, largely relies on donated foods from hotels, restaurants and grocery stores.
“The challenge is I might get peanut butter donated, but I don’t have the jelly, or I might have pasta donated, but I don’t have the marinara,” said Eric Cooper, president and CEO of the food bank. “This program allowed us to purchase those items that we didn’t get that then helped round out the food box, or really complement the food that was being donated to give families the ability to make meals.”
The program initially provided the food bank nearly $3 million in grant funding — about 20% of what the organization spends each year on bulk food purchases. It expected a similar amount this year, before USDA’s announcement.
Cooper said cuts come even as the need for assistance rises. Food prices have squeezed families, and mass layoffs of federal workers portend more demand for food assistance in the coming months, he said.
“And we’ll be caught in the middle. And you know, that’s an incredibly uncomfortable place to be. The only thing we’ll be able to do is just ration what little we have — to spread it as thinly as possible over the number of households we provide food to.”

A boost for school lunches
For years, school meal programs have struggled with tight margins. Not only do they have to meet strict nutritional guidelines, but schools also face lagging reimbursement from the federal government and spend millions covering the cost of students’ unpaid meal debt.
At the 1,600-student Monticello School District in Arkansas, that debt is approaching $60,000.
So $50,000 from USDA’s local food program was a significant boost to the bottom line.
“That was such a help,” said Amanda West, the district’s child nutrition director.
The southeast Arkansas district used grant money to buy locally grown ground beef. The beef went into dishes including taco salad, meatloaf and spaghetti.
West said staff and students immediately noticed a difference in taste from conventionally purchased meats. And though the local product cost more, West said it also yielded more because it was not full of additives that cause the meat to shrink when cooked.
West, who is the president of the Arkansas School Nutrition Association, noted that her state is home to the nation’s highest rates of food insecurity.
Trump’s school choice push adds to momentum in statehouses

West had hoped to see the local foods program help turn that tide by bringing more stability to school meal programs and growing the state economy by boosting local farmers, ranchers and distributors.
“We’re all upset about it. I hate that we’re not receiving it because grocery prices are 30, 40% higher than what they were a few years ago, and it really hurts our budget,” she said. “It helped a lot of districts, including mine, and it would be amazing if we could get it back.”
On top of the local foods program cuts, congressional Republicans are considering billions in potential cuts to free and reduced-price school meal programs — cuts the School Nutrition Association says could potentially affect millions of American students.
The federal government partially subsidizes breakfast, lunch and after-school snack programs at rates calculated by the income level of students’ families.
The School Nutrition Association, which represents 50,000 school meal providers across the country, said the school meals are the healthiest many American children receive. But that group says federal reimbursements are far from adequate, leaving members worried about the future of their meal programs.
In a recent association survey of more than 1,390 school meal directors, more than 90% reported serious or moderate concern over the financial sustainability of their school meal programs three years from now.

Rows of dead batteries stretch across some 30 acres of high desert, organized in piles and boxes that are covered to shield them from the western Nevada sun. This vast field is where Redwood Materials stores the batteries it harvests from electric vehicles, laptops, toothbrushes, and the litany of other gadgets powered by lithium-ion technology. They now await recycling at what is the largest such facility in the country.  
Redwood was founded in 2017 by former Tesla executive JB Straubel and says it processes about three-quarters of all lithium-ion batteries recycled in the United States. It is among a growing number of operations that shred the packs that power modern life into what is called “black mass,” then recoup upwards of 95% of the lithium, cobalt, nickel, and other minerals they contain. Every ounce they recover is an ounce that doesn’t need to be dug from the ground.
Recycling could significantly reduce the need to extract virgin material, a process that is riddled with human rights and environmental concerns, such as the reliance on open pit mines in developing countries. Even beyond those worries, the Earth contains a finite source of minerals, and skyrocketing demand will squeeze supplies. The world currently extracts about 180,000 metric tons of lithium each year — and demand is expected to hit nearly 10 times that by 2050, as adoption of electric vehicles, battery storage, and other technology needed for a green transition surges. At those levels, there are only enough known reserves to last about 15 years. The projected runway for cobalt is even shorter.
Before hitting these theoretical limits, though, demand for the metals is likely to outstrip the world’s ability to economically and ethically mine them, said Beatrice Browning, an expert on battery recycling at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, which tracks the industry. “Recycling is going to plug that gap,” she told Grist. 
Given these trends, the most remarkable thing about Redwood isn’t that it exists, but that it didn’t exist sooner. As the United States belatedly embraces the economic, national security, and environmental benefits that domestic battery recycling offers, it is trying to claw back market share from countries like South Korea, Japan, and especially China, which has a decades-long head start.
“There is this race in terms of EV recycling that people are trying to capitalize on,” said Brian Cunningham, program manager for battery research and development at the Department of Energy. “Everybody understands that, in the long term, developing these robust supply chains is going to be incredibly reliant on battery recycling.”
Eye on the future
Straubel’s recycling journey began while he was still the chief technology officer at Tesla, which he co-founded with Elon Musk, and three others, in 2003. One of his roles was establishing the company’s first domestic battery manufacturing facility, Gigafactory Nevada. Material for Tesla’s batteries came from mines around the world, and Straubel understood that the trend would accelerate alongside demand for EVs, which has quintupled in number in the U.S. since 2020. He also knew that, in the years ahead, a growing number of electric vehicles would reach the end of their lives. According to consulting firm Circular Energy Storage, the world’s supply of retired batteries is expected to grow tenfold by 2030.

“[We] need to be planning ahead and really keeping an eye toward what that future looks like, to be ready to recycle every one of those batteries,” Straubel said in 2023. “The worst thing we could do is go to all this destruction and trouble to mine it, refine it, build the product and then throw it away.”
Last year, Redwood says it recycled 20 gigawatt-hours of lithium-ion batteries, or the equivalent of about a quarter-million EVs, generating $200 million in revenue. In addition to its headquarters in Carson City, Nevada, Redwood is building a campus in South Carolina. It isn’t alone in looking to expand. Ascend Elements, Cirba Solutions, Blue Whale Materials, and Li-Cycle are among a number of recyclers operating, or planning to operate, facilities in at least nine states across the country. More than 50 startups worldwide have attracted billions in investment in recent years. (Much of this outlay was driven by Biden-era legislation that Republicans are considering repealing, though it remains unclear just what such action might mean for spending already planned or underway.)
Despite the boom, the reuse revolution won’t come quickly.
Benchmark projects that recycled lithium and cobalt will account for a bit more than one-quarter of the global supply of those metals by 2040. A closed system in which battery manufacturers use only recycled material is considerably further off, because any increase in the number of old packs available to recycle will be outstripped by the need for new ones.
Global demand for EV batteries, for example, is growing by about 24% per year and won’t level off until sometime after 2040 — the point at which Benchmark’s forecast ends and growth is still forecast at 6% per year. The battery powering an EV can last well over a decade or more, so there will be a lag before the supply of recycled material catches up to demand.
Even today, the world’s recycling capacity outpaces the supply of batteries available to recycle, leaving everyone clambering to find more. That has meant waiting for EV batteries to reach the end of their lives, and attempting to recycle the small batteries in everyday gadgets that are often trashed. The dearth of material available for recycling is often attributed to the idea that only 5% of lithium batteries make it to companies like Redwood Materials. But the provenance of that number, cited everywhere from the Department of Energy and Ames National Laboratory to The New York Times and Grist, is murky. 
“If you ever ask, ‘Where did that 5% number come from?’ no one can really track back to the data,” said Bryant Polzin, a process engineer at Argonne National Laboratory. Like other Department of Energy employees or affiliates quoted in this story, he spoke to Grist before President Trump was inaugurated. “I think it was just kind of a game of telephone.”
Argonne’s research pegs the recycling rate for all lithium-ion batteries originating in the U.S. at 54% — 10% domestically and 44% in China — though it notes that data reliability remains an issue. Even that number, though, falls considerably short of what’s possible: 99% of lead acid batteries, like those used to start cars, in the United States are recycled, according to the Battery Council International trade association.
Redwood works with many automakers, including Toyota, BMW and Volkswagen, to gather EV batteries, and goes into the field to collect others from automotive repair shops, salvage yards, and the like. Policy tweaks could help recyclers acquire more. In California, for example, a state working group recommended more clearly delineating when various entities in the supply chain — from the battery supplier and auto manufacturer to a dismantler or refurbisher — are  responsible for ensuring a battery is recovered, reused, or recycled. This, the report said, could reduce the risk of “stranded” resources.

So far, though, this seems to be a rare occurrence. The much bigger hindrance to EV recycling in the U.S. is simply that there aren’t enough old batteries to meet the demand for new ones. As that waiting game unfolds, recycling those often discarded as household waste could help bridge the gap.
Collection is a challenge
Small lithium-ion batteries power everything from phones and electric toothbrushes to toys. By Benchmark’s estimate, about 5% of virgin lithium is used in consumer devices, but when they die, many of them are squirreled away in a drawer or trashed.
“A lot of household stuff does get chucked in the waste, and they’re not getting recycled,” said Andy Latham, the founder of Salvage Wire, a consulting firm focused on automotive battery recycling. Beyond being wasteful, dropping old batteries in the trash can be dangerous; scores of garbage trucks in cities from New York to Oregon have caught fire in recent years due to improperly disposed e-waste. 
Data on just how much lithium is simply thrown away or hoarded remains elusive. But Latham says, in the short-term, batteries in portable electronics are “probably just as much, if not more of a factor” as those in EVs when it comes to advancing recycling. Redwood Materials, for one, is hoovering up as many as it can. It works with nonprofits and others to funnel them to its Nevada campus and hopes to establish drop-off locations at big-box retailers, similar to can and bottle collection in some states. 
“Collection is definitely the biggest challenge,” said Alexis Georgeson, Redwood Materials’ vice president of government relations and policy. “It’s really a problem of how you get consumers to clean out their junk drawers.” 
Until more people do that, recyclers count on a somewhat ironic source of material: Scraps from factories that make new batteries. One of Redwood’s primary feedstocks are the bits and pieces left over during the manufacturing process in places like Tesla’s Gigafactory, Georgeson said. Benchmark estimates that such leftovers represent about 84% of the material all battery recyclers use today.



How to get rid of your e-waste
Lithium-ion batteries can be found in laptops, phones, toothbrushes, Bluetooth speakers, and power tools, just to name a few things. But many people aren’t sure what to do with these gadgets once they die. Instead of tossing them in the trash, which can be dangerous, experts say to recycle them. Here’s how. 
The nonprofit Call2Recycle operates some 16,000 sites nationwide where people can drop off their devices at no cost — at libraries, garbage dumps, and big box stores like Staples. The organization collected 5.4 million pounds of rechargeable batteries in 2023, and provides an online map to find a recycling location near you. Earth 911, Green Gadgets, and GreenCitizen also have locators. 
Some cities offer curbside pickup, making recycling even easier. Call2Recycle, Electronic Recycling International, and others will take them by mail, usually for a fee. “Batteries sitting in a junk drawer or a box in the basement can accidentally cause a fire,”said Mia Roethlein, an environmental analyst at the Department of Environmental Conservation in Vermont, a national recycling leader. “Bring them to one of the free battery collection locations as soon as they are no longer usable.” 



The authors of the Argonne paper underscored how vital this material is: “If no scrap was available,” they wrote, “the development of the U.S. recycling industry might be significantly delayed.”
As more EVs hit the end of the road, consumer electronics are collected in greater numbers, and battery manufacturing yields less scrap as it grows more efficient, the composition of the material will adjust. New battery technologies could also have an impact, with emerging solid-state batteries, for example, expected to create more production waste in the short term but less in the long term. But few doubt recycling will be a thriving business that could help the country cut carbon emissions and decrease its dependency on places like China, Chile, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo for increasingly vital minerals. It’s a future that American policymakers are trying to shape, hasten, and prepare for. 
Although under threat from President Donald Trump’s administration, both the Biden-era bipartisan infrastructure law and Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, explicitly aim to bring battery manufacturing to the United States. They provided billions of dollars in grants and tax credits to incentivize building out domestic capacity (often in Republican congressional districts). The consumer-facing EV tax credit also requires that manufacturers source a minimum amount of both minerals and components locally. The government has been investing hundreds of millions of dollars in battery recycling as well, including Department of Energy support for everything from collection systems for small electronics to research into improving recycling technology. 
“The work that we are funding is to really make those processes more efficient and economical,” said Jake Herb, technology development manager at the agency’s Vehicle Technologies Office. One success story is Ascend Elements, which Department of Energy funding helped grow from a Worcester Polytechnic Institute startup into a major player in the domestic industry. The department offered to loan Redwood Materials $2 billion to expand its factory, though the company declined the additional investment and says it has not accepted any federal funding. A robust domestic industry ensures that“we’re able to reclaim more materials [and] keep more of those materials domestic in the U.S.,” Herb said. 
Federal role is unclear
Several challenges remain as the country sprints toward that goal.
One hurdle is figuring out when recycling is the best option. Argonne National Laboratory’s “battery material use hierarchy” puts recycling near the bottom of its list of possible outcomes. It’s better to find alternate uses for batteries, especially those from EVs, like refurbishing them for use in another car or directing them to less intensive applications, such as for energy storage. 
“It would provide a much more economical solution to consumers,” said Vince Edivan, executive director of the Automotive Recyclers Association. 
Still, this so-called “second life” market remains nascent in the U.S. Edivan says automakers could boost it by making it easier for salvage yards to assess a battery’s condition to determine whether it can be reused or should be recycled. They often consider that information proprietary, he said. “We’re shredding perfectly good batteries because we don’t know the state of health.”










Collection is definitely the biggest challenge. It’s really a problem of how you get consumers to clean out their junk drawers.


– Alexis Georgeson, Redwood Materials’ vice president of government relations and policy


Battery recycling comes with another danger as well: fire. Dismantling and recovering batteries involves highly volatile processes. Last fall, a recycling plant in Missouri sparked a blaze that led many residents to evacuate. Thousands of dead fish washed up downstream of the plant. 
It’s somewhat hazy who is supposed to regulate this rapidly growing industry. The Environmental Protection Agency considers lithium-ion batteries hazardous waste, which dictates how they should and shouldn’t be disposed of, but doesn’t directly address recycling. In 2021, Argonne signed on to help develop lithium recycling standards, though the status of that effort remains unclear. The task will likely fall to a patchwork of federal, state, and local authorities, which must keep the public both safe and confident in a process that will be critical to the country’s — and the climate’s — future.
Perhaps the biggest challenge to creating a full-cycle loop in the United States is that before any reclaimed material can be used in a battery, it must be refined into an intermediary product, such as cathode, which makes up approximately 40% of a battery’s value. “You can’t send lithium to a Gigafactory,” said Georgeson. “It is like sending sand to a computer factory.”
At the moment, no one is making cathode in the U.S. at scale — manufacturers are buying it from Asia. Redwood, Ascend Elements, and others are ramping up cathode facilities that should be online in the coming years (Panasonic plans to use Redwood cathode at its new battery plant in Kansas). But, for now, they are frequently selling their raw material abroad. 
Georgeson sees federal policy as key to helping, or hindering, efforts to plug the cathode hole in the supply chain. One impediment has been a Treasury Department ruling that allows cathode sourced from allied countries to also qualify for the EV tax credit. That, she said, has pushed billions in business and investments to countries like South Korea instead of the United States. 
It remains unclear exactly how the new administration will impact the industry, but President Trump could certainly upend it. If Congress rolls back the IRA’s investment and production tax credits, it could significantly handicap America’s burgeoning recycling buildout. On the other hand, tariffs, particularly aimed at China, could tip the economic scales toward American producers and recyclers by making imported batteries and their components more expensive.
Redwood, for one, is optimistic that its goal of onshoring both battery recycling and cathode production aligns with Trump’s goals of putting “America first.” Straubel has said that the Trump administration could do a lot to encourage a more robust domestic supply chain, including making the battery origin requirements of the EV tax credit more stringent — rather than scrapping the incentive entirely. 
Getting the policy wrong, the company argues, will put the U.S. at the mercy of others in a future where battery recycling will only become more critical.

Cawley Middle School on Nov. 5, 2024. (Photo by Will Steinfeld/New Hampshire Bulletin)Reegan DePasquale had just moved to Hampton. On March 11, she attempted a rite of passage: participation in town meeting. 
But after arriving at Winnacunnet High School after work, DePasquale hit a hurdle. As a new resident of New Hampshire, DePasquale was required to produce documentary evidence of her citizenship, part of the requirements of a state voting law that passed last year. She needed her birth certificate, and, because her married name does not match her birth certificate, a copy of her marriage certificate, too.
It was 5 p.m., and DePasquale had two kids, 5 and 3, who needed dinner soon. She did some mental math and decided she wouldn’t be able to make it back with the documents she needed by 7 p.m. Frustrated, she headed home and did not vote.
“I obviously brought my ID, brought my kids, and I didn’t realize that I also needed to bring a passport or birth certificate,” she said during a press conference Tuesday. “I don’t usually carry those around with me.”
A prominent New Hampshire voting rights group says DePasquale isn’t alone. At least 96 people were turned away from voting during town meetings March 11 due to the new documentation law, according to research from the New Hampshire Campaign for Voting Rights, a subsidiary of America Votes, which hosted the press conference.
The group deployed observers to 22 polling places across the state that day — the busiest day of town meeting season this year — McKenzie St. Germain, New Hampshire state director for America Votes, said Tuesday. The group also conducted follow-up conversations with local elections officials to arrive at the tally.
“Those 96 voters only represent towns where we either had observers or have gotten in touch with election officials,” St. Germain said. “This is not even a full state perspective, so we would anticipate that that number may continue to grow.”
This town meeting season is the first time the new law has been in effect; it was signed by Gov. Chris Sununu in 2024 only after Sununu waited long enough that it would not take effect for the Nov. 5 general election. 
The law requires people who are newly registering to vote in New Hampshire — or who have been removed from the voting rolls because of a lack of activity — to produce documentation of citizenship in order to register and vote, with no exceptions. The law does not apply to people who are already registered to vote in the state but have moved to a different municipality or polling ward. 
Supporters of the law say it is an important safeguard against potential fraudulent voting, and will stop people from casting their ballot if they are not U.S. citizens. 
“You have to be a qualified voter to cast a ballot,” said Rep. Ross Berry, a Weare Republican and the chairman of the House Election Law Committee, in an interview. “And in order to be a qualified voter, you have to prove you are who you say you are: you’re a citizen of the United States, you are 18 years old, and you live where you say you live. It’s a very common-sense thing that if you don’t wait until the last minute to do it is not an issue.”
Previously, new registrants could sign a legally binding affidavit attesting that they were citizens, but Berry and other supporters of the law argue that system still allowed those people to cast ballots even if they were investigated and charged later. 
“If you wake up on election day and decide you want to go vote, which is your right, you’re going to need the documents,” Berry said. “And I’m sorry, but the affidavits were not a document. That was nothing more than a signature on a piece of paper.”
To St. Germain and other advocates, the number of people turned away this month suggests the new law has created disruptions even in relatively low turnout town meeting elections. And they indicate there could be more people turned away from the polls during the state primary and general elections in 2026, St. Germain said. 
“What we saw on March 11 made it clear that access to the ballot is under attack in New Hampshire, and voters cannot afford more restrictions that prevent them from exercising their right to vote,” she said.
Currently there are two lawsuits against the law, House Bill 1569. In one, brought in part by the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire, a trial will take place Feb. 9, 2026, in the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire, according to Henry Klementowicz, senior staff attorney for the ACLU of New Hampshire. 
A second lawsuit was filed in the same federal court by the New Hampshire Youth Movement with the help of the Elias Group, a firm helmed by election law attorney Marc Elias. 
Both lawsuits argue the law violates the First and 14th amendments of the U.S. Constitution because it creates too high a burden to register and vote. 
Those lawsuits were filed in late 2024, after HB 1569 became law but before it had taken effect in any elections, Klementowicz said. Now, Klementowicz said plaintiffs in the ACLU lawsuit may mention the new numbers indicating the law did prevent some people from immediately voting.
“I think that the results from the town elections could be used as evidence in the case,” Klementowicz said during the press conference.
Despite supporting the law, Berry agrees that more work needs to be done to inform voters about the need to bring the documents to register. 
“If I had any criticism, it would be that there wasn’t enough broadcast about what you’re going to have to do if you’re going to register on election day,” he said. “And I think that the state should take a proactive approach to get people to register before election day. Because if you’re waiting to register on election day, you’re basically saying, ‘God, I hope nothing goes wrong.’”
Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers are considering a number of bills that would tighten voting registration further, particularly for absentee voters. House Bill 217 would require people voting absentee to also produce documentary proof of citizenship, age, domicile, and identity in order to register; Senate Bill 213 would apply similar documentary requirements. HB 217 is up for a vote on the House floor during its sessions Wednesday and Thursday, while SB 213 has already passed the Senate.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/nhvotersrights-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

Rows of dead batteries stretch across some 30 acres of high desert, organized in piles and boxes that are covered to shield them from the western Nevada sun. This vast field is where Redwood Materials stores the batteries it harvests from electric vehicles, laptops, toothbrushes, and the litany of other gadgets powered by lithium-ion technology. They now await recycling at what is the largest such facility in the country.  
Redwood was founded in 2017 by former Tesla executive JB Straubel and says it processes about three-quarters of all lithium-ion batteries recycled in the United States. It is among a growing number of operations that shred the packs that power modern life into what is called “black mass,” then recoup upwards of 95% of the lithium, cobalt, nickel, and other minerals they contain. Every ounce they recover is an ounce that doesn’t need to be dug from the ground.
Recycling could significantly reduce the need to extract virgin material, a process that is riddled with human rights and environmental concerns, such as the reliance on open pit mines in developing countries. Even beyond those worries, the Earth contains a finite source of minerals, and skyrocketing demand will squeeze supplies. The world currently extracts about 180,000 metric tons of lithium each year — and demand is expected to hit nearly 10 times that by 2050, as adoption of electric vehicles, battery storage, and other technology needed for a green transition surges. At those levels, there are only enough known reserves to last about 15 years. The projected runway for cobalt is even shorter.
Before hitting these theoretical limits, though, demand for the metals is likely to outstrip the world’s ability to economically and ethically mine them, said Beatrice Browning, an expert on battery recycling at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, which tracks the industry. “Recycling is going to plug that gap,” she told Grist. 
Given these trends, the most remarkable thing about Redwood isn’t that it exists, but that it didn’t exist sooner. As the United States belatedly embraces the economic, national security, and environmental benefits that domestic battery recycling offers, it is trying to claw back market share from countries like South Korea, Japan, and especially China, which has a decades-long head start.
“There is this race in terms of EV recycling that people are trying to capitalize on,” said Brian Cunningham, program manager for battery research and development at the Department of Energy. “Everybody understands that, in the long term, developing these robust supply chains is going to be incredibly reliant on battery recycling.”
Eye on the future
Straubel’s recycling journey began while he was still the chief technology officer at Tesla, which he co-founded with Elon Musk, and three others, in 2003. One of his roles was establishing the company’s first domestic battery manufacturing facility, Gigafactory Nevada. Material for Tesla’s batteries came from mines around the world, and Straubel understood that the trend would accelerate alongside demand for EVs, which has quintupled in number in the U.S. since 2020. He also knew that, in the years ahead, a growing number of electric vehicles would reach the end of their lives. According to consulting firm Circular Energy Storage, the world’s supply of retired batteries is expected to grow tenfold by 2030.

“[We] need to be planning ahead and really keeping an eye toward what that future looks like, to be ready to recycle every one of those batteries,” Straubel said in 2023. “The worst thing we could do is go to all this destruction and trouble to mine it, refine it, build the product and then throw it away.”
Last year, Redwood says it recycled 20 gigawatt-hours of lithium-ion batteries, or the equivalent of about a quarter-million EVs, generating $200 million in revenue. In addition to its headquarters in Carson City, Nevada, Redwood is building a campus in South Carolina. It isn’t alone in looking to expand. Ascend Elements, Cirba Solutions, Blue Whale Materials, and Li-Cycle are among a number of recyclers operating, or planning to operate, facilities in at least nine states across the country. More than 50 startups worldwide have attracted billions in investment in recent years. (Much of this outlay was driven by Biden-era legislation that Republicans are considering repealing, though it remains unclear just what such action might mean for spending already planned or underway.)
Despite the boom, the reuse revolution won’t come quickly.
Benchmark projects that recycled lithium and cobalt will account for a bit more than one-quarter of the global supply of those metals by 2040. A closed system in which battery manufacturers use only recycled material is considerably further off, because any increase in the number of old packs available to recycle will be outstripped by the need for new ones.
Global demand for EV batteries, for example, is growing by about 24% per year and won’t level off until sometime after 2040 — the point at which Benchmark’s forecast ends and growth is still forecast at 6% per year. The battery powering an EV can last well over a decade or more, so there will be a lag before the supply of recycled material catches up to demand.
Even today, the world’s recycling capacity outpaces the supply of batteries available to recycle, leaving everyone clambering to find more. That has meant waiting for EV batteries to reach the end of their lives, and attempting to recycle the small batteries in everyday gadgets that are often trashed. The dearth of material available for recycling is often attributed to the idea that only 5% of lithium batteries make it to companies like Redwood Materials. But the provenance of that number, cited everywhere from the Department of Energy and Ames National Laboratory to The New York Times and Grist, is murky. 
“If you ever ask, ‘Where did that 5% number come from?’ no one can really track back to the data,” said Bryant Polzin, a process engineer at Argonne National Laboratory. Like other Department of Energy employees or affiliates quoted in this story, he spoke to Grist before President Trump was inaugurated. “I think it was just kind of a game of telephone.”
Argonne’s research pegs the recycling rate for all lithium-ion batteries originating in the U.S. at 54% — 10% domestically and 44% in China — though it notes that data reliability remains an issue. Even that number, though, falls considerably short of what’s possible: 99% of lead acid batteries, like those used to start cars, in the United States are recycled, according to the Battery Council International trade association.
Redwood works with many automakers, including Toyota, BMW and Volkswagen, to gather EV batteries, and goes into the field to collect others from automotive repair shops, salvage yards, and the like. Policy tweaks could help recyclers acquire more. In California, for example, a state working group recommended more clearly delineating when various entities in the supply chain — from the battery supplier and auto manufacturer to a dismantler or refurbisher — are  responsible for ensuring a battery is recovered, reused, or recycled. This, the report said, could reduce the risk of “stranded” resources.

So far, though, this seems to be a rare occurance. The much bigger hindrance to EV recycling in the U.S. is simply that there aren’t enough old batteries to meet the demand for new ones. As that waiting game unfolds, recycling those often discarded as household waste could help bridge the gap.
Collection is a challenge
Small lithium-ion batteries power everything from phones and electric toothbrushes to toys. By Benchmark’s estimate, about 5% of virgin lithium is used in consumer devices, but when they die, many of them are squirreled away in a drawer or trashed.
“A lot of household stuff does get chucked in the waste, and they’re not getting recycled,” said Andy Latham, the founder of Salvage Wire, a consulting firm focused on automotive battery recycling. Beyond being wasteful, dropping old batteries in the trash can be dangerous; scores of garbage trucks in cities from New York to Oregon have caught fire in recent years due to improperly disposed e-waste. 
Data on just how much lithium is simply thrown away or hoarded remains elusive. But Latham says, in the short-term, batteries in portable electronics are “probably just as much, if not more of a factor” as those in EVs when it comes to advancing recycling. Redwood Materials, for one, is hoovering up as many as it can. It works with nonprofits and others to funnel them to its Nevada campus and hopes to establish drop-off locations at big-box retailers, similar to can and bottle collection in some states. 
“Collection is definitely the biggest challenge,” said Alexis Georgeson, Redwood Materials’ vice president of government relations and policy. “It’s really a problem of how you get consumers to clean out their junk drawers.” 
Until more people do that, recyclers count on a somewhat ironic source of material: Scraps from factories that make new batteries. One of Redwood’s primary feedstocks are the bits and pieces left over during the manufacturing process in places like Tesla’s Gigafactory, Georgeson said. Benchmark estimates that such leftovers represent about 84% of the material all battery recyclers use today.



How to get rid of your e-waste
Lithium-ion batteries can be found in laptops, phones, toothbrushes, Bluetooth speakers, and power tools, just to name a few things. But many people aren’t sure what to do with these gadgets once they die. Instead of tossing them in the trash, which can be dangerous, experts say to recycle them. Here’s how.
The nonprofit Call2Recycle operates some 16,000 sites nationwide where people can drop off their devices at no cost — at libraries, garbage dumps, and big box stores like Staples. The organization collected 5.4 million pounds of rechargeable batteries in 2023, and provides an online map to find a recycling location near you. Earth 911, Green Gadgets, and GreenCitizen also have locators. 
Some cities offer curbside pickup, making recycling even easier. Call2Recycle, Electronic Recycling International, and others will take them by mail, usually for a fee. “Batteries sitting in a junk drawer or a box in the basement can accidentally cause a fire,”said Mia Roethlein, an environmental analyst at the Department of Environmental Conservation in Vermont, a national recycling leader. “Bring them to one of the free battery collection locations as soon as they are no longer usable.” 



The authors of the Argonne paper underscored how vital this material is: “If no scrap was available,” they wrote, “the development of the U.S. recycling industry might be significantly delayed.”
As more EVs hit the end of the road, consumer electronics are collected in greater numbers, and battery manufacturing yields less scrap as it grows more efficient, the composition of the material will adjust. New battery technologies could also have an impact, with emerging solid-state batteries, for example, expected to create more production waste in the short term but less in the long term. But few doubt recycling will be a thriving business that could help the country cut carbon emissions and decrease its dependency on places like China, Chile, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo for increasingly vital minerals. It’s a future that American policymakers are trying to shape, hasten, and prepare for. 
Although under threat from President Donald Trump’s administration, both the Biden-era bipartisan infrastructure law and Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, explicitly aim to bring battery manufacturing to the United States. They provided billions of dollars in grants and tax credits to incentivize building out domestic capacity (often in Republican congressional districts). The consumer-facing EV tax credit also requires that manufacturers source a minimum amount of both minerals and components locally. The government has been investing hundreds of millions of dollars in battery recycling as well, including Department of Energy support for everything from collection systems for small electronics to research into improving recycling technology. 
“The work that we are funding is to really make those processes more efficient and economical,” said Jake Herb, technology development manager at the agency’s Vehicle Technologies Office. One success story is Ascend Elements, which Department of Energy funding helped grow from a Worcester Polytechnic Institute startup into a major player in the domestic industry. The department offered to loan Redwood Materials $2 billion to expand its factory, though the company declined the additional investment and says it has not accepted any federal funding. A robust domestic industry ensures that“we’re able to reclaim more materials [and] keep more of those materials domestic in the U.S.,” Herb said. 
Federal role is unclear
Several challenges remain as the country sprints toward that goal.
One hurdle is figuring out when recycling is the best option. Argonne National Laboratory’s “battery material use hierarchy” puts recycling near the bottom of its list of possible outcomes. It’s better to find alternate uses for batteries, especially those from EVs, like refurbishing them for use in another car or directing them to less intensive applications, such as for energy storage. 
“It would provide a much more economical solution to consumers,” said Vince Edivan, executive director of the Automotive Recyclers Association. 
Still, this so-called “second life” market remains nascent in the U.S. Edivan says automakers could boost it by making it easier for salvage yards to assess a battery’s condition to determine whether it can be reused or should be recycled. They often consider that information proprietary, he said. “We’re shredding perfectly good batteries because we don’t know the state of health.”










Collection is definitely the biggest challenge. It’s really a problem of how you get consumers to clean out their junk drawers.


– Alexis Georgeson, Redwood Materials’ vice president of government relations and policy


Battery recycling comes with another danger as well: fire. Dismantling and recovering batteries involves highly volatile processes. Last fall, a recycling plant in Missouri sparked a blaze that led many residents to evacuate. Thousands of dead fish washed up downstream of the plant. 
It’s somewhat hazy who is supposed to regulate this rapidly growing industry. The Environmental Protection Agency considers lithium-ion batteries hazardous waste, which dictates how they should and shouldn’t be disposed of, but doesn’t directly address recycling. In 2021, Argonne signed on to help develop lithium recycling standards, though the status of that effort remains unclear. The task will likely fall to a patchwork of federal, state, and local authorities, which must keep the public both safe and confident in a process that will be critical to the country’s — and the climate’s — future.

At the moment, no one is making cathode in the U.S. at scale — manufacturers are buying it from Asia. Redwood, Ascend Elements, and others are ramping up cathode facilities that should be online in the coming years (Panasonic plans to use Redwood cathode at its new battery plant in Kansas). But, for now, they are frequently selling their raw material abroad.

North Carolina is among the states considering legislation designed to regulate health insurers’ prior authorization and claims reviews. (Chris Carlson/The Associated Press)Health insurance companies are under increasing scrutiny for allegedly using artificial intelligence bots and algorithms to swiftly deny patients routine or lifesaving care — without a human actually reviewing their claims.
The high-profile killing late last year of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has focused even more attention on so-called prior authorization, the process by which patients and doctors must ask health insurers to approve medical procedures or drugs before proceeding. There had been protests and outrage over the company’s practices for months before Thompson’s death, and UnitedHealthcare has been accused in a class-action lawsuit of using AI to wrongfully deny claims.
As more patients and doctors voice their frustrations, states are responding with legislation designed to regulate prior authorization and claims reviews. So far this year, lawmakers in more than a dozen states are considering measures that would, for example, limit the use of AI in reviewing claims; exclude certain prescription medications from prior authorization rules; ensure that emergency mental health care is not delayed for more than 48 hours; and require that insurers’ review boards include licensed physicians, dentists or pharmacists with clinical experience.
Insurers have long required doctors to obtain their approval before they’ll pay for certain drugs, treatments and procedures. They argue it is necessary to rein in health care costs and limit unnecessary services. But many doctors and patients say the practice has gotten out of hand, causing delays and denials of care that are harming and even killing people.
In a survey last year by the American Medical Association, 93% of doctors said that insurers’ prior authorization practices delayed “necessary care” for their patients. Twenty-nine percent said such delays had led to a “serious adverse event,” such as hospitalization, permanent injury or death.
In 2023, insurers selling plans on the marketplaces created under the Affordable Care Act denied a combined average of 20% of all claims. Of the 73 million in-network claims they denied, only 1% were appealed, according to KFF, a health policy research group.
 The federal role

Under the Biden administration, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice took a firmer hand against health care corporations alleged to be engaging in behavior resulting in limited and more expensive care for patients. The administration also approved rules requiring that beginning in 2026, Medicare and Medicaid plans create a streamlined electronic process for reviewing claims, making decisions more quickly and providing specific reasons for denying care.
But it’s difficult to hold insurers accountable, according to Timothy McBride, a health policy analyst and co-director of a program at the Institute for Public Health at Washington University in St. Louis.
“Each part of the health care industry — hospitals, pharmaceuticals, insurers — they all have a lot of concentrated power,” McBride said in a phone interview. “And unless somebody actually takes it on directly, it’s going to stay that way. I think the Biden administration tried to take it on, but didn’t make a lot of progress.”
It’s unclear whether the Trump administration and Congress will reverse course. During his confirmation hearing on March 14, Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, defended the use of artificial intelligence in reviewing claims.
“AI can be used for good or for evil, and it to a large extent depends on who’s using it and for what purpose,” Oz told members of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee. “I think AI could play a vital role in accelerating preauthorization.”
In the past, Trump has supported measures to help patients, such as increasing hospital price transparency and lowering prescription drug prices, McBride noted. But “Republicans and conservatives generally are anti-regulation,” he said. “My gut feeling would be that they back off on the Biden push on this.”
States have limited power to act on their own. They have authority only over state-regulated health plans, which include Medicaid, plans for state workers and policies residents purchase from the ACA marketplaces. About 90 million people are covered that way. State laws do not apply to the 156 million workers, retirees and dependents who get their coverage through employer-sponsored health plans, which are regulated through a federal law known as ERISA.
Furthermore, health insurance companies are large and have deep pockets, allowing them to easily absorb state fines.
But Kaye Pestaina, the director of the program on patient and consumer protection at KFF, said states have an important role to play.
“Much of the focus around prior authorization at the federal level has kind of originated from state protections, so I imagine there will be continual activity by state legislatures to come at the problem,” Pestaina told Stateline.
 What states are doing

Pestaina said states are trying a number of solutions. For example, states such as Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania have given their insurance regulators more authority to directly access claims denial information, in order to overturn decisions or potentially enforce state rules. And these efforts have largely had bipartisan support.













There is a role for some oversight to make sure that things are covered. But right now, I think the system is out of balance.


– North Carolina Republican state Rep. Timothy Reeder





In Pennsylvania, Republican state Sen. Kristin Phillips-Hill pushed through bipartisan legislation in 2022 to streamline prior authorization practices for state-regulated health plans after hearing numerous complaints from patients and doctors.
The legislation created an Independent External Review organization that allows Pennsylvanians to submit an online form to request a review if their insurer denies a service or treatment. If the review organization decides the service should be covered, the insurer must do so. Before then, patients could turn only to a federal review process, which may have been more challenging to navigate and taken more time.
“Our reforms created clear rules, clear timelines for the prior authorization process, and it removed ambiguity or uncertainty from the system that at times, insurers could exploit and providers could be confused over,” Phillips-Hill told Stateline. “Prior to that reform, if you had a denial from your insurer, you had very little recourse.”
The program began in January 2024, and in its first year the Pennsylvania Insurance Department overturned half of 517 denials, which amounted to claims from 259 people.
Jonathan Greer, president and CEO of the Insurance Federation of Pennsylvania, said his trade group worked with lawmakers to come to an agreement on how to change the prior authorization process in a way that worked for insurers and patient advocates. Greer says he thinks Pennsylvania could be a model for other states.
“Prior authorization, I think unfairly, has been characterized as a reason to say ‘no’ by insurers,” Greer said. “The purpose of prior authorization is to make sure that you know the care that you get is consistent with the care that you need.”
In North Carolina, Republican state Rep. Timothy Reeder is hopeful that his prior authorization bill will make it across the finish line this year. Reeder’s bill would set tight deadlines on insurers’ claim decisions and require companies to have licensed practitioners on their claim review boards. Insurers would also have to publicize a list of services they require authorization for.
“I’m not saying that we need to get rid of it completely,” Reeder told Stateline. “There is a role for some oversight to make sure that things are covered. But right now, I think the system is out of balance.”
But some state laws have proven to be less effective than advertised.
In 2021, Texas enacted a first-of-its-kind law creating a “gold card” standard, under which physicians whose care recommendations are approved by insurers at least 90% of the time are exempt from the prior authorization process. But as of the end of 2023, only 3% of Texas physicians had earned gold card status, according to the Texas Medical Association.
That’s why the group is pushing legislation that would require insurers to report which preauthorization exemptions they granted and denied and how many claims went to independent review. Dr. Zeke Silva of the Texas Medical Association’s legislative council said it would be “in the same spirit” as what Pennsylvania has done.
“Our focus with the [Texas Medical Association] is our physicians being able to provide the best care possible. And we want that to be free of burden,” Silva told Stateline. “We want to minimize third parties coming in and inappropriately denying care that our physicians and our patients think is in their best interest.”

Rows of dead batteries stretch across some 30 acres of high desert, organized in piles and boxes that are covered to shield them from the western Nevada sun. This vast field is where Redwood Materials stores the batteries it harvests from electric vehicles, laptops, toothbrushes, and the litany of other gadgets powered by lithium-ion technology. They now await recycling at what is the largest such facility in the country.  
Redwood was founded in 2017 by former Tesla executive JB Straubel and says it processes about three-quarters of all lithium-ion batteries recycled in the United States. 
It is among a growing number of operations that shred the packs that power modern life into what is called “black mass,” then recoup upwards of 95% of the lithium, cobalt, nickel, and other minerals they contain. 
Every ounce they recover is an ounce that doesn’t need to be dug from the ground.
Recycling could significantly reduce the need to extract virgin material, a process that is riddled with human rights and environmental concerns, such as the reliance on open pit mines in developing countries. 
Even beyond those worries, the Earth contains a finite source of minerals, and skyrocketing demand will squeeze supplies. The world currently extracts about 180,000 metric tons of lithium each year — and demand is expected to hit nearly 10 times that by 2050, as adoption of electric vehicles, battery storage, and other technology needed for a green transition surges.

At those levels, there are only enough known reserves to last about 15 years. The projected runway for cobalt is even shorter.
Before hitting these theoretical limits, though, demand for the metals is likely to outstrip the world’s ability to economically and ethically mine them, said Beatrice Browning, an expert on battery recycling at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, which tracks the industry. 
“Recycling is going to plug that gap,” she told Grist. 
Given these trends, the most remarkable thing about Redwood isn’t that it exists, but that it didn’t exist sooner. 
As the United States belatedly embraces the economic, national security, and environmental benefits that domestic battery recycling offers, it is trying to claw back market share from countries like South Korea, Japan, and especially China, which has a decades-long head start.
“There is this race in terms of EV recycling that people are trying to capitalize on,” said Brian Cunningham, program manager for battery research and development at the Department of Energy. “Everybody understands that, in the long term, developing these robust supply chains is going to be incredibly reliant on battery recycling.”
Eye on the future
Straubel’s recycling journey began while he was still the chief technology officer at Tesla, which he co-founded with Elon Musk, and three others, in 2003. 
One of his roles was establishing the company’s first domestic battery manufacturing facility, Gigafactory Nevada. Material for Tesla’s batteries came from mines around the world, and Straubel understood that the trend would accelerate alongside demand for EVs, which has quintupled in number in the U.S. since 2020. 
He also knew that, in the years ahead, a growing number of electric vehicles would reach the end of their lives. According to consulting firm Circular Energy Storage, the world’s supply of retired batteries is expected to grow tenfold by 2030.

“[We] need to be planning ahead and really keeping an eye toward what that future looks like, to be ready to recycle every one of those batteries,” Straubel said in 2023. “The worst thing we could do is go to all this destruction and trouble to mine it, refine it, build the product and then throw it away.”
Last year, Redwood says it recycled 20 gigawatt-hours of lithium-ion batteries, or the equivalent of about a quarter-million EVs, generating $200 million in revenue. 
In addition to its headquarters in Carson City, Nevada, Redwood is building a campus in South Carolina. 
It isn’t alone in looking to expand. 
Ascend Elements, Cirba Solutions, Blue Whale Materials, and Li-Cycle are among a number of recyclers operating, or planning to operate, facilities in at least nine states across the country. More than 50 startups worldwide have attracted billions in investment in recent years. (Much of this outlay was driven by Biden-era legislation that Republicans are considering repealing, though it remains unclear just what such action might mean for spending already planned or underway.)
Major electric vehicle lithium project paused. Other SC battery recycling investments continue.

Despite the boom, the reuse revolution won’t come quickly.
Benchmark projects that recycled lithium and cobalt will account for a bit more than one-quarter of the global supply of those metals by 2040. A closed system in which battery manufacturers use only recycled material is considerably further off, because any increase in the number of old packs available to recycle will be outstripped by the need for new ones.
Global demand for EV batteries, for example, is growing by about 24% per year and won’t level off until sometime after 2040 — the point at which Benchmark’s forecast ends and growth is still forecast at 6% per year. 
The battery powering an EV can last well over a decade or more, so there will be a lag before the supply of recycled material catches up to demand.
Even today, the world’s recycling capacity outpaces the supply of batteries available to recycle, leaving everyone clambering to find more. That has meant waiting for EV batteries to reach the end of their lives, and attempting to recycle the small batteries in everyday gadgets that are often trashed. 
The dearth of material available for recycling is often attributed to the idea that only 5% of lithium batteries make it to companies like Redwood Materials. But the provenance of that number, cited everywhere from the Department of Energy and Ames National Laboratory to The New York Times and Grist, is murky. 
“If you ever ask, ‘Where did that 5% number come from?’ no one can really track back to the data,” said Bryant Polzin, a process engineer at Argonne National Laboratory. Like other Department of Energy employees or affiliates quoted in this story, he spoke to Grist before President Trump was inaugurated. “I think it was just kind of a game of telephone.”
SC readying training for EV workers across the state. Here’s what job seekers can expect.

Argonne’s research pegs the recycling rate for all lithium-ion batteries originating in the U.S. at 54% — 10% domestically and 44% in China — though it notes that data reliability remains an issue. 
Even that number, though, falls considerably short of what’s possible: 99% of lead acid batteries, like those used to start cars, in the United States are recycled, according to the Battery Council International trade association.
Redwood works with many automakers, including Toyota, BMW and Volkswagen, to gather EV batteries, and goes into the field to collect others from automotive repair shops, salvage yards, and the like. 
Policy tweaks could help recyclers acquire more. 
In California, for example, a state working group recommended more clearly delineating when various entities in the supply chain — from the battery supplier and auto manufacturer to a dismantler or refurbisher — are responsible for ensuring a battery is recovered, reused, or recycled. This, the report said, could reduce the risk of “stranded” resources.

So far, though, this seems to be a rare occurance. The much bigger hindrance to EV recycling in the U.S. is simply that there aren’t enough old batteries to meet the demand for new ones. As that waiting game unfolds, recycling those often discarded as household waste could help bridge the gap.
Collection is a challenge
Small lithium-ion batteries power everything from phones and electric toothbrushes to toys. By Benchmark’s estimate, about 5% of virgin lithium is used in consumer devices, but when they die, many of them are squirreled away in a drawer or trashed.
“A lot of household stuff does get chucked in the waste, and they’re not getting recycled,” said Andy Latham, the founder of Salvage Wire, a consulting firm focused on automotive battery recycling.
Beyond being wasteful, dropping old batteries in the trash can be dangerous; scores of garbage trucks in cities from New York to Oregon have caught fire in recent years due to improperly disposed e-waste. 
Data on just how much lithium is simply thrown away or hoarded remains elusive. But Latham says, in the short-term, batteries in portable electronics are “probably just as much, if not more of a factor” as those in EVs when it comes to advancing recycling. 
Redwood Materials, for one, is hoovering up as many as it can. It works with nonprofits and others to funnel them to its Nevada campus and hopes to establish drop-off locations at big-box retailers, similar to can and bottle collection in some states. 
“Collection is definitely the biggest challenge,” said Alexis Georgeson, Redwood Materials’ vice president of government relations and policy. “It’s really a problem of how you get consumers to clean out their junk drawers.” 
Until more people do that, recyclers count on a somewhat ironic source of material: Scraps from factories that make new batteries. 
One of Redwood’s primary feedstocks are the bits and pieces left over during the manufacturing process in places like Tesla’s Gigafactory, Georgeson said. 
Benchmark estimates that such leftovers represent about 84% of the material all battery recyclers use today.



How to get rid of your e-waste
Lithium-ion batteries can be found in laptops, phones, toothbrushes, Bluetooth speakers, and power tools, just to name a few things. But many people aren’t sure what to do with these gadgets once they die. Instead of tossing them in the trash, which can be dangerous, experts say to recycle them. Here’s how. 
The nonprofit Call2Recycle operates some 16,000 sites nationwide where people can drop off their devices at no cost — at libraries, garbage dumps, and big box stores like Staples. The organization collected 5.4 million pounds of rechargeable batteries in 2023, and provides an online map to find a recycling location near you. Earth 911, Green Gadgets, and GreenCitizen also have locators. 
Some cities offer curbside pickup, making recycling even easier. Call2Recycle, Electronic Recycling International, and others will take them by mail, usually for a fee. “Batteries sitting in a junk drawer or a box in the basement can accidentally cause a fire,”said Mia Roethlein, an environmental analyst at the Department of Environmental Conservation in Vermont, a national recycling leader. “Bring them to one of the free battery collection locations as soon as they are no longer usable.” 



The authors of the Argonne paper underscored how vital this material is: “If no scrap was available,” they wrote, “the development of the U.S. recycling industry might be significantly delayed.”
As more EVs hit the end of the road, consumer electronics are collected in greater numbers, and battery manufacturing yields less scrap as it grows more efficient, the composition of the material will adjust.
New battery technologies could also have an impact, with emerging solid-state batteries, for example, expected to create more production waste in the short term but less in the long term. 
But few doubt recycling will be a thriving business that could help the country cut carbon emissions and decrease its dependency on places like China, Chile, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo for increasingly vital minerals. It’s a future that American policymakers are trying to shape, hasten, and prepare for. 
Lithium fires burn hotter and longer. Here’s how SC is preparing for a growing battery industry.

Although under threat from President Donald Trump’s administration, both the Biden-era bipartisan infrastructure law and Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, explicitly aim to bring battery manufacturing to the United States. They provided billions of dollars in grants and tax credits to incentivize building out domestic capacity (often in Republican congressional districts). The consumer-facing EV tax credit also requires that manufacturers source a minimum amount of both minerals and components locally. 
The government has been investing hundreds of millions of dollars in battery recycling as well, including Department of Energy support for everything from collection systems for small electronics to research into improving recycling technology. 
“The work that we are funding is to really make those processes more efficient and economical,” said Jake Herb, technology development manager at the agency’s Vehicle Technologies Office. 
One success story is Ascend Elements, which Department of Energy funding helped grow from a Worcester Polytechnic Institute startup into a major player in the domestic industry. 
The department offered to loan Redwood Materials $2 billion to expand its factory, though the company declined the additional investment and says it has not accepted any federal funding. 
A robust domestic industry ensures that “we’re able to reclaim more materials [and] keep more of those materials domestic in the U.S,” Herb said. 
Federal role is unclear
Several challenges remain as the country sprints toward that goal.
One hurdle is figuring out when recycling is the best option. 
Argonne National Laboratory’s “battery material use hierarchy” puts recycling near the bottom of its list of possible outcomes. It’s better to find alternate uses for batteries, especially those from EVs, like refurbishing them for use in another car or directing them to less intensive applications, such as for energy storage. 
“It would provide a much more economical solution to consumers,” said Vince Edivan, executive director of the Automotive Recyclers Association. 
Still, this so-called “second life” market remains nascent in the U.S. 
Edivan says automakers could boost it by making it easier for salvage yards to assess a battery’s condition to determine whether it can be reused or should be recycled. They often consider that information proprietary, he said. “We’re shredding perfectly good batteries because we don’t know the state of health.”










Collection is definitely the biggest challenge. It’s really a problem of how you get consumers to clean out their junk drawers.


– Alexis Georgeson, Redwood Materials’ vice president of government relations and policy


Battery recycling comes with another danger as well: fire. Dismantling and recovering batteries involves highly volatile processes. Last fall, a recycling plant in Missouri sparked a blaze that led many residents to evacuate. Thousands of dead fish washed up downstream of the plant. 
It’s somewhat hazy who is supposed to regulate this rapidly growing industry. 
The Environmental Protection Agency considers lithium-ion batteries hazardous waste, which dictates how they should and shouldn’t be disposed of, but doesn’t directly address recycling. In 2021, Argonne signed on to help develop lithium recycling standards, though the status of that effort remains unclear.
The task will likely fall to a patchwork of federal, state, and local authorities, which must keep the public both safe and confident in a process that will be critical to the country’s — and the climate’s — future.
Perhaps the biggest challenge to creating a full-cycle loop in the United States is that before any reclaimed material can be used in a battery, it must be refined into an intermediary product, such as cathode, which makes up approximately 40% of a battery’s value. 
“You can’t send lithium to a Gigafactory,” said Georgeson. “It is like sending sand to a computer factory.”
At the moment, no one is making cathode in the U.S. at scale — manufacturers are buying it from Asia.
Redwood, Ascend Elements, and others are ramping up cathode facilities that should be online in the coming years (Panasonic plans to use Redwood cathode at its new battery plant in Kansas). But, for now, they are frequently selling their raw material abroad. 
Georgeson sees federal policy as key to helping, or hindering, efforts to plug the cathode hole in the supply chain. 
One impediment has been a Treasury Department ruling that allows cathode sourced from allied countries to also qualify for the EV tax credit. That, she said, has pushed billions in business and investments to countries like South Korea instead of the United States. 
Electric vehicle industry will persist, experts say, despite Trump funding cuts

It remains unclear exactly how the new administration will impact the industry, but President Trump could certainly upend it. 
If Congress rolls back the IRA’s investment and production tax credits, it could significantly handicap America’s burgeoning recycling buildout. On the other hand, tariffs, particularly aimed at China, could tip the economic scales toward American producers and recyclers by making imported batteries and their components more expensive.
Redwood, for one, is optimistic that its goal of onshoring both battery recycling and cathode production aligns with Trump’s goals of putting “America first.” 
Straubel has said that the Trump administration could do a lot to encourage a more robust domestic supply chain, including making the battery origin requirements of the EV tax credit more stringent — rather than scrapping the incentive entirely. 
Getting the policy wrong, the company argues, will put the U.S. at the mercy of others in a future where battery recycling will only become more critical.

They’re also heartened by the governor’s proposed child tax credit. But the slate of policies they’re backing are far from a sure bet, as the Republican-controlled General Assembly takes a skeptical view toward benefit spending.
The House speaker has expressed doubts about universal school meals — “huge amount of waste”— and the House’s budget chief is skeptical about maintaining funding for foodbanks after the COVID-19 pandemic — “just probably not gonna be what we do.”

To faith leaders from the Hunger Network in Ohio, the way the state spends its money is a statement of its collective morals.
“Our budget here in Ohio is reflective of our values, is reflective of who we are as a people,” Bishop Tony Minor of Community Faith Assembly in Cleveland said. “It speaks to how we care about the poor, how we care about those that that are hungry. It speaks to our concern about public education. It speaks to our concern about the environment.”
He and other organizers contend lawmakers are shortchanging vital programs and cite specific amendments to bring spending in line with the support they believe ordinary Ohioans need.
“Politicians, elected officials, can stand up and say what their priorities are,” Deacon Nick Bates said in a press conference Tuesday. “But before I believe them, let me see their budget.”

Health care
Che Gadison, an organizer with the Northern Ohioans for Budget Legislation Equality, said that Gov. Mike DeWine’s push for Medicaid work requirements is misguided. She’s a single mother, and she explained Medicaid expansion helped provide health services for her sons.
“If we did not have these programs, my son would not have glasses right now,” she said. “I would not have glasses right now.”
“These programs are imperative to poor Ohioans who don’t make a livable wage,” she continued. “Now with the work requirements that they are mandating that is going to limit access to even more Ohioans out here.”
Ohio medical professionals express outrage, opposition to Medicaid work requirement proposal

She noted that previously incarcerated Ohioans often have a difficult time getting a job, and by extension, limited access to health care. In his recent State of the State address, DeWine urged employers to “give them a chance.” But at a policy level, the state is doing little to encourage hiring.
“Our health is not something to bargain with,” Gadison argued.
Food banks
The governor’s initial budget proposal dials back the funding for food banks by $7.5 million compared to the last two-year spending plan. DeWine’s office described that $7.5 million as a one-time supplement, in light of additional federal funding and heightened need from the COVID-19 pandemic.
But Joel Call, who heads up Lutheran Social Services food pantries, argued that Ohio should be going in the opposite direction. Instead of letting that one-time funding lapse, he said lawmakers should take up an amendment that restores the funding along with a substantial inflation adjustment of about $4.9 million.
“The number of individuals that we serve continues to rise year after year,” he said. “A 24% increase in unduplicated individuals two years ago, another 12% increase just last fiscal year. What was once 1.7 million meals per year is now 2.2 million meals per year.”
Ohio food banks warn over less funding in governor’s budget proposal

Food pantries like the ones Call leads are downstream of the food banks state lawmakers fund — the banks are like regional distribution centers while pantries are community-facing operations.
And with that level of personal interaction, Call had plenty of experiences he could relate. Sticking to first names, he described Ivanna, whose daughter’s medical bills make it difficult to afford housing and food.
“I think of Sam, who’s retired and takes the bus because he doesn’t want to spend money on gas to get to the pantry,” Call continued. “Or Julia, whose cancer diagnosis and treatment completely wiped out her savings and is having to start over from scratch.”
“These are regular, hardworking Americans facing challenging situations that shouldn’t be the end of their story,” he argued. “It’s our obligation as their Ohio neighbors to support them.”

Responding to skepticism
Presented with Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman and finance chair state Rep. Brian Stewart’s critiques of school lunch and food bank funding, Deacon Bates pushed back. He described a family in which one parent lost their job. Because they’re in Columbus City Schools, Bates said, the kids will still get a free breakfast and lunch.
“I’ve actually taken them to school, and they were super excited to tell me all about ‘we get free breakfast every day,’” he said.
“So, this is one of the things about making a universal program, you never know when tragedy is going to hit a family,” he said, “Just because somebody can afford (lunches) in August doesn’t mean they can afford it in October.”
One of the organizers piped up, “I would just like to add that eggs are still $6 a dozen.”
As for funding food banks, Bates argued that most Ohio families are “one broken furnace, one flat tire away, from struggling to make ends meet.” And he derided lawmakers for entertaining a $600 million loan package for a new Cleveland Browns stadium while quibbling over less than $40 million for food banks.
“That doesn’t make sense to me, if we believe we are a moral society,” he said. “We have money to give out tax cut, after tax cut, after tax cut, after tax cut, after tax cut, after tax cut — 13 in the past 20 years.”
“We can afford to do all of these things,” he added, “all of these benefits for those who already have enough — yet we are debating about whether or not we can feed a child who might go hungry?”

It was six months ago this week that Hurricane Helene devastated much of western North Carolina. By now, you’d think elected leaders would have long since devoted all of the resources at their disposal toward emergency relief and getting the basics of life in the mountains back up and running.
Unfortunately, while state lawmakers did approve a new recovery package last week, they continue — quite inexplicably — to ignore several basic and well-documented needs.
Topping the list: direct aid to businesses wiped out by the storm and renters left homeless. As lawmakers like Asheville’s Rep. Lindsey Prather have repeatedly explained, offering loans to folks who’ve lost everything isn’t enough.
If mountain communities are going to come close to recovering, the state needs to use its rainy day fund to provide direct grants.
Lawmakers should also heed Gov. Josh Stein’s plea to aid devastated local governments and state parks.
The bottom line: North Carolina has the money to do much more to help hurricane ravaged communities recover. The legislature’s failure to allocate it simply makes no sense.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for the Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original article.)With Republicans pushing a law requiring proof of citizenship to vote, new research shows that huge numbers in Ohio and elsewhere lack ready access to such documents. 
As with his GOP colleagues in other states, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose has failed to show that noncitizen voting is a significant problem in the Buckeye State. Even so, he last year started requiring naturalized citizens to show proof of citizenship when challenged at the polls.
Now national Republicans are poised to go much further. 
Next week, the U.S. House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on the Save American Voter Eligibility (or SAVE) Act. Among its provisions is a requirement that people produce proof of citizenship when they register to vote.
As in Ohio, national Republicans haven’t produced any evidence that noncitizen voting is a substantial problem. 
There are severe penalties for noncitizen voting, and they seem to be an effective deterrent. A Brennan Center for Justice study of the 2016 election found noncitizen voting occurred at the vanishingly small rate of 0.0001%.
That’s one-fifth the rate of fraud of all types that LaRose found in the 2020 election — 0.0005%. But those infinitesimal numbers haven’t stopped him from conducting massive voter purges, limiting drop boxes, and otherwise making it harder to vote.
If Republicans are successful in creating a national requirement to prove citizenship, much larger numbers of legitimate voters could be affected. The University of Maryland’s Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement this week produced an analysis using surveys conducted last year and in 2023. The analysis was conducted in partnership with the voting-rights group VoteRiders.
The analysis said that laws “such as the proposed federal SAVE Act or the numerous proof-of-citizenship bills pending in state legislatures, apply not only to new registrants but also to those already registered to vote if their citizenship status is questioned. Voters who move or wish to update their party preference would also need to re-register and be subject to the (proof-of-citizenship) requirement.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The numbers affected could be huge. 
According to the national survey that was conducted in 2023, more than 9% of voting-age citizens — 21.3 million — lacked ready access to documents that would prove their citizenship. Nearly 2% — 2.8 million — lacked any documents at all.
In Ohio, there are about 9.8 million voting age people, of whom 8.2 million are registered. 
The number of registered voters would likely take a big dip if the proof-of-citizenship bill passes. Nearly 900,000 voting-age Ohioans lack ready access to citizenship documents and nearly 200,000 lack them altogether — if the numbers found in the national survey apply here.
The researchers conducted two other surveys, in Texas and Georgia, and found that the political consequences might vary according to where you are.
“More Democrats reported lacking access to (citizenship documents) in our national survey; however, our state-level results suggest that the political impact may vary state by state,” the report said. “In our Texas survey, we found more Republicans than Democrats reported not currently having (proof of citizenship) at all or not being able to easily access (citizenship documents.) In our Georgia study, we found roughly even numbers of Democrats and Republicans were impacted.”
However, all surveys found that younger voters were less likely to have ready access to citizenship papers, and the national and Georgia surveys found that independents were less likely to have it. The Texas survey didn’t address independents.
The biggest upshot is that huge numbers would be inconvenienced or disenfranchised to address a problem that the legislation’s supporters cannot show exists. The report noted that in Georgia, an audit found just nine instances of noncitizen voting in a state with 8.2 million registered voters.
“This means that legislation like the SAVE Act that requires documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote could burden or disenfranchise nearly 85,000 Georgia citizens for every instance of non-citizen voting observed by the Secretary of State,” the report said. “This extraordinarily low rate of accuracy suggests that policy makers and the public may want to explore more accurate policy approaches that prevent these extremely rare cases of non-citizen voting rather than pursuing blanket policies that inaccurately burden or disenfranchise tens of thousands of eligible voters for every instance of non-citizen voting.”

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original article.)Ohio CBD store owners are concerned about a bill that would regulate intoxicating hemp and drinkable cannabinoid products — something that could potentially put them out of business. 
Fourteen people submitted opponent testimony and four people submitted supporter testimony for Ohio Senate Bill 86 during Tuesday’s Senate General Government Committee meeting. No supporters showed up at the meeting to testify in person. 
“Should these restrictions pass, they would eliminate 90% of the non-intoxicating full-spectrum hemp products we currently offer,” said Jaimee Courtney, owner of Bellefontaine’s Sunmed | Your CBD Store. “This would drive consumers to unregulated online markets, creating potential safety risks and diverting significant tax revenue out of Ohio.”
The bill would require intoxicating hemp products to only be sold at adult-use marijuana dispensaries instead of allowing them to be sold at CBD stores, convenience stores, smoke shops, or gas stations. 
The bill would also impose a 15% tax on intoxicating hemp products, ban sales to anyone under 21, and would only allow intoxicating hemp products to be sold at dispensaries if the products have been tested and comply with standards for packaging, labeling, and advertising. 
Ohio state Sens. Steve Huffman, R-Tipp City, and Shane Wilkin, R-Hillsboro, introduced S.B. 86. Eleven people submitted testimony in support of the bill last week — including people in the marijuana business, poison control workers, and religious organizations.
“The people walking into our stores are not looking to get high, they are looking for relief,”  said Robert McClure, owner of Centerville and Deerfield Township’s SUNMED | Your CBD Store. “Most of our customers will not go to a dispensary for a multitude of reasons.”
He said his store requires customers to be at least 21 years old to buy their products, which are all third-party tested.
“We have concerns that the language in S.B. 86 would ban most of all other types of hemp products from retail sales and driving them to an unsafe, illicit environment with no age restrictions,” said Kristin Mullins, president of the Ohio Grocers Association. 
Instead, she wants lawmakers to enforce age-restrictions, ensure product labeling and require testing procedures. 
“Bad actors exist, but responsible businesses outnumber them,” said family physician Dr. Bridget Cole Williams. “If this legislation passes, it will harm reputable businesses while failing to address real concerns. Limitation doesn’t solve the problem; it merely creates a space for an illicit market to grow.”  
Jim Higdon, co-founder of Cornbread Hemp in Kentucky, agrees with the age restrictions and regulations regarding consumer safety, but has issues with other parts of the bill. 
“The strict caps proposed by S.B. 86 would eliminate all effective hemp products for Ohioans looking for natural product supplements to support their legitimate wellness needs,” he said. 
Cornbread Hemp sells its products in more than 30 Ohio retail stores, including 10 Fresh Thyme Market locations. 
“The customers at these stores tend to be older adults with expendable incomes, not teenagers looking for a cheap, unregulated high,” Higdon said. 
The 2018 U.S. Farm Bill says hemp can be legally grown if it contains less than 0.3% THC. Ohio is one of about 20 states that does have any regulations around intoxicating hemp products, according to an Ohio State University Drug Enforcement and Policy Center study from November 2024.

Mike DeWine superimposed over a photo of the Cleveland Browns stadium in downtown Cleveland. (Photo/graphic by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine is trying to sack lawmakers’ plans to give $600 million to the Cleveland Browns by issuing bonds for the construction of their new stadium.
In a draft amendment to the state budget, the team that only won three games last season would be handed millions of taxpayer dollars.
The Browns are one step closer to getting their new $2.4 billion stadium construction project into the end zone.
“Six-hundred million of it is money that would be made available to the people who are building this thing, and then the bond payers would be paid back over 30 years,” Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman said.
In a proposal first reported by the Statehouse News Bureau and obtained by WEWS, an 18-page amendment would provide the money to the Haslam Sports Group.
To authorize that, Republicans also propose changing state law to allow lawmakers to give more money for pro-sports projects.
To help convince lawmakers they are serious, the Browns have offered $38 million upfront as collateral for the state.
“There’s enough fiscal impacts or direct tax revenues to support the investment we’re asking for,” Browns attorney Ted Tywang said during his pitch to lawmakers in early March.
The war of words between the Browns and the City of Cleveland has heated up over the last week.
But the governor is trying to block the budget amendment. He is doubling down on his plan to solve both issues. He would raise the sports betting tax for the sportsbooks, creating a fund for all professional sports teams to get money from in the future.
“It’s going to enable us to support professional teams, minor leagues, major leagues,” DeWine said Friday. “But at the same time, not take money away from education.”
Huffman has threatened to slash at least $650 million in public education spending, saying the state doesn’t have the budget for it and the millions the schools believe they were promised this General Assembly is “unsustainable.”
We’ve asked him about giving $600 million to a private sports team owned by a multi-billionaire versus fully funding schools.
Because Huffman filibustered the first time we asked the question, we asked again.
“Well, I don’t think there is $600 million right now for a stadium, but if what you’re asking me is if you’re trying to compare those two things, they’re not comparable,” Huffman said.
We asked for clarification from his team after Huffman said there isn’t $600 million right now. They explained that he meant the state would be borrowing the millions. That’s true, but the state would still need to pay that money back — with interest.
DeWine said that they are directly comparable, and he is worried that more requests could come in soon. The Cincinnati Bengals are working on a $1.25 billion stadium renovation as their lease expires next year.
“We can’t really afford to continue to put money in sports stadiums out of a general fund,” DeWine said Monday. “There’s not enough money there.”
He emphasized the point that the state would be taking money away from education, kids, and mental health services.
We asked if Ohio should be giving taxpayer dollars to billionaires. The governor said that under both GOP and Democratic leadership, Ohio has always contributed some money to professional sports.
“My guess is that that will continue,” he said. “The question is, do you take that from the taxpayers or do you take it from the people who run the gambling operations in the state of Ohio? It seems to me we ought to take it from them.”
When it comes to the financial impact this would leave, he emphasized that by the end of this process, it would be “about a billion dollars of tax dollars directly out of the general fund.”
On Friday, we asked DeWine if he would veto the provision if it made its way into the budget.
“Well, I’m hoping that they’re not gonna do that,” the governor replied.
Lawmakers are set to debate the plan over the coming weeks.

Speeding or looking down at your phone — even for one second — can be deadly. &#8220;The eyes are everything when it comes to driving,&#8221; DriveTeam instructor Thurston Voisine [&#8230;]","A traffic camera. Getty Images.Ohio lawmakers are trying to prevent road worker deaths and injuries by requiring a driving safety course if you speed or crash in a construction zone.
Speeding or looking down at your phone — even for one second — can be deadly.
“The eyes are everything when it comes to driving,” DriveTeam instructor Thurston Voisine said.
We’re just three months into 2025, and already, about 150 people have died in car crashes in Ohio. And state data shows that deaths in work zones increased by nearly 150% from 2023 to 2024. The number jumped from nine to 22.
The Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) reported that nearly 1.3 million work zone crashes have taken place since 2020 — with more than 8,000 injuries and 101 deaths, with the majority being ODOT or contract workers. Already in 2025, there have been 380 crashes and two deaths due to work zone incidents.
“A lot of times, people are looking at what [ODOT workers, police, tow trucks] are doing, so their car starts to drift over,” Voisine said.
But a new bill in the House aims to save lives.
State Reps. Gary Click, R-Sandusky, and Mark Johnson, R-Chillicothe, introduced H.B. 82, increasing penalties for traffic violations in work zones.
“What this bill really focuses on, more than anything else, is education because people just breeze by these construction zones,” Click said.
If you speed or cause a crash, not only will you face existing driving penalties, but you will also need to complete a driving safety course. If you don’t complete it, you’ll be fined $400.
A second offense within five years would mean additional driving training and possibly a 90-day license suspension. If you don’t do it, you will also be charged another $400.
A third or more time offending within five years would mean even more training and a possible year-long suspension. As expected, the $400 fine would be added.
“While we cannot eliminate risk, we can reduce it,” Johnson said. “We cannot prevent every accident, but we can lower the numbers through incentives and education.”
The bill would also allow ODOT to install video cameras to monitor construction zones.
“Hopefully, you just put something in your mind where you begin to think and realize somebody’s life is at stake,” Click added.
This bill is a compromise from the last General Assembly’s H.B. 429.
While the former bill had thousands of dollars in additional fines, this one focuses on teaching how to drive.
However, state Rep. Juanita Brent, D-Cleveland, questioned the sponsors, asking why this was needed since the state already has safety regulations.
“The only thing difference from what I’m seeing in our Ohio Revised Code is that we’re adding on cameras,” Brent said. “And then where’s the money at going to go to pay for these cameras?”
Click said ODOT and contractors would. These cameras could be used for investigations, but they wouldn’t be used for speeding tickets.
“Respectfully, representative, I hate those,” state Rep. Cindy Abrams, R-Harrison, said, to laughter. “If that was in this bill — we can stop it right here.”
Education at any age is important, Voisine said, and he supports mandatory driving training.
“Even with me being a driving instructor for 18 years, I’m still learning and I still train myself on my skills and make sure I’m better,” he said.
The bill will continue to be heard in the coming months.

(Library of Congress)Extremists in our Statehouse and in Washington, D.C., have busied themselves with rolling back decades of civil rights gains.
In Topeka, they quashed legally cast ballots by eliminating the three-day grace period and admitting that if they’d had their druthers, they’d eliminate all early voting.
In the nation’s capital, extremists have attacked Navajo “code talkers,” the Pima Indian soldier who took part of the iconic photo of American forces planting a flag on Iwo Jima, and baseball barrier-breaker Jackie Robinson.
The president’s administration has lifted a ban on segregated facilities for federal contractors and has deleted more than 90 links to Congressional Medal of Honor winners of color. It feels so very bleak.
But as ugly as this seems, it also means the charade of societal equality for people of color is mercifully over. It is now clear that a majority of Americans either harbor racial biases or don’t consider them serious enough to actively oppose. The question is settled. We can stop pretending. These most recent actions demonstrate that the racism they claim does not exist, really does.
These developments upend more than 50 years of denials about our racial caste system.
Back in 1968, President Johnson’s Kerner Commission wrote this in a groundbreaking report: “White society is deeply implicated in the ghetto. White institutions created it, white institutions maintain it, and white society condones it.”
A carefully orchestrated counter-campaign of deny, delay and deflect followed.
We caught glimpses of it in Lee Atwater’s infamous 1981 interview about Nixon’s “Southern Strategy,” the plan by which Presidents Nixon and Regan converted Dixie Democrats.
“You start out in 1954 by saying, ‘N*****, n*****, n*****. By 1968 you can’t say ‘n*****’ — that hurts you, backfires. So, you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states’ rights, and all that stuff, and you’re getting so abstract. Now, you’re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you’re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, Blacks get hurt worse than whites. … ‘We want to cut this,’ is much more abstract than even the busing thing, uh, and a hell of a lot more abstract than ‘N*****N, n*****.’ ”
A common strategy from these extremists is attacking their opponent’s greatest strength, and in this case, it’s the hundreds of years of history demonstrating that the nation’s founders used race as one of its organizing principles. It is a tacit admission of what that side fears most — truth.
This remains manifestly true, but the current administration continues the ruse.
“We have ended the tyranny of so-called diversity, equity and inclusion policies all across the entire federal government and, indeed, the private sector and our military,” the president said during his recent speech to the joint session of Congress. “And our country will be woke no longer.”
So, the victims of hundreds of years of tyranny are the tyrants?
Black median household wealth stood at $24,100 in 2019. White median household wealth stood at $188,200. Black unemployment has remained roughly twice that of the white unemployment and expectedly, Black people remain disproportionately impoverished.
Diversity policies represent mere remedies for historic inequality. Ending them assumes the society has achieved social equality. This is ending the remedy without addressing the central issue of inequality. It leaves the unfair system untouched so that those who’ve always had an advantage maintain their edge and punishes those already behind.
How can 60 years of half-hearted equality efforts address 335 years of enslavement and segregation? They can’t. That span lasted from 1619 to 1954. Racists killed Emmett Till the following year. The Montgomery Bus Boycott also began in 1955.
This is like debating climate change. We know it exists, but powerful voices need it not to, so this odd dance around the truth continues.
Wrote Ta-Nehisi Coates in his latest book, “The Message,” “Some people’s credits earned them more, and their mistakes cost them less. And those people who took more and paid less lived in a world of iniquitous wealth, while his own people lived in a world of terrifying want.”
A cruel pettiness remains a part of this dance.
In the past, towns passed laws saying Black people couldn’t play chess or checkers with white people or that Black drivers couldn’t pass white drivers in traffic or use the same pay phones. Today, it is Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth threatening to drum Black people out of the military because of razor bumps or pseudofoliculitis. 
The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. came to this sad realization near the end of his life after years of fighting for equality. King said he’d taken many white people at their word that they wanted to end discrimination.
“White America is not even psychologically organized to close the gap,” King said in his last book, “Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community?” “Essentially, it seeks to only to make it less painful, less obvious, but in most respects, to maintain it.”
When I led the Kansas African American Museum, we received the donation of a Ku Klux Klan robe and mask (more than once), found by family members of a deceased patriarch. The family would not fill out the provenance documents. They didn’t want any lasting connection to their horrifying finds.
We eventually put the robes on a mannequin for an exhibition on racial terror. A guest, there for other business, left shaken by the display. I decided to never put it out again.
The guest said that as a boy in Mississippi, his father left him in the car to run a quick errand as Klansmen gathered nearby. His father gave him a haunting command.
“Don’t look them in the eye.”
By staring too long, they may think you know them and then, they start reaching for torches and rifles.
This represented the real power of the so-called “invisible empire.” With faces hidden, people never knew if the judge, or the policeman, or their doctor held membership in the Klan. This is how racism has operated, under sheets of denial.
But now that the pretense that racism doesn’t exist has dropped, we absolutely must look these people and practices in the eye. The nation has an opportunity to vomit up all the bilious myths and stereotypes that continue to threaten our stability as a nation.
We no longer have to pretend. This is no longer a theory. It’s out in the open now. We don’t have to hide.
And there’s an incredible blessing in all of this — if we face it.

The 2026 elections offer Ohio Democrats a great chance to show that they can win statewide and change the political narrative in the Buckeye State.
First, the major executive offices of the state such as governor, attorney general, and secretary of state are open races. In the absence of an incumbent, elections become more competitive, so Democrats have a unique opportunity to compete for these offices without the headwinds produced by someone who is already doing the job seeking reelection.
Second, Donald Trump will not be on the ballot. Trump has carried Ohio all three times he has run for president, most recently carrying the state by 11% in 2024. His endorsements still matter a lot in the Buckeye State, but his not being on the ballot could be enough to keep some soft Republican supporters home. Successful presidential candidates bring with them the coattail effect, where their candidacy helps the members of the party down the ballot. Though the widespread coattail effect of Trump is debatable, Republicans have done particularly well in Ohio when Trump is on the ballot. For example, Republican challenger Jim Renacci lost to incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown in the 2018 midterm election during Trump’s first term, but Republican challenger Bernie Moreno defeated Brown in the race for the Senate seat in 2024.
Third, the party that controls the presidency usually performs poorly in midterm elections. There have been few exceptions to this rule in the past 100 years. In 2018, the Republican Party lost 40 seats in the House. It is reasonable to expect that Republicans will underperform in 2026 compared with 2024. While the surge/decline theory usually is considered in the context of Congressional elections, it has also been considered with regard to state elections.
Some new polling from the Bowling Green State University Democracy and Public Policy Research Network sheds light on the attitudes of Ohio registered voters, and there may be some good news for Democrats.
The survey of 800 Ohio registered voters was conducted by YouGov and is weighted to the 2024 election results. Therefore, for example, the respondents report voting for Trump over Harris 54% to 44% and Moreno over Brown by 50% to 48%.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
What does the data tell us?
First, Gov. Mike DeWine is not particularly popular. Only 42% somewhat or strongly approve of the job he is doing as governor. Contrast that with the 50% who approve of the job Donald Trump is doing as president.
Next, some of the likely Democratic and Republican candidates are not very well known.  For example, 57% of Ohio voters have neither an unfavorable nor favorable opinion of Democratic gubernatorial candidate Amy Acton, while 54% feel the same way about Republican candidate Dave Yost. Only 28% are neutral toward Republican candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, but 36% are favorable and 35% unfavorable. 
Large numbers of voters not having opinions about candidates gives candidates the opportunity to define themselves positively and their opponents negatively, if they can raise the money to do so.
Even in the race for U.S. Senate, where the appointed incumbent Jon Husted is expected to run, the race could be competitive. Husted is ahead in a matchup with Sherrod Brown 47% to 41%, and would also lead Tim Ryan 45% to 38%. These are not insurmountable leads. The road to controlling the U.S. Senate may well run through Ohio in 2026.
It should be noted that all of these numbers are based on a highly Republican, pro-Trump sample (49% plan to vote in the Republican primary in 2026, while only 39% plan to vote in the Democratic primary).  
There is no guarantee that the 2026 electorate will match the 2024 electorate, and the Democratic Party will work hard to make sure it does not, by generating enthusiasm and turnout among their partisans.  
Enthusiasm is usually higher among the party that lost the previous presidential election in–part because voters are motivated to vote against a party rather than align themselves and enthusiastically support their party.
Even if Ohio’s days as a swing state in presidential elections are over, that does not mean that elections for U.S. Senate and state executive officers cannot be competitive. Democrats are definitely in a hole in Ohio, but the conditions are there for them to get themselves out.

Health insurance companies are under increasing scrutiny for allegedly using artificial intelligence bots and algorithms to swiftly deny patients routine or lifesaving care — without a human actually reviewing their claims.
The high-profile killing late last year of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has focused even more attention on so-called prior authorization, the process by which patients and doctors must ask health insurers to approve medical procedures or drugs before proceeding. There had been protests and outrage over the company’s practices for months before Thompson’s death, and UnitedHealthcare has been accused in a class-action lawsuit of using AI to wrongfully deny claims.
As more patients and doctors voice their frustrations, states are responding with legislation designed to regulate prior authorization and claims reviews. So far this year, lawmakers in more than a dozen states are considering measures that would, for example, limit the use of AI in reviewing claims; exclude certain prescription medications from prior authorization rules; ensure that emergency mental health care is not delayed for more than 48 hours; and require that insurers’ review boards include licensed physicians, dentists or pharmacists with clinical experience.
Insurers have long required doctors to obtain their approval before they’ll pay for certain drugs, treatments and procedures. They argue it is necessary to rein in health care costs and limit unnecessary services. But many doctors and patients say the practice has gotten out of hand, causing delays and denials of care that are harming and even killing people.
In a survey last year by the American Medical Association, 93% of doctors said that insurers’ prior authorization practices delayed “necessary care” for their patients. Twenty-nine percent said such delays had led to a “serious adverse event,” such as hospitalization, permanent injury or death.
In 2023, insurers selling plans on the marketplaces created under the Affordable Care Act denied a combined average of 20% of all claims. Of the 73 million in-network claims they denied, only 1% were appealed, according to KFF, a health policy research group.
 The federal role

Under the Biden administration, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice took a firmer hand against health care corporations alleged to be engaging in behavior resulting in limited and more expensive care for patients. The administration also approved rules requiring that beginning in 2026, Medicare and Medicaid plans create a streamlined electronic process for reviewing claims, making decisions more quickly and providing specific reasons for denying care.
States want to make it harder for health insurers to deny care, but firms might evade enforcement

But it’s difficult to hold insurers accountable, according to Timothy McBride, a health policy analyst and co-director of a program at the Institute for Public Health at Washington University in St. Louis.
“Each part of the health care industry — hospitals, pharmaceuticals, insurers — they all have a lot of concentrated power,” McBride said in a phone interview. “And unless somebody actually takes it on directly, it’s going to stay that way. I think the Biden administration tried to take it on, but didn’t make a lot of progress.”
It’s unclear whether the Trump administration and Congress will reverse course. During his confirmation hearing on March 14, Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, defended the use of artificial intelligence in reviewing claims.
“AI can be used for good or for evil, and it to a large extent depends on who’s using it and for what purpose,” Oz told members of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee. “I think AI could play a vital role in accelerating preauthorization.”
In the past, Trump has supported measures to help patients, such as increasing hospital price transparency and lowering prescription drug prices, McBride noted. But “Republicans and conservatives generally are anti-regulation,” he said. “My gut feeling would be that they back off on the Biden push on this.”
States have limited power to act on their own. They have authority only over state-regulated health plans, which include Medicaid, plans for state workers and policies residents purchase from the ACA marketplaces. About 90 million people are covered that way. State laws do not apply to the 156 million workers, retirees and dependents who get their coverage through employer-sponsored health plans, which are regulated through a federal law known as ERISA.
Furthermore, health insurance companies are large and have deep pockets, allowing them to easily absorb state fines.
But Kaye Pestaina, the director of the program on patient and consumer protection at KFF, said states have an important role to play.
“Much of the focus around prior authorization at the federal level has kind of originated from state protections, so I imagine there will be continual activity by state legislatures to come at the problem,” Pestaina told Stateline.
 What states are doing

Pestaina said states are trying a number of solutions. For example, states such as Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania have given their insurance regulators more authority to directly access claims denial information, in order to overturn decisions or potentially enforce state rules. And these efforts have largely had bipartisan support.










There is a role for some oversight to make sure that things are covered. But right now, I think the system is out of balance.


– North Carolina Republican state Rep. Timothy Reeder


In Pennsylvania, Republican state Sen. Kristin Phillips-Hill pushed through bipartisan legislation in 2022 to streamline prior authorization practices for state-regulated health plans after hearing numerous complaints from patients and doctors.
The legislation created an Independent External Review organization that allows Pennsylvanians to submit an online form to request a review if their insurer denies a service or treatment. If the review organization decides the service should be covered, the insurer must do so. Before then, patients could turn only to a federal review process, which may have been more challenging to navigate and taken more time.
“Our reforms created clear rules, clear timelines for the prior authorization process, and it removed ambiguity or uncertainty from the system that at times, insurers could exploit and providers could be confused over,” Phillips-Hill told Stateline. “Prior to that reform, if you had a denial from your insurer, you had very little recourse.”
The program began in January 2024, and in its first year the Pennsylvania Insurance Department overturned half of 517 denials, which amounted to claims from 259 people.
Jonathan Greer, president and CEO of the Insurance Federation of Pennsylvania, said his trade group worked with lawmakers to come to an agreement on how to change the prior authorization process in a way that worked for insurers and patient advocates. Greer says he thinks Pennsylvania could be a model for other states.
“Prior authorization, I think unfairly, has been characterized as a reason to say ‘no’ by insurers,” Greer said. “The purpose of prior authorization is to make sure that you know the care that you get is consistent with the care that you need.”

In North Carolina, Republican state Rep. Timothy Reeder is hopeful that his prior authorization bill will make it across the finish line this year. Reeder’s bill would set tight deadlines on insurers’ claim decisions and require companies to have licensed practitioners on their claim review boards. Insurers would also have to publicize a list of services they require authorization for.
“I’m not saying that we need to get rid of it completely,” Reeder told Stateline. “There is a role for some oversight to make sure that things are covered. But right now, I think the system is out of balance.”
But some state laws have proven to be less effective than advertised.
In 2021, Texas enacted a first-of-its-kind law creating a “gold card” standard, under which physicians whose care recommendations are approved by insurers at least 90% of the time are exempt from the prior authorization process. But as of the end of 2023, only 3% of Texas physicians had earned gold card status, according to the Texas Medical Association.
That’s why the group is pushing legislation that would require insurers to report which preauthorization exemptions they granted and denied and how many claims went to independent review. Dr. Zeke Silva of the Texas Medical Association’s legislative council said it would be “in the same spirit” as what Pennsylvania has done.
“Our focus with the [Texas Medical Association] is our physicians being able to provide the best care possible. And we want that to be free of burden,” Silva told Stateline. “We want to minimize third parties coming in and inappropriately denying care that our physicians and our patients think is in their best interest.”

Bryan Simonaire (R-Anne Arundel) announced Tuesday that he will not seek reelection next year, after fiver terms in office. Del. Nicholaus Kipke (R-Anne Arundel) has already filed for the seat. (File photo by Bryan P. Sears)A five-time elected Republican state senator is calling it a career at the end of his current term.
Sen. Bryan W. Simonaire (R-Anne Arundel) announced in an email Tuesday morning that he would not run for reelection in 2026.
“It’s time for the next chapter in my life and I cherish the opportunity to spend more time with my growing family,” Simonaire said in a statement.
Simonaire, 61, was the first Republican elected to the Senate from District 31. He succeeded Sen. Phil Jimeno, a Democrat who retired after 22 years in the Senate.
Simonaire said he plans to finish his current term, which includes two more weeks of the 2025 session. His term ends in 2026.
“Therefore, the final farewells will have to wait awhile,” Simonaire said in his statement. “Given the political ripple effect on the Senate and other seats in my district, I thought it was the right thing to make my intentions public now.”
The ripples have already started: Del. Nicholaus R. Kipke (R-Anne Arundel) filed on Monday for the Republican primary for the Senate seat in the district. Kipke, 46, was elected to the House of Delegates the same year Simonaire joined the Senate. He filed his candidacy the day before the senator announced his intent to retire.
Former Senate aide pleads guilty
A former Maryland Senate aide pleaded guilty Tuesday to a felony theft scheme for diverting $20,000 in senatorial scholarships that she never applied for to pay her own school bills, the Office of State Prosecutor announced.
Esther Dikongue was an aide to Sen. William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery) from fall 2019 through March 2023, during which time she had access to the senator’s legislative email  account and was assigned to work with the committee that disbursed the scholarships that all senators have to award.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Those scholarships typically go to constituents who attend a college in Maryland, or who are attending a college out of state for a course of study not offered in Maryland. Each senator gets about $50,000 a year to award as they see fit, with awards typically renewed annually by the Maryland Higher Education Commission until the student graduates.
Smith’s office had a formal application to the committee, which selected recipients. Awards ranged from $500 to $5,000, with the upper amount being awarded “only under rare circumstances,” according to court documents.
Prosecutors said that in July 2022, Dikongue used Smith’s email to tell MHEC that she had been awarded a $10,000 scholarship to study at American University in Washington, D.C., even though she never actually applied for the award and was not chosen by the senator or the committee. An MHEC worker questioned the size of the award, but Dikongue insisted that $10,000 was the correct amount and had the money sent to American University, where she was enrolled in the Ethics, Peace and Human Rights master’s program.
In May 2024, after she left the Senate office, Dikongue again used the office email to falsely obtain a second $10,000 scholarship, the prosecutor’s office said.
Dikongue pleaded guilty Tuesday before Anne Arundel Circuit Judge Stacy McCormack. Sentencing has been set for July 16.
“It is unacceptable to misappropriate funds that are reserved to help Maryland students attend universities,” said Maryland State Prosecutor Charlton Howard III. “Our office will continue to work to ensure Maryland taxpayer dollars are being used as intended.”
New school board member
The Senate voted Tuesday morning to officially confirm Alverne “Chet” Chesterfield to the state Board of Education.
The 33-13 vote along party lines came after Sen. Mary Beth Carozza (R-Lower Shore) asked for the Senate to vote separately on “Nominee No. 14” — Chesterfield — from among those other nominees listed on an Executive Nominations report.
Gov. Wes Moore (D) had submitted Chesterfield’s name to serve on the board.
“I believe the nominees and board members should be held to a standard greater than sufficient when you factor in the impact of the State Board of Education on our children and their future,” Carozza, who voted against  Chesterfield, said in prepared remarks. “Questions and concerns were raised by well-respected education leaders about the nominee’s background and qualifications that prevent me from voting to confirm this nominee to serve on the Maryland State Board of Education.”

Sen. Charles Sydnor III (D-Baltimore County) said Chesterfield received 37 pages of letters of support. Sydnor, who voted in favor of the appointment, read one of the letters on the Senate floor Tuesday that mentioned the person working with Chesterfield at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore for more than 30 years.
“The tireless services he provided at the university and now, while working with other educational related establishments, support his commitment to education and excellence,” Sydnor said. “I think he’ll do a great job on this board.”
Chesterfield recently served as a member of the Somerset County Board of Education and worked as a substitute teacher in that school system.
A state Department of Education spokesperson said in an email Tuesday afternoon Chesterfield was appointed in December during the interim as a recess appointment and began to attend meetings in January.
Chesterfield, whose four-year term runs through 2028, replaced former board member Susan Getty.
These are a few of our favorite things…
What did you do to mark Maryland Day? You know, to recognize March 25, 1634, when the first English settlers celebrated their safe arrival in St. Mary’s County, four months after leaving England.
Yeah, we didn’t either.
But the folks at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Institute of Politics have more state spirit than we do, apparently, and decided to mark the day by polling Marylanders on what they like best about the state.
Almost one in four people, 24%, said their favorite part of the state’s “natural beauty, climate and weather” as their favorite things about the state, with “geography and geographic diversity” in third place, at 15%. The geography fans echoed the old America in Miniature label for the state, with one noting to pollsters that residents can “enjoy a diversity of activities and environments, from enjoying the ocean in Ocean City to fishing in the Chesapeake to hunting in central Maryland, and skiing at Wisp.”
In second place, at 17%, was “people and communities,” with respondents citing both the diversity and the friendliness of the people. Crabs and Natty Boh were not — strictly speaking — at the top of the list, but the 14% who cited “food and culinary experiences” name-checked crabcakes, crabs and Old Bay.
Bottom of the list, maybe not surprisingly, were government and politics, at 3%, and economy and job opportunities, at 2%.
Institute of Politics Director Mileah Kromer said the polls shows “there are many things to love about Maryland. Like many other Marylanders, I’m glad to live in a state that offers a little bit of everything, truly embodying America in miniature moniker.”
The survey of 803 Maryland adults took place from Feb. 11-15, by phone and internet. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5%.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DSC_0062-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

Ford/Maryland Matters)The state’s sweeping education reform bill took another painstaking step forward Tuesday, when a second Senate committee give it preliminary OK and rejected a separate House version.
But the 6-2 vote by the Senate Education, Energy and the Environment Committee merely sends the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act back to the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee, which needs to agree to the latest changes before sending the bill to the full Senate.
From there, the bill has to go back to the House, which will likely reject the Senate plan before convening a conference committee to iron out the differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill. All with less than two weeks left in the legislative session.
Besides approving Senate Bill 429 Tuesday, the committee also known as Triple-E voted to make the House version conform to the Senate version, rejecting several cuts on collaborative time and per pupil funding first proposed by Gov. Wes Moore (D).
Sen. Mary Washington (D-Baltimore City) abstained because “there’s still more to work do on such an important bill,” she said after the committee meeting that lasted more than two hours.
One major difference the committee approved versus the House version deals with community schools, those schools where at least 75% of the students are eligible for free and reduced-price meals. According to the state Department of Education, about half of the state’s schools have that community school designation.
The committee agreed with the governor’s proposal to require that all 24 school systems develop countywide Blueprint implementation plans focused strictly on community schools.
The House struck that proposal, noting that local school officials already have to submit plans to the state Department of Education and the Accountability and Implementation Board, as part of the overall Blueprint for Maryland’s Future 10-year reform plan. The board began to approve updated Blueprint plans in October.
Tuesday’s discussion became a bit animated when it came to instructional coaches.
State Department of Education officials said the state currently has 803 instructional coaches, experienced educators who help administrators, teachers and other “education professionals” learn how to prepare lesson plans, assess student data and other duties.
The goal is to hire up to 200 additional coaches in a four-year period.
Elise Brown, assistant state superintendent for instructional programs and services, said about 63% of the current coaches work in only five school systems.
“We do not see an equal distribution,” she said.
Alex Reese, chief of staff at the department who attended the meeting to represent State Superintendent Carey Wright, said the average ratio of teachers to coaches is 79 to 1. Reese said three school systems – one in Western Maryland, one on the Eastern Shore and another in Southern Maryland – have no instructional coaches.
“Best practice would be for a coach to coach a maximum of 12 teachers,” he said.
Sen. Katie Fry Hester (D-Howard and Montgomery) asked what’s the annual salary for an instructional coach. Reese said the base salary is about $125,000.
Although Fry Hester supports instructional coaches, she said some of that money to seek coaches could be used to hire additional personnel in cybersecurity and other technology for schools.
“We have one person in the entire state of Maryland, at the state level, looking out for cybersecurity for the local schools,” said Fry Hester. But she agreed to withhold an amendment to add additional personnel toward cyber security after committee chair Sen. Brian Feldman (D-Montgomery) said more information was needed.
“We’re immediately going to lose 200 teachers,” Fry Hester said. “We’re already short on teachers.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Senate-Education-Energy-and-the-Environment-Committee-3-25-2025-1024x743.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

Don Bacon, R-Neb., arrives for a House Republican members meeting at the U.S. Capitol on Oct. 19, 2023, in Washington, D.C. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)LINCOLN — U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., reassured his constituents Tuesday that Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency and the House GOP budget are not threats to the stability of the social programs they rely on or the federal agencies that provide benefits like Social Security and Medicaid.
Bacon also said he and a bipartisan group of House lawmakers are prepared to push back against Trump administration efforts to privatize key government functions such as the U.S. Postal Service. He said he would press DOGE and the administration to be more thoughtful in cutting government spending. 
Bacon, a retired Air Force brigadier general, also called on President Donald Trump and his national security team to take accountability for accidentally sharing war plans with a journalist using a consumer-grade cell phone app, Signal.
Tele-town hall
Unlike previous years when Bacon held in-person town halls, the Omaha-area congressman held a Tuesday evening tele-town hall for more than 17,000 people. His choice received criticism from Nebraska Democrats, but Bacon’s team has said he made the format change because of “large interest.” 
National leaders advised House Republicans to avoid in-person town halls after several meetings saw public protests and angry constituents. Democrats have argued Bacon feared facing the people he represents.
Multiple Democratic-aligned groups have again targeted Bacon’s seat, seeing Nebraska’s most competitive congressional district as a potential flip for the midterms. Bacon represents the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District, one of the few remaining swing districts nationally.
Bacon stepped into the national spotlight as one of the few House Republicans willing to criticize the Trump administration over DOGE, its handling of Ukraine and its relationships with allies, including Europe and Canada. Bacon continued that trend this week by commenting on the administration’s latest controversy.
Signal controversy
On Monday, The Atlantic published a story in which its editor-in-chief was added to a Signal group chat by National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, where Waltz and other administration officials, including Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, discussed specifics about pending military strikes in Yemen. 
Bacon told his constituents that those involved should admit they made an error.
“Thus far, they have not,” Bacon said. “I want people to take responsibility for their actions. Blaming the reporter. Blaming [the] Atlantic is not taking responsibility,” 
U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts also weighed in on the Signal controversy late Tuesday, telling the Examiner in a statement that the leak was “terrible.” 
“Someone needs to stand up and be accountable,” Ricketts said. “There needs to be a thorough review of what happened, and it must not happen again.” 
Bacon told reporters after the town hall that he would keep his “mind open” on the kind of accountability Hegseth should face. He didn’t rule out asking for Hegseth to be fired after a reporter asked if House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries’ calls for Trump to fire Hegseth would be an “appropriate amount of accountability.”
Waltz said he’s takes “full responsibility” for the controversy on Fox News Tuesday. 
Less viral than some
While Bacon’s tele-town hall didn’t go as viral as others, including U.S. Rep. Mike Flood’s recent town hall in Columbus, he faced similar questions from constituents about potential cuts to Medicaid and social programs. 
All three Nebraska House Republicans voted yes for the proposed GOP budget that would expand the 2017 Trump tax cuts and cut $2 trillion in spending. A non-partisan federal budget office said earlier this month that cuts at that scale can’t happen without cutting Medicare or Medicaid. 
Bacon and others claim other cuts can be found that avoid Medicaid and other social programs. Most have not specified what they would cut. 
Bacon said House Republicans are looking to tweak Medicaid, including adding work requirements for “able-bodied adults that do not have children,” and job training because “the goal is to get people on actual insurance.” He added that Republicans want to do annual audits of Medicaid, because he said the government hasn’t been allowed to regularly audit the program for five years. 
“We probably have folks who do not qualify for Medicaid,” Bacon said. “I believe in the end, we’ll do smart changes to Medicaid, but we’re going to preserve it,” 
Another issue raised during the town hall was the Trump administration’s approach to cutting government costs with DOGE. Constituents raised concerns about how the agency looks for “fraud” in the federal government, including pausing certain federal grants and firing thousands of federal workers. 
Of DOGE, the congressman said, “We need to think carefully before we fire somebody.”
Weather balloons
Those cuts reached home when the National Weather Service office for the Omaha area, and other Great Plains offices recently announced pausing the deployment of weather balloons after the Trump administration cut 1,000 jobs at the national agency that monitors local weather early this month. 
Weather balloons are a key tool in forecasting, which constituents called essential for Nebraska during tornado season and other extreme weather, such as last week’s blizzard. Meteorologists have said that forecasts could be less accurate without them. 
Bacon said he would “press the White House” to restore the National Weather Service office’s ability to deploy weather balloons. He told the Examiner he plans to get other representatives affected by cuts to the Weather Service to write a letter to the White House.
“So I’m not going to lie to you, I’ve been focused on Ukraine, Russia, NATO, Canada, Greenland and tariffs, but this needs to be dealt with,” Bacon said.

Sears/Maryland Matters)The Maryland House of Delegates could give its final approval Wednesday to a fiscal 2026 spending plan that includes more than $1 billion in new taxes.
House Democrats and Republicans engaged in a sometimes testy, nearly seven hour debate of a two-bill package. Republicans, who make up less than 30% of the 141-member House, offered up 20 proposed amendments on those two bills.
House Appropriations Chair Ben Barnes (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) said Republican amendments would make cuts to education in some counties, aid to poor children, and students with disabilities.
“So yeah, you know what? This is a difference in values. We disagree,” Barnes said. “And it’s nice that we can finally have a real conversation about our difference in values, because we would rather tax millionaires a little more so that students with disabilities can get the services they need; because we would rather take a little cut to tourism rather than a cut to every kid in this state or families who need Medicaid.
“So look, we can argue this all day,” he said. “We have a difference in values. The paper says what it says. We disagree. We chart a different path.”
The issue of values became one of a number of running themes.
  House Minority Leader Jason C. Buckel (R-Allegany) and Minority Leader Jesse T. Pippy (R-Frederick). (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)
House Minority Whip Jesse T. Pippy (R-Frederick) proposed an amendment to cut a 1% cost of living increase for state employees. The money would instead be pushed to services at the Developmental Disabilities Administration.
“Let’s talk about values. These are the minority party values,” Pippy said. “We value our most vulnerable over state employees getting another raise because, quite frankly, they’ve had a 36% increase in salary and benefits for the last few years.”
Maryland’s $67 billion budget — a figure that includes all spending including general and federal funds and higher education — is one-tenth of a percent higher than the current year.
The $27 billion general fund budget, which encompasses state revenue from sources including income and sales taxes, is $414 million less than the current year.
The plan also solves a projected $3 billion deficit for the coming year. The solution involves more than $2 billion in what Gov. Wes Moore (D) and legislative Democrats have called cuts.
The plan also includes more than $1 billion in taxes including a proposed $500 million services sales tax on data and IT services. That tax has already caused one business owner, who is also the vice chair of a House Committee, to move his business from Southern Maryland to Virginia.
Another $367 million would come from a 2% surcharge on capital gains income over $350,000. The rate is double what Moore proposed in his budget. Most of the tax would land in the state’s general fund, with about 40% earmarked for the state’s Transportation Trust Fund.
The state would also raise $344 million from changes in the tax code, including the creation of two new tax brackets: Those earning $500,000 to $1 million would pay 6.25%; those above $1 million in earnings would pay a rate of 6.5%.
Democratic lawmakers and Moore claim 94% of Marylanders will either see a decrease or no change in their taxes.
  Del. Emily Shetty (D-Montgomery). (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)
“This plan does not increase taxes for 94% of Marylanders,” said Del. Emily Shetty (D-Montgomery). “Ninety-four percent of Marylanders will not see their taxes go up. They’ll either see no change, or they’ll see a decrease.”
Del. Mark N. Fisher (R-St. Mary’s) called the claim “silly.”
“No one believes that, because it’s not true,” Fisher said. “And the 6% that you say that you’re taking from are the 6% that have the most ability to leave. And you know what I would say to them, maybe you should leave and stick it once and for all to the majority party and show them that all wealth isn’t created by government. It’s created by the private sector.”
House Minority Leader Del. Jason C. Buckel (R-Allegany) said the average tax decrease will range between $53 and $61.
The amount is lower than the $173 average cut that was part of the tax changes proposed by Moore in January.
That “$5 per month,” Buckel said, would be gobbled up by other fees imposed by the state, such as a 6% sales tax on vending machine purchases.
“Guess what happened to your income tax cut? Gone. Gone. You just ate it up in what you paid additional to the vending machine.,” Buckel said.  “If you buy a car that year — gone. We’re raising the excise tax. Your tax cut you’re getting, somebody that makes $70, $80, $90, $100,000 a year. That 53 bucks a year, you’re getting, go out and buy a new car that year. Your income tax cut is gone that year, and the next year, and the next year, and the next year. You just pay more money. Gone.”
As the hours dragged on, the debate boiled over.
During one tense exchange, House Republicans openly criticized Democrats, including House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County), whom they perceived was rushing through debate and stifling the voices of the minority party.

Republicans claimed Jones ignored minority party delegates who wished to speak. They also complained that House Majority Whip Del. Jazz Lewis (D-Prince George’s County) used a procedural rule to curtail debate.
In one such instance, Del. Robin L. Grammer Jr. (R-Baltimore County) proposed language that would require an annual report from the Department of Transportation updating the status of bridge vulnerability assessments.
But Democrats shot down the proposal saying that the amendment was drafted improperly and adding that lawmakers were working on a separate amendment that would be added to the budget later in the process.
But as Grammer and Republicans attempted to press their case, Lewis moved to end the debate and force a vote. That led to a tense exchange between Republicans and Democrats including Jones.
“For some of you, maybe the majority party, it’s a routine day,” Pippy said. “Respectfully for us, this means something.
“And so if we want to get up and have an opportunity to explain our vote, or we want to get up and make an argument, that’s what we’re here for. So I don’t want our members to feel like we’re getting shut down,” he said.
Others were more blunt.
  Del. Lauren Arikan (R-Harford) criticized House Democrats for marginalizing Republican voices during a budget debate Tuesday. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)
“We chose you as our speaker several years ago, and since that time, many of us have stood up. You have refused to call on us. You have seen us standing. You have skipped over us,” said Del. Lauren Arikan (R-Harford).
“We consistently try to make our voices heard in a state that marginalizes us and ignores us constantly, in a chamber that has been gerrymandered madly to continue to marginalize us,” she said. “You don’t have to listen to us speak right now. You can continue to cut us off. But you will hear us in the election just like you did in November.
Ultimately, it was Lewis who stepped in and attempted to de-escalate the situation.
“I understand there are many things for us to debate on revenues and whatnot, but this right here, you just got a promise to do what you want. She’s promised to do it. The committee chair just promised to do that. No one is steamrolling here,” Lewis said.
“You’ve received a promise, and we’re going to honor them,” he said.
The vote Tuesday keeps the bill on pace to land in the Senate later this week.
The Senate Budget and Taxation Committee Tuesday finalized its recommendations on the budget. The House and Senate have agreed on a broad framework for the budget.
One area they disagree on is funding for transportation. Both chambers have agreed to provide more than $400 million but have not finalized a plan on how to reach that number.
A final agreement is not expected before a key deadline passes March 31.
Lawmakers in both chambers said they believe a conference committee to resolve differences in the budget will not lead to protracted debates as has happened in years past.

Brian Kemp’s big 2025 legislative push to pass lawsuit damage limits is ready for his victory lap, but as the dust settles in the wake of Thursday’s razor-close House vote on Senate Bill 68, some legislators’ nerves are still frayed and one longtime lawmaker lost his job over his vote. 
Lawmakers in both parties are beginning to feel the fallout of their votes on the pivotal bill aimed at overhauling Georgia’s civil litigation system as party leaders and powerful business interests take note of who toed the party line and who crossed it. In the House, where the bill passed along razor-thin margins, eight Republicans broke ranks to vote against the legislation and three Democrats joined the majority to secure the bill’s passage. In the final Senate vote, two Democrats crossed party lines to vote in support of the legislation, and one Republican opposed it.
State Rep. Vance Smith, a Pine Mountain Republican, was ousted from his position as CEO of the Harris County Chamber of Commerce during a Friday afternoon Zoom call. He tearfully recounted his dismissal during a speech in the House chamber Tuesday.
Though SB 68 successfully cleared both chambers, Kemp repeatedly twisted arms throughout the session to coerce lawmakers into passing the bill. At the start of the 2025 session, he had pledged to drag lawmakers back to Atlanta for a special session if “meaningful, impactful” changes were not made to the state’s civil justice system by the end of the regular session on April 4. A key lieutenant also threatened the governor would use his substantial campaign warchest to back primary challengers to any Republicans who opposed the bill, and ahead of the final Senate vote, Republicans briefly paused floor proceedings to assemble for a caucus meeting attended by Kemp.
Republicans in both chambers might have to wait until the 2026 election season to see if Kemp makes good on his promise.
Smith, whose west Georgia district spans parts of Harris, Muscogee and Troup counties, first joined the Georgia Legislature in 1993. He has long been a reliable member of the Republican caucus, making his vote on Thursday somewhat unexpected. In an emotional speech on the House floor Tuesday morning, Smith made veiled references to the fallout from his decision.
“A lot of things have transpired since last week when we left,” he said, thanking his family and members of the house for their support over the past few days. He also tearfully quoted the Bible verse Jeremiah 29:11, “‘for I know the plans I have for you,’ declares the Lord, ‘plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.’”
Though Smith expressed surprise over the Harris County Chamber of Commerce’s abrupt decision to fire him, he told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that he did not regret his vote. The Georgia Chamber of Commerce and local chambers formed a powerful alliance in the fight to get a bill passed intended to limit jury payouts for medical malpractice and negligent property owners.
House leaders also addressed the strong reactions to Thursday’s vote, with House Majority Caucus Whip James Burchett, a Waycross Republican who sponsored the bill in the House, urging Georgia residents to “hold legislators accountable for their votes under the Gold Dome at the ballot box – not by taking aim at their ability to support their families.”
“Numerous members have suffered threats to their livelihoods and independence because of their votes on Senate Bill 68,” Burchett said in a statement issued Tuesday afternoon. “These retaliations undermine the strengths of our citizen legislature, which depends on members voting their conscience after fully weighing the issues and determining what they think is best for their communities and our state.”
Democrats are also grappling with the aftermath of SB 68’s passage, with House minority leaders sharply criticizing the members of their caucus who broke ranks to vote for the legislation.
“We were sent here to make hard decisions, and hard decisions are hard because you have to look people in the eye that you disappoint,” said Rep. Stacey Evans, an Atlanta Democrat, shortly after the bill passed in the House. “Those victims won’t be here every day, but the chamber will be here. Insurance companies will be here, and I think too many of my colleagues were worried about walking down the hall and looking them in the eye and not worried about the people back home.”
Rep. Mack Jackson, a Sandersville Democrat who is Black with a history of splitting from his party on pivotal votes, criticized the House Democratic caucus in a speech on the House floor last Friday, comparing an unnamed Democratic colleague to segregation-era figures like Bull Connor and George Wallace. 
“I realized that somewhere in her subconscious mind, she thought that she had bought me and my freedom to choose,” he said, referencing a conversation in which the unnamed colleague brought up her contribution to his most recent re-election campaign. “I gave her her money back because I don’t want anyone to think that they own me and can talk down to me as if I’m a child.” 
He also described other conversations with fellow Democrats who expressed disappointment with his vote, and requested that their campaign contributions be refunded.
“I’ll refund everything, because I don’t ever want anybody to think that they own me,” he said.
Rep. Michelle Au, a Johns Creek Democrat and doctor who also voted in favor of the bill, took to social media to explain her decision, posting a two-page statement on the social media site X (formerly Twitter).
“It is by no means a perfect bill,” Au wrote. “There are elements I object to. But on balance I think it protects our fair, equal access for all to our justice system while hopefully addressing the ways our litigation environment has become untenable for many.”
The second part of Kemp’s tort package, Senate Bill 69 that would increase regulations around third-party lawsuit financing, passed the House Rules Subcommittee on Lawsuit Reform Tuesday evening. It is expected to come up for a vote on the House floor later this week.

Senators heavily reworked the bill Tuesday. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)Senators on Tuesday rolled a laundry list of energy bills together into one package aimed at reshaping Maryland’s energy picture well into the future, and lowering costs in the process.
And they added one amendment designed to provide consumers more immediate relief.
In a two-hour session Tuesday, the Senate Education, Energy and the Environment Committee added bits and pieces of other energy bills to leadership legislation that had largely focused on expediting the construction of new power plants in the state.
But with Maryland residents face soaring electricity and gas rates, much of Tuesday’s debate focused on the so-called “Legislative Energy Hardship Credit” for residential customers.
“A lot of the things in this bill won’t really take effect for a while,” said Sen. Mary Washington (D-Baltimore City and Baltimore County). “We’re probably planning in a way that maybe we should have done 10 years ago, 15 years ago. But this [consumer credit] … would go right into some pockets of Marylanders right away.”
Money for the rebates would come from the Strategic Energy Investment Fund, a state account utilities pay into as a penalty for not meeting certain renewable energy requirements. In fiscal 2024, the payments totaled $318 million, according to the Fund’s most recent annual report, a considerable increase over prior years because it was often more economical to pay into the fund than buy credits from renewable-energy generators.
That fund has been used to pay for energy-efficiency projects, but it would be sent directly to consumers next year under the Senate proposal. The payments would come in two installments, applied to consumers’ bills once in the summer peak energy season and once in the winter.
It’s not clear how much ratepayers would receive, but the amendment says the rebates would be “based on the customer’s consumption of electricity supply that is subject to the Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard.”
Lawmakers grill energy companies over high utility bills

Sen. Cheryl C. Kagan (D-Montgomery) took issue with the fact that the refund would go to all residential ratepayers, regardless of income.
“I hate that someone who lives in a huge mansion is going to somehow be getting a hardship payment when they’re not going to need it, notice it or appreciate it,” said Kagan, the vice chair of the committee.
The idea of a ratepayer rebate got the support of at least one Republican on the committee, Sen. Mary Beth Carozza (R-Lower Shore).
“Our constituents expect some type of immediate relief,” Carozza said.
Long-term energy goals 
While the rebates garnered plenty of the discussion, longer-term energy policy formed the larger part of the omnibus bill that senators cobbled together, with less than two weeks left in the legislative session.
The amended bill builds on a package endorsed by legislative leaders early in the session that would create a “fast track” process to approve certain new power facilities in the state. But amendments set new limits on the process.
The bill would create procurement procedures for more nuclear power and energy storage technology, which could contribute stored power to the grid during peak times.
It also aims to rein in utility spending on natural gas infrastructure, by requiring companies looking to get rapid reimbursement from ratepayers to first show that new infrastructure is needed for safety reasons. It states that investor-owned utilities can’t use ratepayer dollars on trade association memberships or private planes.
Environmental and consumer advocacy groups have long complained that a 2013 law meant to encourage updates to leaky gas pipes, called STRIDE, was actually causing utility companies to go overboard with upgrades, leaving ratepayers stuck with the tab, even as the state transitions from fossil fuel-burning.
“It [STRIDE] was passed to deal with aging infrastructure and there just weren’t any sort of checks and balances as part of the original bill,” Washington said during Tuesday’s work session.
The bill also takes aim at “multiyear” rate plans, which — when approved by the Maryland Public Service Commission — let utilities raise rates annually over a period of several years, instead of coming to the PSC every time they wanted their next increase. Utilities would have to demonstrate a “definite cost-savings to consumers” to be approved for multiyear rate increases under Tuesday’s amendments.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“If the legislature wants to address rising energy costs, the smartest thing they can do is stop relentless rate hikes from Exelon utilities by ending or reforming the STRIDE and multi-year ratemaking programs, and these proposals are a strong start,” said Emily Scarr, a senior adviser at the Maryland Public Interest Research Group, in a statement Tuesday.
The amended bill would also deny renewable energy subsidies to facilities that burn trash to generate energy. The development is likely to please environmental groups that had long fought against the subsidy, including in South Baltimore, which hosts one of the state’s two incinerators.
Industrial facilities that use a large amount of energy (100 megawatts), such as data centers, were also targeted in the amended bill, which calls for utilities to develop a unique rate schedule for those customers, among other provisions.
“It is the intent of the General Assembly that residential retail electric customers in the state should not bear the financial risks associated with large loaf customers interconnecting to the electric system serving the state,” reads the amended bill.
Cold shoulder for original plan
Environmental groups pushed back against the energy pack originally proposed by House and Senate leaders, arguing that it was essentially encouraging construction of a new natural gas plants, flouting the state’s climate goals.
At a recent Maryland League of Conservation Voters event in Annapolis, protestors donned T-shirts with the slogan: “No New Gas! Don’t Need It, Don’t Want It.” Opponents have also questioned the notion that any new in-state power plants are needed at all.
“Maryland doesn’t have a reliability problem. It has an affordability problem,” said Susan Miller, a senior attorney with Earthjustice, during the Annapolis conference.
The Maryland Office of People’s Counsel, which represents ratepayers, has also cast doubt on the notion that the state’s energy supply is perilous. Two coal-fired plants that were set to be retired, Brandon Shores and H.A. Wagner, will keep operating while new transmission lines are added to account for their loss, read a recent report from the OPC.
Maryland residents want a menu of energy generation options, poll shows

“The relevant available data does not show that there is a near-term need for generation located in Maryland for reliable electric service,” the report said. “The transmission system in place can import sufficient power into Maryland, and new transmission under development will increase that capability as power plants retire.”
The amended energy bill sets new guardrails on what types of energy generation can receive expedited approval.
For example, it says the combined total capacity of natural gas generators approved under the bill “may not exceed the combined summer peak capacity profile of coal and oil energy generating stations in the state.” It also required four non-emissions emitting projects be approved for every one emissions-emitting project.
Sen. Jason C. Gallion (R-Cecil and Harford) took issue with the natural gas provisions during Tuesday’s proceedings.
“We have an energy crisis in the state,” he said. “I don’t know why we would be capping natural gas.”
The amended bill requires that any natural gas plant approved through an expedited procedure at the PSC have the ability to convert to hydrogen or zero-emissions biofuel. After a new plant becomes operational, it would have to submit reports every five years regarding the feasibility of such a conversion.
Sen. Ronald L. Watson (D-Prince George’s) worried about the 50-year time frame in the bill.
“A company goes in and submits their report, and then tomorrow, technology is available, and they get to burn unclean fuel for another five years before they have to do another report,” Watson said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DSC01497-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

Whether from being by the fish-cutting table or helping package moose for the freezer, I’ve always been right there helping. I am from Tyonek, which is on the west side of the Cook Inlet, and currently a senior at Mt. Edgecumbe High School in Sitka. Living in a rural village is hard, especially when you have to order your groceries from Anchorage and have them sent down by plane. In certain weather conditions, this is when having subsistence foods on hand is important. Subsistence foods like baleek (smoked salmon strips), ganut (the salmon meat we cut off to make baleek), salmon fillets, moose jerky, moose meat, and more. While putting these foods away, I was taught to show respect to the animals we harvest, how to care for them, and to thank them for their sacrifice to feed my family.

	Being so intertwined with our ways of life with my family and community, pushed me to take the Federal Subsistence Board Policy and Procedures class at the University of Alaska Southeast Sitka Campus, a dual enrollment class offered by UAS with the Sitka Conservation Society and U.S. Forest Service. Before learning about this class, I had never heard of these processes before and didn’t realize that we had regulations on subsistence that people discussed, decided on, and made changes to. Taking the class with teachers Heather Bauscher and Ashley Bolwerk showed me the importance of subsistence for rural communities across Alaska. An example of this would be the closing of units 11, 12 and 13 due to the decline of the caribou herd. I saw how important this food source was to the people in those communities, but I also saw how important it was to those communities to see that herd continue to grow and flourish. That showed me how much we as rural people give up for the environment and for the animals that we harvest. We aren’t interested in over-harvesting these animals, because if we did, what would we have to eat or use for traditional crafts when there was no more?
This class showed me how much our regional advisory councils listen to the voices in their communities, and that they actually bring these concerns to the Federal Subsistence Board. The board members listen to these concerns as well, and they make sure they are doing the right thing for the rural communities across Alaska. It is also just a great experience to see the measures taken for our ways of life. The best part of taking this class was to see how passionate rural Alaskans are about our ways of life and the traditions that are passed down. 
Over the past year, I have noticed the importance of involvement in this process. Being involved can mean a variety of different things. It can mean just going to a meeting in your region or talking to one of the RAC members. Doing this shows that, as rural Alaskans, we care about our resources and want to keep them. If we don’t use these processes, then what is the point of having them anyway?
Here are some ways Alaskans can be involved in this process: giving testimony at their RAC meeting or the board meeting about their concerns, apply for a seat on their RAC, talk to someone who sits on their RAC, or they can submit a proposal to the RAC. I am hoping to apply to the SouthCentral RAC to represent myself, my family, and most importantly, my community. I recommend this class because I have seen the importance of protecting how we carry and participate in our ways of life. I cannot see myself not doing any subsistence harvesting with my family, and when I even imagine just a little bit, it breaks my heart. 











Subsistence creates life. Subsistence creates memories. Subsistence is about love. Subsistence is special. Subsistence is our way of life.



	Without subsistence, life is quiet. Without subsistence, I’m not close with my family. Without subsistence, we are not a community. Without subsistence, there is starvation in rural areas. Without subsistence, I see a decay in Alaskan Native traditions. Without subsistence, I see more substance abuse. Without subsistence, there are no funny stories. Without subsistence, I see elders not sharing traditions.
Subsistence creates life. Subsistence creates memories. Subsistence is about love. Subsistence is special. Subsistence is our way of life.
Without subsistence, there is no me.
Chiqnik. Thank you.

Democrat Dan Goughnour won the 35th House District seat, previously held by Rep. Matthew Gergely (D-Allegheny), with 63.4% of the vote, according to unofficial results. His victory restores the 102-101 seat majority Democrats held in the House before Gergley died in January after suffering a medical emergency.
A Democratic victory in the Lancaster County race would not change Republican control of the Senate, but would be a significant upset in the district, where President Donald Trump won by 15 percentage points in November.
Unofficial results in the 36th Senate District election showed Democratic East Petersburg Mayor James Malone ahead of Republican County Commissioner Chairman Joshua Parsons by fewer than 500 votes, or 0.89% of the 54,000 votes cast. 
The Associated Press said the race was too early to call, with an unknown number of provisional ballots still to be counted. The winner will take the place of former Republican Sen. Ryan Aument, who resigned to work for U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick.
Party leaders said the Democratic victories were a statement on the Trump administration’s cuts to federal agencies and chaotic first two months in power.
“Malone’s victory is a loud and clear rebuke to Republicans’ threats to the programs Pennsylvania families rely on – from Social Security and Medicaid to our public schools,” Democratic National Committee Chairperson Ken Martin said in a statement.
Sen. Vincent Hughes, chairman of the Senate Democratic Campaign Committee, said the election was a referendum on chaos in Washington and inaction by Republicans in Harrisburg.  
“Voters are fed up, and they showed up tonight in Lancaster,” Hughes said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Malone, who works for a business information technology firm, says he is devoted to transparent, compassionate, inclusive and innovative government. His campaign website said his priorities are affordable housing, including support for first-time homeowners and property tax relief; public education; supporting first responders; and expanding social services and mental health support.
Parsons is the Lancaster County commissioners chairperson, a veteran U.S. Army officer and former assistant district attorney. He gained prominence in conservative political circles for his  defiance of state COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, claiming credit for Lancaster County’s economic recovery during the emergency and touted his leadership as an abortion opponent. 
Parsons’s campaign was supported by GOP activist Scott Presler, who helped turn out Amish voters in the 2024 general election. Presler, who has drawn criticism for his anti-Muslim language, rung early alarm bells about a possible Democratic victory, drawing the attention of billionaire megadonor Elon Musk, Lancaster Online reported this week.
The 36th District covers a swath of northern Lancaster County including suburbs of the city of Lancaster, Elizabethtown and rural areas.
Goughnour is a member of the McKeesport Area School Board and captain of detectives in the McKeesport Police Department. He ran against Republican Charles Davis, who is president of the White Oak borough council. The 35th District, in the Monongahela River Valley south of Pittsburgh, includes the industrial cities of Clairton, Duquesne and McKeesport, and is favored to remain in Democratic control.

Stanley Dunlap/Georgia Recorder.
A panel of Georgia Power representatives testified for eight hours at Tuesday’s Public Service Commission hearing about its controversial roadmap for meeting large-scale, data center-driven energy demands over the next decade.
The executives testified that the investor-owned utility’s 2025 Integrated Resource Plan would provide the right balance of energy capacity to meet the rising demands of a growing Georgia, largely based on the projected boom in data centers supporting emerging internet technologies and their voracious appetite for electricity.
The company’s long-term plan forecasts 8,000 megawatts of growth through early 2030s, while citing the potential of 40,000 megawatts of industrial interest in the state.
Georgia Power officials have defended the company against criticism of past overly optimistic projections that could burden ratepayers and concerns about the financial and environmental impact of large data facilities.
In its 10-year plan, Georgia Power proposes a resource mix that is reliable, economical, and diverse enough to meet the growing needs of its 2.8 million customers, including plans to build 1,000 miles of transmission lines, adding renewable solar storage facilities, and continued investments in nuclear, natural gas, coal, and hydropower plants.
A company official said it will continue to use informed judgment and historical trends to adapt to load forecasts. 
A Georgia Power industrial pipeline tracking includes companies that have shown interest and companies that have committed, which occurs after a customer selects the state’s largest supplier as their electric service provider.
A PSC public interest attorney asked how much experience Georgia Power’s staff has working with data centers customers, particularly large facilities that will operate artificial intelligence.
Georgia Power’s director of resource and policy planning, Jeff Grubb, said the company has forecast industrial energy demands successfully for years.
“It doesn’t mean that every industry that we model has had somebody from Georgia Power working there,” Grubb said. “We work with those customers. We learn from those customers.”
The company said its economic development staff can promote Georgia to prospective commercial and industrial customers.
“There’s a reason why these data centers are here in Georgia,” said Michael Robinson, vice president of grid transformation for Georgia Power. “It’s the infrastructure, it’s reliability. It’s the affordability in Georgia.”
Protesters decry Georgia Power plan
Georgia lawmakers, clean energy and consumer advocacy groups have warned against state regulators signing off on Georgia Power’s repeated utility bill increases after the Southern Company subsidiary stuck ratepayers with new electricity base rates, overrun costs associated with building two new Vogtle nuclear power plant units, coal ash cleanup and other expenses.
On Tuesday, Emory University freshman Ava Trachtenberg criticized the utility’s plan to the five-member PSC panel of elected Republicans before gathering outside to protest with her fellow Sunrise club members along with Georgia Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club of Georgia.
“The Georgia Public Service Commission has been prioritizing Georgia Power’s profits over future health of the communities, over people’s bills for so many years,” Trachtenberg said. “This is our opportunity to speak to them, to let them know that we’re paying attention. It’s really, really important that they know that young people are here. We’re paying attention, and we want clean, affordable energy.”
Georgia Power officials have said new PSC rules for data centers will prevent residential and commercial customers from being billed for power consumed by facilities that rely on enormous amounts of energy day and night. 
The new rules include a provision allowing Georgia Power to require data center companies to put up front-end collateral for energy costs over the lifetime of the contract for electricity supply. Georgia Power officials testified Tuesday that the process the company uses to forecast commercial and industrial demand factors in how much the company requests to increase its energy capacity in its resource plans. 
Georgia Power to argue new long-term plan to PSC after Legislature stalls consumer-friendly bills

Georgia Power executives were grilled about the transparency of filings, including new generic expansion plans that lack details about specific projects.
A company official said Georgia Power adhered to a PSC rule protecting confidential information, which was put in place to prevent competitors from gaining advantages.
Jennifer Whitfield, a senior attorney representing Georgia Interfaith Power and Light and Southface Institute, requested that state regulators require Georgia Power to provide more information to consumer and green energy advocates, including fuel types and the megawattage for the proposed projects.
“This will allow intervenors to assess what the resources look like. Right now, 95% of the need to fill capacity beyond 2031 is not made available to the intervenors,” Whitfield said. 
Commissioner Tricia Pridemore said that the terms of the future plan were set in a previous filing and were being withheld for good reasons this year.
“I don’t want to see us do anything that exposes pricing or anything that would jeopardize the all-source RFP,” Pridemore said.
In the recent filing, the utility company proposes extending the lifetime of coal-fired units at Plant Bowen and Plant Scherer by converting them to co-firing natural gas generation by 2030. The updated electricity generation could delay the retirement of the plants until early 2039, according to Georgia Power.
Whitfield questioned why Georgia Power staff failed to study the effects of retiring fossil fuel units at Bowen and Scherer on the economy and the environment. 
Georgia Power officials said in 2022 that it was no longer economically feasible to maintain the coal-fired units.
Grubb said that because the expected energy demand increased this time, it was in the best interest of customers to continue operating the units.

Last week, on the same day a budget agreement that included the tax was announced, Crosby moved his business to Virginia. (File photo by Bryan P. Sears)Del. Brian M. Crosby (D-St Mary’s) is vice chair of the House Economic Matters Committee — a panel that handles many business issues — as well as the owner of a small business that is a subcontractor on Defense IT contracts.
Until last week, that business was based in Maryland.
But Crosby was already in the process of moving his business to Virginia last week when the governor and legislative leaders announced a budget deal that includes a 3% tax on IT, among other services, a tax that critics say poses an existential threat to businesses such as Crosby’s that contract with federal agencies.
“I listened to the announcement in the truck,” he said, describing the move that came on the same day as the budget announcement.
“I’ve raised these issues,” Crosby said. “I don’t know what to say. I think people are still convinced that you’re getting 50 cents of $1 or something.”
Instead, he said the tax would mean businesses such as his would lose money on every transaction.
“All I can say is you’re not taking 50 cents on $1,” Crosby said. “You’re taking $1.50 from $1.”
Budget agreement could generate more than $1 billion in new revenue

Crosby told his story Tuesday, minutes after his Democratic colleagues muscled through a two-bill spending plan on a preliminary vote. That plan includes the tax on data and IT services that is expected to raise nearly $500 million annually, part of the $1 billion in new revenues — and $2.5 billion in spending cuts — needed to close a $3 billion gap in the fiscal 2026 budget.
Crosby noted the irony of the situation. Gov. Wes Moore (D) and other legislators say they want to grow private industry and attract IT jobs to the area. One of the largest components of that industry are the numerous defense facilities in the state — Patuxent River, Fort Meade, Fort Detrick and others.
“On one hand, we’re saying we’re the IT-cyber corridor,” said Crosby. “On the other hand, the industry, which I’m a part of, is saying if you’re in the DoD [Department of Defense] segment, which is the state’s number one industry, you can’t make it on that (tax).
“The commercial companies, they can pass it off,” he said. “It’s not the same for the DoD guys, especially the smaller guys, it’s not as easy.”
Smaller companies such as Crosby’s often work as subcontractors to large prime contractors that are based out of state and, thus, not subject to the proposed tax, that is soon to head to the Senate. Subcontractors based in Maryland are not exempt.
Crosby’s five-year old company — he asked that it not be named — has been growing. He has a warehouse location in Georgia, where he plans to register his company while keeping a small presence in Maryland and a new office in Virginia Beach.
The new out-of-state company will deliver on its contracts as before to its larger prime, typically exempt, contractor partners that will deliver services to the federal facilities in Maryland.
“We know the numbers,” Crosby said when asked about how the change would affect companies that do the same type of contracting. “All I can say is that within a year, we’d file for bankruptcy.”
So Crosby acted fast. The House and Senate have an agreement on the tax. Delaying a move would mean needing more trucks, as materials needed for third-quarter projects are soon to arrive. There’s also the matter of bidding on future contracts.

	Delaying a move was too risky, Crosby said.
Crosby may not be alone in his move should the tax pass as expected. The state Cybersecurity Association Inc. estimated that about 800 businesses similar to Crosby’s could be affected by a services tax. The Maryland Chamber of Commerce estimates more than 15,000 businesses , that employ an estimated, 100,000 people, would be subject to the new tax.
During Tuesday’s floor debate in the House, Republicans tried to strip out the IT services tax — one of more than a dozen failed amendments offered during a sometimes testy four-hour debate.
Del. Todd Morgan (R-Calvert and St. Mary’s) stood feet away from Crosby as he described the choice faced by his Democratic colleague.
“Now I’m going to bring this home, ladies and gentlemen, to this room, to our colleagues, to one of my friends on the other side of the aisle,” Morgan said. “That individual is moving his business to Virginia.
“I’ll say this again, one of the colleagues in this room, who’s our friend on the other side of the aisle, is moving his business to Virginia as we speak,” he said. “So I just want that to sink in when we look at how big this picture is.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DSC_0190-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., talks to voters through a virtual town hall meeting on March 25, 2025. (Screenshot from Fedorchak website)North Dakota U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak told tele-town hall attendees Tuesday that Social Security benefits will not be cut as part of a budget proposal in the U.S. House.
The virtual event was the first forum open to the general public Fedorchak has hosted for constituents since being elected in November.
“Social Security is not being cut. It’s not on the table for any cuts at all,” Fedorchak said. “I want to work my time as your representative in Congress to ensure that we reform these programs so they are available for the long term to the people who have paid into them and to the people who deserve to have them.”
Social Security nominee vows service will improve despite mass firings, office closures

A statement from the Democratic-NPL Party noted that Fedorchak did not address reports of Department of Government Efficiency plans to close Social Security field offices or cut phone support. The Minot Social Security field office is among federal leases listed for potential cancellation, The Associated Press reported.
Democratic-NPL Party Committeeman Jamie Selzler, who asked the Social Security question, said in a statement he appreciated Fedorchak taking his call.
“I respect that she was willing to take tough questions and didn’t handpick callers,” Selzler said, though added he thinks Fedorchak is “abdicating her responsibility” to provide oversight of the administration.
In response to a Bismarck woman concerned about how Medicaid cuts would affect her son with disabilities, Fedorchak laid out House Republican plans for $400 billion in Medicaid savings over the next decade to help keep the program solvent for future generations.
“We’re looking to make reforms to the program so we can preserve it and protect it for the people that need it the most, like your son,” Fedorchak said. “The way it’s growing right now is unsustainable, so if we don’t make some reforms, it’s going to collapse.”
She said audits of Medicaid recipients against eligibility requirements could save $100 billion for taxpayers. Work requirements for able-bodied Medicaid recipients between ages 18 to 55 could save another $300 billion, she added.
“I don’t think North Dakotans are participating in the program that shouldn’t be, but this is a problem in other states and it’s costing the program hundreds of billions of dollars,” she said.
A Mapleton woman asked Fedorchak how cuts to the Department of Education will impact rural schools.
Fedorchak told the woman that the goal of President Donald Trump’s administration is to return control of education to parents, school boards and the states.
“That’s where responsibility for education long belongs,” Fedorchak said.
She also explained that taxpayers were funneling money to local schools through the department and the department was “taking a cut.”
“What President Trump wants to do is eliminate the middle man,” she said. 
Fedorchak said, with more state and local control over school funding, she believes the education outcomes for children will improve. She also believes eliminating the department will cut through a lot of bureaucratic red tape and barriers to programs and funding.
“By eliminating those strings, they can put those dollars to use in the best way possible to meet the needs of our schools, our kids and our teachers,” Fedorchak said.
North Dakotans rally for town hall meetings with congressional delegation

Republican members of Congress have come under fire in recent weeks, including Bismarck, for not holding in-person town hall events for their constituents.
In response to an online question about why she wasn’t doing town halls in person, Fedorchak said the virtual event gives her an opportunity to reach more North Dakotans. She said more than 3,000 people had registered for Tuesday’s event, with potentially more watching the livestream.
Fedorchak also described recent meetings she’s held in North Dakota, including meeting with the tribal councils of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and Spirit Lake Nation, as well as the Bismarck-Mandan Chamber of Commerce and state corn growers. 
Fedorchak said she plans to continue holding tele-town halls in the coming months to hear concerns from voters.
The Democratic-NPL Party is hosting its own in-person town hall at 7 p.m. Thursday at the Sanctuary Event Center in Fargo.
The event will feature testimonials from residents impacted by the recent federal government workforce and funding reforms. It will also give residents a chance to write their concerns down on paper so they can be compiled together and mailed to North Dakota’s federal delegation, said Cheryl Biller, executive director for the Democratic-NPL Party.

John Albers, a Roswell Republican, presents his case for making doxxing a crime - including a felony in some cases - in Georgia at a committee meeting Tuesday. Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderAn attempt to crack down on so-called doxxing has been met with concerns from attorneys and First Amendment advocates who say the proposal is too broad and would hamper free speech.
Senate Bill 27, which is sponsored by Sen. John Albers, a Roswell Republican, would make it a crime to distribute someone’s personal information – such as their home address – in a way that could cause more than $500 in economic losses or leave the victim scared of being stalked or hurt.
“It’s really a contemporary and pernicious form of harassment just using the power of the internet,” Albers said. “It’s a gross violation of people’s privacy, often resulting in emotional distress, reputational damages, and in some cases, it has resulted in physical harm and death.
“While we can continue to digitize our lives, we have to address this issue,” he said.
The first offense would be a misdemeanor, but repeat offenders would be charged with a felony. More serious cases where the offender intends to cause harm could result in a felony that could land someone in prison for up to five years.
“I want to make sure we understand there’s absolutely no curbing any free speech,” Albers said, pointing to exceptions included in the bill.
But critics of the bill were not convinced. The Georgia First Amendment Foundation and individual attorneys spoke out against the bill during a House committee hearing Tuesday.
Sarah Brewerton-Palmer, the foundation’s president, said the doxxing issue is legitimate and needs to be addressed. But she argued that the proposal being considered is overly broad, particularly with the lower-level offense that includes situations where the offender demonstrated reckless disregard.
If passed, she said the bill would have a chilling effect on First Amendment protected speech – and could even ensnare journalists.
“We appreciate that threats and harassment, particularly those enabled by the anonymity of social media, are real and serious concerns in Georgia and throughout society,” Brewerton-Palmer wrote in a letter she delivered to lawmakers Tuesday.
“However, Senate Bill 27 presents little realistic likelihood of remedying those ills, while exposing innocent speakers and writers to arrest and prosecution that could be triggered by nothing more than publishing an already-prominent person’s name,” she said.
Brewerton-Palmer and others have said the bill could be applied to an unfavorable Yelp review, such as one urging people to avoid a specific physician because they have had their license suspended numerous times.
Andrew Fleischman, who is an attorney, presented a timely national example of what he argued could be considered doxxing under the proposal: An explosive report from The Atlantic’s editor that said he had been accidentally included in a text exchange with Trump administration Cabinet members about plans to bomb Yemen.
“A reporter was part of a text thread about national security, and in that conversation you learned who those people’s employers were and also where they’d be likely to be, and you know what? I think there’s a pretty good chance that those people will suffer mental anguish or economic harm,” he said.
Fleischman argued that existing laws can be used to go after people who are doxxing others in Georgia.
The bill advanced out of committee Tuesday night with a few dissenting votes from both parties and now goes to the gatekeeping House Rules Committee. April 4 is the last day of this year’s legislative session.
After the vote, Fleischman posted this on X: “It looks like this bill is going to pass. If you, or anyone you know, is charged with a violation of this law, call me. I will work for cheap or for free to overturn it.”

Greg Dolezal during testimony on SB 1. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderA Senate bill aimed at barring transgender girls from playing on girls’ school sports teams passed a significant milestone toward becoming law Tuesday when it moved through a House committee on a party-line vote.
Cumming Republican Sen. Greg Dolezal’s Senate Bill 1 bars students who were designated male at birth from playing on teams for girls or women from K-12 through college in public and private schools. It also imposes gender-based restrictions on locker rooms, changing facilities and restrooms, with carve-outs for medical or training personnel at certain times.
“We recognize both biologically, anecdotally, and statistically, that there’s inherent male advantage when it comes to sports and we want to create a boundary around female sport that excludes that male advantage from being in female sport,” Dolezal said.
Schools that violate the ban could lose state funding.

It does not go as far as the House’s transgender sports ban, which also replaces the word “gender” with the word “sex” throughout state code, which LGBTQ advocates said could lead to unintended consequences for transgender Georgians from collecting health data to adopting foster children. That House bill is still alive, but author Rep. Josh Bonner, a Fayetteville Republican, indicated he was happy with the version of SB1 that passed Tuesday.
“I think the bill before you represents a good common sense compromise between the two measures, between the House and Senate,” he said.
Supporters said the bill is about fairness.
“Everybody has a place to compete in sports,” said Matt Sharp, an attorney with Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal organization, “but the question is, what is the most fair way to do it? We don’t allow the senior in high school to play against the middle school students. We don’t allow the 220-pound student to wrestle against the 110-pound weight category, nor should we allow males to compete against females.”
Opponents characterized the bill as paternalistic and said it’s based on inaccurate stereotypes of transgender athletes.
“The idea that trans women are across the board faster, taller, and stronger than cis women is untrue,” said Evelina Pierce. “I’m one of the coaches on a professional team, cisgender women on our team have played against transgender women. It is inclusive, and this is partially because women have created the rules. I notice the people who are bringing forth these anti-trans bills are men. We need women to be actually creating the rules under which we play, not men. This bill is not about protecting women.”
Pierce coaches for Atlanta Soul, a professional ultimate – also known as ultimate Frisbee – team. Ultimate leagues are often gender-inclusive and welcoming to transgender and nonbinary members.
Kimble Sorrells, an ordained minister, characterized the bill and others like it as an exercise in ginning up the base with red meat bills.
“With so many Georgians struggling for things like just trying to get by and pay the bills, I really wonder why we’re focused on this, and it feels like this is really just political grandstanding and attempts to discriminate,” he said. “In the same way that it was never really about water fountains, I don’t really believe this is about women’s sports.”
Because it was amended, SB1 will need to pass both chambers before it can become law.
Several other bills that would restrict transgender Georgians’ rights are poised for action in the waning days of the 2025 legislative session. Bans on puberty-blocking drugs for transgender minors and gender-affirming treatments for both inmates in correctional institutions and workers on the state health insurance plan have passed the Senate and could be headed for votes in the House.
The end of the year’s session is set for April 4.

Brian Kemp’s desk after it passed the Senate nearly unanimously Tuesday.

Some individual districts already have bans in place, but the bill would apply to all kids through middle school and be in effect from the first morning bell to the dismissal bell starting next July.
“Schools that have done it have literally been transformed,” said the bill’s author, Peachtree Corners Republican Rep. Scott Hilton, after the Senate vote. “We’ve heard some of that in the testimony on the floor that the lunchrooms now, kids are talking, they’re interacting, they’re socializing. So this isn’t just an academic bill, this is a mental health bill, it’s a public safety bill.”
The bill does not specify how schools should ban devices. Some schools have kids put their devices in a locked box or a bag that hangs on the back of the classroom door, others use special locking pouches that the students carry around but that can only be unlocked by the teacher.
Only two senators voted against the bill, Republican Sen. Greg Dolezal of Cumming and Sen. Colton Moore of Trenton, but some Democrats expressed agita at the legislation. Duluth Democrat Nabilah Islam Parkes proposed an amendment that would exempt e-readers like Amazon Kindles from the ban.
As passed, the bill would ban any “personal electronic device,” but still allow for school-owned devices with the teacher’s approval.
“Kids aren’t just reading paperbacks anymore, they’re reading on Kindles, on Nooks, on tools that are built specifically for learning,” Islam Parkes said. “E-readers don’t have TikTok, you don’t text on them, they don’t let you scroll. I agree with banning distractions, not learning.”
  Sen. RaShaun Kemp. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Sen. RaShaun Kemp, an Atlanta Democrat who was formerly a teacher and principal, said he was torn on the bill because he has seen the ways cell phones can contribute to bullying, but he said phones can also be a lifeline in emergencies.
“We’ve already seen this happen, not just here in Georgia, but across the country. Time and time again, when a crazed gunman decided to take the lives of our children while they sat in their desks, it was the calls of students that got emergency services there, it was their text to their parents letting them know they were alive that gave every parent a glimmer of hope,” he said.
“While I support this bill – I actually think it should go up to 12th grade – I implore, I beg my colleagues, for the sake of our children and educators to do something about guns,” he added. “Do something so that we no longer put ourselves in this position where we make sound policy decisions but neglect what our students are really asking for, to be safe in their classrooms.”
Sen. Jason Anavitarte, the Dallas Republican who carried the bill in the Senate, said emergency situations require calm and structure.
“My advice during an emergency at a school, while we know that parents are scared, parents are worried about where their kids are, parents are worried about what’s happening at a moment’s notice – trusting law enforcement, trusting the first responders and following the instructions when emergency text messages, alerts or other things are put out by an individual school or school district I think are important, and this bill does not infringe on any of those communication methods that school districts use now or would develop or use in the future.”
Speaking to reporters after the Senate vote, Hilton indicated that high schoolers’ days of texting in class may be numbered with an expansion to the bill possible as soon as next year’s session.
“Based on the feedback that I’ve got, we do have a problem in 9 through 12, and it’s the nuance of how do we address that, but I do imagine in a future session, we’re going back to think deeply about what we do in high school,” he said.

(Photo by Lisa Hupp/USFWS)A federal judge in Anchorage has ruled in favor of Alaska’s state-owned investment bank in a lawsuit that could clear the way for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
In an order published Tuesday, Judge Sharon Gleason wrote that the U.S. Department of the Interior acted illegally when it canceled oil and gas leases held by the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority on land within the refuge.
“Having reviewed the parties’ arguments, the court concludes that DOI was required to obtain a court order before canceling AIDEA’s leases,” Gleason said in her 22-page decision.
AIDEA did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but Cori Mills, Alaska’s deputy attorney general, called the decision a victory.
“The state looks forward to working with the current federal administration on fully realizing the vast potential of ANWR to grow Alaska’s economy and help America’s energy independence,” she said by email. “It is unfortunate we have lost a significant amount of time litigating, instead of moving forward with field studies and development. We will continue to review the decision in more detail but it’s definitely a victory.”
Tuesday’s order was the result of a lawsuit filed by AIDEA against the federal government last year, when the Biden administration canceled oil and gas leases that AIDEA won in a January 2021 sale.
Two other companies also won leases during the sale but later surrendered them to the federal government, leaving AIDEA as the only company holding leases within the refuge’s coastal plain, which is believed to hold significant oil and gas reserves, just as nearby state land does.
The Biden administration claimed that the sale — conducted under the auspices of the first Trump administration — was flawed and thus illegal.
It first suspended, then canceled the leases, prompting AIDEA to sue in 2024.
Gleason had upheld the Biden administration’s suspension order, but when it came to the cancellation, she ruled in AIDEA’s favor, citing a provision of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that enabled the ANWR leases.
That act said in part that the Interior Department “shall manage the oil and gas program on the Coastal Plain in a manner similar to the administration of lease sales under the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 1976.”
Gleason wrote: “Among the NPRPA’s implementing regulations is a regulation that provides that ‘(p)roducing leases or leases known to contain valuable deposits of oil or gas may be canceled only by court order.’”
But the Interior Department didn’t obtain a court order, Gleason noted.
“Accordingly, federal defendants’ cancellation of AIDEA’s leases was not in accordance with law because it failed to seek a court order,” she wrote.
Several environmental and tribal groups sided with the federal government during the course of the lawsuit and had requested the ability to offer alternative solutions if Gleason ruled in favor of AIDEA.
She turned them down, writing, “DOI’s error is serious: DOI cancelled AIDEA’s leases without following the congressionally mandated procedure for doing so.”
In light of that finding, she vacated the department’s lease cancellation decision, saying the department — now back in the hands of the Trump administration — may decide what to do next.
In a statement released last week, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said he intends to open the refuge’s entire 1.56 million-acre coastal plain to development, indicating that AIDEA will be given a free hand on its leases.
For its part, AIDEA has said in multiple court filings that if allowed to proceed, it will conduct seismic testing and other preliminary work necessary to determine how much oil and gas lies within its leases.
Among the various environmental and tribal groups that stood with the federal government in opposition to AIDEA was the Gwich’in Steering Committee, represented by attorneys from Trustees for Alaska.
“This disappointing ruling ignores the destruction oil drilling will do to our communities and only deepens our resolve in fiercely defending the coastal plain from oil and gas extraction,” said Kristen Moreland, executive director of the Gwich’in Steering Committee. “We will always protect the caribou, our way of life, and future generations.”
The Native Village of Venetie Tribal Government, Arctic Village Council, and Venetie Village Council, represented by the Native American Rights Fund, said in a statement that they will continue to oppose drilling in ANWR and that “multiple legal and administrative pathways remain to ensure proper environmental review before any ground-disturbing activities could occur.”

(Photo by Mike Clark for the Daily Montanan)A bill seeking an amendment to the Montana Constitution to confer “personhood” rights on embryos passed the House after a 57-43 vote on Tuesday.
In support of House Bill 316, sponsor Rep. Lee Deming, R-Laurel, argued in committee that voters hadn’t fully understood what they had done when they voted to add abortion as a constitutional right in CI-128 in the 2024 election.
But the bill received significant opposition in both its committee hearing and on the floor Tuesday.
Opponents said it would nix Montanan’s right to an abortion, as well as access to in vitro fertilization, while Deming argued there was no greater violation of privacy and dignity than abortion. The right to privacy has been used in court cases protecting the right to an abortion.
“The human being in the womb possesses his or her own right of privacy, again, I can’t think of a greater violation of privacy than abortion,” Deming said. “The state has a vested interest in protecting the lives of the most vulnerable human beings. And the human being in the womb has a life interest equal to that of his or her mother.”
During the floor discussion, Rep. Greg Overstreet, R-Stevensville, said the personhood issue was comparable to slavery.
“In pre-Civil War Southern states, African-Americans did not have the legal standing of personhood,” Overstreet said. “Why is that? Because you can’t buy and sell people if they have the legal status of personhood. Because it’s so easy to deny people their basic rights if you say they’re not people.”
HB 316 offers no recourse for victims of rape or incest. It passed along party lines out of the House Judiciary Committee. The bill could even outlaw birth control, Rep. SJ Howell, D-Missoula, said on the floor.
Howell mentioned other issues, specifically surrounding choices being made for someone who is pregnant. They said someone could push for specific healthcare a woman wouldn’t want, or that as written, the legislation could be used to possibly prevent a mother from being able to move out of state.
Abusers could potentially use the right of the embryo to dictate how someone lives their life, Howell added.
“I think one of the serious unintended consequences of an initiative like this is that it creates a legal pathway for more of that cohesive control,” Howell said. “Control over a woman by someone who does not have her best interests at heart.”

Barry Usher and Rep. Tom France addressed the elephant in the room with a bill that would prohibit disciplinary proceedings against constitutional officers who are lawyers, albeit with exceptions.
In 2023, Attorney General Austin Knudsen was accused of 41 counts of professional misconduct — charges his lawyer has argued should be dismissed.
The case and any discipline are pending with the Montana Supreme Court, but this session, Sen. Usher, R-Billings, sponsored Senate Bill 49 to protect constitutional officers who are attorneys from discipline while in office.
Those officers include the attorney general, and also the governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, superintendent of public instruction, and auditor, and the law would apply to legislators too.
The bill got out of the Senate on a 29-21 vote on third reading, and it prompted a heated debate in the House Judiciary Committee this week.
In a hearing Monday, Usher said it offers immunity to legislators or constitutional officers who are attorneys and speaking in the course of their work as elected officials.
“It’s a free speech issue,” Usher said.
No proponents testified for the bill.
Rep. France, D-Missoula, said he understood many of Usher’s arguments, but also said the AG’s role is a bit different than the role of the other constitutional officers.
He said the AG serves in a dual capacity, as a constitutional officer, but also as an officer of the court.
“It seems to me that the Attorney General, of all of our elected officers, has a high duty to respect the court and very carefully follow the rules of professional conduct,” France said.
As such, France asked if Usher would accept an amendment that would exclude the AG from immunity. Usher, however said he would not consider that a friendly amendment.
France then brought up a different idea.
He said the AG made some comments France, as an attorney, thought “pushed the limits of what was acceptable” and ones he considered “an attack on the court’s integrity.”
The Commission on Practice, which hears claims against attorneys, held a hearing in fall 2024 and recommended a 90-day suspension of Knudsen’s law license; a final decision is pending and a hearing is scheduled on Friday.
France asked if Usher would accept an amendment to push the effective date of the bill “so that we don’t look like we’re giving him a get-out-of-jail-free card.”
Currently, the effective date is upon passage and approval, and it applies retroactively to any disciplinary proceeding occurring on or after Jan. 1, 2024.
Usher said he would accept that amendment as friendly, but he’s heard the allegation before.
“I have been accused that this is why this bill is coming forward, but that would be a friendly amendment,” Usher said.
He also said he believes the case against Knudsen will conclude before the bill gets to the governor’s desk.
The bill was part of a suite of legislation that came out of the Senate Special Committee on Judicial Oversight and Reform, a priority this session for Republicans, who have clashed with the courts.
Originally, the bill was requested to exempt only the attorney general from disciplinary measures, according to a summary of bill draft requests from the committee.
A subsequent list of draft bill requests broadened the scope to all constitutional officers and legislators.
The committee didn’t take immediate action on the bill Monday, and a draft amendment wasn’t posted Tuesday.
At the hearing, Rep. Alanah Griffith, D-Big Sky, a lawyer, said professional rules require her to be truthful and honest, including to the legislature.
Griffith said she feared the bill would give constitutional officers a pass on ethics when they present bills.
“Do you think that’s a good idea?” Griffith said.
Usher said you don’t have to be an attorney to uphold ethics, and the bill doesn’t intend to be a license to “lie, cheat and steal.”
“I’m very offended by that, and I’m offended that you brought it up again,” Usher said.
He also said all elected officials are held accountable at the ballot box.
Rep. Zooey Zephyr, D-Missoula, said she had similar concerns as Griffith.
Zephyr said as she read it, the bill would create a situation where the AG could “lie through his teeth” about financial needs in his office.
Usher said he’d like to be able to prosecute someone who lies to the legislature, but he hasn’t found support for that idea in the past.
Plus, he said, lots of people can misrepresent information to lawmakers.
“So could any of the witnesses you had today that aren’t attorneys,” Usher said.
Zephyr said she was concerned the bill was a step backwards if the concern was about being truthful, but Usher said it didn’t make sense to have different standards.
Say a person is an attorney and is elected as superintendent of public instruction, he said.
“Why is that person held at a different standard than the last OPI superintendent that was not an attorney?” Usher said.
Rep. Tracy Sharp, R-Polson, said there’s no question a “tremendous battle” is taking place in this country involving the legislature and the judiciary. He asked Usher if one aim of the bill was for a lawyer elected into one of those roles to be able to speak freely of the judiciary.
“You’re trying to allow that elected official to speak openly and critically of that body, absent punishment,” Sharp said. “Is that what this bill is trying to do?”
Usher said that’s one example. He said currently, the governor is allowed, say, in his state-of-the-state address, to criticize the judiciary, and the governor shouldn’t lose that ability if he’s a member of the bar.
Bruce Spencer, with the State Bar of Montana, said he doesn’t believe the law would pass constitutional muster because the Montana Constitution states that the state Supreme Court regulates the practice of law.
Spencer also said his organization feels that lawyers should be ethical 100% of the time, and he doesn’t think it’s good policy to say lawyers get a pass if they’re elected.
He said the State Bar believes that lawyers represent a special trusted place in our society, and their great power requires them being held to higher standards.
“I can empty your bank account if I get a judgment,” Spencer said. “I can sell your house. I can, as a prosecuting attorney, put you away for life or the death penalty. And so the State Bar feels that lawyers should be held to a higher standard simply because we’ve been granted that privilege, that license to practice law.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-1437811901-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

This year, Green teamed up with several legislators to sponsor a new law, House Bill 134. 
The new law requires health insurance companies to cover supplemental breast cancer screening when abnormalities aren’t found or suspected in the breast of people who are at high risk for breast cancer due to personal or family history, genetic predisposition or other factors. Supplemental breast cancer screening required to be covered by the bill includes magnetic resonance imaging, or an MRI. 
The law takes effect Jan. 1.

 Lawmakers meet at Boise salon to support legislator with breast cancer

Tuesday’s event to support Green and breast cancer screening provided several genuinely touching moments that stood in contrast to the divisive nature of modern politics and the contentious Idaho legislative session. 
Green visited the Two Zero Eight Salon and Spa in downtown Boise on Tuesday to watch her fellow legislators get their heads shaved. 
While she was there, Green posed for photos and hugged each of her legislative colleagues who shaved their heads, telling them the support overwhelmed her.
“I love this, you guys are amazing,” Green said.
Some legislators brought their family members to the salon, and Rep. Stephanie Mickelsen, R-Idaho Falls, snapped photos and offered positive encouragement to each of the men waiting in line to shave off their hair.
Rep. John Shirts, R-Weiser, volunteered to have his head shaved first Tuesday. Just hours before taking his seat in the barber’s chair, the student pages who assist legislators presented Shirts with a humorous award for “best hair” in appreciation of his perfectly groomed salt-and-pepper hair.

Shirts said he hasn’t shaved his head since joining the military in 2014, but he didn’t hesitate Tuesday to buzz it all off.
“When someone’s going through a trying time you can get caught up in the session, all the politics of it, but there’s a human side as well and you want to be able to support your colleagues and help them through it,” Shirts said. 
Legislators who shaved their heads include Pohanka, Shirts and Reps. Jaron Crane, R-Nampa; Josh Wheeler, R-Ammon; Dan Garner, R-Clifton; Mark Sauter, R- Sandpoint; Jeff Cornilles, R-Nampa; and Jack Nelson, R-Jerome.

 New Idaho law, House Bill 134, requires coverage of supplemental breast cancer screenings

Green and the legislators who shaved their heads said they want to highlight the importance of breast cancer screening and early detection. House Bill 134 is one way to do that, she said.
“I’ve been here for seven years and I’ve carried several bills, but this one is by far the most meaningful one … Because it’s going to help so many Idaho and women,” Green told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview Tuesday. 
The bill was cosponsored by a mix of over two dozen Republican and Democratic state lawmakers. Green said it’s one of the most politically diverse cosponsor lists she has seen.
Days after her first breast cancer diagnosis, Green said her radiologist brought the issue to her attention. 
She recalled seeing women on Facebook groups saying they needed an MRI, but couldn’t afford it. 
“And I look to her, and I go, ‘Oh my goodness. If we could just get you that MRI early, you’re gonna have a better prognosis than say for me, who’s at stage two, or somebody who’s got stage three or four because they waited too long,’” Green told the Sun. “And so passing this legislation or being a part of it while I’m going through treatment really makes it that much more meaningful.”
While working on the bill, Green said she’s built stronger bonds with colleagues in the Legislature.
Green told the Sun, she was surprised to see her legislative colleagues shave their heads, but she said the support from her Republican colleagues shows how the issue reaches across the political aisle.
“Breast cancer isn’t a partisan thing. … It brings people together in the worst kind of ways, and gets everybody in support of a cause,” Green said. 
Little signed the bill Monday, a spokesperson for the governor’s office told the Idaho Capital Sun.
“I want to highlight Representative Brooke Green as she has courageously battled breast cancer, all while serving in the legislature this session and bringing meaningful legislation forward,” Little told the Sun in a written statement on Tuesday. “HB 134 ensures access to life-saving breast cancer screening for at-risk individuals, reducing long-term treatment costs for Idahoans, hospitals, and insurers.”
The Idaho Legislature widely passed the bill this year, on a 62-6 vote in the House and a 25-10 vote in the Senate. 
The bill doesn’t take effect until next year, Green said, mainly to give health insurers time to plan for the requirements. In the meantime, she said she’s working on a fact-sheet and educational resources for doctors.
The bill doesn’t apply to self-insured health insurance plans, like at major companies like Micron and St. Luke’s, Green told the Sun. But, she added, “we really want to empower women to be able to continue to push for it. Because (in) Idaho, we cannot mandate self-insured plans.”
Next year, said she expects to bring more breast cancer-related bills forward, but she isn’t sure yet what they’ll look like.

Democrat Courtney Waters, 35, officially won a seat Tuesday representing North Charleston in the state House. She was unopposed in the special election after defeating a pair of opponents in January’s Democratic primary.
She expects to be sworn in Tuesday.
Waters paints herself as a Democratic voice willing to reach across the aisle. She said her focus will be education, affordable housing, child care, abortion access, and the environment.
“I’m just looking forward to knowing the system better and figuring out how to make it work for District 113,” she told the SC Daily Gazette Tuesday night.
She will assume the seat left vacant by former Rep. Marvin Pendarvis, who resigned in September amid a state investigation into claims he settled a former client’s lawsuit without telling him, then tried to buy him off to prevent the allegations from becoming public.
After SC legislator resigned, he won anyway. Now a special election is set.

Pendarvis won re-election anyway in November as the only candidate on the ballot.
He declined to re-take the seat, triggering the special election.
Waters served on the Charleston County school board from 2020-2024, an experience that she said served as a catalyst for her new role.
“After my time on the school board, I was fortunate that enough people appreciated my service there that folks asked if I’d consider running,” Waters said.
The North Charleston native received nearly 70% of the vote in a three-way primary in January. Michelle Brandt, the state Democratic Party’s third vice chair, was far behind at 28%, followed by Kim Clark, with less than 2% of votes cast. No Republican ran for the heavily Democratic seat.
Waters’ supporters included two Democratic state senators: Deon Tedder, who won a special election in November 2023 for a district that includes North Charleston, and Ed Sutton, who last November won a seat representing areas including downtown Charleston and West Ashley.
Tedder, who first met Waters at a training event held by the Legislative Black Caucus on how to run a campaign, was elected to the state House as Waters won her seat on the school board.
He described Waters as a well-respected, outspoken person who can explain complicated issues to constituents.

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — A free clinic to help homeowners transfer generational wealth to a beneficiary will be held Friday and Saturday at Habitat for Humanity’s Omaha office.
The nonprofit Habitat will be collaborating with local attorneys and Creighton University Law School students in hosting two Transfer on Death Deed events, offering individualized sessions.
A TODD allows a person to pass on their house to a beneficiary of their choice, subject to any encumbrances on the property, after their death without a need for probate. Volunteer attorneys and students will work with participants to prepare documents and have them signed at the clinic.
Habitat representatives said in a news release that in 2024, similar workshops secured more than $40 million in real estate wealth for future generations.
Tara Evans of Bellevue participated in an event two years ago. She purchased her home in 2002 and has a plan to leave the house to one of her kids. She encourages others to take advantage of the sessions. 
“It cuts out the worry,” said Evans. “That’s a blessing.”
The TODD events, open to all, will be Friday, noon to 6 p.m., and Saturday, 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., both at 1229 Millwork Ave., Suite 301.
Registration is required to secure an appointment, and closes by 5 p.m. Thursday. Walk-ins will be accepted based on availability.
More information and a registration link is available at habitatomaha.org. A valid form of identification is required at the clinic to complete the documents.

(Grace Hills/ Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The House and Senate on Tuesday overrode Gov. Laura Kelly’s veto of legislation that could result in thousands of advance ballots being disqualified.
Senate Bill 4 moves the deadline for counting mail-in ballots to 7 p.m. on Election Day. From 2018 to 2024, the law allowed ballots to be counted if they were postmarked by Election Day and received by the following Friday.
Kelly, a Democrat, had vetoed the bill Monday over concerns that the new law would disenfranchise voters. The Secretary of State’s Office earlier this year provided written testimony that showed more than 2,000 ballots from the November 2024 election would have been disqualified by getting rid of the three-day grace period.
But Republicans embraced talking points associated with lies about the 2020 presidential election, when ballots that were counted after Election Day gave Joe Biden and edge over Donald Trump.
House Republican leadership in a joint statement said the governor’s “misguided veto was a slight to voter confidence.”
“Kansas voters — whether in rural communities or urban centers — deserve an election system that is transparent, fair, and trusted,” the statement said. “This override reflects House Republicans’ commitment to ensuring all Kansans’ votes will be counted.”
The override of a veto requires support from two-thirds of the members of both chambers — 27 out of 40 in the Senate and 84 out of 125 in the House.
The Senate overrode the veto by a 30-10 vote that matched the total earlier this month when the Senate passed the bill. Sen. Brenda Dietrich, a Topeka Republican, joined the chamber’s nine Democrats in opposition.
The House completed the override with an 84-41 vote, with three Republicans opposed: Rep. Jesse Borjon of Topeka, Rep. Ken Collins of Mulberry and Rep. Laura Williams, of Lenexa.
One Republican, Rep. Angel Roeser of Manhattan, flipped her vote from earlier in the month to support the override.
House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard, a Lenexa Democrat, said the legislation would harm seniors, college students and rural Kansans.
“Senate Bill 4 directly undermines the integrity of our elections and disenfranchises those who are most vulnerable,” Woodard said in a statement. “House Democrats will never support these types of partisan Republican efforts that deliberately make it harder for Kansans to vote.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Kelly-Masterson-and-Hawkins-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

Spencer Cox (center) announces new annual raises for teachers. (Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch) Utah Gov. Spencer Cox vetoed a controversial bill on Tuesday that would have given him the power to appoint the chief justice of Utah’s Supreme Court.
Sponsored by Sen. Chris Wilson, R-Logan, SB296 was one of a handful of judicial reform bills proposed by lawmakers during the 2025 General Session. It would have required the chief justice to be appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate, then reappointed every four years. 
Currently, the chief justice is elected by the Supreme Court’s five members. 
Wilson, the Senate’s Majority Whip, said it would have allowed for more public input in the selection of the chief justice, who leads the state’s Judicial Council, the policy-making body for the judiciary. The bill also had support from House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, and Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton.

But critics, including the Utah State Bar, worried the bill would erode the judiciary’s independence, making the Supreme Court hesitant to go against the will of the governor or the Legislature. During the session, Utah Supreme Court Justice Paige Petersen told her colleagues during a Judicial Council meeting that they should work to “kill this silly bill.” 
“There’s absolutely no reason for (the governor and the Senate) to be meddling in how we pick the chief justice,” she said. 
After weeks of contention between the judiciary and Legislature, lawmakers decided to abandon three other controversial judicial reform bills. A relieved Judicial Council and Utah State Bar then shifted to a neutral stance on SB296. 
After weeks of division, Utah legislative leaders announce deal with judiciary

Cox said that no one from the judiciary asked for the veto, and that the groups maintained their neutrality. In a letter explaining the decision to Schultz and Adams, the governor wrote that the prospect of having more power over the Utah Supreme Court was tempting, “but just because I can, doesn’t mean I should.” 
Ultimately, it wasn’t the appointment that made Cox wary — if all the bill did was shift the selection of chief justice to the governor and require confirmation by the Senate, Cox said that’s “something I could support.” 
Instead, it was the four-year reappointment process that gave the governor heartburn. Cox called it “a very meaningful and problematic additional step.” 
“This means that, unlike the selection of the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, the Chief Justice of the Utah Supreme Court would be required to go through a political appointment, a Senate confirmation committee, and full Senate confirmation processes every four years,” Cox wrote. 
In a joint statement Tuesday afternoon, Schultz and Adams said Cox’s decision “undermines that good-faith compromise” between the Legislature and judiciary that ultimately led to lawmakers abandoning the other bills, and the Judicial Council and Utah State Bar taking a neutral position. 
“Through meaningful dialogue with the Judiciary — particularly with Chief Justice Durrant — we did not proceed with many bills during the session,” their statement reads. “ We will work with our chambers to determine the best path forward. The Legislature remains firm in its commitment to improve transparency, efficiency, and integrity within all branches of government to ensure we’re responsive to and representative of the people in our state.” 
On Tuesday, the Utah State Bar commended Cox for vetoing the bill that, despite taking a neutral position, they worried would have “compromised the independence of the judiciary and disrupted the critical balance among the branches of government.”
“Gov. Cox’s decision to veto SB296 demonstrates a thoughtful exercise of executive restraint and a deep respect for the constitutional principles that underpin our democratic system,” said Elizabeth Wright, executive director of the Bar. “By rejecting this bill, the governor has affirmed the importance of an independent judiciary and preserved the checks and balances that are essential to good governance.”

(Peter Hall/Capital-Star)With President Donald Trump promising to replace the Affordable Care Act , Pennsylvania House Democrats passed legislation Tuesday to make the health insurance coverage required by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) mandatory under state law if the federal version is repealed.
Four bills passed with broad bipartisan support in the chamber that would require health insurance companies to allow young adults to remain on their parents’ insurance until age 26, pay for preventative care and ban lifetime coverage limits and exclusions for pre-existing conditions.
“We’ve seen threats to the Affordable Care Act in Congress, through executive action and through federal court lawsuits. We can’t wait for D.C. politicians or appointees to take away our health care rights for millions of Pennsylvanians,” House Insurance Committee Chairperson Perry Warren (D-Bucks) said at a news conference after the votes.
Democrats, including Lt. Gov. Austin Davis and Sen. Vincent Hughes of Philadelphia, called on the Senate to pass the bills, noting Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro has said he will sign them.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
With a Republican majority in the upper chamber, similar measures passed in the previous House session with bipartisan votes died in the Senate.
Hughes, the ranking Democratic member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, recalled the historic image of Obama signing the ACA with a young boy by his elbow and noted it was an achievement other presidents had attempted for generations before him.
“The context is important. It took decades to get this way. It, and in just a few short years, they’re trying to snatch it away. But we must remind them to keep their hands off our health care,” Hughes said.
In remarks on the Senate floor Tuesday responding to Hughes, Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) called his remarks fearmongering and said the House actions are premature. 
Pittman called Trump a “change agent … focused on figuring out a better path forward because it isn’t working any more.” Senate Republicans believe the best policy is encouraging economic growth to provide family-sustaining jobs that include health insurance as a benefit, Pittman added. 
“We don’t know what’s going to happen in Washington, D.C.,” Pittman said. “Let’s cool the temperature down a bit … and we will evaluate whatever bills that our friends in the House send to us and we will make rational, reasonable decisions on whether or not we think it is best for the commonwealth of Pennsylvania to pursue those policies.”
Signed by President Barack Obama in 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was designed to make affordable health insurance available to more people. Dubbed “Obamacare” by opponents, the nickname soon shed its derogatory connotations and became synonymous with more broadly available health insurance.

The law gave states the option to expand medicaid to include more low income people, which Pennsylvania did under Gov. Tom Corbett in 2014 and then further expanded in 2015 after Gov. Tom Wolf took office. The ACA originally pushed others not eligible for Medicaid to purchase minimum essential coverage. Congress in 2019 eliminated a tax penalty for those who chose not to buy insurance. 
The minimal coverage, available through federal or state exchanges, is required to include preventative care regardless of pre-existing conditions.
Since its enactment, Republicans have attempted to repeal the ACA at least 50 times according to the University of Pennsylvania’s Regulatory Review. In his first term, Trump issued an executive order seeking “prompt repeal” of Obamacare and came with a single vote in the Senate of repealing the ACA. After his reelection last year, Trump has indicated a desire to pursue a replacement for the ACA in his second term. 
U.S. Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Arizona) in January introduced new legislation that would repeal the ACA. And a Republican budget framework passed last month would require “deep, damaging cuts to Medicaid,” Philadelphia U.S. Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-2nd District) said.
Each of the four bills passed in the evenly-divided state House did so with at least 20 Republican votes in favor and Hughes told the Capital-Star that Pennsylvanians need to “speak loud and clear” to their state Senators they want the measures to pass.
“These are fundamental protections that clearly are being threatened in Washington, D.C.,” Hughes said. “We don’t have to live like that with those kinds of threats. We can pass this stuff here in Pennsylvania and protect the people of Pennsylvania, because they certainly have benefited from it.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_3723-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

The amendment would also specify that English will be used in “all public proceedings, public documents, public instruction, and any other public acts of any public institution in the state of Idaho,” except as required by federal law. 
“This is a resolution that essentially says that language matters,” said Sen. Brian Lenney, R-Nampa, who cosponsored the resolution. “It speaks to who we are as a nation. It binds us together as a people. It ties us to our history, our heroes and our heritage.”
The Idaho Senate passed the resolution on a 30-5 vote on Tuesday, about two weeks after the House passed it on a 59-8 vote. The resolution needed two-thirds support in each legislative chamber to pass.
All but two of the 15 Democrats serving in the Idaho Legislature opposed the resolution. Sen. James Ruchti, D-Pocatello, and Rep. John Gannon, D-Boise, voted for it.
Ruchti told the Idaho Capital Sun he saw the resolution as just acknowledging “what we already do.”
“The language of it was not restrictive of other languages being used in … the official government operations (in the) state of Idaho,” he told the Sun in an interview. “It was just acknowledging what I believe is already taking place, which is English is the primary language we use here. It’s used in our communications, in government agencies, things like that.”
On March 1, President Donald Trump signed an executive order declaring English as the United States’ official language, the Associated Press reported. Idaho is in the United States.
 Idaho’s constitutional amendment slated for 2026 general election

The proposed constitutional amendment is slated to be on Idaho’s November 2026 general election ballots. To pass, it would need a simple majority support from Idaho voters.
The proposed constitutional amendment will ask Idaho voters:
“Shall Article X of the Constitution of the State of Idaho be amended by the addition of a new Section 8, to provide that the English language shall be the official language for the state of Idaho, and to further provide that, except as required by federal law, English shall be used in all public proceedings, public documents, public instruction, and any other public acts of any public institution in the state of Idaho?” the resolution says.
Pursuing the constitutional amendment is expected to cost as much as $300,000, according to the resolution’s fiscal note. But if other amendments or ballot initiatives qualify for that election, the resolution’s fiscal note says those costs “will occur anyway.” 
Idaho Senate Minority Leader Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, said she thought putting the amendment on the ballot was a waste of taxpayer dollars. She also worried it could impact court reporting and interpretations of court services.
“It’s pretty clear that English is our official language, and now we’re going to spend $300,000 to put it on the ballot — when we are struggling to pay the bills,” Wintrow said.
Idaho lawmakers who sponsored the resolution that proposes the amendment include House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, Sen. Lenney, Rep. Dale Hawkins, R-Fernwood, and Rep. Kyle Harris, R-Lewiston.
As part of the process of amending the Idaho Constitution, state legislators finalize arguments for and against the amendment to be distributed to voters through mailed pamphlets.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The hottest item at Surplus Provisions in Warwick is a yellow T-shirt featuring a snake wrapped around an anchor over the words “DON’T TREAD ON ME.”
Tonya Pereira, who co-owns the military surplus shop with her husband Frank, said she’s sold well over a couple of hundred Gadsden flag-inspired shirts. They’ve even sold out, according to the store’s Facebook page.
“This is probably one of the best turnouts we’ve ever seen,” Pereira said in an interview Tuesday.

Pereira’s hope is that yellow shirts will overtake the number of orange and red shirts gun safety advocates will wear inside the House Lounge Wednesday afternoon when the chamber’s Committee on Judiciary holds a hearing on Democrats’ latest push to ban assault-style weapons in Rhode Island. The proposal has been endorsed by Gov. Dan McKee and the state’s other general office holders.
The bill sponsored by Rep. Jason Knight, a Barrington Democrat, would ban the manufacture and sale of assault-style weapons starting Jan. 1, 2026. Such weapons are defined based on their function and features, such as ability to accept detachable magazines and stocks, bayonet mount, and barrel shrouds.
McKee, gun safety advocates set sights again on passing an assault weapons ban

Under the bill, those who violate the ban would face up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $10,000 and forfeiture of the weapon. Assault-style weapons acquired ahead of the proposed ban would be exempt and registered with their owners’ local police department or the Rhode Island State Police. 
Knight’s language mirrors the same proposal McKee has put in his recommended fiscal year 2026 budget as part of his latest push to get a ban passed.
But Pereira said the features the state is looking to ban on firearms are integral to modern rifles. One example is the shroud, which Pereira said keeps peoples’ hands from burning while a gun is being fired.
“This would ban so many things that were put into place for safety,” she said. “This is the worst bill I’ve ever seen.”
Pereira is not alone in her opinion. As of Tuesday afternoon, the House Judiciary Committee has received nearly 480 letters on the proposed ban — the majority opposed to Knight’s legislation, among other firearms-related bills up for consideration Wednesday.
Knight could not be reached for comment on Tuesday.
But some writers have expressed their support for Knight’s bill. They include Zoe Weissman of Providence, who knows firsthand how traumatic assault weapons can be. She was outside the Marjorie Stoneman Douglass High School the day a gunman killed 17 students in Parkland Florida in 2018, she wrote.
At the time Weissman was 12 years old. Now she is a freshman at Brown University and says she continues to experience paranoia while in public and has developed post-traumatic stress disorder because of the mass shooting.
Reached for comment, Weissman said she was on spring break and would not be at the State House Wednesday.
“Gun violence does not just physically maim its direct victims: it destroys the psyches of all those in its vicinity,” Weissman wrote in her testimony.
Advocates who belong to Moms Demand Action will be wearing red shirts at Wednesday’s hearing, while members of the Rhode Island Coalition Against Gun Violence will be clad in orange.
Melissa Carden, the coalition’s executive director, did not immediately respond to request for comment.
Tony Morettini, legislative chapter lead for Moms Demand Action, declined to speculate how many gun safety advocates will turn out at the State House.
“Obviously, I would like a really strong showing,” Morettini said. “But really the only numbers that matter are the votes we get in committee and votes on the floor.” 
Companion legislation is sponsored in the Senate by Lou DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat.
Senate Minority Leader Jessica de la Cruz, a North Smithfield Republican, plans to oppose the measure.
“Minority Leader de la Cruz hears from constituents every day who are opposed to this legislation that will effectively criminalize almost all firearms in production while failing to address criminal violence in any way,” Senate Minority Office spokesperson Lee Ann Sennick said in an email.



An assault-style weapons ban and other gun-related bills
The House Judiciary Committee meets Wednesday, March 26, at 2 p.m. in the House Lounge at the Rhode Island State House to hear testimony on several bills relating to firearms.
Among them:

2025-H 5651, sponsored by Rep. Carol Hagan McEntee (a South Kingstown Democrat, allows access to juvenile criminal records in order to conduct firearm background checks.
2025-H 5654, sponsored by Rep. Kathleen A. Fogarty, a South Kingstown Democrat, prohibits local licensing authorities from issuing a concealed carry permit to out-of-state residents who have a permit in their home state.
2025-H 5666, sponsored by Rep. William W. O’Brien, a North Providence Democrat, mandates arming campus police at public higher educational institutions and includes campus police in the definition of “law enforcement officer” for the purposes of the Law Enforcement Officers’ Bill of Rights.
2025-H 5890, sponsored by Rep. Jennifer Boylan, a Barrington Democrat, would make it unlawful for anyone under the age of 18 to possess a firearm unless they are in the presence of a parent, guardian or supervising adult at any regular and recognized camp or rifle range. There is an exception for minors engaged in lawful hunting activity under the supervision of a parent, guardian or qualified adult.

Chellie Pingree via Facebook) U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree and Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey said it’s crucial for states to challenge President Donald Trump’s executive orders and “sham investigations,” emphasizing the legal avenues already used to counter several of the administration’s actions.
Frey, who was speaking alongside the 1st District representative during a tele-town hall Tuesday evening, highlighted cases Maine has joined challenging Trump’s executive order about birthright citizenship and attempts to freeze federal funding, and U.S. Department of Education layoffs.
Speaking to the roughly 13,000 people who joined, according to Pingree’s office, Frey also addressed the federal investigations by the U.S. DOE and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that found Maine to be in violation of Title IX within a few days of being initiated — and did so without following any steps of a typical investigation, including interviews.
Maine now faces several pending deadlines set by the various federal agencies to comply with the Trump administration’s interpretation of Title IX, which views allowing transgender girls’ access to sports, locker rooms and bathrooms as violating the federal law that bans sex-based discrimination. If the state does not challenge the findings in federal court, it will have to comply or risk losing millions in federal funding. 
Pingree and Frey discussed the tense exchange between Trump and Gov. Janet Mills, which prompted the directed investigations. 
“We do have a situation where we have a federal administration that appears to be trying to please the president by targeting Maine and programs in Maine,” Frey said. “It’s hard not to see it as something that’s been motivated by this desire to effectuate revenge, or effectuate some sort of animus that the President has for the state of Maine.”
The remark came the same day that the acting head of the Social Security Administration Leland Dudek admitted to the New York Times that he temporarily halted several agency processes in the state that would have significantly inconvenienced Maine people because he was “ticked at the governor of Maine for not being real cordial to the president.”
Frey did not say Tuesday whether Maine would be filing a lawsuit challenging the Title IX investigations, but said, “obviously, we’re engaged. We are the state’s attorney. We are working with the affected agencies.”
Pingree also emphasized that the president does not have the power to unilaterally cut off funding to Maine, from Social Security to the temporary funding freeze ordered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to research and grants to the University of Maine System.
“However you feel about a policy, the president does not have the power, just because of his executive order, to block funding to the states,” said Pingree.
“Congress can block funding to the states … but it can’t be an edict of a president because he feels a certain way. He can’t do it because of policy, he can’t do it because he feels he was insulted,” added the congresswoman, who said in an email following the event that she’ll be announcing in-person town-hall events “very soon.”

Mike Klimesh, R-Spillville, spoke during floor debate March 25, 2025 on legislation that would set work requirements for recipients of Iowa's expanded Medicaid program with some exceptions. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa Senate passed legislation Tuesday setting work requirements for Iowans on the state’s expanded Medicaid program.
Senate File 615, passed by the Senate in a 33-15 vote, would make work requirements mandatory for the continued existence of the Iowa Health and Wellness Plan, also known as IHAWP, the Medicaid coverage available for low-income, able-bodied adults from ages 19 to 64.
The legislation was amended in committee to require people to work at least 80 hours each month to continue receiving this health coverage. That’s an increase from an earlier version of the Senate bill that set the requirement at 20 hours, but the amended bill aligns with the House work requirements bill.
There are some exceptions to the proposed IHAWP work requirements, including for people with disabilities, in substance abuse treatment programs for a period of up to six months and those with children under age 6. According to the Legislative Services Agency, there are about 181,000 individuals currently enrolled in IHAWP, 12.3% of whom would be medically exempt from work requirements, and another 10% exempt through other provisions under the legislation — leaving roughly 142,000 Iowans subject to work requirements.
LSA stated that about 32,000 individuals may lose IHAWP coverage with the implementation of work requirements. The fiscal note stated that based on data from the implementation of Medicaid work or community engagement requirements in Arkansas, LSA estimated nearly 25% of individuals subject to Medicaid work requirements in Iowa may fail to meet work and reporting requirements and lose IHAWP coverage, with 10.5% estimated to later regain coverage.
The nonpartisan LSA said in its fiscal note that Iowa Department of Health and Human Services has not responded to multiple requests for information, but that it estimated the cost of Medicaid work requirements would result in decreased Medicaid expenditures of $3.1 million in fiscal year 2026 and $17.5 million in FY 2027.
Though few senators spoke on the legislation during floor debate, Sen. Molly Donahue, D-Marion, said after the debate that “the most important thing that people need to know in our communities back home, is that we received a fiscal note that is not worth the paper it is on” because HHS did not respond to LSA’s requests for information. She said she and other lawmakers had also not received information they requested from HHS on the implementation of Medicaid work requirements.
Iowa HHS did not respond to a request for comment on the LSA note or comments made by senators.
“So the only information we have is from Arkansas and Atlanta,” she said. “… We know that in Arkansas, it costs about 27-28 million dollars beyond their savings. And in Georgia, it was 80-some million dollars more than their savings. We are not going to save money on this. It is going to cost Iowa far more — not just the people who are losing their health care if that happens, but those of us who are paying for our health care.”
She said the costs of health care for these individuals will be shifted to others in the system. Donahue argued the legislation will not help push people on IHAWP into the workforce, but create more hardships for low-income people.
“Iowans are not lazy. They are not sitting at home on their little hammock and having a margarita,” Donahue said. “They’re doing what they can, which is why they have this program to help them, because they cannot afford private insurance.”
Under the bill, Iowa HHS would be required to seek a waiver from the federal government to implement these work requirements. If the federal government does not allow for work requirements to be implemented, the legislation directs the Iowa HHS to discontinue IHAWP with a provision to implement an alternative plan if ending the program is not allowed.
Sen. Janet Petersen, D-Des Moines, introduced an amendment that would remove this language. She called the legislation as a whole a “Medicaid repeal bill in sheep’s clothing” — a reference to comments made by Idaho Democratic state Rep. Ilana Rubel regarding a similar bill in Idaho that proposed repealing Medicaid expansion if the federal government did not approve work requirements.
Petersen said the IHAWP program was a “huge bipartisan effort signed by Governor (Terry) Branstad” that lowered Iowa’s uninsured population by 50%. The “trigger language” in the bill, cutting the program if work requirements do not receive federal approval, would strip health coverage from all 181,000 Iowans currently on IHAWP, she said, and would remove the state savings, support for Iowa health care providers and better health outcomes achieved through the program.
“This demands the department to get rid of Medicaid expansion,” Petersen said. “I’ve heard many of you talk about not having health care access in your hometowns — if you look at the fiscal report, it doesn’t even talk about the detrimental impacts if that goes into effect. Get rid of the trigger language in this bill.”
Sen. Mike Klimesh, R-Spillville, the bill’s floor manager, said this provision contained the language “subject to federal approval” for Iowa HHS to be allowed to discontinue the Medicaid expansion program. In this situation, the bill states the state would instead pursue the implementation of an “alternative plan” as allowed for under federal Medicaid administration guidelines.
However, Klimesh said the conversation on the bill should be focused on the importance of work in an individual’s life.
“Work is more than just a paycheck,” Klimesh said. “It provides individuals with a sense of pride, accomplishment, and a deeper connection to society. This bill ensures that individuals receiving Medicaid expansion benefits are given the opportunity to experience this dignity. By requiring work, we are providing an important stepping stone to help Iowans develop the life skills, build responsibility and regain a sense of purpose.”
The measure also directs Iowa HHS to seek approval from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to implement work requirements for other public assistance programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). There are already work requirements in place for SNAP recipients — able-bodied adults with no dependents are required to work, participate in work programs or volunteer for at least 80 hours a month to receive benefits.
LSA estimated any additional SNAP work requirements under the legislation would have a “minimal fiscal impact” on the state because SNAP work requirements are already in place.
The House has its version of the Medicaid work requirements bill, House File 948, on the calendar for floor debate Wednesday.
As state lawmakers are advancing bills to set these work requirements, Gov. Kim Reynolds has also pledged to pursue work requirements through executive action. In her Condition of the State address in January, she said she plans to seek a waiver from the Trump administration for these requirements.
Mason Mauro, deputy communications director for the governor’s office, said the governor has directed HHS to seek a waiver, but that the request has not yet been submitted.
“As she stated in her Condition of the State speech, Governor Reynolds has directed HHS to submit a Medicaid Work Requirements waiver which will be done soon,” Mauro said. “The waiver will match the current bill moving through legislation and will install new eligibility requirements for Iowans to be covered by Medicaid. It will include common sense exemptions such as, but not limited to, age, disability, caretaking of children under a certain age, and those on unemployment. Iowans who do not meet the new requirements will be given a time to come into compliance; those who choose not to will no longer be eligible for Medicaid coverage.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/klimesh3.25-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)PLATTSMOUTH, Nebraska – Neighbors to a compost operation south of Ashland filled a courthouse meeting room Tuesday to complain about the putrid odors and swarms of flies from the operation and a lack of progress to mitigate them.
“It’s a living hell,” one neighbor, Jeff Horacek, told members of the Cass County Board.
He and other neighbors said they could no longer play outdoors with kids or take meals on outside decks due to the odor, which they compared to a decomposing corpse and said was as pungent as a skunk.
Owner acknowledges smell
The operator of the composting operation, Black Elk Farms, located along Interstate 80 just southwest of 262nd Road, acknowledged that the smell was a problem, but that he was “learning a lesson the hard way” about odors created by composting waste grain he was paid to take from ethanol plants.
Operator Andy Harpenau said problems should soon be over at the operation, which was launched last summer.
“We’re not bringing in any more material,,” Harpenau told board members. “We need to spread it (on farm fields) and that will end the odors.”
He added that he does not take waste grain from the controversial and now closed AltEn Ethanol Plant in Mead.
Promises of relief brought some grumbling and some shaking of heads from the neighbors who packed the room used for Cass County Board meetings.
The board scheduled a public hearing Tuesday after hearing persistent complaints from nearby residents about the composting operation and unsuccessful attempts by county officials to resolve the complaints.
About a dozen neighbors testified about the horrible smells and concerns about the potential for contaminating a nearby creek and drinking water.
One board member, Duane Murdoch, said he’d been assured that the compost would be spread and the odors resolved by now, but that hasn’t happened.
Harpenau said equipment problems and bad weather had delayed his efforts, adding that he has four other compost operations to attend to. Attempts to quell the smell by mixing the compost with mulch, he added, had been unsuccessful.
Murdoch, as well as Cass County Zoning Administrator Mike Jensen both rejected those explanations.
Jensen, who issued an order last year to clean up the mess, said there’s much more compost on Harpenau’s property than could reasonably be applied to the crop fields there.
Frustrations boil
A reporter visited the farm Tuesday evening. Putrid odors were evident from a nearby gravel road, as was evidence that the compost had been spread on much of an adjacent field and its green cover crop. Cover crops and using less commercial fertilizer and pesticides are part of “regenerative agriculture,” which Harpenau maintained is how he is using the compost.
Tempers rose briefly during the public hearing when Horacek shouted, “You’re a liar!” at Harpenau after the compost operator said he wasn’t taking any new materials.
Emotions cooled quickly when County Board Chairman Alex DeGarmo warned that threatening behavior would not be tolerated and that offenders would be removed by sheriff’s deputies.
Cass County Attorney Chris Perrone said that the county could sue to end the nuisance or fine Harpenau. No conditional use permit was required to do the composting, so there is no permit that the county could rescind.
The board took no action after hearing from neighbors.

Andy Beshear delivers the State of the Commonwealth address to lawmakers at the Capitol in Frankfort. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Arden Barnes)Saying it “threatens the life of pregnant women in Kentucky,” Gov. Andy Beshear has vetoed a bill Republican lawmakers said would clarify the state’s abortion ban; the measure also would pave the way for Kentucky to open freestanding birth centers. 
The Republican-controlled General Assembly can override Democrat Beshear’s veto when lawmakers return to Frankfort Thursday and Friday following the veto period. 
Kentucky’s abortion ban has exceptions only to prevent death or permanent impairment of a life-sustaining organ; medical providers accused of violating the ban can be charged with a felony.  Doctors had long said the language is too vague and restrictive, and they did not know when they could legally intervene to save a woman’s life, forcing delays in care. In House Bill 90, lawmakers attempted to provide clarity by itemizing emergencies and categorizing what is an abortion and what isn’t one, based on intent. Doctors said the new language confused them even more than current law. 
KY doctors say GOP lawmakers’ attempt to clarify abortion ban confuses instead

Beshear’s veto comes after Planned Parenthood, joined by 85 health care providers, urged him to reject the bill. He also wrote in his veto letter that he was urged by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to reject the bill, with the organization “clearly stating that it does not support this bill.” 
“Although supporters of House Bill 90 claim it protects pregnant women and clarifies abortion law in Kentucky, it actually does the opposite,” Beshear wrote in his veto message. “House Bill 90 creates an exhaustive list of specific emergency situations in which abortion may be provided to save the life of the mother. The bill is silent on any other emergency situations. No one, including legislators, can possibly create an exhaustive list of emergency situations that may occur in a hospital or medical facility. Gaps in the law are literally a matter of life and death.” 
In his veto letter, Beshear also slammed the quick process by which HB 90 got final approval, saying it “lacks transparency and violates the Kentucky constitution.” 
The bill originally concerned only freestanding birth centers, but in a surprise move late in the session it was quickly altered to add the abortion language. That version of the bill received final passage the day before lawmakers adjourned for the 10-day veto period. 
Kentucky legislature approves late-breaking ‘clarification’ of state abortion law

The bill “uses new definitions that have been advanced by advocates who oppose in vitro fertilization and birth control,” Beshear wrote. “These definitions set a stage for future legislation and litigation that put these important health care options at risk.” 
Planned Parenthood’s Kentucky director, Tamarra Wieder, praised the veto and asked the legislature to let it stand. 
“HB 90 was never about clarity or compassion. It ignored medical standards, used anti-abortion rhetoric like ‘maternal-fetal separation,’ and would have forced doctors to delay care during medical emergencies,” she said in a statement. “By vetoing this bill, Gov. Beshear put patients over politics and protected Kentuckians from needless suffering.” 
The conservative Commonwealth Policy Center, on the other hand, asked the legislature to override Beshear.
“Gov. Beshear’s veto demonstrates a greater commitment to Planned Parenthood than to healthcare providers who’ve asked for clarity in the law,” Richard Nelson, the center’s executive director, said in a statement. “The governor’s choice to keep healthcare policy muddled doesn’t help frontline professionals helping women who are facing life-threatening pregnancies.”
Since the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 paved the way for Kentucky and other states to enforce bans on abortion, there have been increasing reports from around the country of pregnant women forced to wait until they were in medical crisis before receiving care for miscarriages and other pregnancy complications, including reports of women who have died as care was delayed or refused because providers feared running afoul of abortion bans.

(Courtesy of PAcast.)At the Central Pennsylvania Food Bank in Harrisburg, Gov. Josh Shapiro announced his administration is pushing back against a move by the United States Department of Agriculture to cancel $13 million in funding for Pennsylvania farmers who provide products for food banks.
“As a result of what I consider to be this unlawful action, 189 Pennsylvania farms will lose a critical source of revenue, and 14 food banks across Pennsylvania will lose access to locally produced, fresh food,” Shapiro said. “Here at the Central Pennsylvania Food Bank, that means 500,000 fewer meals they can deliver to hungry Pennsylvanians every month.”
The funding came from the Local Food Purchase Assistance Program, which was established  in 2021. It was intended to help both farmers struggling during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as food banks that may not have a budget for fresh food. Since the program  began, Pennsylvania has received over $28 million, according to Pa. Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding, most of which has been distributed. 
Redding said in December, the USDA signed a contract to give the commonwealth an additional $13 million over the next three years, but it was cancelled this month. 
The move is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to slash spending across the federal government. But Shapiro said he believes the move to renege on the contract is illegal.
Redding said  he sent a letter to the USDA to  appeal the cancellation on Tuesday, and included a list of farms potentially impacted by the cuts, as well as the counties they’re in,  to underscore the impact on the agricultural community. 
Shapiro says, if the appeal fails, he will consider further legal action. 
“Pennsylvania farmers and food banks are owed $13 million and I won’t stand by and let our farmers get screwed in the process,” Shapiro said. “We are prepared to take further legal action to protect our farmers and ensure those who are hungry get fed.”
Shapiro was joined at the food bank press conference by Amy Brickner, a third-generation dairy farmer in Carlisle, Cumberland County, who provides produce for the program. Brickner said her LFPA funding was frozen in January when President Donald Trump ordered a freeze on federal spending pending the review of programs. 
“Milk is still the most requested item at food banks,” Brickner said. “I kept donating because I knew the impact. This winter was lean and I lost costs that I couldn’t afford to lose,  but I’m proud of the products that I produce with my  grandmother, my mother, and my two sons by my side.”
She was ultimately reimbursed for the costs of her donations during the funding freeze  in the first months of 2025, but now the money is being cancelled altogether. 
“I want to be able to continue the impact that I’ve already had,” Brickner said. “And that is from these grant programs  for dairy farmers to help me cover the expenses and give back to my community.”
Rep. Justin Fleming (D-Dauphin) was also at the food pantry, which is in his district. He said when he was a kid, his family relied on food stamps and government assistance while they worked their way to the middle class.
“I was one of those kids who didn’t have enough to eat going to bed,” Fleming said. “What I’m most concerned about with actions like this that the federal government is taking, they are literally taking food out of the mouths of kids.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Shapiro said  the program is also designed to help farmers, and he’s spoken to some who say LFPA funds make up 10-15% of their budget. And it’s unclear how that can be made up if the program is terminated permanently.
“The Central Pennsylvania Food Bank may figure out a way to fundraise more or figure out a grant from somewhere else … but I don’t know how farmers will make up this market share,” Shapiro said.  “The state can not make up those cuts. People are going to suffer as a result of these policy decisions they’re making in Washington.”
Shapiro has already sued the Trump administration over other reductions in federal spending that have impacted the state. Though that lawsuit is ongoing, Shapiro said he was able to get the administration to reverse course and unfreeze  grants totalling $2 billion that his office identified in February.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/27461_gov_statesRights_12-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Photo by Leah Romero / Source NM)The Las Cruces police chief on Tuesday echoed sentiments from Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and Republican state lawmakers that nothing “meaningful” was accomplished during the recent 60-day session, saying he had wanted to see enhancements to the state’s Delinquency Act and more funding for law enforcement recruitment.
The City of Las Cruces held a press conference Tuesday where Las Cruces Police Chief Jeremy Story walked members of the media through the timeline of the Friday evening shooting at Young Park that left three dead and 15 others injured. He also played audio from 911 calls and heavily redacted police bodycam footage from that evening. 
Four people have been arrested so far in connection to the shooting, including 20-year-old Tomas Rivas, and three teens – two 17-year-olds and a 15-year-old. Story said the potential for additional charges still exists. 
“This is not about politics, but it is about policy. Police chiefs from across the state and New Mexico [Police Chiefs Association] have been screaming from the rooftops about a very serious juvenile violent crime problem we have in New Mexico,” Story said. “We have given example after example after example of real acts committed by kids. Most of the time those kids have a history of violence, like in this case.”
He noted that Rivas has previously been involved in shoplifting and possession of a controlled substance, and has been a suspect in batteries, domestic batteries and aggravated assaults. Story said Rivas is also currently facing charges of smuggling by the Texas Department of Public Safety. The teens charged in the shooting have also been charged in aggravated burglaries, vandalism, sexual assault and aggravated assaults.
Story pointed to the recently concluded 60-day legislative session and said he wanted to see House Bill 134 pass, which would have made quite a few amendments to the Delinquency Act, including lowering the age requirement for a “serious youthful offender” to 14 and expanding that definition to include minors charged with second-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter and armed robbery. Another section of the bill would have limited the court’s options for commitment to probation or confinement for a child up to age 25 and allow the child to be transferred to an adult prison when they turn 18. 
“That had a lot of change that I think would address the issues that we’re facing,” Story said. “And that’s not about locking all the kids away. The focus is still on rehabilitation and hopefully diversion.” 
Story said the current system has already failed when a mass shooting takes place.
HB134 stalled in its first committee, the House Consumer and Public Affairs Committee, whose members voted to table the bill after an hour of debate. Opponents of the bill gathered in the Roundhouse on Feb. 24 to encourage lawmakers to invest in education, mental health treatment and job training as an alternative.
Story said he also supports legislation that helps law enforcement recruit and retain officers. He said the budget from the city funds 220 officers and he has about 188 currently employed. 
“It’s not that I don’t have the positions or even the money in the budget. I have a difficult time fulfilling any of those because people want to be police officers less than they used to,” Story said. 
Las Cruces Mayor Eric Enriquez also added that he is committed to working with the governor and state Legislature to enact “changes in our laws and policies to make sure that our city is safe.”

“Let me be clear, this incident will not be tolerated in our community,” Enriquez said during the press conference.
U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.) also has been in Las Cruces since the shooting, visiting Centennial High School, where one of the victims was a student; touring the Victim Response Center at the Las Cruces Convention Center; and hosting a roundtable discussion with high school counselors from the Las Cruces School District, among other activities.
“This isn’t just about what happened last Friday,” Vasquez said in a statement. “It’s about what we do next—to protect our kids, support our educators and first responders, and build a safer future for every family in southern New Mexico.”

Larry Rhoden issued his second veto of the legislative session, rejecting a bill that would place new restrictions on citizen-initiated constitutional amendments. 
He also signed a large group of other election-related bills into law Tuesday, including a bill requiring labels on political deepfakes within 90 days of an election, and legislation limiting full-time travelers such as RVers to federal-only ballots when they vote in South Dakota elections.
Groups pledge referendum if governor signs geographic rule for ballot petitions

The vetoed legislation, House Bill 1169, would require constitutional amendment petitions to receive signatures from registered voters in each of the 35 state Senate districts. Groups would need signatures equal to 5% of the total votes cast for governor in each district during the last general election.
That would be in addition to current requirements that petitions have a total number of signatures equal to at least 10% of the votes cast statewide for governor in the last general election. Current law says those signatures can be from anywhere in the state.
Voter advocacy groups raised alarms last week, urging the governor to veto the bill and pledging to petition it to the ballot if he signed it. The Voter Defense Association of South Dakota praised the governor’s veto in a press release Tuesday and urged lawmakers to sustain it.
“House Bill 1169 was a deeply flawed bill that would have severely and unjustly restricted the initiated amendment process in South Dakota,” the release said.

In a letter to lawmakers, Rhoden said the 35-district requirement risks creating a system where “dark money out-of-state groups” with more financial resources are the only entities that could effectively undertake a statewide petition drive. 
He added that the bill’s requirements might not be upheld in state or federal court. A federal court could determine the bill imposes an illegally severe burden on political speech, he wrote, and he questioned whether the baseline level of petition signatures required in the state constitution can be modified by a statute.
“I swore an oath to support both the South Dakota and the United States Constitutions – and I am concerned about this bill in both regards,” Rhoden wrote.
Lawmakers could override Rhoden’s action with a two-thirds vote of each chamber when they gather on Monday to consider his vetoes. The bill had more than two-thirds support from the House when it passed, but had less than two-thirds support in the Senate.
Rhoden vetoed another bill earlier this session, which would have offered more child care tuition assistance to child care workers. The Legislature considered that veto earlier this month and failed to override it.

The attorney for a former North Dakota lawmaker convicted of a sex crime argues he should not serve his time in a prison due to his age and health in a court document that also disputes new allegations made last week by a federal prosecutor. 
Defense attorney Mark Friese makes the case that the appropriate sentence for 81-year-old Ray Holmberg is time served, plus a period of home confinement and supervised release, according to a sentencing memorandum filed Monday.
Holmberg, set to be sentenced Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Fargo, pleaded guilty to traveling with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct.
Lawmaker convicted of child sex crime had history of exploiting vulnerable boys, prosecutor alleges

Prosecutors characterized the allegations as traveling to Prague for the purpose of paying for sex with underage boys. 
Friese argues that prosecutors have presented no evidence that minors were involved.
“The fact that Mr. Holmberg traveled overseas with intent to engage in commercial sex with a minor does not mean that he did have commercial sex with a minor. Inuendo is not evidence,” Friese wrote.
Sentencing guidelines call for Holmberg to serve between three and four years in prison, which is what Acting U.S. Attorney Jennifer Klemetsrud Puhl advocated for in her sentencing memorandum last week.
The court record said Holmberg took 14 trips between 2011 and 2021 to Prague, where he frequented a brothel. He served as a lawmaker during this time and some trips were connected to a cultural exchange program subsidized by taxpayer money.
The memorandum highlighted several emails or messages recovered from Holmberg’s devices, including one he wrote that said: “No one is ever to young … remember Prague.”

Friese emphasizes Holmberg’s advanced age and health in advocating for a lesser sentence. He points to a presentence investigation report, which is not a public record, that identifies “multiple diagnosed health conditions and issues” that require medication and therapies. The defense argues that providing medical care to Holmberg in home detention would be less costly to the public than providing care in a federal prison.
Holmberg has served about 145 days in jail in Minnesota, according to Friese.
The prosecution alleges Holmberg, a retired high school guidance counselor who held a powerful position as chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, leveraged his power to exploit vulnerable boys and young men. The prosecution said he still poses a risk if not incarcerated.
Friese calls the prosecutor’s sentencing memorandum “salacious at first blush” but says the evidence “paints a different picture.”
Friese said prosecutors have no evidence that Holmberg assaulted a minor. The defense also disputes other allegations of inappropriate conduct, including that Holmberg exploited a former student of Grand Forks Central High school, where Holmberg worked.
U.S. District Judge Daniel Hovland will sentence Holmberg at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday.

Health insurance companies are under increasing scrutiny for allegedly using artificial intelligence bots and algorithms to swiftly deny patients routine or lifesaving care — without a human actually reviewing their claims.
The high-profile killing late last year of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has focused even more attention on so-called prior authorization, the process by which patients and doctors must ask health insurers to approve medical procedures or drugs before proceeding. There had been protests and outrage over the company’s practices for months before Thompson’s death, and UnitedHealthcare has been accused in a class-action lawsuit of using AI to wrongfully deny claims.
As more patients and doctors voice their frustrations, states are responding with legislation designed to regulate prior authorization and claims reviews. So far this year, lawmakers in more than a dozen states are considering measures that would, for example, limit the use of AI in reviewing claims; exclude certain prescription medications from prior authorization rules; ensure that emergency mental health care is not delayed for more than 48 hours; and require that insurers’ review boards include licensed physicians, dentists or pharmacists with clinical experience.

Insurers have long required doctors to obtain their approval before they’ll pay for certain drugs, treatments and procedures. They argue it is necessary to rein in health care costs and limit unnecessary services. But many doctors and patients say the practice has gotten out of hand, causing delays and denials of care that are harming and even killing people.
In a survey last year by the American Medical Association, 93% of doctors said that insurers’ prior authorization practices delayed “necessary care” for their patients. Twenty-nine percent said such delays had led to a “serious adverse event,” such as hospitalization, permanent injury or death.
In 2023, insurers selling plans on the marketplaces created under the Affordable Care Act denied a combined average of 20% of all claims. Of the 73 million in-network claims they denied, only 1% were appealed, according to KFF, a health policy research group.

The federal role

Under the Biden administration, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice took a firmer hand against health care corporations alleged to be engaging in behavior resulting in limited and more expensive care for patients. The administration also approved rules requiring that beginning in 2026, Medicare and Medicaid plans create a streamlined electronic process for reviewing claims, making decisions more quickly and providing specific reasons for denying care.

But it’s difficult to hold insurers accountable, according to Timothy McBride, a health policy analyst and co-director of a program at the Institute for Public Health at Washington University in St. Louis.
“Each part of the health care industry — hospitals, pharmaceuticals, insurers — they all have a lot of concentrated power,” McBride said in a phone interview. “And unless somebody actually takes it on directly, it’s going to stay that way. I think the Biden administration tried to take it on, but didn’t make a lot of progress.”
It’s unclear whether the Trump administration and Congress will reverse course. During his confirmation hearing on March 14, Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, defended the use of artificial intelligence in reviewing claims.
“AI can be used for good or for evil, and it to a large extent depends on who’s using it and for what purpose,” Oz told members of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee. “I think AI could play a vital role in accelerating preauthorization.”
In the past, Trump has supported measures to help patients, such as increasing hospital price transparency and lowering prescription drug prices, McBride noted. But “Republicans and conservatives generally are anti-regulation,” he said. “My gut feeling would be that they back off on the Biden push on this.”
States have limited power to act on their own. They have authority only over state-regulated health plans, which include Medicaid, plans for state workers and policies residents purchase from the ACA marketplaces. About 90 million people are covered that way. State laws do not apply to the 156 million workers, retirees and dependents who get their coverage through employer-sponsored health plans, which are regulated through a federal law known as ERISA.
Furthermore, health insurance companies are large and have deep pockets, allowing them to easily absorb state fines.
But Kaye Pestaina, the director of the program on patient and consumer protection at KFF, said states have an important role to play.
“Much of the focus around prior authorization at the federal level has kind of originated from state protections, so I imagine there will be continual activity by state legislatures to come at the problem,” Pestaina told Stateline.

What states are doing

Pestaina said states are trying a number of solutions. For example, states such as Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania have given their insurance regulators more authority to directly access claims denial information, in order to overturn decisions or potentially enforce state rules. And these efforts have largely had bipartisan support.










There is a role for some oversight to make sure that things are covered. But right now, I think the system is out of balance.


– North Carolina Republican state Rep. Timothy Reeder


In Pennsylvania, Republican state Sen. Kristin Phillips-Hill pushed through bipartisan legislation in 2022 to streamline prior authorization practices for state-regulated health plans after hearing numerous complaints from patients and doctors.
The legislation created an Independent External Review organization that allows Pennsylvanians to submit an online form to request a review if their insurer denies a service or treatment. If the review organization decides the service should be covered, the insurer must do so. Before then, patients could turn only to a federal review process, which may have been more challenging to navigate and taken more time.
“Our reforms created clear rules, clear timelines for the prior authorization process, and it removed ambiguity or uncertainty from the system that at times, insurers could exploit and providers could be confused over,” Phillips-Hill told Stateline. “Prior to that reform, if you had a denial from your insurer, you had very little recourse.”
The program began in January 2024, and in its first year the Pennsylvania Insurance Department overturned half of 517 denials, which amounted to claims from 259 people.
Jonathan Greer, president and CEO of the Insurance Federation of Pennsylvania, said his trade group worked with lawmakers to come to an agreement on how to change the prior authorization process in a way that worked for insurers and patient advocates. Greer says he thinks Pennsylvania could be a model for other states.
“Prior authorization, I think unfairly, has been characterized as a reason to say ‘no’ by insurers,” Greer said. “The purpose of prior authorization is to make sure that you know the care that you get is consistent with the care that you need.”
In North Carolina, Republican state Rep. Timothy Reeder is hopeful that his prior authorization bill will make it across the finish line this year. Reeder’s bill would set tight deadlines on insurers’ claim decisions and require companies to have licensed practitioners on their claim review boards. Insurers would also have to publicize a list of services they require authorization for.
“I’m not saying that we need to get rid of it completely,” Reeder told Stateline. “There is a role for some oversight to make sure that things are covered. But right now, I think the system is out of balance.”
But some state laws have proven to be less effective than advertised.
In 2021, Texas enacted a first-of-its-kind law creating a “gold card” standard, under which physicians whose care recommendations are approved by insurers at least 90% of the time are exempt from the prior authorization process. But as of the end of 2023, only 3% of Texas physicians had earned gold card status, according to the Texas Medical Association.
That’s why the group is pushing legislation that would require insurers to report which preauthorization exemptions they granted and denied and how many claims went to independent review. Dr. Zeke Silva of the Texas Medical Association’s legislative council said it would be “in the same spirit” as what Pennsylvania has done.
“Our focus with the [Texas Medical Association] is our physicians being able to provide the best care possible. And we want that to be free of burden,” Silva told Stateline. “We want to minimize third parties coming in and inappropriately denying care that our physicians and our patients think is in their best interest.”

(Photo by Lowell Washburn/DNR) For more than a decade, Iowans have gathered at the Kellerton Grasslands Bird Conservation Area at sunrise to watch the unique courtship dance of the prairie chicken, whose population in Iowa has been closely monitored for decades. 
The Iowa Department of Natural Resources announced Tuesday that Prairie Chicken Day, typically held the first week in April, was canceled due to the bird’s decline in population that has resulted in only sporadic sightings at the typically popular site. 
The greater prairie chicken was once Iowa’s most prominent game bird, and according to DNR might be the first game in the state to have a bag limit. Hunting of the bird officially ended in 1915 due to concerns of its declining population.

The number of prairie chickens continued to dip as agriculture and other development diminished grasslands in the state, which the prairie chicken needs to nest and brood. 
According to the Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation, less than 0.01% of Iowa’s landscape that was historically prairie remains. 
Stephanie Shepherd, a wildlife diversity biologist with DNR, said the prairie chicken is “very picky“ about its habitat and needs “huge” areas of grass with very few trees to thrive. 
“We see a lot about how much of the loss of habitat has already happened, and it has, but we are still also losing grassland,” Shepherd said. 
In the 1950s, Iowa recorded the last nesting prairie chickens in the state and it wasn’t until the 1980s and 1990s that attempts were made to reintroduce the bird. 
Shepherd said because the prairie chicken has such high standards for its prairie, it acts as an “umbrella species” for other grassland critters. She said the conservation efforts in southern Iowa by DNR, The Nature Conservancy, Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation and other groups have created “one of the most wonderful grassland landscapes” and home to other prairie birds like short-eared owls, upland sandpipers and harriers.
“It’s sad that it’s not necessarily looking like it’s going to support a sustainable prairie chicken population, but it is supporting lots of other wildlife, and is still an incredible place to visit,” Shepherd said. 
Shepherd said the birds are “incredibly unique” from a conservationist standpoint, but also for their courtship dance, and the associated noises. 
Male prairie chickens have orange air sacs on the sides of their necks which they will inflate and “boom” during mating. The birds begin their courtship dance and booming at dawn in the communal areas called leks during the spring. 

The observation deck at the Kellerton site looked out at a lek, which made it perfect for the festival. Shepherd said this year, only two males have been observed at the lek, which bodes poorly for a prairie chicken day, but not necessarily for the birds themselves. 
“That doesn’t necessarily mean that the population has crashed and is gone,” Shepherd said.  “They do sometimes decide that they don’t like one lek and move to another one for a couple years and shift around.” 
This is also why the department is expanding its search for the greater prairie chicken beyond the leks it already monitors.
“We’ve been doing surveys all along, and the numbers keep steadily going down, but the missing piece is: Are there leks that we just don’t know about?” Shepherd said.
The department estimates there are 40-70 prairie chickens in Iowa, primarily in Adair, Madison, Adams, Union, Clarke, Taylor, Ringgold, Decatur and Wayne counties, though the territory also stretches into northern Missouri. 
Iowans who have prairie chickens on their property, or find them in the state, are encouraged to report their findings through an online form to the department. 
The department is also deploying several automated recording units that can detect the prairie chickens’ unique call, which could help identify additional leks. 
“You can never say never with wildlife, it will always surprise you,” Shepherd said. “So who knows there could be, like, 17 leks out there that we have no idea about.”

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)A coalition of Colorado advocacy groups is urging state and local leaders to scale up the Denver metro area’s investment in public transit service by hundreds of millions of dollars in new spending per year.
The new “vision” unveiled Tuesday by the Alliance to Transform Transportation centers on doubling, from one-third to two-thirds, the share of Denver-area residents living near high-frequency transit lines, defined as providing service every 15 minutes or less. That would require a major expansion of bus service by the Regional Transportation District, the metro area’s sprawling and struggling transit agency, with the number of high-frequency bus routes rising from 34 to 83 over the next decade.
“The question we’re trying to answer right now is: What does transit need to look like in 10 years’ time?” said Danny Katz, director of the Colorado Public Interest Research Group, or CoPIRG, at a press event Tuesday at an RTD Park-n-Ride at Broadway and Interstate 25 in Denver. “And that’s important, because it takes a while to build up transit service, so we need to be starting right now if we’re going to be increasing transit service and get to the vision that we’re putting out there, 10 years from now.”

The Alliance to Transform Transportation includes CoPIRG, the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, the Denver Streets Partnership and other environmental and progressive nonprofits. The groups commissioned a 2023 study evaluating the potential impact of new public transit investments in the RTD system, especially within its core network of higher-density communities with less car dependency.
Under a plan unveiled last year, Colorado officials are aiming to double transit ridership, biking and walking over the next decade in order to help the state meet its climate goals, part of a broader push from Gov. Jared Polis’ administration to encourage more abundant and higher-density housing development. State lawmakers last year passed legislation that will increase funding for multimodal transportation projects and transit operations, including through new fees on rental cars and oil and gas production.










We have to acknowledge that we can’t have highly frequent transit in every single part of this region.


– Danny Katz, director of CoPIRG


Advocates say the new funding — which could provide transit operations with a boost of over $100 million annually — is a good start, but their plan calls for a total of over $4 billion in new and expanded bus and train service by 2036. Initially, the largest share of the investment would be directed towards capital costs, like those associated with the construction of bus rapid transit, or BRT, infrastructure. Over time, the funding would shift to cover the operational costs of expanded and higher-frequency service.
RTD, an independent body established by the Legislature in 1969 to oversee transit across all or part of eight Denver-area counties, has been the target of criticism from Polis and state lawmakers in recent years as it has struggled to return its ridership to pre-pandemic levels. A bill to substantially overhaul the agency’s governing board stalled during the 2024 legislative session, but a subsequent reform proposal introduced this year would make a variety of changes aimed at increasing transparency and accountability at the agency.
With commuter bus routes serving communities as far-flung as Longmont, Nederland, Brighton and Conifer, RTD’s service area of roughly 2,400 square miles is among the largest served by any metropolitan transit agency in the country. The Alliance to Transform Transportation’s vision says that new funding for transit “should be focused on a core part of the region to maximize ridership.”
“We have to acknowledge that we can’t have highly frequent transit in every single part of this region,” Katz said. “There are parts that just don’t make sense to have a bus coming every 10 minutes, if it’s just a couple homes up in Evergreen. This map is really trying to indicate where we would concentrate those dollars to get that frequency.”

Ford Carr raises his hand to make an objection during a March 25, 2025, evidentiary hearing into a complaint against him. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Rep. Ford Carr says Republicans intend to slander his reputation and expel him from the Legislature for being a “scary Black man.”
Speaking truth to power, he told Kansas Reflector, “has a way of making many uncomfortable,” including some of his fellow Democrats.
Officially, the House Select Investigating Committee is considering a complaint made by Rep. Leah Howell, a Derby Republican, that alleges Carr, a Wichita Democrat, broke a House rule about using disorderly words while debating legislation.
But Carr says he is actually being punished for pointing out racism in the Statehouse and filing a complaint against a Republican who verbally accosted him at his desk during a floor debate.
“I would have to say that when you speak out against racism and the Republican Party, removing you and silencing your voice as a Black man is always the intent,” Carr said in an email.
The committee, with three Republicans and three Democrats, on Tuesday heard evidence in Carr’s case and on Thursday plans to listen to both Carr and Howell before deciding whether to recommend the House reprimand, censure or expel Carr. Any of those options would require support from two-thirds of House members.
The evidentiary hearing was held in a room where the maximum capacity is 45, and a crowd of more than 60 spilled out into the hallway. Most were there to show support for Carr.
“This is an injustice,” said Marcus Clark, pastor at Love Fellowship Church in East Topeka, in an interview before the hearing. “The reason for our presence and our support is because we believe firmly injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.”
He was invoking the famous words of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in talking about the complaint against Carr.
“My hope and prayer is that the support shown here by the community today will be influential, that the support he’s receiving from the wider community will be a clear indicator that it’s not appreciated how he’s being mistreated,” Clark said.
Later, the committee chairman would throw the pastor out of the room for clapping.

The 24-point list of evidence in the complaint against Carr ranges from comments he made during House debates over the past two years to news articles to video that shows him shouting at a Wichita councilman in January in a Topeka bar.
Then, in February, a heated confrontation between Carr and Rep. Nick Hoheisel, a Wichita Republican, brought debate to a standstill. Carr had thanked another Republican for not being too racist to answer his questions. Hoheisel subsequently marched across the chamber, thumped a finger on Carr’s desk and told him: “That’s bulls***.”
Carr filed a complaint against Hoheisel, but the investigating committee deadlocked in a party-line tie on whether to dismiss or proceed.
Howell’s complaint alleges Carr violated House decorum during the February exchange. On Tuesday, Carr objected to the presentation of evidence that has nothing to do with the alleged rule violation. He also pointed out that, in order to consider such a violation, someone needed to challenge his remarks during the debate, which didn’t happen.
Carr said the procedure was “100% out of order.”
“The question before us is do we make up the rules as we go, or do we abide by them?” Carr said.
He said the only disruption he may have made was “after the other member came across the floor, after the other member walked up to me, after the other member put his finger in my face, after the other member uttered profanities in my face —”
Rep. Bob Lewis, a Garden Center Republican who chairs the committee, cut Carr off.
“We’ll take your objection under advisement,” Lewis said.
As Carr made his way back to his front-row seat, he told the crowd: “You see how they’re making up rules.”
“Excuse me?” Lewis said. “Mr. Carr, there will be none of that. You understand?”
“I do understand, sir. And thank you very much for that point,” Carr said.

The committee reviewed evidence in chronological order, which included the recitation by Rep. Susan Humphries, a Wichita Republican who sits on the committee, of an article Carr wrote in 2023 for Community Voice in Wichita. It was titled: “Yes I Called My Fellow Black Kansas Lawmaker ‘A House Negro’ and I Regret Nothing.”
When Clark, the Topeka pastor, clapped at the conclusion of the article, Lewis demanded he be removed from the room. There were no law enforcement present, but Clark voluntarily got up from his back row seat and resumed clapping as he left.
Rep. Dan Osman, an Overland Park Democrat who sits on the committee, asked Lewis if he could inform the committee while reviewing evidence which specific rule violations were under consideration.
“This is getting ahead of ourselves, but the precedent in this body going back to 1951 provides that you can look beyond any specific rule in addressing misconduct,” Lewis said.
Carr tried to make another objection about the reading of his quotes from news articles. Lewis told him he should email any objections after the hearing and that Carr would be allowed to testify about them on Thursday.
“I do understand what you’re saying and where this is going,” Carr said.

The presentation of evidence included two clips taken with smartphones that show a heated shouting match between Carr and Wichita Councilman Brandon Johnson in January at the Celtic Fox, a bar across the street from the Statehouse. Lewis described the evidence as the work of “videographers,” although he couldn’t or wouldn’t say who took the videos.
Rep. Stephanie Clayton, an Overland Park Democrat who observed the hearing while standing against a side wall, muttered: “Videographers? Jesus Christ.”
At another point, when reviewing comments Carr made in 2023, she could be heard saying: “This isn’t even from this session.” Humphries shot her a glare.
When Clayton left the committee room, she paused to tell this reporter: “If we’re bringing up the past, I may have several complaints I need to issue.”
She didn’t elaborate.

(Courtesy of Creighton University)OMAHA — As thrilled as they are about a $114 million pediatric mental health care facility rising in Omaha, local health care officials expect challenges, including assembling the necessary workforce during the current nursing shortage.
Helping to address such demand is a new partnership between Children’s Nebraska and the Creighton University College of Nursing, which is designed to bring additional skilled pediatric nurses to the Children’s campus.
Buoyed by the Omaha-based Ryan Foundation, 40 full-tuition scholarships will be available in Creighton’s Accelerated Bachelor of Science in Nursing (ABSN) program. In exchange for the free schooling, recipients, who already must have a bachelor’s degree, will commit to two years of work at Children’s Nebraska.

Jessica Clark, dean of Creighton’s College of Nursing, said she’s talked to many professionals interested in pursuing nursing as a different career choice but who are deterred by cost, especially if mired in student debt. She says tuition and fees for the program run about $55,000. The new scholarship is designed to help break down the financial barrier.
Clark said the 12-month accelerated program — now in its 50th year — typically draws older students and professionals with more life experience. 
“They make phenomenal workers when they hit the workforce,” she said.
 Call to nursing

Marcie Peterson, vice president and associate chief nursing officer at Children’s, said she expects the initiative to produce nurses who “really have a calling to nursing.”
“What we find is they bring a lot of value to the workforce because of those experiences they already have and they know what they want,” Peterson said. She said they provide “a lot more bang for our buck.”
The scholarship idea emerged as various factors collided, Clark said, including the planned 2026 opening of the Behavioral Health & Wellness Center at the Children’s Omaha headquarters site. Of that facility’s total price tag, $16 million comes from federal American Rescue Plan Act funding earmarked by the Nebraska Legislature. 
Meanwhile, a study by state health care entities showed Nebraska on pace to be short nearly 5,500 nurses this year. In the backdrop, Clark said, conversations with nurse wannabes working in other professions explained that the top barrier to a nursing career was financial.
Clark said she met with representatives at Children’s, who talked to the Ryan Foundation. They hoped for 10 scholarships — and received funding for 40.

Peterson and Clark expect that nurses who go through the program will stay at Children’s beyond the promised two-year commitment. Peterson said Children’s has a track record of high nurse retention rates.
She said that Children’s provides an environment to expand one’s career. Her own ascent is an example. Peterson started as a receptionist at Children’s right out of high school, 26 years ago. She entered nursing school and said in an interview this week that along the way to her current position she was helped by mentors and colleagues to reach her goals.
The scholarship program, beginning this fall and supporting five cohorts, will help students as they develop pediatric skills and prepare to serve in one of 89 pediatric subspecialties across multiple Children’s Nebraska facilities.
 “We are building a workforce that is prepared to meet the evolving needs of children and families across our region,” said Pam Johnson-Carlson, senior vice president and chief nursing officer at Children’s. “This partnership ensures that highly skilled pediatric nurses will be ready to deliver exceptional care in both acute and specialized settings for years to come.”

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas’ attorney general on Tuesday rejected a proposed ballot measure that aims to amend the state’s initiative and referendum process. 
Attorney General Tim Griffin cited ambiguities as his reason for rejecting the proposed ballot title and language, which Little Rock attorney David Couch submitted on behalf of the League of Women Voters of Arkansas on March 11.
State law requires the attorney general to approve or reject a proposed ballot measure along with its ballot title and popular name within 10 business days of receiving the original draft. Tuesday was the deadline for Griffin to do so. 
Concerns over transparency and accessibility prompted the nonpartisan nonprofit to submit its proposal, according to a press release. Key provisions of the proposed constitutional amendment include prohibiting the General Assembly from amending a voter-approved constitutional amendment with a two-thirds vote, which is currently permitted, and allowing canvassers to submit signatures under penalty of perjury in place of requiring notarization of signatures.
The measure also would require the attorney general’s office to approve or modify the language of ballot titles. Once approved, challenges would have to be filed with the Arkansas Supreme Court, which would prevent legal disputes after signature collection, according to the press release. 
“While this outcome is not what we hoped for, it only strengthens our resolve to protect the rights of Arkansans,” LWVAR President Bonnie Miller said in a statement. “We will carefully review the Attorney General’s feedback, make the necessary adjustments to the ballot title, and resubmit it promptly.” 


Let us know what you think...


 

One of the ambiguities cited in Griffin’s 15-page opinion is how the proposed ballot measure would change the law regarding the General Assembly’s authority to amend the state Constitution. 
Griffin also took issue with how the measure would amend the ballot title review process. By removing the option for the attorney general to reject the popular name and ballot title altogether, which is currently allowed under state law, Griffin said the measure would create a scenario whereby the state’s chief lawyer would be unable to act in certain circumstances.  
Two bills to change citizen-led petition process pass Arkansas House, but without emergency clauses

“Therefore, you have misleadingly presented the matter as if, upon submission to the Attorney General, some version of the ballot title will always be certified that presents the voter with a ‘fair and reasonable understanding of the issues in the measure,’” the opinion states. “Yet you have instead established a system in which, at times, that will be impossible — just like it is here with your current submission.” 
In addition to ambiguity, Griffin also identified other problems, such as grammatical issues, in his opinion, which was prepared by Senior Assistant Attorney General Kelly Summerside. 
The attorney general’s office has already certified three other ballot title proposals that address education, government transparency and taxes on feminine hygiene products for the 2026 election cycle. The League of Women Voters of Arkansas intends to continue efforts to join them.
“We encourage all Arkansans who value their role in shaping our state’s laws to stay engaged and support our efforts as we navigate this process,” Miller said. “Our dedication to preserving and enhancing direct democracy in Arkansas remains unwavering.”
Arkansas is one of 24 states that allows for citizen-led initiatives, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Altering that process has been a focus during the 2025 legislative session for some Arkansas lawmakers, most notably Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, who is running for Secretary of State in 2026. 
A number of his proposals have already been signed into law this session, including legislation that would require canvassers to request a photo ID from potential signers and inform them that petition fraud is a criminal offense.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa House passed two bills making changes to state election laws Tuesday, including a measure introduced by Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate on noncitizen voting.
House File 954, approved by the House 65-31, contains multiple changes to state election law, including a prohibition on ranked choice voting and increasing the requirement for candidates of a party to receive at least 10% of the general election vote to gain “political party” status. It also has language introduced by Pate ahead of the 2025 legislative session to allow the Secretary of State’s office to contract with federal and state agencies, as well as private entities, for verification and maintenance of the state’s voter rolls.
The issue gained prominence in the 2024 general election when Pate issued guidance to county auditors weeks before the Nov. 5, 2024 election to challenge the ballots of 2,176 voters identified by the state office as “potential noncitizens.” These individuals had self-identified to the Iowa Department of Transportation or another government entity as non-citizens within the past 12 years, but later went on to register to vote or participate in state elections.
Pate said the guidance was necessary because the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services under former President Joe Biden had refused to share access to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) database for the state to confirm the citizenship status of these individuals.
A federal judge had allowed Pate’s guidance to stand in the lead-up to the 2024 election as there were some individuals confirmed to not have U.S. citizenship on the Secretary of State’s list. However, organizations including the American Civil Liberties Union and League of United Latin American Citizens had argued the guidance limited the voting rights of naturalized U.S. citizens who appeared on the list.
In a news release earlier in March, Pate said 277 of the 2,176 individuals on the list have been confirmed to not hold U.S. citizenship, and that 35 noncitizens cast ballots that were counted in the 2024 general election. The Secretary of State said the legislation allowing his office to work with other government and private entities on voter registration verification will ensure that a similar situation will not happen in the future.
Rep. Austin Harris, R-Moulton, claimed that some organizations had attempted to dismiss the Secretary of State’s focus on these noncitizens registered to vote illegally as saying that these voters are “such a small number, who really cares” — but that these numbers could have a major impact on Iowa elections.
“In the last few general elections, between legislative and congressional races, we’ve had four elections that were separated by 35 votes or fewer,” Harris said. “We’ve had several more that were decided by 277 votes or fewer. Just one illegal vote is an attack on all of our votes. To me, it threatens what it means to be an American. And as American, we have a right to self-determination through our elections, and when we turn to blind eye, and we let people who have not earned the right to vote to do that that threatens all of our abilities to self-determination.”
President Donald Trump signed an executive order Tuesday requiring heightened proof of citizenship to participate in U.S. elections.
The Senate State Government Committee approved Pate’s proposal as a standalone bill through Senate File 550, but the legislation has not been brought to the floor. Senators also approved Senate File 459, a measure banning ranked choice voting, in a 34-13 vote earlier in March.
House Democrats largely spoke against the measure for its language banning ranked choice voting. Rep. Austin Baeth, D-Des Moines, introduced an amendment to allow local governments to conduct elections using ranked choice voting. The amendment failed.
Under ranked choice voting, a voter does not choose a single candidate. Instead, voters order candidates appearing on a ballot from their first to last choice. If one candidate wins the majority of first-choice votes, they win the election. If there is not a clear winner, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated, and voters who designated that candidate as their first choice have their votes redistributed to their second-choice candidate. This process continues until one candidate wins the majority of votes.
Baeth said while this election method, also known as instant runoff voting, is new, early data has shown it is a way of mitigating the “horrible, hyperpartisan polarization of our politics” through the two-party system.
“Iowans are sick of hyperpartisan politics, they’re sick of having to choose between blue and red,” Baeth said. “They like to have a little bit more choice, because none of us here perfectly adhere to one particular party, and neither do Iowans. They want to be able to have a choice in who represents them, and ranked choice voting might give them that opportunity. Let’s be in favor of local control. Let’s give cities and counties the opportunity to decide for themselves whether they want to give ranked choice voting a try.”
Rep. Aime Wichtendahl, D-Hiawatha, said while no Iowa municipality currently uses ranked choice voting, the measure could help save local governments money in conducting elections. She pointed to the city of Cedar Rapids as an example of a city that requires regular runoff mayoral elections.
“Hypothetically, if the city employed ranked choice voting, it would allow them to select the mayor in one round of voting, saving them from the cost of having that runoff election,” Wichtendahl said. “… I believe that if we want local governments to save money on elections, and there, by extension, save money on property taxes, we should let local governments maintain the option of ranked choice voting.”
Harris said ranked choice voting could cause a delay in election results, lead to an increase in local election costs through updating voting systems and would require a “heavy lift” in informing public about how the new voting system would work. He also added that “none of my constituents have asked” for the implementation of a ranked choice voting system.
Changes to Iowa’s election recount system passed
House lawmakers also passed a measure dealing with election recounts, House File 928, in a 66-31 vote Tuesday. The bill sets a threshold of a 1% difference in votes — or 50 votes, whichever is less — to request a recount. While the state would cover the costs of a recount if the results are within 0.1% — a smaller margin than the 1% under current Iowa law — the candidate or their committee that requests the election recount must pay for the costs of the recount process if it fails to change the election result.
Candidates would be required to request a recount by the end of the day following the election canvass — the second Wednesday after the election — moving it up from the current deadline of Friday following the canvass deadline. The bill also requires that legislative, statewide and federal races all request a recount through the Secretary of State’s office, requiring the state office to distribute notice to county auditors instead of having this task performed by the campaign.
“This makes it easier for campaigns and for the Secretary of State to track where recounts are happening,” Harris said. “This also fixes the problem of allowing losing campaigns to pick and choose where to recount votes.”
Changes are also proposed to election recount boards, which currently consist of a person designated by each candidate and one other individual agreed upon by both candidates. Election boards, under the bill, would be made up of the county commissioner of elections — the county auditor — county election staff, and people hired during the election to tally ballots. The bill was amended to require tallying staff on the recount board include an equal number of people from each political party. The measure would also allow each candidate to choose up to five people to observe the recount in each county, with the candidate being allowed to replace an observer at any time.
Rep. Adam Zabner, D-Iowa City, said though he agreed Iowa’s election recount system needed reform, he disagreed with the provision changing the makeup of recount boards. He brought up hypothetical situations where an incumbent county auditor is in charge of conducting the recount over their own election, or where an elected county auditor — who has a party affiliation — is in charge of overseeing a highly contested election that could determine control of the U.S. House of Representatives, as reasons where the proposed recount system could create mistrust in Iowa’s elections.
“For that reason, I prefer our current system, which allows each candidate to select one person and a third neutral party, to ensure that all decisions made are fair and the result of deliberation between both candidates,” Zabner said.
Harris contested these concerns, saying county auditors were already given the responsibility and trust to oversee elections in Iowa’s current system.
“We allow them to conduct the initial election to begin with — why would we not trust them to conduct the recount of the election that they just conducted?” Harris asked.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/earlyvoting1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)The Senate on Tuesday voted 39-7 to pass a bill to cap monthly insulin costs for more North Dakotans.
House Bill 1114 would limit out-of-pocket costs for a monthly supply of insulin at $25 for the state’s commercial insurance market. It would also establish a $25-a-month cap on insulin-related medical supplies.
The new caps would affect North Dakotans on individual, small group and large group insurance plans within the fully insured market. The bill doesn’t apply to the self-insured market.
Patient advocates plan to continue pushing for insulin price cap

The bill will cost about $834,000 for the 2025-2027 budget cycle, according to a fiscal analysis on the Legislature’s website.
“I would argue, in the long run, a proposal like this will save money as more North Dakotans will be able to avoid a situation where they’re rationing insulin or missing treatment because of the cost,” said Sen. Sean Cleary, R-Bismarck, who carried the bill on the floor.
No senators spoke against the bill Tuesday.
Advocates who submitted testimony on the proposal said that insulin caps are needed in order to ensure the treatment is available to all who need it.
Opponents have said that the policy would unfairly shift costs to groups like businesses and insurers.
House Bill 1114 passed the House in February. The bill will still need to go before Gov. Kelly Armstrong before it can become law.
The same insulin caps were piloted in state employee health plans beginning in 2023.
State law requires any health insurance mandates to be tested on state employee plans before introducing them to the North Dakota commercial market.
Some other health insurance plans in the state, like North Dakota Affordable Care Act plans, already have their own caps.
The three largest manufacturers for the U.S. insulin market, Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi, all recently lowered the cost of their insulin products.
Because of those price cuts, the North Dakota Public Employee Retirement System board found that the pilot program was not significantly costly to the state.The Senate earlier this session passed a separate proposal, Senate Bill 2370, that would continue the caps for state employee insurance plans but not extend them to the North Dakota commercial market. That bill is scheduled for a hearing before the House Human Services committee Wednesday.

Greg Gianforte, and later at a joint press conference, DeSantis urged the Montana Legislature to pass a resolution calling for a convention of the states [&#8230;]","Gov. Gianforte (right) and Gov. DeSantis (left) speaking during a press conference at the Montana State Capitol. (Courtesy photo)Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis visited Montana on Monday to advocate for a proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution requiring Congress to balance the federal budget. 
Appearing before lawmakers with Gov. Greg Gianforte, and later at a joint press conference, DeSantis urged the Montana Legislature to pass a resolution calling for a convention of the states — a never-before used method of amending the U.S. Constitution — and join the national call for a balanced budget. 
“People have gravitated to Montana. They have fled states that have performed poorly as a matter of policy, and they’ve gravitated to states like Florida and Montana, and I expect that to continue into the future,” said DeSantis, a former Republican presidential candidate. “… But ultimately the states are not going to be successful if federal spending and the Congress does not get under control.”
DeSantis said that 27 states, including Florida, have passed resolutions calling for a balanced budget amendment, just shy of the 34-state threshold needed. He added that supporting the proposal doesn’t mean a state is voting for the amendment — they are voting for the convention to discuss the amendment — and any amendment proposed at the convention would have to be certified by at least 38 state legislatures.
The two Republican governors spoke about runaway spending in Washington D.C., which has led to a current $36.11 trillion national debt at the federal level. 
“In Washington, they’ve been spending like drunken sailors, and that’s not what our founding fathers envisioned,” Gianforte said during the press conference. “We need to change — and fast — to prevent our children and grandchildren from inheriting this mess that they’ve created. As you know, there is no constitutional limit on congressional borrowing. It’s up to Congress to police itself.”
Unfortunately, Gianforte said, Congress has refused to do so. 
Every state in the country except one — Vermont — is required to balance its budget. And “while every business, school district, city or family must balance their budgets, sadly, the U.S. government doesn’t have to do the same,” Gianforte said. 
During his stint in Congress, Gianforte said the first piece of legislation he proposed was a law to prohibit Congress from being paid unless it passed a balanced budget. 
“Shockingly, I was booed by both Democrats and Republicans,” Gianforte said. “So in an interesting way, I actually brought everybody together.”

According to Article V of the Constitution, two-thirds of states (34) can call for a convention to propose constitutional amendments. 
The Montana Legislature has considered two resolutions related to the federal budget. 
The specific balanced budget amendment proposal championed by DeSantis and Gianforte, however, did not receive a warm reception. 
Senate Joint Resolution 4 calls for a convention of the states for the “sole purpose” of proposing the balanced budget amendment. The resolution saw a 5-4 vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee in January but has not received a vote on the Senate floor. The transmittal deadline for resolutions is April 5. 
Asked about whether he hoped to see that move forward, or another similar bill drafted in the final weeks of the session, Gianforte said there was still plenty of time to have those discussions. 
“As you know, there’s still a lot of bill titles in play, close to around 1,000,” Gianforte said. “… It’s not done until they sine die and go home.”
Another joint resolution that did pass both chambers, SJ 9, expressed concern about the federal government’s fiscal policies including the increasing national debt, and urged Congress to take immediate and decisive action, including “a balanced budget amendment of the United States Constitution.” But that resolution did not explicitly call for a convention of states to tackle the matter. 
Gianforte pointed to the work done in Montana to become debt free under his administration, and both governors lauded their states for holding the line on spending and modeling what could be done on a federal level.  
“Because of our conservative and balanced budgets over the last four years, Montana has a surplus again to deliver historic tax relief. In fact, thanks to our strong fiscal management, we’re able to propose the largest income tax cut in state history, so more Montanans can keep more of their hard earned money,” Gianforte said. “That’s what’s possible with strong fiscal discipline.”
Earlier on Monday, DeSantis met with Idaho lawmakers to discuss the same issue.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/balancethebudget-1024x700.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

“Having a website is a perfect first step, but really relaying that information and getting that information in front of people requires the information from that website to be channeled through other media outlets,” said Nathaniel White, director of state affairs for the Alabama chapter of the Alzheimer’s Association.

Christy deGraffenried, vice president of governmental relations for the Alabama Nursing Home Association, said it’s important to have online resources and social media presence to effectively disseminate information to the public, saying that caregivers often seek immediate access to information.
“That doesn’t cost us a lot of money. It’s not like doing print material. … As someone who has dealt with somebody I love very much who got dementia, and it was very sad and very horrible. Even with the contacts I have, I didn’t know exactly what to do,” deGraffenried said. “If we can have a resource that goes out to the people in the state and that they can access information easily. I think that’s important.”
White agreed, pointing to the necessity of using multiple types of media, including social media, to reach the target audience, saying that many people aged 45-65 get their information from social media.
The subcommittee also discussed reducing stigma through increased general awareness, with White pushing subcommittee members to “think outside of the box.” He suggested the campaign should move beyond traditional methods like posters in public facilities and include mass media and mass communication strategies.
DeGraffenried asked about funding for professional assistance in creating public awareness campaigns, but White could not provide specific information on fund availability. He said he would include it in the recommendation in the committee’s report and discuss it with Rep. Ginny Shaver, R-Leesburg, who chairs the task force.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma state leaders have urged President Donald Trump’s administration to bypass typical funding methods at the U.S. Department of Education and place federal dollars for schools directly in the state’s hands.
Republican leaders of the Oklahoma House and Senate endorsed state Superintendent Ryan Walters’ request submitted Tuesday to the Trump administration, which aims to close the federal Department of Education.
Providing state-controlled block grants is a method conservatives have supported, including in Project 2025, as a method to limit influence from Washington, D.C., over school policy and empower states to decide how to spend federal education funds.
The U.S. Department of Education pours hundreds of millions of dollars into Oklahoma schools to support a variety of programs, including those benefiting impoverished students, special education and English language learners, among many others. A majority of funds for Oklahoma public schools come from state and local sources.
In a letter to the Trump administration, Walters pledged that support for special education will continue. He didn’t specifically name any other federal programs for continued funding.

If the Trump administration agrees to dole out block grants, the Oklahoma State Department of Education would categorize schools “into types based on need” to direct funding and would offer a “diverse marketplace of solutions,” according to the letter. 
The marketplace could include financial aid for families sending their children to private schools, the letter states, and would support schools offering classical education, which emphasizes the study of liberal arts and classic literature.
Oklahoma officials said the federal government’s current funding system comes with too many administrative burdens and bureaucratic layers. The U.S. Department of Education uses these mechanisms to ensure states and schools comply with federal regulations, including civil rights laws.
However, states and local school districts broadly control what is taught in the classroom. In Oklahoma, the state Department of Education and the Legislature set academic standards for the topics schools must teach at every grade level and in each class subject, and districts decide their own lesson plans for how to teach the mandatory topics.
Walters often criticized former President Joe Biden’s administration for leveraging federal funds to enforce policies that Republicans labeled radical — like non-discrimination protections for transgender students and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.
“President Trump’s vision for education is simple: empower parents, get politics out of the classroom and put students first,” Walters said in a statement. “Today, Oklahoma is raising our hand and saying we will be the first to take the reins of education for our students.”
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, and Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, supported the request for block grants. Both said they wish to see Oklahomans, rather than federal officials, have greater control of the state’s education system.

“We will continue our work on improving student outcomes and reducing the teacher shortage, which is best done by Oklahomans to the benefit of all Oklahoma students,” Hilbert said in a statement.
The heads of the Senate Education Committee, Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, and the House Education Oversight Committee, Rep. Dell Kerbs, R-Shawnee, also supported the measure.
Trump issued an executive order last week, instructing his education secretary to “take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure” of the U.S. Department of Education while ensuring services are uninterrupted.
Shutting down the federal agency would take an act of Congress, who created the department in 1979. Congressional Republicans are working to codify Trump’s order.
Democratic leaders in Oklahoma opposed the agency’s closure. 
House Minority Leader Cyndi Munson, D-Oklahoma City, said eliminating federal oversight of education would give “more power and less accountability” to Walters, whose tenure in office has been a frequent source of controversy.

“This may be a win for him, but not for Oklahoma students, teachers or families,” Munson said in a statement last week.
Senate Democrats said they doubt closing the U.S. Department of Education would improve academic outcomes for Oklahoma students.
“We have seen nothing so far that gives me confidence this change will be well-planned or avoid negatively impacting student learning,” Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, said. “Swift policy shifts at the state level have already had a negative impact on the classroom. Educators are left scrambling to understand what’s happening while simultaneously trying to support students and prepare for the upcoming school year. This is truly alarming.”

(Photo by Clark Kauffman/Iowa Capital Dispatch)A newly filed lawsuit accuses Casey’s General Stores and an Iowa Board of Regents member of colluding with others as part of an illegal conspiracy to limit competition at convenience store fuel pumps.
The lawsuit was filed this week in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa by a JF Acquisitions, a North Carolina company that builds and installs gasoline pumps found at convenience stores.
The defendants in the case are Seneca Companies, based in Des Moines; OWL Services, a Michigan corporation; and Trive Capital Management, a Texas private equity firm. Although the lawsuit claims Casey’s General Stores and Iowa Board of Regents member JC Risewick are involved in the alleged conspiracy, they are not named as defendants in the case. Risewick is the chief strategy officer for OWL Services and the former owner of Seneca, according to Board of Regents records.

Trive is alleged to have created OWL Services, which the lawsuit calls “a rollup of several fuel-dispenser distribution, installation and service companies.” In 2024, the lawsuit claims, Trive quietly added an OWL competitor, Seneca, to its portfolio and never publicly announced the deal or informed regulators of it due to “obvious competition concerns.”
This lack of disclosure extended to a state conflict-of-interest report filed by Risewick, the Iowa Board of Regents member, the lawsuit claims.
Risewick allegedly disclosed his affiliation with Seneca and OWL, but not with Trive — a “potentially relevant omission given the fact that the University of Iowa Foundation is a limited partner in multiple Trive funds,” the lawsuit claims.
Company claims Casey’s agreed to boycott 
Following Trive’s acquisition of Seneca, the lawsuit claims, the defendants allegedly engaged in “exclusionary and predatory conduct” aimed at cementing their combined market power and diminishing competition in the fuel-dispenser distribution and servicing market in Iowa and southern Illinois. JF Acquisitions alleges it has been “the chief target” of these “anticompetitive measures.”
Specifically, the lawsuit claims the defendants have tried to exclude JF Acquisitions from the market by “cutting it off from the customer, supplier, and employee relationships that are essential” for JF to do business in Iowa and Illinois.
The defendants allegedly did this by entering into what JF Acquisitions calls “an unlawful conspiracy — including each of the defendants and Casey’s General Stores, one of JF’s most significant customers nationally and the largest convenience store chain in the Midwest region — pursuant to which Casey’s has agreed with defendants that it will all but entirely boycott JF”  in Iowa and southern Illinois.
“At the urging of Seneca, OWL Services, and Trive, Casey’s all but entirely refused to do business with JF,” the lawsuit claims.
The lawsuit also alleges the defendants have engaged in a “smear campaign” against JF Acquisitions that has included misrepresentations concerning the latter’s capacity to legally service stores in Iowa and Illinois.
Seneca, the lawsuit claims, has also attempted to “intimidate its workforce” through the unreasonable enforcement of broad noncompete agreements with hourly workers who service gas pumps. In one instance, Seneca allegedly sued a former employee who sought employment with a competitor. The worker was then ordered to pay more than $70,000, although the man’s total wages amounted to only $31,000 per year.
“This is all in service of Trive’s goal of converting its acquisitions of OWL and Seneca into a regional monopoly and becoming the region’s only brand-agnostic provider of fuel-dispenser distribution and servicing,” the lawsuit claims. “Left unchecked, this conduct will deprive fuel-dispenser customers in the region of meaningful and robust competition, and result in higher prices and reduced output. And ultimately, the deprivation of meaningful competition in the market will also harm downstream consumers in the form of higher prices for fuel and other goods sold at gas station convenience stores.”
Lawsuit: Regents member is a friend of Casey’s CEO
The lawsuit alleges that as part of the purported conspiracy, Risewick wrote to one fuel-distribution company “in an effort to thwart JF’s entry into the market.” The lawsuit appears to then quote from the Risewick letter, but all of the relevant text is redacted from public view.
As further evidence of Risewick’s alleged role in the matter, the lawsuit alleges Risewick is “a close personal friend of Darren Rebelez, the chairman and CEO of Casey’s.” On Feb. 28, 2024, Risewick emailed Rebelez, the lawsuit states, “and suggested (redacted).”
The lawsuit also appears to quote from “private text messages,” including one from the head of procurement for Casey’s to Risewick — although, again, the actual content of the purported text message is redacted from the court filing.
Risewick was appointed to the Iowa Board of Regents on June 21, 2022, by Gov. Kim Reynolds. His term expires on April 30, 2025.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for monopolization and conspiracy to restrain trade in violation of the federal laws known as the Sherman Act, as well as conspiracy to restrain and monopolize trade in violation of the Iowa Competition Law and tortious interference with prospective business relationships in violation of state law.
The defendants have yet to file a response to the lawsuit. Risewick and Casey’s General Stores did not immediately respond Tuesday to calls and emails from the Iowa Capital Dispatch.

(Photo by Mary Iuvone for New Jersey Monitor)More candidates are running for seats in the New Jersey Assembly this year than they have at any point since Jimmy Carter was president.
This year, 209 Assembly candidates — 123 Democrats and 86 Republicans — will vie for their parties’ nomination on June 10, up from the 170 that ran for the lower chamber when it was last on the ballot in 2023. To find a higher total, you have to go back to 1977, when 252 office-seekers launched bids for the Assembly.
Dan Cassino, director of the Fairleigh Dickinson University poll, cited this year’s crowded race for governor as a factor.
“The fact there’s a governor on the ballot means there’s more money floating around, and there is more interest in the election overall, and that money does matter. The fact that there are higher profile candidates out there raising money, some of that money leaks down,” Cassino said. “It might not happen in tax policy, but in politics, there absolutely is trickle-down economics.”

The breadth of candidacies has ballooned the number of contested primaries in the state.
New Jersey has 40 legislative districts, and each one is represented by one senator and two members of the Assembly (senators are not on the ballot this year). More than two Democrats have filed to run in 24 districts, and Republican candidates will face contested primaries in seven.
In 2023, when the state’s 80 Assembly seats were last on the ballot, only 11 primaries were contested across both parties.
Cassino and others cited the increasingly uncertain national political landscape as a possible cause for the surge.
“We’re seeing, I think, more of a blending than we ever have of national and state level politics at this point,” said Ashley Koning, director of Rutgers University’s Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling.
Assembly candidates recruited by Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, who is seeking the Democratic nod for governor, account for most of the primary challenges on his side of the aisle.
The 37 candidates running under Fulop’s “Democrats for Change” slogan have mounted bids in 23 of the state’s legislative districts, including in two solidly Republican ones where the Democrats are unopposed in their primary.
The sharp increase in Assembly candidates this year has created six-way primaries in two districts.
In Hudson County’s 32nd District, Assemblywoman Jessica Ramirez (D-Hudson) is running alongside Jersey City Councilman Yousef Saleh on a Fulop-aligned slate against Hoboken Public Library director Jennie Pu and Crystal Fonseca, division director of buildings and street maintenance in Jersey City. Pu and Fonseca have the endorsement of the Hudson County Democratic Organization.
Also seeking the Democratic nods in that district are Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla and Katie Brennan, a former New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency chief of staff. Brennan’s allegations of sexual assault against a staffer on Gov. Phil Murphy’s 2017 campaign roiled Trenton and spurred legislative hearings.
“That’s a hell of a race,” Cassino said. “What that does is, first off, because these are well-resourced candidates, you’re going to get higher turnout. You’re going to get more voters.”

In Bergen County’s 37th district, Assemblywomen Shama Haider (D-Bergen) and Ellen Park (D-Bergen) face challenges from Tamar Warburg, general counsel for the Jewish Community Foundation of Greater MetroWest NJ, and Tenafly Councilman Daniel Park, both of whom were recruited by Fulop. Former Teaneck Mayor Yitz Stern and real estate agent Rosemary Hernandez Carroll have also launched bids there.
The swell of candidacies comes as a broad array of gubernatorial candidates vie for the chance to replace a term-limited Murphy and roughly a year after a federal judge’s injunction ended a unique New Jersey ballot design called the county line. County-line ballots grouped all candidates that received official party-backing, whether they were running for president or town council, and often relegated non-endorsed candidates to the far reaches of the ballot.
Critics of the system alleged it depressed the number of office-seekers by limiting the number of competitive races in the state.
“New Jersey voters are smart, and it’s been clear to them for years now that something in the system is broken, and up until now, our state races have been notoriously uncompetitive,” said Nuzhat Chowdhury, director of the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice’s democracy and justice program.
Lawmakers have since passed, and Murphy signed, legislation to codify the use of office-block ballots, which group candidates by the office they are seeking.
“With the county line no longer being there to allow parties to influence ballots and elections, I think people finally feel empowered to embrace democracy and run for public service,” Chowdhury said.
Though the move to office-block ballots will limit parties’ influence on primaries, it won’t end it altogether.
“Organizations still matter, even without the line,” said Ben Dworkin, director of the Rowan Institute for Public Policy. “If you’ve got a cadre of volunteers, lists of voters who trust you and are willing to listen to your pitch — an organization with those resources to employ on behalf of specific candidates is very likely to make a difference in these races.”
Some party organizations, Dworkin added, are better prepared to campaign for their chosen candidates than others.
Just two sitting legislators are seeking reelection unopposed. Assemblywoman Verlina Reynolds-Jackson (D-Mercer) and Assemblyman Anthony Verrelli (D-Mercer) have no primary challengers, and no Republicans filed to run in their 15th Legislative District.
They could still face challenges in November from unaffiliated and third-party candidates, who must file their nominating petitions before 4 p.m. on June 10.
The number of candidates running this year could decline as petition challenges are filed in the coming days.
Murphy in February signed legislation that more than doubled existing signature thresholds needed to get on the ballot, and challenges could knock some candidates beneath the 250-signature threshold needed to run for Assembly.
In the 28th District, which is largely a collection of Essex County towns, Democrat Nadirah Brown filed to run with 255 signatures and Republican Toye Kumolu filed with 260. Their names would be removed from the ballot if enough of their signatures were invalidated.
Though party organizations have sometimes eschewed challenges to longshot candidates’ petitions for fear of antagonizing rank-and-file voters over an uncompetitive challenger, they have little reason to fear such backlash this year.
“Unfortunately, we don’t know if the public’s paying attention. When we talk about state and especially local politics, this is so hard for voters to follow in any state,” Koning said. “New Jersey has an election every year. Put on top of that the national climate and the barrage of breaking news that voters are experiencing, and it’s really hard for voters to pay attention to elections at this level.”
Four sitting members of the Assembly — Reginald Atkins (D-Union), John Allen (D-Hudson), Julio Marenco (D-Hudson), and Shavonda Sumter (D-Passaic) — are not seeking reelection. Their decisions to forgo bids for another term were earlier reported by the New Jersey Globe.

,DC,2025-03-25 22:06:29+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Members of Hispanic Federation ask Congress for focus on economy, not deportations",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/members-hispanic-federation-ask-congress-focus-economy-not-deportations,,"WASHINGTON — In a Tuesday press conference outside the U.S. Capitol, members of the Hispanic Federation detailed how the first three months of the Trump administration’s policies have harmed the Latino community rather than addressing economic concerns.Frankie Miranda, the president of the federation, a nonprofit that focuses on civic engagement in the Latino community, said the president’s immigration crackdown has instilled fear and failed to tackle economic issues that influenced Latino voters in the 2024 presidential election, such as inflation and housing costs.He said the revocation of legal status for hundreds of thousands of immigrants — many of them with work permits — will harm not only the Latino community but the economy overall.“We want to ensure that our elected officials understand that this is going to have a negative impact on industries, on the economy,” he said. “This is going to have an impact on everyday Americans when you remove workers and people contributing and paying taxes to the economy.”Grants yankedMiranda, along with representatives from 130 nonprofits, will spend Wednesday meeting with lawmakers to talk to them about the economic contributions of Latinos and how President Donald Trump’s plans for mass deportations harm the community.Miranda said the groups will also stress to lawmakers how the cancellations of federal grants, which were already approved by Congress, have led to staff layoffs and undercut services for the Latino community, from job training to legal aid.Federation members were joined by Democratic Reps. Maxwell Alejandro Frost of Florida and Chuy Garcia of Illinois for Tuesday’s press conference.“We saw that this election, the economy was the number one concern of voters across this entire country,” Frost said.Some of the groups at the press conference included the Carolina Migrant Network of North Carolina and the Orlando Center for Justice, of Florida.Stefanía Arteaga, who co-founded the Carolina Migrant Network, said the nonprofit is the only organization in North Carolina that provides free legal services for immigrants who are in immigration detention centers.She said many of those people who have called her organization had their legal statuses revoked.“This is part of a larger systematic failure and strategy by this administration to put people in deportation proceedings and use them as scapegoats,” Arteaga said.Frost decried the Trump administration's immigration crackdown and the revocation of the legal status of more than 530,000 immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.He said those immigrants, along with more than 350,000 Venezuelans who have lost Temporary Protected Status, “now will face deportation,” by April 2.“These are our neighbors, our coworkers, our friends and our loved ones,” Frost said.Garcia also slammed the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. High-profile raids have taken place in his district in Chicago. “Raids are terrorizing our communities, and this is a show of the abuse of state power,” Garcia said.Federation contracts in limboIn an interview with States Newsroom, Miranda said the Hispanic Federation has about $105 million in federal contracts that were approved by Congress but are now pending or on hold under the Trump administration.The Trump administration has cancelled many federal contracts, zeroing in on those that address diversity, equity and inclusion. The White House has also canceled contracts with nonprofits that provide services for refugees and immigrants, from resettlement to legal services for unaccompanied minors.Miranda said some of the contracts from the Hispanic Federation that are now frozen would award $1 million for legal services, $58 million for solar panel projects in Puerto Rico and $16 million to help people obtain digital skills for the workforce.He said he believes these programs were targeted because they either aim to provide equity or promote environmental justice.“We want to ensure that elected officials understand that in these efforts of efficiency, what you are creating is more chaos, disruption of essential services and (losing) the opportunity for the country to continue moving forward in the right direction and avoid the effects of falling into a recession,” Miranda said.Karina Ayala-Bermejo, president of the Instituto Del Progreso Latino in Chicago, said for decades the nonprofit has provided free legal services for lawful permanent residents seeking to become naturalized citizens.She said U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services cut her nonprofit’s federal contract worth $450,000.“It is having us reconsider a fee-for-service model, that we know is going to create a substantial financial barrier on families who merely seek to be able to fully participate in the U.S. democracy,” Ayala-Bermejo said.",,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Photo: Lynne Terry/Oregon Capital Chronicle)Third-party companies known as pharmacy benefit managers, which administer prescription drug benefits for health insurance plans, employers, and other organizations including governments, are driving up prescription drug costs, putting small pharmacies out of business, and interfering in the relationship between doctors and their patients, says Sen. Rochelle Nguyen, a Democrat from Las Vegas and the sponsor of Senate Bill 316, a measure that seeks to reform PBMs. 
Nevadans are being deprived of “life-changing and life-saving prescription drugs and often have to make difficult decisions based on what they can and cannot afford,” Nguyen told members of the Senate Committee on Labor and Commerce during a hearing Monday, adding escalating prescription prices are just one component of high costs. “This isn’t a magic pill that’s going to solve all our health care problems.”
Nguyen said PBMs operate “as an invisible middleman responsible for negotiating drug prices on behalf of a health insurer or a self-insured plan,” and are intended to benefit patients and employers. Instead, she said, drug costs are rising “while large corporate PBMs profit off the negotiations meant to serve all Nevadans.” 
Nguyen told lawmakers that three PBMs – CVS Health, Optum Rx, and Express Scripts – control 80% of the prescription drug market.
The American Medical Association reported last year that the four largest PBMs collectively have a 70% share of the market, with CVS Health leading with 21.3% market share, Optum Rx with 20.8%, Express Scripts with 17.1% and Prime Therapeutics with 10.3%.
The largest three PBMs are owned by the nation’s largest health insurers, Nguyen said. Aetna owns CVS Health, Cigna owns Express Scripts and United Healthcare owns Optum RX.
CVS Health is bigger than JP Morgan Chase, the largest bank in America, noted Kaylyn Kardavani of New Day Nevada, a non-profit organization. CVS Health had total revenue of $372.8 billion in 2024, compared with $278.9 billion for Chase. However, Chase earned higher profits than CVS Health.
Failure to trickle down
PBMs, which receive rebates and discounts from pharmaceutical companies, were intended to pass those savings on to patients. 
In 2023, drug manufacturers paid $356 billion in rebates and discounts to PBMs that are not making their way back to patients, Nguyen testified.

A state audit of Maryland’s Medicaid plan in 2020 found that PBMs pocketed $72 million in spread pricing, leading to a ban on the practice and a push for reforms; 
A 2024 report from the Office of Inspector General found that Express Scripts overcharged the US Postal Service by $45 million for their prescription drugs during a five-year period;
Texas reported in 2022 that of $4.39 billion in rebates negotiated with drug manufacturers, only $866,000 (.02%) was passed on to patients at the point of sale; and, 
A February 2025 report from the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General found that the VA overpaid OptumRx more than $1 billion between 2020 and 2024. 

Vertical integration of insurance companies, PBMs, pharmacies, and providers “is consolidating the market share and eliminating patient choice,” Nguyen testified, adding health insurance parent companies of PBMs are designing plans with large out-of-pocket costs such as high deductibles and co-insurance.
A bipartisan group of 39 state attorneys general, including Nevada AG Aaron Ford, wrote to Congress last year about concerns that PBMs are “profiting at the expense of patients, employers, and government payers,” Nguyen said. 
Last year, the Federal Trade Commission sued the largest three PBMs, however, President Donald Trump’s firing of two FTC commissioners could jeopardize the lawsuit, Politico reported last week. 
“It does not matter if you are from a blue, red or purple state like Nevada, if you are rural or urban, whether or not you have commercial insurance or Medicaid. PBMs are costing all of us, including our state budgets, the bottom lines of our small businesses, and the pocketbooks of our families across the state of Nevada.” 
SB 316 would put “guardrails on how much profit” PBMs can make, Nguyen said, adding the standard practice initially “was to negotiate the drug price and receive a standard fee for each drug they negotiated. The rebate was then used to lower the cost of the drug for patients.”
The model, she said, has evolved into a structure that allows PBMs to pocket a “substantial percentage of the rebate,” resulting in an “adverse incentive for profit-motivated PBMs to negotiate on high-price drugs instead of lower-cost generics, because they can profit more.”
SB 316 would require that “100% of the rebate, minus agreed upon fees and other required reimbursements, go to the benefit of the patient, either at the point of sale at the pharmacy counter or through lowering their out of pocket cost sharing obligations with their health insurer,” Nguyen said. “There’s just simply no reason patients should be paying more for their prescription drugs than their PBM is.” 
PBMs contend they retain 6% of the prescription drug dollar.
“This is not the complete picture,” Kardavani said, adding a 2025 study from the Berkeley Research Group found PBMs are receiving 18 times the amount of the prescription drug dollar they retained in 2010, and the oft-cited 6% figure leaves out billions earned from prescriptions filled via mail and at PMB-owned specialty pharmacies, which account for more than half of their profits. 
Additionally, she said, PBMs are creating instability in the independent pharmacy market by “squeezing out local pharmacies. This creates pharmacy deserts across the country. More than 1,000 independent rural pharmacies have closed since 2003, leaving 630 communities, with no retail drugstore.”
PBMs and insurers are excluding a growing number of medicines, Nguyen testified, adding the exclusions leave patients with fewer options. 
Since 2014 medicine exclusions on PBM controlled formularies have increased by more than 1,000%, Kardavani of New Day Nevada testified, amounting to 1,156 medications excluded by the three top PBMs.
Democratic Sen. Edgar Flores suggested adding an educational component to the bill to notify patients of their rights and direct them to assistance. 
Lobbyist Danny Thompson, representing the Pharmaceutical Industry Labor and Management Association (PILMA), said PBMs in Nevada “have operated with limited oversight, profiting from opaque pricing schemes and practices that hurt patients, independent pharmacies and even insurers.”  
“I call them the prescription benefit manipulators,” testified Liz McMenamin of the Retail Association of Nevada. “They manipulate the market and take advantage of their ability to rake in high profits under their parent company. While PBMs could use their power to negotiate lower drug prices, they instead use it to line their own pockets.”
Jacqueline Nguyen of the Nevada State Medical Association said PBM reform is a top legislative priority for doctors, stating “PBMs and insurers are now interfering with medical decisions that should be between the doctor and their patient.”
Bill Head of the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, the trade association for PBMs, testified the average annual list price of a new drug coming to market is $300,000. 
“PBMs are the only entity in the entire drug supply chain that exert any downward pressure on what payers and patients pay for a drug,” he said. “I think the best evidence of that is the fact that every single state employee, program including PEB, hires a PBM. Virtually every state Medicaid program, including Nevada Checkup, hires a PBM. What we’re doing works.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/CVS-pharmacy-front-Lynne-Terry-scaled-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

Patrick Morrisey signed a bill into law that will ban food containing some artificial food dyes from being sold in West Virginia starting on Jan. 1, 2028. (Leann Ray | West Virginia Watch)Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed a bill Monday that will ban a list of artificial food dyes from being included in food items sold in grocery stores or in school lunches.
Republican lawmakers behind the measure have said the synthetic red, blue, green and yellow dyes are unnecessary and harmful. They’ve linked them to behavioral issues in children. 
“West Virginia ranks at the bottom of many public health metrics, which is why there’s no better place to lead the ‘Make America Healthy Again’ mission,” Morrisey said. “By eliminating harmful chemicals from our food, we’re taking steps toward improving the health of our residents and protecting our children from significant long-term health and learning challenges.”
Several states are considering similar legislation, and West Virginia is the first state to pass a sweeping synthetic food dye ban.
House Bill 2354 bans the use of seven artificial dyes — Red No. 3, Red No. 40, Yellow No. 5, Yellow No. 6, Blue No. 1, Blue No. 2 and Green No. 3 — in school meals beginning Aug 1.
The dyes would be prohibited along with the preservatives butylated hydroxyanisole and propylparaben, in drugs and food items for sale in the state beginning Jan. 1, 2028.

“This extended deadline allows companies ample time to adjust, protecting consumers from price increases,” a news release from the governor’s office said. 
The state’s food and beverage industry pushed back on the measure, warning that it would lead to increased grocery prices and empty shelves. Alternative ingredients don’t exist to scale, they said. 
  Del. Evan Worrell
Del. Evan Worrell, R-Cabell, maintained that the food industry was using “scare tactics” to fight the bill.
“While there are many steps to take to improve our health outcomes, this bill starts by not allowing manufacturers to choose ‘poison for profit’ in our food supply,” he said. “I applaud the governor for signing the food dye bill into law. The governor believes in the [Make America Healthy Again] movement as I do and we are taking steps to improve the quality of health in West Virginia.”
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has told food executives that removing artificial food dyes is an urgent priority. 
“Thank you to the Legislature, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the entire Trump Administration for helping us launch this movement right here in West Virginia,” Morrisey said.

,DC,2025-03-25 21:57:00+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump signs broad elections order requiring proof of citizenship,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-signs-broad-elections-order-requiring-proof-citizenship,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump Tuesday signed a sweeping executive order that overhauls the administration of U.S. elections, including requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote.It’s likely to face legal challenges from voting rights groups and Democratic state attorneys general.The order is an extension of the president’s rhetoric on the campaign trail about noncitizens voting in federal elections and his crackdown on immigration since returning to office.Trump has often pushed back against other issues in elections administration, railing against early voting and vote-by-mail. He falsely claimed the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him through voter fraud. Tuesday's order aligns with a priority for House Republicans to pass the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, or SAVE, Act that would require proof of citizenship in federal elections. That bill, if signed into law, would codify parts of the executive order.States are responsible for administering elections — even those at the federal level — but the order uses federal funding to compel states to follow it. Those that do not comply with the order will have federal funds revoked, according to the order.The order directs the federal Election Assistance Commission, which distributes grants to states, within 30 days to start requiring people registering to vote to provide proof of citizenship, such as a passport or state-issued identification that indicates citizenship.The order also prohibits the counting of absentee or mail-in ballots that are received after Election Day. States set their own rules for ballot counting and many allow those that arrive after Election Day but postmarked before.The order also instructs the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, along with Trump megadonor Elon Musk’s U.S. DOGE Service, to gain access to state voter rolls in order to ensure the voter lists are up to date. Those entities will also have access to immigration databases and states will be allowed to request DHS to verify if any noncitizen is on the state's list of voters.The Department of Government Efficiency, which is not actually a federal department, has come under scrutiny for the access it has been given to Americans’ private data housed in other federal departments.The order instructs DHS Secretary Kristi Noem within 90 days to provide the attorney general “information on all foreign nationals who have indicated on any immigration form that they have registered or voted in a Federal, State, or local election, and shall also take all appropriate action to submit to relevant State or local election officials such information.”While noncitizens are not allowed to vote in federal elections, certain municipalities in California, Maryland and Vermont, as well as the District of Columbia, allow noncitizens to participate in local elections. If someone who is not a U.S. citizen votes, it could lead to a felony charge and subject that person to deportation.Congressional Republicans and the president have taken aim at noncitizen voting, even though it’s extremely rare. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, conducted an analysis of election conduct from 2003 to 2023 and found 29 instances of noncitizens voting.",,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)U.S. Supreme Court justices heard oral arguments Tuesday in a case that could allow states to challenge federal environmental rules in more favorable courts.
The case could determine whether certain U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulations are reviewed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit — which has more liberal judges — or in regional courts, where certain states and industry groups would prefer to make their arguments.
The dispute, known as Oklahoma v. Environmental Protection Agency, centers around EPA’s decision that 21 states’ plans for ozone pollution failed to meet federal Clean Air Act standards. Oklahoma and Utah challenged that disapproval in the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which spans six Western states. The federal agency argued the challenge should be heard in the D.C. Circuit.
The D.C. Circuit is the venue for lawsuits over rules that are national in scope, while local or regional issues are heard in regional circuit courts. The EPA argues that it used a consistent methodology for all 21 denials, making it an issue that should be resolved nationally in a single court. Oklahoma and Utah contend that regional courts are better suited to account for state-specific factors.
During oral arguments, Justice Neil Gorsuch seemed to question the notion that states should bring their challenges to regional courts.
“[Air pollution] crosses the country in ways that don’t respect our jurisdictional boundaries between circuits,” he said.
Gorsuch suggested such an approach could create confusion, if states bring challenges to varying regional courts that issue conflicting rulings.
“We’re going to have different interpretations of the statute with different — different circuits and all these terrible splits and — and, gosh, we won’t have the immediate resolution of the D.C. Circuit that we could have,” he said.
Meanwhile, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson noted that state-specific factors informed each EPA denial.
“It matters that you are Denver versus, you know, Arizona or whatever in terms of how the modeling works,” she said.

Tim Walz gives remarks at Minnesota Management and Budget’s economic forecast announcing a $3.7 billion surplus on Feb. 29, 2024. Courtesy of Senate Media Services.Gov. Tim Walz announced on Tuesday that most state employees will be required to return to the office for at least half of their scheduled workdays beginning June 1 as more companies and government leaders shift away from remote work that exploded during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“This approach balances the flexibility of telework with the workplace advantages of being in office,” Walz said in a release. “Having more state employees in the office means that collaboration can happen more quickly and state agencies can build strong organizational cultures more easily.”
Walz’s office said about 60% of state government workers currently work in-person and about 60% also worked in person during the pandemic. Still, much of Minnesota’s government employees have yet to return to the office fully in the years since the pandemic.
Employees who live more than 75 miles away from their primary work location are exempted from the new policy, Walz’s office stated.
The expansion of remote work during the pandemic has been a boon to both office employees, who can work in sweatpants and skip the daily commute, as well as employers, who’ve been able to downsize and cut their office costs.
But there have also been concerns about a drop in productivity and collaboration from the shift to remote work as well as the cost to cities’ downtowns, which rely on the 9-to-5 workers to shop and eat-out at local businesses.
Walz’s order follows the Trump administration’s move to mandate all federal employees back to the office, which has caused chaos in some agencies without enough office space and parking to accommodate all of their workers.
Like Trump’s order, Walz’s directive faces resistance from the state’s public sector unions.
Megan Dayton, president of the Minnesota Association of Professional Employees, says the union plans to “fight this with everything we have,” which could include litigation.
“We are incredibly frustrated the governor decided to unilaterally do this. We were not involved in the decision-making or the communication in any way,” Dayton said in an interview. “Our members are really mad.”
Dayton said the policy only increases the state’s costs as it stares down a gloomy budget forecast, while taking away a valuable benefit to workers who’ve now organized their lives around being able to work from home.
She said the union has some loose protections regarding telework in its labor contract, including the right to a meeting with one’s supervisor, though the issue is not subject to a formal grievance procedure.
St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter also recently called city employees back to the office at least three days a week beginning April 1.
Earlier this month, California Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order requiring agency employees to return to the office for at least four days per week. Newsom has harbored hopes for a presidential run, and has tried to align himself with more conservative policies.
Walz appears to also have presidential ambitions. In recent weeks, he has been on the road in Iowa, Wisconsin and most recently Rochester, Minnesota, to host town halls in Republican districts, fueling speculation that he’s gauging a 2028 presidential run.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/walz-forecast-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(File photo by Travis Bell/Statehouse Carolina/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — South Carolina senators are recommending Treasurer Curtis Loftis be removed from office, saying he “willfully neglected his duties” for his role in a $1.8 billion accounting error that went unreported for nearly a decade.
A panel of senators investigating the error, which only exists on paper and does not involve actual money, made the recommendation during a committee hearing Tuesday.
Sen. Larry Grooms, who lead the investigation, outlined the final report of the mess that has led to a federal securities investigation and the resignation of the two other state financial officials involved.
SC under federal investigation as auditors determine mystery $1.8B didn’t actually exist

Grooms has repeatedly called for Loftis’ resignation. But the Bonneau Beach Republican and his bipartisan committee has stopped short of calling for forcible removal — until now.
As an elected official, Loftis can’t simply be fired. But legislators could force him out of office, likely through a process known as “removal on address.” This obscure constitutional procedure has a lower bar than impeachment and applies when an official commits willful neglect of duty rather than a serious crime.
The governor must remove an executive officer from office if two-thirds of both chambers of the Legislature vote to remove him.
Loftis responded with a statement saying he “rejects” the call for removal.
“South Carolina’s financial threat isn’t from mismanagement or missing money,” the statement read. “The real danger comes from a relentless, politically motivated attack on my office — one that risks undermining our state’s financial reputation, increasing taxpayer costs, and stripping voters of their right to elect a Treasurer who works for the people, not special interests.”
First elected to the post in 2010, Loftis has already said he won’t seek a fifth term in 2026.
Loftis maintains he did nothing wrong. He has instead pointed fingers at other financial officers and even the senators looking into the matter, suggesting potential damage to South Carolina’s borrowing power came from the public investigation.
“Instead of focusing on real solutions, they’ve turned this into a headline-grabbing spectacle, calling for resignations and manufacturing a crisis where none exists,” Loftis continued.
‘Witch hunt’
Drama over the debacle has played out over multiple legislative sessions and months of hearings that saw heated exchanges between Loftis and the lawmakers. At one point, the treasurer told a House budget committee the investigation amounted to a “political witch hunt.”
Loftis’ office put out its own 58-page document claiming documents provided to the Senate committee were modified to place the blame solely on the treasurer. That document accused members of the Senate panel and acting Comptroller General Brian Gaines of providing false information intended to malign him.
The forensic accountants hired by the state would later refute those claims and reiterate that the treasurer, former comptroller and former auditor all shared a part.
Origins of the error
The genesis of the bad accounting was a changeover from the state’s legacy accounting system to a new one. In the process, a series of electronic ledger entries made it appear the state had $1.8 billion sitting untouched in a fund with no record of where it was supposed to go. The state’s financial officials never alerted the General Assembly to the issue.
But the entries were made in error, and all but $200 million of the money was never real, according to a forensic accounting firm hired by the state for $3 million.
The billions in paper errors never affected the state budget, since legislators rely on a different office for the numbers they use to craft the state’s spending plans. But the state could face penalties ranging from a hit to its sterling credit rating to hefty fines, depending on how severely the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission views the matter.
The problem came to light in the fallout from a larger, $3.5 billion error discovered in 2022 by a deputy in the comptroller general’s office included in annual reports given to Wall Street investors. That ultimately led to the 2023 resignation of Republican Richard Eckstrom, who had been the comptroller general for 20 years.
State Auditor George Kennedy tendered his resignation in January. But Loftis has remained defiant against calls for his own resignation.
“It’s not going to happen,” he told the Senate investigative panel last month. “It’s my job. I swore an oath.”
The investigation
Over several hearings legislators have grilled Loftis about contradictory testimony he gave under oath — that the funds had been invested and earned interest — which later proved to be false when it was determined the funds never existed.
Senators faulted Loftis for threatening to publish the state’s sensitive financial information online, putting the state at risk to cybercriminals. It took frantic calls from State Law Enforcement Division Chief Mark Keel and Gov. Henry McMaster, who had just come out of knee surgery, to stop him, Grooms has said.
SC Senate report says $1.8B blunder is Treasurer Loftis’ fault

Loftis has since contended he was following orders from senators and it was all a misunderstanding.
The matter culminated in a 659-page report, with exhibits, published by the Senate panel Tuesday.
The “neglect,” the senators argue in the report, came when financial officials, including Loftis, failed to report the accounting issue to the General Assembly despite knowing about it since at least 2017, a duty of the treasurer they say is required under state law.
That final report also contained a new allegation: that the treasurer is currently in violation of federal law.
The U.S. Treasury put Loftis’ office on notice last week that it needed to pay back unspent federal housing assistance funds for low-income families, as well as any interest earned on those funds. Loftis has reportedly refused for more than five months to move the money to the correct account so the state Housing Authority can rebate it.
Grooms said they do not know why the treasurer has withheld the funds.
The committee is expected to repeat its presentation before the full Senate. To begin removal proceedings, senators will need to draft an official resolution and set a hearing date, at which Loftis would present his defense.
McMaster indicated last week that he does not support Loftis’ removal from office.
The Senate committee’s removal recommendation joins earlier legislation filed by a House Democrat asking the House to start its own impeachment proceedings for “dereliction of duty and the breach of the public trust.”

(Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa lawmakers differed Tuesday on definitions and merits of diversity, equity and inclusion while debating legislation to restrict local governments’ DEI efforts.
The Iowa Senate passed Senate File 507 with a vote of 34-15 and sent it to the House for consideration.
If signed into law, the bill would bar county and city governments, offices and boards from opening or keeping DEI offices as defined in the bill unless required by law. Local government bodies would also be prohibited from having an employee or third party perform the duties of a DEI office and from requiring or soliciting anyone to submit a DEI statement.
Included in the bill’s definition of diversity, equity and inclusion are hiring practices that aren’t “colorblind” and “sex-neutral,” or that provide deferential treatment or special benefits to someone based on race and other demographics. The bill also defines as DEI programs or activities promoting deferential treatment or topics disclosed in the legislation like implicit bias, transgender ideology and antiracism, among others.
“Iowa taxpayers deserve for us to use the best hiring practices and to hire the very best people,” floor manager Sen. Cherielynn Westrich said. “Why would we not just hire the very best person, regardless of their particular characteristics?”

Similar legislation, amended to include community and private colleges, passed out of the Iowa House on March 18. House File 856 would bar state entities from spending any money, allocated or received through other methods, on DEI offices, positions and programming, with exceptions.
One exception listed in the Senate bill is for programming to teach deescalation techniques and “prevention of bias,” which Westrich said was requested by law enforcement to maintain their current training programs.
Sen. Herman Quirmbach, D-Ames, said during debate it seems like law enforcement has realized that diversity is important in their job duties of keeping their communities safe. Ensuring police have the understanding of their communities’ languages, cultural practices, history and more is necessary enough to put into this bill, he said, but the legislation would prohibit another important aspect of serving communities — recruiting from a diverse applicant pool in order to have the best force possible.
“I want to choose the most qualified police officers, the most qualified candidates,” Quirmbach said. “But when you deal with issues like this, diversity is one of the elements of merit. We hear this from the other side of the aisle all the time, ‘Oh, well, we’re all about merit.’ Well, diversity and merit are not antithetical.”
This applies to other areas of public work as well, Quirmbach said, from firefighters to 911 operators to housing coordinators. Limiting applicant pools by barring departments from recruiting from diverse areas stops cities and counties from having the most qualified people in the job, he said.
Other Democratic lawmakers agreed with Quirmbach, voicing concerns about how the legislation could affect human rights commissions, cultural and ethnic recognition and celebrations and emphasizing that DEI is necessary in the worlds of business, academics and government.
Westrich pointed out during debate the Senate has a female president and the Republican caucus as an Indian chief of staff and “many diverse people” as members, elected or appointed without the need for DEI training or policies.
Westrich said the words making up DEI in the context of local government have only served to apply unequal standards and set preferential outcomes for people based on their race, sex, gender identity and other demographics.
“The DEI movement is not about a sincere desire to make local government more diverse, more fair, more inclusive,” Westrich said. “Equal rights based on merit, talent, skill and qualifications is what we should have in our local government.”
When asked by Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, about examples of local governing bodies breaking current Iowa law and discriminating against people in their hiring practices, Westrich said she has no specific examples but she knows that with DEI practices going on across the state, it has been happening.
Most pieces of legislation introduced to the Senate usually come with at least one example of a negative consequence of whatever it is the body is trying to change, Wahls said, adding it was “unfortunate” Westrich had none.

Elliott Pritt, R-Fayette, a public school teacher, speaks in support of an elementary school student discipline bill in the House of Delegates on Tuesday, March 25, 2025 in Charleston, W.Va. (Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)A bill that would bolster elementary school teachers’ ability to remove disruptive and violent students passed the West Virginia House of Delegates, nearing the finish line at Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s desk. 
The measure is two years in the making and the top request of teachers across the state, who say worsening student behavior — particularly among the state’s youngest learners — has impeded their ability to teach. 
“We have to look after and take care of all the other kids that are in the class whose education is being disrupted by the behavior of very few. It’s about time we stood up,” said Del. Elliott Pritt, R-Fayette, who is a public school teacher.
The Senate unanimously signed off on Senate Bill 199, and the House of Delegates passed the measure with a 94-3 vote.
The bill outlines how and why teachers in kindergarten through sixth grade classrooms can remove students who are violent, threatening or intimidating toward staff or peers, or students’ whose behavior is impeding on other students’ ability to learn. The House amended the bill to include pre-K classrooms that are on public school grounds.
  Del. Joe Ellington, R-Mercer
“You’re not only taking care of the student who may be disciplined, potentially disciplined … It also helps the other students in the classroom, and also just helps things run a lot smoother in class, more satisfaction from our teachers, staff and the students and parents,” said House Education Chair Del. Joe Ellington, R-Mercer.
The bill also mandates that school counselors and social workers work to determine any underlying cause of the child’s behavior. Many educators have tied children’s dangerous behavior or outbursts to the state’s ongoing substance abuse crisis and high rate of kids in foster care.
A similar bill died on the final night of the legislative session last year. 
Bill sponsor Sen. Amy Grady, R-Mason, said additional work in the last year has resulted in better legislation that will help the state’s vulnerable children. Opponents of the bill have worried that children would end up out of school with limited support and forced to attend virtual school. 
Grady, who is a public school teacher, said that only 1% of students are violent.
  Sen. Amy Grady, R-Mason
“We want a bill that’s going to work and that also helps our more vulnerable children,” she said. “We want to make sure that we have things in place that will help them, as well, prior to just removing them from the classroom — that it’s giving them some opportunities, possibly, to change the behavior. Because we’re talking about little kids, you know, and they need second chances.”
Three Democrats in the House voted against the measure, citing concerns about potentially unqualified counselors or social workers conducting an assessment to determine the underlying cause of a child’s behavior.
“There are some serious flaws in here, so I would have to vote no on this iteration of it,” said Del. Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell. 
Pritt said the bill was the result of a compromise and didn’t go far enough to support teachers, but it was time for the Legislature to act.
Grady said that the bill will empower teachers, who regularly are beholden to their school administrator to step in and remove the child. 
“We want to allow our teachers to be able to teach, while also trying to provide these students that are causing the disruptions with the help they also need, based on what the school can provide,” she said.

Braaten also represents landowners in a lawsuit that challenges state laws related to carbon dioxide storage. (Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)Summit Carbon Solutions is asking North Dakota judges to dismiss appeals in different legal challenges to its five-state carbon capture and storage project. 
Attorneys for Summit and North Dakota landowners argued a Summit request for dismissal in a Burleigh County Court on Tuesday. Landowners have appealed the legality of the North Dakota Industrial Commission’s order granting Summit permission to pump carbon dioxide into underground sequestration sites in Mercer, Oliver and Morton counties. 
Summit also has filed motions to dismiss appeals related to the North Dakota Public Service Commission’s pipeline route permit. 
Summit is attempting to move carbon captured at ethanol plants in five states to the underground storage site in North Dakota through a network of pipelines.

The case heard Tuesday in Burleigh County involves landowners who have objected to the storage plan. Summit’s motion to dismiss argues that landowner attorney Derrick Braaten did not notify parties properly and that the case does not belong in Burleigh County but instead belongs in one of the counties where the storage wells are planned. 
“This is not the only case where Summit is making these arguments,” Braaten said. 
The hourlong hearing on Tuesday focused on procedural issues and not the merits of the appeal. Landowners contend the state Department of Mineral Resources withheld information about Summit’s models that would predict where the carbon dioxide would move when the gas is pumped underground.  
Braaten also is involved in appeals on the PSC decision involving Burleigh County, Emmons County, the city of Bismarck and multiple landowners. In those cases, Summit also says not all parties were notified properly. 
Among the issues being challenged are the PSC ruling that state zoning rules trump county zoning ordinances on pipelines and that the PSC did not give enough weight to the safety of residents along the proposed route. 
A hearing on one motion to dismiss was held Monday and another is set for April 22. 
Each of the three cases has a different judge. 
No ruling has been issued in either of the motions argued this week.

Housing New Mexico, aka the New Mexico Mortgage Finance Authority, on Monday announced a pilot program to make more affordable rental properties available for tenants on rental assistance by offering forgivable loans to landlords to improve them.
The Rehab-2-Rental program is offering forgivable loans of up to $25,000 to landlords who currently lease or agree to lease their properties to renters who hold tenant-based housing vouchers like Section 8, Linkages and local government rental assistance, according to a news release.
The landlords would use the loan money to pay for needed improvements to rental units to make them ready to rent, the news release states.
Housing New Mexico’s Board of Directors in February approved $656,000 for the program. According to the notice of funding, landlords must commit to offering the lease at a rate affordable to the tenant for five years, and must commit to meeting the real estate inspection standards set by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
“Whether it’s single-family homes or rental properties, New Mexico is in great need of affordable housing for its residents,” Housing New Mexico Executive Director and CEO Isidoro Hernandez said in a statement. “This program is a win-win in that it will help landlords with funding to bring rentals up to standards and will provide more opportunities for affordable housing in the state.”
According to the news release, private companies, public housing authorities and others are eligible to apply by submitting rehabilitation projects on behalf of private landlords.

""Freedom of Conscience in the Workplace Act"" was first slated to be heard (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)A hotly contested proposal that would prohibit the use of preferred pronouns in state and local government workplaces, and limit gender identity training for state and local government employees, won approval in its first committee stop on Tuesday.
Labeled the “Freedom of Conscience in the Workplace Act” (SB 440), the measure, sponsored by Ocala Republican Stan McClain, says that an employee in a public workplace may not be required to refer to another person using that person’s preferred pronouns if such pronouns don’t correspond to that person’s sex at birth. 
It says that a public employee or contractor similarly cannot require his or her employer to use their preferred pronouns under the same circumstances. Additionally, job applications in public workplaces may only ask an applicant whether they are male or female and may not provide a nonbinary option.
No government employer could punish an applicant, employee, or contractor because of their “religious, moral, conscience-based, or biology based” beliefs, including if they oppose same-sex marriage or disagree with “gender ideology,” whether at or away from the worksite.
The measure would not affect the private sector, insisted Sen. McClain.
Dozens of speakers signed up to denounce the proposal, which compelled committee chair Sen. Randy Fine to limit public comments to just 30 seconds.
“We need to oppose the bill to avoid the continued suppression of our speech viewpoint and self-determination here in Florida,” said Monica Davis, with the group Florida Rising. “The bill would promote workplace discrimination by supporting the outdated ideas that the use of transgender person-affirming pronouns are disconnected from reality.”
“Speaking as someone who doesn’t support the Venezuelan government, nor the Cuban government, it’s really appalling to see that the Cuban government and the Venezuelan government show more respect for gender identity than here in the Florida Legislature,” said Vanessa Garcia, who said she was born in Venezuela. “And these are countries that are oppressive and restrictive so this is not the land of the free.”
Claudia Thomas, elected late last year as the Central Florida city of Sanford’s first openly LGBTQ member of the City Commission, said she would “love” to get back to her city’s problems with water, housing, and other matters instead of “wasting her time talking about pronouns.”
“Your bill is misnamed: It should be the ‘Freedom from Conscience’ Act,” she declared.
The measure would also make it  illegal for any local government to require any training, instruction, or other activity on sexual orientation.
‘Terrorist rag’
The audience reacted derisively after Sen. Fine cracked, “Enjoy your terrorist rag,” after a speaker wearing a keffiyeh over his shoulder left the dais. As members of the audience jeered him, Fine was defiant, saying, “I’m the chairman, I can say what i want. If you don’t like it, you can leave.”
As the audience continued to make noise, Fine — who said earlier on Tuesday that this would be his last day in the Legislature as he seeks a congressional seat next week — warned that he would clear the room if he heard “one more outburst.”
“I don’t have to have any of you sit here. One more. One more. I’ll clear the room. We’ll debate, and we’ll vote.”
The meeting resumed without any more outbursts.
‘Hostile work environment’
The only legislator to speak about the bill was Orange County Democrat Kristen Arrington, who said she didn’t understand the need for the legislation.
“The bill really does promote government employers and contractors to harass transgender individuals by allowing them to intentionally misgender them by using disrespectful pronouns and having no consequences,” she said. “And this is a license to discriminate, free from accountability. It seems that’s an attempt to create a hostile work environment for LGBTQ people, particularly transgender Floridians.”
The bill defines gender identity as “a fully internal and subjective sense of self, disconnected from biological reality and sex, and existing on an infinite continuum that does not provide a meaningful basis for identification and cannot be recognized as a replacement for sex.”
“We’re not going to allow state employees to be coerced by their employers or subcontractors going forward,” declared Sen. McClain in making his closing pitch to the Senate Committee on Government Oversight and Accountability, which ultimately passed it on a party-line vote. It has two more committee stops before making the floor.
A companion bill filed in the House (HB 1495) by Seminole Republican Rachel Plakon has yet to be heard in committee.

“In Florida, we are committed to upholding the truth and the words ‘never forget,’ and we will continue to sponsor causes and find ways to ensure our next generation is able to learn about the horrible ordeal that these survivors had to face,” DeSantis said. 
DeSantis presented Holocaust survivor David Schaecter with the governor’s medal of freedom. Schaecter moved to Miami in the 1950s after surviving Auschwitz. 
The governor touted legislation he has signed providing extra security for Jewish Day schools, increased Holocaust education, and flying Americans from Israel after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel.

Following the unveiling of the memorial, legislators kicked off Israel Day at the Capitol along with Israeli Consul General Maor Elbaz-Starinsky and Tallahassee Mayor John Dailey.
“It’s our duty as a Legislature to educate. Antisemitism thrives in ignorance,” Rep.

Mike Huckabee fielded questions about his nomination as ambassador to Israel during a congressional hearing punctuated by protests Tuesday. 
President Donald Trump nominated Huckabee for the role in November. The native Arkansan has no foreign policy experience, but has visited Israel several times.
The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee also questioned Reed Rubinstein, State Department legal adviser nominee, and Kevin Cabrera, Panama ambassador nominee, but Huckabee’s remarks were the only ones interrupted multiple times by audience members who were removed after shouting about “desecrating the Holy Land” and “misus[ing] Christianity to justify ethnic cleansing.”
Hamas militants launched an attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and tens of thousands of people have died in the conflict since Israel retaliated. A ceasefire negotiated in January was broken last week when Israeli strikes killed hundreds of Palestinians in Gaza. 
Ranking committee member and New Hampshire Democrat Jeanne Shaheen said it’s important to get the parties back to the negotiating table. Noting Huckabee’s previous support for Israeli annexation of the West Bank and total Israeli control of Palestinian territory, Shaheen called the rhetoric “highly incendiary across the Middle East and the entire Muslim world.”
“And so I hope that you will think about how to advance long-term peace and stability in the region,” she said.
Former Arkansas governor says Trump’s Israel ambassador nomination is an honor

An evangelical Christian, Huckabee is a long-time supporter of Israel and has opposed a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine. Huckabee told the committee Tuesday that he wasn’t there to defend his views and repeatedly said that if confirmed, he would enforce Trump’s policies.
“An ambassador doesn’t create the policy, he carries the policy of his country and his president,” he said.
Asked by Oregon Democrat Sen. Jeff Merkley if he supports Trump’s plans to remove Palestinians from Gaza, Huckabee said the president has never called for forced displacement, but rather to ensure there is “a safe and secure place for people to live during the process of cleaning out what is a disastrous mess.”
Trump last month suggested the idea of the United States taking control of Gaza. When asked during a Fox News interview if Palestinians would have a right to return to the territory, Trump said “no, they wouldn’t,” noting it would be years before the land would be habitable. 
While it may not be possible today, Nevada Democrat Sen. Jacky Rosen said she firmly believes a two-state solution should be the ultimate goal and inform how the U.S. approaches the Israel-Palestine conflict. Rosen asked if Huckabee agreed and if not, requested an alternative approach.
“The question is not is there a need for people who are Palestinian to be able to live and have a future, the question is where and when,” he said. “Where will that be? Will it be on top of the Israeli Jewish state or will it be somewhere that is decided upon that would be completely different, only for those who wish to locate there?”
Trump’s goal is to see “a real and lasting peace” in the Middle East, according to Huckabee, who said he believes the president could achieve something of “biblical proportion.”
“If confirmed, I want to be able to take the clarity of his voice and moral understanding of what should happen in the Middle East in dealing with terrorism and being able to be part of something historic, to stop that which has murdered and destroyed the lives and livelihoods, not only of soldiers, but of civilians,” he said. 
After visiting Israel for the first time in 1973, Huckabee began taking groups there in 1981. He told the committee he’s led “tens of thousands” of people to the “Bible lands” over the course of approximately 100 trips.
An ordained Southern Baptist pastor, Huckabee hosted a talk show on Trinity Broadcasting Network that ended in January. He also previously hosted shows on Fox News and was syndicated on Cumulus Media Networks.
Huckabee served as Arkansas’ governor from 1996 through 2006 before running for president in the 2008 and 2016 Republican primaries. He is the father of the current governor, Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

(Photo courtesy of MaineHealth)An obstetrics and gynecology doctor left Franklin Hospital in Farmington for a job out of state that offered higher pay. A hospitalist, an ear, nose and throat doctor and two orthopedists also recently declined offers at Waldo Hospital in Belfast all citing low pay. 
These are just some examples of the hiring challenges rural hospitals are facing, which brought Katie Fullam Harris, chief government affairs officer with MaineHealth, before the Legislature’s Labor Committee Tuesday to ask that its members support a change to the state’s equal pay law.
“So the gist of it is you’d like to pay people more money but you’re afraid you’re going to be in violation of Maine wage laws?” asked Sen. Dick Bradstreet (R-Kennebec).
Answering in the affirmative, Harris said MaineHealth wants the flexibility to offer a candidate who could fill a specialist position higher base pay to move to Norway, for example, or some other rural corner of the state where the organization has had trouble recruiting. 
Senate Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook) introduced LD 898 as a vehicle to address hiring challenges at rural hospitals, while staying true to the intention of the state’s equal pay law, which is in part to close the gender pay gap. Specifically, the proposal would amend the law to allow pay differentials based on geographic location and credentials. 
Under current law, MaineHealth has to pay an oncologist in Portland the same it pays an oncologist in Farmington. This bill would allow for a scenario in which the organization could offer a higher base salary to the Farmington physician because it’s much harder to convince people to work there than in southern Maine, Harris explained. 
The Maine Department of Labor had planned to oppose the bill, said legislative liaison Dillon Murray, who instead asked for more time to consider after learning more about the intention behind the change. In general, Murray said the department wants to be cautious with any changes made to the state’s equal pay law. 
Committee members asked Harris if the healthcare organization could use bonuses or other forms of compensation such as housing or transportation stipends to make offers in rural areas more attractive. 
But those aren’t the barriers keeping specialists from rural hospitals, she said. Rather, “we have been told over and over again that the reason that we’re being turned down for these positions is because we cannot offer compensation that is adequate.” 
The committee also asked a series of questions about the potential of this bill leading current employees to seek raises. However, Harris said the intention is rather to target specialist positions, which are limited. 
Harris said this would also address situations where a candidate has more credentials or experience compared to others in that position and wants to be compensated as such but can’t under current law.
For example, Harris said a family medicine physician who had additional training in palliative care declined an offer because MaineHealth couldn’t offer higher compensation for that training beyond what other family medicine physicians in the organization are paid. 
The Maine State Chamber of Commerce also voiced its support for the bill at the hearing Tuesday. 
Proposals to change minimum wage
The labor committee also held public hearings for two bills looking to adjust aspects of the state’s minimum wage law. 
A 2016 citizens referendum required the state minimum wage be adjusted every year based on the cost of living index. However, LD 206, introduced by Sen. Jeff Timberlake (R-Androscoggin) along with several Republican co-sponsors, would do away with those annual adjustments and set the minimum wage to its current rate of $14.65. 
Alternately, legislation from Rep. Valli Geiger (D-Rockland) would replace the minimum hourly wage with a county-based living wage. 
Starting in 2026, LD 853 would divide the state’s counties into three regions and replace the statewide minimum hourly wage with a wage based on the cost of living in those regions using data from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Living Wage Calculator.
The committee also heard arguments for and against LD 941, which would require employers to disclose wage salary ranges in job postings.

Ron DeSantis visited Idaho on Monday to promote a proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would require a federal balanced budget.
The amendment would be sought through a never-before used method of amending the U.S. Constitution: A convention of the states. DeSantis met privately with lawmakers in the Idaho Legislature early Monday.
“I am convinced that you are not going to have Congress all of a sudden change its behavior for the long term. I think the reason we’ve gotten into this with respect to fiscal is because there are certain incentives for the people that are in Washington to behave the way they do. And we need to change those incentives,” DeSantis, a former Republican presidential candidate, told reporters in a news conference in the Idaho governor’s office, standing between Idaho Gov. Brad Little and Lt. Gov. Scott Bedke.
Critics say a constitutional convention could put the entire Constitution up for change. But supporters argue a convention is needed to rein in the rising federal deficit and an increasingly powerful federal government.
Asked about concerns the process would be uncontrollable, DeSantis told reporters he disagreed — pointing to state-level controls for a constitutional convention and ratification requirements.
“I think the people that say somehow the whole thing would melt down, they’re basically saying that the founding fathers were wrong to give the people in the states an ability to restrain the federal Congress,” the Florida governor said. “And I don’t think they were wrong to do that. I think they understood Congress could be the problem.”
And he said he doesn’t even think a constitutional convention would happen. Once 33 states apply — before the 34-state application threshold would prompt the convention — DeSantis said it’d push Congress to pass their own balanced budget amendment.
Little suggested the risk of not acting is high.
“We don’t even think it’s going to get to 34 votes. We think things are going to happen,” Little told reporters. “There’s all those sidebars, all those guardrails we put on those. But then what’s the alternative? Do we want … our federal debt to go to $70 trillion and consume all of the capital and basically burden our children, great grandchildren and great, great grandchildren. I think there is no other usable option, and our forefathers put it in the Constitution.”
Earlier this month, the Idaho House rejected a proposal by Rep. Jordan Redman, R-Coeur d’Alene, that would’ve called for Idaho to submit three separate applications to amend the U.S. Constitution through a convention of the states, including for a balanced budget amendment.
Past attempts at getting the Idaho Legislature to call for a constitutional convention have failed. Last year, representatives of the Idaho Republican Party and the Idaho Second Amendment Alliance opposed an Idaho resolution to apply for a convention of the states.
DeSantis also plans to visit Montana on the same issue.

(Win McNamee/Getty Images)U.S. Supreme Court justices heard oral arguments Tuesday in a case that could allow states to challenge federal environmental rules in more favorable courts.
The case could determine whether certain U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulations are reviewed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit — which has more liberal judges — or in regional courts, where certain states and industry groups would prefer to make their arguments.
The dispute centers around EPA’s decision that 21 states’ plans for ozone pollution failed to meet federal Clean Air Act standards. Oklahoma and Utah challenged that disapproval in the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which spans six Western states. The federal agency argued the challenge should be heard in the D.C. Circuit.
The D.C. Circuit is the venue for lawsuits over rules that are national in scope, while local or regional issues are heard in regional circuit courts. The EPA argues that it used a consistent methodology for all 21 denials, making it an issue that should be resolved nationally in a single court. Oklahoma and Utah contend that regional courts are better suited to account for state-specific factors.
During oral arguments, Justice Neil Gorsuch seemed to question the notion that states should bring their challenges to regional courts.
“[Air pollution] crosses the country in ways that don’t respect our jurisdictional boundaries between circuits,” he said.
Gorsuch suggested such an approach could create confusion, if states bring challenges to varying regional courts that issue conflicting rulings.
“We’re going to have different interpretations of the statute with different — different circuits and all these terrible splits and — and, gosh, we won’t have the immediate resolution of the D.C. Circuit that we could have,” he said.
Meanwhile, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson noted that state-specific factors informed each EPA denial.
“It matters that you are Denver versus, you know, Arizona or whatever in terms of how the modeling works,” she said.

Senate Bill 484 would apply to every city and town in the state that has populations under 300,000. Only Oklahoma City and Tulsa had populations over that threshold, according to the most recent U.S. Census data.
It would allow churches to open homeless shelters regardless of distance from a school.
Existing homeless shelters already within that slightly more than half-mile distance would be grandfathered in, meaning they could still operate. It would not apply to domestic violence or youth shelters.
Sen. Lisa Standridge, R-Norman, the author of the legislation, made significant changes to the bill to make it less restrictive. It no longer applies to libraries, churches and preschools, she said.
Standridge said the measure is necessary to protect children.
Some nonprofit groups are distributing clean needles, condoms and bongs to homeless shelters, she said. The items should not be around children, she said.
Standridge said the measure applied to cities and towns under 300,000 people because larger cities have more resources to help the homeless.
Sen. Regina Goodwin, D-Tulsa, said the buffer zone between sex offender residences and schools is 2,000 feet.
Sen. Mark Mann, D-Oklahoma City, said there will still be drug activity in neighborhoods surrounding schools.
He questioned whether the bill was broad state overreach.
Sen. Paul Rosino, R-Oklahoma City, said city councils can pass ordinances governing the issue.
“This bill acts like it solves a problem but it doesn’t,” said Sen. Mary Boren, D-Norman.
It creates the “illusion” that it is doing something, Boren said.
Sen. Carri Hicks, D-Oklahoma City, said the measure does not do anything to address the causes of homelessness such as addiction, poverty and mental illness. She said some homeless students are living in the shelters.
“All this is is a spacing bill,” Standridge said. “This does not close homeless shelters.” 
The bill narrowly passed by a vote of 26-20 and is available for consideration in the House.

Patrick Morrisey's office says his executive order for religious exemptions still stands. (Getty Images)Despite a rebuke to religious exemptions to school vaccine requirements by state lawmakers Monday, the West Virginia Bureau for Public Health said Tuesday it will continue to abide by an executive order from Gov. Patrick Morrisey requiring religious exemptions.
“Yesterday’s House vote on Senate Bill 460 does not affect Gov. Morrisey’s executive order allowing for religious exemptions for school vaccines,” Gailyn M. Markham, deputy director of communications for the Office of Shared Administration, wrote in an email. “The West Virginia Department of Health will continue to abide by and comply with that order.”
Julie Bertram, health services coordinator for Wood County Schools, said since the Jan. 14 executive order, the Bureau for Public Health has responded to a few families in her school system who have requested religious exemptions that the state would take “no action” in court over the child not meeting the immunization requirements. The families, school nurses and the school system should also get a copy of the letter from the bureau, she said. 
School nurses then notify the families that they received a letter about their exemption from the Bureau for Public Health and that their child may enter school. 
Bertram said after the Legislature rejected the bill, she questions whether the letter qualifies as an exemption. 
The state Department of Education has not given school nurses, who have historically enforced the immunization laws, any new guidance on the matter Tuesday, Bertram said. 
A spokesperson for the state Department of Education did not immediately respond to a question about how the department had advised parents who ask about religious exemptions. 
The House voted down Senate Bill 460 with a vote of 42 yays and 56 nays on Monday. The legislation would have allowed families who object to the shots on religious grounds to submit a written statement to their school administrator in order to be exempt from the requirements. The state’s private and parochial schools would have been able to set their own requirements for vaccines. It also would have revamped the process the state has for medical exemption for vaccination requirements, allowing a child’s medical provider to submit a medical exemption without needing approval from the state immunization officer.
Until the executive order, West Virginia was among only five states in the country that allowed only medical exemptions to the school vaccination requirements. Following the vote Monday, state Democrats called on the governor to rescind the executive order.
A spokesman for Morrisey said the order remains in effect and would not be rescinded.
“We still have three weeks of [the legislative] session, so they may try to bring [the legislation] back, but I’m pretty sure that West Virginians have spoken,” Bertram said. “I think the legislators have gone out and spoken to the communities, they’ve polled West Virginians, and I think they feel pretty strongly, that’s how they could get those Republicans on board with them that West Virginians are not for this, the vast majority.”

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Gubernatorial hopeful Sean Spiller, president of teachers union the New Jersey Education Association, failed to meet the necessary fundraising and spending thresholds to secure public matching funds for his campaign ahead of Monday’s deadline.
Spiller, a former Montclair mayor, could be denied a position on the Democratic primary debate stage after failing to raise and spend the $580,000 needed to qualify for matching funds and debates organized by the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission.
“As a teacher, coach, immigrant, and working dad, this race is about so much more to me than who can collect the most cash and dole out the most favors. It’s about giving working people in this state a voice again,” Spiller said in a statement Monday.
Spiller is the only one of the six Democrats seeking the nod to succeed a term-limited Gov. Phil Murphy who failed to qualify for gubernatorial public financing. The program affords qualified candidates matching funds at a 2-to-1 rate in exchange for them agreeing to spending and fundraising caps.
This year, candidates who receive matching funds must agree to spend no more than $8.7 million in the primary and $18.5 million in the general election. Spiller could still qualify for general election matching funds if he wins his party’s nomination on June 10.
The teachers union president is running his campaign unconventionally. He has eschewed building out campaign staff, relying instead on consultants, and has largely leaned on union dollars transmitted to an independent expenditure group to build name recognition and spread his message.
That group, called Working New Jersey, in August told the state’s campaign finance regulators it intended to spend $35 million in this year’s gubernatorial primaries. The group, which has yet to disclose any fundraising or spending, is staffed by former New Jersey Education Association officials.
The candidate’s own fundraising has lagged significantly behind that of his five opponents in the Democratic race, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, U.S. Reps. Josh Gottheimer and Mikie Sherrill, and former state Sen. Steve Sweeney.
Combined, those candidates have received more than $15 million in matching public dollars so far. Baraka, who qualified for matching funds in February, has yet to receive his first batch of matching funds.
It remains unclear whether Spiller will make it to the debate stage. To qualify for that, candidates must have raised and spent — or committed to spend — $580,000 before the deadline to file nominating petitions, which was Monday.
Those thresholds match ones for the gubernatorial public financing program, but there are no limits on how much of their own money candidates can use to reach the debate stage, while those receiving matching funds must commit to use no more than $25,000 of their own money.
A Spiller campaign spokesman did not return a request for comment. The commission declined to comment because it was still processing submissions.
The commission is due to select debate sponsors at a special meeting on Friday. Candidates receiving matching funds are required to attend two debates hosted by sponsors selected by the commission.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Former Pinellas County Republican Congressman David Jolly says he is considering running for governor in Florida next year — as a Democrat.
“We’re very close to a decision,” said the 52-year-old former legislator, who has been a pundit on MSNBC for the past six years, while speaking to the Phoenix during a visit to Tallahassee Tuesday morning.
“I’ve done a fair amount of meeting with Democratic clubs, meeting with Democratic leadership, meeting with Democratic grassroots, and my wife and I have made the personal decision to do it,” he said.
Still registered as a political independent, he said he will make a firm decision by Memorial Day.
Jolly worked as a top aide and general counsel for Pinellas area Republican U.S. Bill Young for more than a decade beginning in the mid-1990s before parlaying that experience into a career as a Washington, D.C., lobbyist.
After Young died in late 2013, Jolly entered a special congressional election to succeed him and defeated Democrat Alex Sink in early 2014. The race at the time was considered one of the most expensive congressional races ever (More than $12 million was spent in the race, with more than two-thirds of that amount generated by third-party groups).
He won re-election that fall, but lost to Democrat Charlie Crist in 2016 after the district was redrawn, making it more favorable for a Democrat, and has been out of electoral politics ever since. But he says that his work in television over the past several years potentially opens up campaign dollars that have been absent from Florida Democrats recently.
“Some of the largest donors in Democratic circles have indicated to me personally that if you get into this race, we’ll now reconsider coming into Florida,” Jolly said, adding that he believes “several national politicians” will move off the sidelines to support him and open their donor base if he gets into the race.
As a Republican, Jolly was part of the Never-Trump wing of the GOP. In 2018, he announced on the HBO show Real Time with Bill Maher that he had left the party and become a political independent, saying, “I don’t think the future is between the two parties.”
This is not the first time Jolly has flirted with running for governor of Florida, or serving on a gubernatorial ticket. In the spring of 2018, he began a national tour with former South Florida Democratic U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, and the two publicly discussed running as a hybrid Democratic-Republican gubernatorial fusion ticket.
It was almost exactly four years ago that he told this reporter he was “likely” to run for governor of Florida as a political independent. In neither case did those events happen.
In looking back, Jolly said such a “unity ticket” in 2018 was not with the times, as the Democrats in the first national election after the election of Donald Trump took back the U.S. House of Representatives and Andrew Gillum, with backing from Bernie Sanders, became the Florida Democratic gubernatorial nominee coming out of a contested five-person primary, before losing in a narrow race to Ron DeSantis that fall.
Four years ago, Jolly was involved in efforts to launch a national third party. He still believes multiparty democracies produce better voter turnout, voter participation, and results, he said, but acknowledged that’s not the political system in the United States. “We made the right decision not to do it,” he added about staying out of that race.
And while he has been thinking about running for a while, Jolly found it discouraging to see both Donald Trump and U.S. Sen. Rick Scott win by 13-percentage point margins in Florida in November. Still, he said, the first two months of the Trump administration shows the political winds can change quickly in these times.
“I know there’s an appetite for change in Florida. There’s a frustration over the affordability crisis. The insurance crisis. There is a growing school voucher crisis. Not just the defunding of public schools, but the fact that vouchers don’t keep up with the rate of inflation,” Jolly said.
“Republicans’ only answer is to double down on vouchers, and they are not going to be able to meet the issue on this. And, in many ways, my wife and I are living through all of those crises with other Floridians. The insurance crisis. The schools crisis. Fundamentally, I’m a reform person and I think that the corruption in Tallahassee is disgusting. It’s worse than Washington, D.C., and I think a good dose of ethics and finance reform put in front of voters, and hopefully implemented in Tallahassee, is something that also is important.”
Former USF-St. Petersburg government professor Darryl Paulson, who says he has known Jolly for more than 15 years, wrote an op-ed defending him for his work as a lobbyist when he ran for Congress more than a decade ago. He believes there is a chance Jolly could win as a Democrat but “he could also lose, and lose badly.”
“If I were David, I would ask myself if I had a realistic chance of winning,” Paulson said. “I would also ask myself if running as a Democrat could do irreparable harm to my image and the ideas I have traditionally supported.”
If Jolly does run for governor, his trajectory could be similar to the man who knocked him out of his congressional seat in 2016, Charlie Crist.
Crist was a popular longtime Republican who flipped independent in 2010 when Marco Rubio thwarted his path to the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate that year. After losing that race, Crist became a Democrat, losing for governor in 2014 to Rick Scott before winning the Pinellas congressional seat in 2016. After serving six years there, he ended up losing to Ron DeSantis in another race for governor in 2022 by 19 points.
Jolly acknowledges that Florida is a red state in 2025, so there’s no guarantee he would be more successful than any of the other Democrats who have run statewide in recent years.
“We all know the numbers,” he said. “But I know there’s a coalition out there, and if the macro political environment next summer is one in which people are desperately looking for a change, then I think that we’ve got a shot to change leadership in Tallahassee.”
The only declared candidate in the race for Florida governor in 2026 so far is Republican U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, who received an endorsement from President Trump before he officially entered the contest last month.

House Bill 1223, by Rep. Kevin West, R-Moore, proposed ending the tradition of moving clocks forward an hour to comply with a federal law that requires states to switch to daylight saving time the second Sunday in March unless they specifically exempt themselves. 
West said his constituents want “to lock the clock,” but right now Congress gives states two options — change their clocks twice a year or lock the clock on standard time, which means residents would have more hours of light in the morning.
He said students are leaving for school in the dark because the sun doesn’t rise until after 8 a.m.
But Scott Fetgatter, R-Okmulgee, said Oklahomans made it clear last year that they want more daylight at the end of the day, not at the beginning.
“They want to lock the clocks, but they do not want to lock the clocks and it get dark at 4 o’clock in the afternoon,” he said.
Fetgatter said he walked to school in ice and snow and with wet hair that had icicles hanging from it.
After the measure failed 40-54, West publicly congratulated his colleagues.
“Congratulations on that vote because you just guaranteed that we’ll continue to change our clocks twice a year,” he said.

(Photo: Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline) North Carolina Democratic lawmakers on Tuesday advocated for bills proposing comprehensive paid family leave and minimum wage increases during back-to-back press conferences at the Legislative Building in Raleigh. They framed the proposals as urgent measures to ease the financial strain on workers needing time off for family and medical needs and those struggling with the cost of living.
Paid time off
In the first event, Senate Democratic Leader Sydney Batch of Wake County joined nonprofit advocates in renewing a longstanding appeal for paid leave legislation that would give North Carolina workers greater access to paid time off. Batch opened the press conference by highlighting the stark reality facing North Carolina workers: 79% of the state’s workforce — approximately 4 million people —have no paid leave through their jobs. She shared a heart-wrenching story of a mother forced to leave her premature child in the hospital to continue working, returning to the neonatal intensive care unit after hours and spending each night there before going home.

“In a society that is so well-resourced, it is outrageous that we don’t provide paid leave for individuals and that is something that absolutely needs to change,” said Batch, a sponsor of the NC Paid Family Leave Insurance Act (Senate Bill 480).
About 20% of U.S. workers do not have access to paid sick leave, and 73% lack paid family leave, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The U.S. is among a small number of countries worldwide that do not require employers to offer paid sick leave or paid maternity leave.
In North Carolina, while some workers have access to unpaid leave due to the Family and Medical Leave Act, many are ineligible, and many more cannot afford to take time off without pay. Senate Bill 480 would allow workers up to 12 weeks of paid time off for major life events, such as caring for newborns or tending to sick relatives.
The proposal modeled loosely on Social Security, would be funded through small weekly contributions from employers and employees. This approach aims to make paid leave accessible to everyone, including small business owners, self-employed workers, and part-time employees.

Rep. Laura Budd (D-Mecklenburg), a small business owner and mother, explained how the current system disadvantages small and medium businesses competing for talent against larger corporations that can offer comprehensive benefits. “This bill helps level the playing field,” Budd said.
For almost two decades, legislation to allow North Carolina workers to earn paid sick time has been introduced but has not received a committee hearing in the Republican-controlled legislature. Advocates say this lack of action leaves many working North Carolinians without paid time off to recover from illness, care for sick loved ones, or access preventive health care.
“If you’ve heard it once, you’ve heard it a hundred times,” Batch said. “There are so many families who are struggling with regards with just being able to make ends meet. Most of them are living paycheck–to-paycheck and they don’t have the ability to take any leave.”
Raising the state’s minimum wages
Later in the morning, another group of Democratic lawmakers held a second press conference to unveil twin bills aimed at raising the state’s hourly and tipped minimum wages, which have not changed since 2009. The proposed Economic Security Act (House Bill 339, Senate Bill 326) would raise North Carolina’s minimum wage to $22 per hour. It would also phase out the lower minimums that employers can pay restaurant workers and others who regularly get tips — $2.13 per hour. A separate measure, the Fair Minimum Wage Act (House Bill 353), proposes a more gradual increase, lifting the state’s minimum wage to $18 per hour by 2030.

“The people of North Carolina work hard and put their all into everything that they do,” said Sen. Natalie Murdock (D-Chatham, Durham), a sponsor of the Senate wage bill. “They deserve to be paid every single dime that they are worth. They are worth more than what they are getting today.”
The proposal also includes provisions for paid sick days, workplace safety protections, and reinstating the Earned Income Tax Credit. “More than half of Americans are just one paycheck away from homelessness,” said Murdock. “That is unacceptable. We can and we must do better for our state.”
Both efforts face steep odds in the Republican-controlled legislature, where similar proposals have stalled for years. 
But advocates stressed broader economic stakes: The NC Justice Center estimates a $15 minimum wage could inject $4.5 million into the economy, while paid leave backers argue it would reduce turnover and boost productivity.
The Democratic lawmakers promoted the bills Tuesday as part of a lobbying day for worker advocates. 
“Full time minimum wage workers earn $15,000 yearly. That’s a death sentence,” said Rep. Marcia Morey (D-Durham), noting the state ranks last nationally for worker conditions.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/20240430_163039-1024x709.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — An income tax plan touted by state GOP leaders Tuesday as making South Carolina more competitive will cut taxes for many while requiring some people to pay more.
The proposal released with much fanfare in the Statehouse lobby would collapse all tax brackets to a single, flat 3.99% starting Jan. 1 for tax year 2026 — meaning taxpayers may not realize it until they file their taxes in spring 2027.
That would seem to be a huge cut from this year’s top tax rate of 6.2%, and that’s the goal.
Republicans have long complained the state’s top marginal rate makes South Carolina appear as the highest-taxed state in the Southeast, even while the effective rate — what tax filers actually pay — was among the lowest.
A 2022 law that has already reduced revenue by $1 billion has so far reduced that top tax bracket — what previous GOP leaders likened to a sticker price on a car that’s negotiated down — from 7% to 6.2%. But that number is still the region’s highest.
The plan announced Tuesday appears to be a far deeper cut. Yet, it reduces revenue flowing into state coffers far less. Under the phased-in 2022 law, the biggest cut came in the first year, when it eliminated more than $700 million for a half-point reduction.
Under the new plan, the state can get to 3.99% in one fell swoop by shaving $200 million from tax collections, said House Ways and Means Chairman Bruce Bannister.

Regionally, only Florida and Tenneessee would have a lower income tax rate — and that’s because theirs is zero. Their tax structure doesn’t include a state income tax. Both neighboring Georgia and North Carolina already have a flat tax rate, at 5.39% and 4.25% respectively, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.
“That makes us not only more competitive, but also more attractive to new businesses and more affordable for families to call South Carolina home,” Bannister, R-Greenville, told reporters.
The plan does that by adjusting the tax structure, which will broaden the number of filers who pay.
Currently, South Carolina is among just five states basing tax collections on “federal taxable income,” meaning the state taxes only what’s left after home mortgage interest, property taxes and various other deductions and personal exemptions are subtracted. Essentially, South Carolinians start their state tax forms with less income to tax, compared to what they’d file if they lived across the state border.
The plan untethers South Carolina from the federal tax code and switches to taxing adjusted gross income as most states do. That makes South Carolina’s taxes truly comparable to its neighbors.
How many taxpayers will pay more versus less is not yet known. The state’s fiscal experts are working on projections that likely won’t be ready until next week.
Republicans call it flat and fair.
“Everybody has to pay something — a little something, at least — to be a part of this great state of South Carolina,” Gov. Henry McMaster said.

As of calendar year 2023, 44% of tax filers paid zero in state income taxes, while 10% of filers accounted for 65% of the total income taxes paid, according to the last analysis by the state Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office.
That was largely unchanged from before the 2022 law, which helps explain why it received unanimous approval in the Legislature. Rather than cutting taxes mainly for top earners, as the bill’s filers initially proposed, the compromise spread tax breaks to lower income levels — which received high praise from Democrat lawmakers as helping “the working man.”
In its first year, the law dropped South Carolinians’ average effective tax rate from 3.4% to 2.7%. With the annual income tax reductions since, the effective rate has likely further shrunk, though by how much is unknown. An updated number may be released with Fiscal Affairs’ analysis of the GOP plan.
The changes won’t simply shift to lower-income filers. The plan provides a new personal exemption meant to help them, offering a full tax break for people drawing just $6,000 and providing relief for people making up to $40,000.
The bill does not change any of the state’s existing tax benefits or deductions, including those benefiting military families, senior citizens and parents of young children, Bannister said.
It’s also designed to start putting more money in South Carolinians’ paychecks starting in 2026, by requiring the state Department of Revenue to adjust employers’ withholding tables to reflect the new tax structure.
That means employers will withhold less in taxes, resulting in higher take-home pay. But it should also result in smaller refunds at spring tax time, Bannister said.
Democrats are withholding judgment on the new plan until they see the details.
Rep. Roger Kirby, the House’s assistant minority leader, said he’s not opposed to a tax cut, but legislators need to be sure they don’t hurt low-income residents and government services in the process.
“Those were always the unanswered questions” on various study committees over the years looking at reducing taxes, said the Lake City Democrat.
Moving to a single tax rate could reduce the sticker shock for people looking to move to South Carolina and businesses wanting to start shop here, since the top tax rate made it appear so much higher than surrounding states, Kirby said.
“Hopefully, it’ll be something good everybody can support, and it’ll be good for economic development,” he said.
The state Chamber of Commerce, which has pushed for a tax overhaul for years, wasted no time in applauding the proposal.
“South Carolina’s incredible economic growth has been achieved despite a clear competitive disadvantage — an archaic and confusing individual income tax rate that discourages investment and stymies talent attraction,” said the chamber’s CEO, Mike Brenan. “This historic tax cut proposal would fix that — immediately vaulting South Carolina ahead of other states that have recently cut tax rates and creating a more competitive economy that will attract even more jobs with even higher wages.”
But wait, there’s more
The proposal would continue reducing taxes until the flat rate gets to 2.49%.
Getting there all at once would cost a whopping $2.7 billion, Bannister said.
Instead, the plan calls for reducing revenues by $200 million for every year tax revenue projections rise by 5%.
That might take half a dozen years of annual reductions, as the population and industry investments continue to grow. The proposal sets no time frame, Bannister said.
“Four years, five years, six years from now, if that’s how long it takes us to get to that 2.49 number — it will just be different, because our economy would be different and the budget would be different,” Bannister said.
McMaster called on legislators to get the bill to his desk this year.
About 50 Republicans joined GOP leaders from both chambers at Tuesday’s announcement, signaling widespread support.
The bill will mostly likely get finalized with the state budget package for the fiscal year starting July 1.
“We’ll make time,” Senate Finance Chairman Harvey Peeler, R-Gaffney, told reporters.

Free.,"Social Security nominee vows service will improve despite mass firings, office closures",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/social-security-nominee-vows-service-will-improve-despite-mass-firings-office-closures,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Social Security Administration pledged Tuesday that if confirmed he’d ensure Americans can access customer service however they choose, though Democrats questioned how that would be possible if thousands of employees are fired and offices throughout the country are closed.Social Security Commissioner nominee Frank Bisignano testified during a nearly three-hour hearing in the Senate Finance Committee that he wants to ensure beneficiaries have the option to visit an office, use the website, or speak to a real person after calling the 1-800 number.“On the phone, I'm committed to reducing wait times and providing beneficiaries with a better experience; waiting 20 minutes-plus to get an answer will be of yesteryear,” Bisignano said. “I also believe we can significantly improve the length of the disability claim process.”Bisignano promised lawmakers he would reduce the 1% error rate in payments, which he said was “five decimal places too high.” And he said repeatedly that personally identifiable information will be “protected.”Elevator musicDemocrats and Republicans on the panel repeatedly raised concerns about how long constituents already wait for their phone calls to be answered when they need to make changes or have an issue with their Social Security benefits.Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., said that on Monday to prepare for the hearing, his staff called the Social Security Administration’s customer service number, but were disconnected twice and then had to wait an hour while listening to “D-grade elevator music.”""It could have at least had Olivia Newton-John or some mediocre 70s music,"" Daines said while playing a recording of the hold music.Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy asked Bisignano how he’d ensure potential changes at the Social Security Administration wouldn’t exclude seniors who are unable to attend in-person meetings at a field office.Bisignano said he views the phone as a “mandatory way for people to communicate,” especially since the Social Security Administration received more than 80 million calls last year. “If you look at the Social Security website, and you look at the statistics, taking 20-plus minutes to answer the phone is not really acceptable,” Bisignano said. “And that's the reason why only 46% of the phone calls get answered, because people get discouraged and hang up.”Bisignano said he believes he can get wait times on the phone line down to under one minute.“I think we can also help the people within the organization answer questions better by bringing artificial intelligence to them, to prompt them with the information they need,” Bisignano said.Bisignano, of New Jersey, works as chairman of the board and chief executive officer at Fiserv, Inc., which ""enables money movement for thousands of financial institutions and millions of people and businesses,"" according to its website. The company is based in Wisconsin.He previously worked as co-chief operating officer and chief executive officer of Mortgage Banking at JPMorgan Chase & Co.DOGE pursues office closuresDemocrats appeared unconvinced that proposed changes from the U.S. DOGE Service and Elon Musk would have a positive impact on the Social Security Administration.“Earlier this month, at the direction of Elon Musk and DOGE, the administration announced plans to close 47 Social Security offices, including the one in Littleton, New Hampshire,” Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan said. “Shortly thereafter, the Social Security Administration announced plans that would force more applicants and beneficiaries to go in-person to offices, while at the same time laying off staff who work in those remaining offices. If the Littleton office is closed, North Country seniors would be forced to travel nearly 100 miles to the next closest New Hampshire field office.”Colorado Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet criticized the Trump administration for announcing plans earlier this month to eliminate “access to a number of service options over the phone.”“Instead, they'll need to either use an online verification process or call to make an in-person appointment,” Bennet said. “The agency itself estimates that this will add 75,000 to 85,000 in-person visitors a week to field offices.“As my colleagues have already said, wait times for appointments can already take a month. And that in-person appointment is only going to get harder to make if the agency cuts 7,000 employees and ends up with the lowest head count in decades.”Minnesota Democratic Tina Smith said the Trump administration choosing to “drastically reduce phone service and force people to apply for benefits in person” while shuttering offices was unacceptable.“So you can call this rank incompetence, or you can call it the don't-know-don't-care game plan that DOGE has taken across the board,” Smith said. “But to me, it honestly looks like sabotage.”Bisignano testified that he, and no one else, would make the final decision about whether to close field offices.“What I will commit to is that there will be no decision made without you knowing about it,” he said. “I have no intent to close field offices, but I've studied nothing on the topic. So, it's a little hard to commit to something.”North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis urged Bisignano not to “pull any punches” on decisions about closing field offices.“What you're going to find out is, after you do the analytics, every member of Congress, except for me probably, will like your analytics, except to the extent that it affects one of their offices and their district or state,” Tillis said.‘Fraudsters,’ newborns and layoffsBisignano distanced himself from some of the comments Trump administration officials have made about Social Security, though he appeared reluctant to do so.He didn’t agree with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who said on a podcast that his mother-in-law wouldn’t complain if she missed a Social Security payment and that “the easiest way to find the fraudster is to stop payments and listen because whoever screams is the one stealing.”“It would be hard to get to that conclusion,” Bisignano said.He said he didn’t agree with trying to use Social Security as a political weapon, after Nevada Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto asked about news reports the acting Social Security commissioner tried to make changes to how Social Security numbers are issued to newborns in Maine.“The current Social Security administrator briefly ended a contract that had allowed parents of newborn babies in Maine to sign their children up for a Social Security number at the hospital,” Cortez Masto said. “Instead, he required them to do so in-person at an office.”“The current administrator, according to a New York Times article, said he had ordered the move after watching Gov. Janet Mills clash with Mr. Trump at the White House,” she added. “He then quickly reversed that decision, but said he did it because he felt that the governor of Maine was not being real cordial to the president.”Bisignano appeared to reject the possibility of mass layoffs at the Social Security administration when asked about the issue by Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders.“Do I think it's a great idea to lay off half of the employees when a system doesn't work? I think the answer is probably no,” Bisignano said.Vermont Democratic Sen. Peter Welch asked whether Bisignano would have taken the same approach to firing some federal workers that DOGE has, which Welch described as a “shoot first, aim later” system.“No,” Bisignano said.During another part of the hearing, Bisignano said that he believes his job as commissioner would be to “ensure that every beneficiary receives their payments on time, that disability claims are processed in the manner they should be.”“So my first actions are going to be to get organized around delivering the services,” he said. “And I've only been given one order, which is to run the agency in the right fashion.”Bisignano also rejected the possibility of privatizing Social Security.“I've never thought about privatizing. It's not a word that anybody's ever talked to me about,” Bisignano said. “And I don't see this institution as anything other than a government agency that gets run to the benefit of the American public.”",,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

Free.,Trump administration challenges order to reinstate refugee services contracts,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-challenges-order-reinstate-refugee-services-contracts,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Tuesday appealed a federal judge’s order that the State Department restore contracts to nonprofits that aid in refugee resettlement.In a late Monday written order, U.S. District Judge Jamal Whitehead of the Western District of Washington found the department unlawfully canceled contracts to the group, saying executive branch management of a refugee resettlement program did not extend to an order virtually eliminating it.“While the Government enjoys significant discretion in administering (U.S. Refugee Admissions Program), that discretion does not extend to abandoning statutory obligations or rendering the program effectively inoperative,” Whitehead, whom President Joe Biden appointed to the bench, said in the order.Whitehead gave the government until March 31 to submit a report showing that it is complying with the order.The U.S. Department of Justice filed an appeal Monday that will be heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.Melissa Keaney, the lead attorney for International Refugee Assistance Project, the group representing the religious organization challenging the cancellations, said in a statement that “it’s time for the government to live up to its moral and legal obligations by fully restoring funding and access to this lifesaving program.”“The court has been clear yet again,” she said. “The government’s efforts to dismantle the refugee resettlement system are unlawful and harming refugees whose lives have been thrown into limbo.”Written order follows verbalThe additional injunction came after the State Department seemed to ignore a verbal injunction Whitehead granted from the bench last month ordering the Trump administration to restore the refugee processing services.The department terminated its contracts with several religious groups providing refugee services just one day after Whitehead’s verbal order.The lawsuit was filed by the International Refugee Assistance Project on behalf of Church World Service, Lutheran Community Services Northwest and Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, or HIAS. The suit also includes nine individuals who are affected by the pause in services, such as refugees who had their resettlement flights canceled, a local refugee sponsor and families trying to reunite.The suit stems from President Donald Trump's executive order suspending the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, as well as the administration’s withholding of funds appropriated by Congress for those services.That order directed officials at the State Department and U.S. Department of Homeland Security to submit a report every 90 days to the White House about refugee resettlement. From that report, the president will then determine whether refugee resettlement is “in the interests of the United States.”",,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Photo by Michael Salerno)Nearly $100,000 worth of repairs and improvements coming soon to the Providence Place mall and parking garage offer little solace to those trapped in the garage for hours during repairs on Saturday, March 8.
But this time, the work will be scheduled to avoid high-traffic hours, according to contractor proposals submitted in Providence County Superior Court.
Judge Brian Stern signed off March 3 on a series of proposed contracts with various consultants brought on to address structural and security concerns at the mall and adjacent parking garage. Safety and security, along with wear-and-tear of the 25-year-old shopping center and parking garage, were top priorities of the West Warwick attorneys named court-appointed receivers for the mall last fall. 
Mark Russo and John Dorsey took over mall operations in October amid allegations by creditors that the mall’s former owner, Brookfield Properties, defaulted on a 2011 loan backed by nearly all of the mall’s 1.3-million-square-foot footprint. The court-appointed receivership, the state equivalent of bankruptcy, allows Russo and Dorsey, along with a new mall management company from Texas, to oversee daily operations and long-term improvements to the mall. They can also advertise the mall to potential new buyers.
No more breaks for Providence Place mall, now in limbo amid $259M mortgage debt

Since December, when they were confirmed as permanent receivers, Russo and Dorsey have engaged with a flurry of consultants to recommend improvements to the property, including for the pair of eight-floor parking garages, which together offer space for 4,000 cars. They also rolled out a new code of conduct which prevents minors from visiting the mall unaccompanied by adults after 5 p.m.
With Stern’s blessing, work is already underway, including a $56,000 contract, with a $3,000 additional fee, to assess and provide recommendations on structural repairs to the garages. The proposal from Indianapolis-based engineering firm American StructurePoint Inc. expressly states the company will “endeavor to perform this work when the structure is least occupied” — presumably avoiding the hourslong March 8 traffic jam.
Providence Police received more than 50 calls between 4 and 8 p.m. on March 8, when drivers were stuck inside the mall garage, Lindsay Lague, a department spokesperson, said in an email. 
Dorsey did not respond to inquiries for comment Tuesday about complaints received from the temporary traffic jam earlier in the month, but told other news outlets that various garage upgrades, including a traffic attendant, were planned.
New digital and cashless kiosks to pay for parking have already been installed.
Receivers also said in a statement on Monday that they plan to sign a new contract for parking security services “later this year.” LAZParking is now the parking security contractor.
Details on the term and the amount of the existing contract with LAZParking were not immediately available.
Other upgrades on the horizon include the $21,600 contract with Coventry-based Shoreside Construction Services to build doors on the mall-side of the skybridge, intended to “maintain control to public access,” according to court filings. Another $9,000 job — with an optional $4,800 for additional work — calls for Warwick-based Jensen Hughes to review the fire safety of adding doors to the parking garage stairwells.
The receivers have also engaged Liability Consultants Inc. of Hudson, Massachusetts, to assess mall security, including technology, staffing and protocol, with a $350 hourly cost plus a $3,500 retainer, according to court documents.
The work is being paid for using a $500,000 loan approved as part of the court receivership.
“These extra safety measures and improvements reflect our dedication to creating a secure and welcoming environment for everyone who visits and works at the mall,” Dorsey said in a statement. “We are committed to transparency and will continue to engage with our patrons, tenants, and the community as we implement these enhancements. Our goal is to restore and instill confidence in Providence Place as a safe and vibrant destination.”
The announcement regarding safety and structural repairs coincided with a new mall code of conduct effective Monday. Among the 14-list set of rules is a new requirement that children under 18 years old must be accompanied by an adult when visiting after 5 p.m. The policy applies to the common shopping areas; individual stores, restaurants and retailers may have different rules.
The conduct code also expressly states as a standalone item that “PROVIDENCE PLACE IS FOR SHOPPING” while a separate rule bans congregating groups of four or more people or using the garage or stairs “for anything other than ingress/egress.”
Mall security officers will be enforcing the new rules, partnering with Providence Place on trespassing issues, Dorsey and Russo said in a statement.
Information on the current list of mall tenants was redacted from public court filings. Details about the amount of money owed to individual creditors was also not publicly available. At the time of the receivership petition in October, creditors alleged Brookfield owed $259 million in principal and interest on the $305 million loan.

Mike Crapo, R-Idaho. 
President Donald Trump nominated Idaho’s new top health official to a role in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. 
Alex Adams, who has been the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare’s Director since June 2024, is tapped to serve as the HHS assistant secretary for family support.
The U.S. Senate, which confirms presidential nominations, received the president’s nomination of Adams on Monday. It isn’t immediately clear when his confirmation hearings are planned.
HHS is headed by U.S. health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who overcame concerns from senators about dozens of false or misleading vaccine safety statements in his Senate confirmation process, States Newsroom reported. 
Adams previously served for years as Idaho Gov. Brad Little’s budget chief and in other state government positions. 
In a written statement, Little thanked Trump for nominating Adams.
“I am grateful to President Trump for his nomination of yet another Idahoan to a key post, and I am excited to see the positive changes to come at HHS with Alex in such an important leadership position,” the governor wrote. 
Adams is the third Idahoan appointed to key Trump administration positions, the Idaho governor’s office said in a news release. 
Adams’ nomination was referred to the Senate Committee on Finance, which is chaired by U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho.
In a written statement on Wednesday, Crapo praised Adams for “a deep commitment to Idahoans’ health” as director of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. And Crapo said he looked forward to “swiftly considering his nomination” in the committee.
“His leadership and dedication to expanding care in underserved areas reflects the commonsense, results-driven approach he will bring to HHS,” Crapo wrote. “Alex’s additional experience as Governor Little’s budget and regulatory director will also prove invaluable in right-sizing the scope of government in improving the health and wellbeing of all Americans.”
Adams couldn’t be reached for comment. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare declined to comment on Adams’ nomination, directing questions to the federal HHS agency. HHS couldn’t be reached for comment.

Little also praised Adams’ work in Idaho, saying he “brings a highly strategic and visionary approach to achieving my priorities for Idaho.”
“As my longtime budget director, he helped us champion record red tape reductions, historic tax relief, and huge wins for Idaho public education and workforce training,” Little wrote. “In under one year at the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, he completely transformed and improved Idaho’s child welfare system to better serve our state’s most vulnerable children and the generous foster families who care for them.”
The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare is Idaho’s largest state government agency, with a more than $5 billion budget that is mostly federally funded.

(Illustration by Alex Cochran for New Jersey Monitor)Six Democrats and five Republicans who want to become New Jersey’s next governor officially have met signature requirements to ensure their place on June’s primary ballots, although two surprises Monday shook up the Republican race.
Former Sen. Ed Durr dropped out, citing fundraising challenges, while Justin Barbera, a Burlington County contractor who made an unsuccessful bid for a House seat last year, filed enough signatures to join the race, according to nominating petitions that were due Monday.
Barring any petition problems, Barbera will appear on the Republican primary ballot with state Sen. Jon Bramnick, former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, former Englewood Cliffs Mayor Mario Kranjac, and former radio show host Bill Spadea. Ciattarelli came close to beating Gov. Phil Murphy in his 2021 reelection bid.
There were no surprises on the Democratic side, where six candidates who have long been on the campaign trail comfortably met signature requirements: Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, U.S. Reps. Josh Gottheimer and Mikie Sherrill, teachers union president Sean Spiller, and former state Sen. Steve Sweeney.

Micah Rasmussen, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University, noted that this will be the state’s first governor’s race without the county line, a controversial ballot design that a judge deemed likely unconstitutional last year. Rasmussen said the loss of the county line is good for voters.
“This is the biggest field of top candidates we have seen, I would say, in 45 years,” Rasmussen said. “You will not often get the mayor of the two largest cities, two of the members of the congressional delegation, a nominee from the last time, and a radio talk show host all running in the same race. So voters get these really interesting choices.”
That has the potential to pump up voter turnout, he added.
“These are really interesting candidates with really interesting agendas and backgrounds, and I hope it does draw more voters in,” he said.
Murphy, a term-limited Democrat, signed a law last month hiking how many signatures candidates need to make the ballot.
Most of the 11 gubernatorial candidates far surpassed the new 2,500-signature threshold, which is more than twice the 1,000 signatures major-party candidates needed before the new law. Baraka logged the most among the Democratic candidates, with 10,806 signatures, while Ciattarelli led the GOP candidates, with 5,543 signatures.
Kranjac just squeaked by, with 2,535 signatures, filings show.
He actually submitted 3,021 signatures by Monday’s deadline, but 486 were rejected as defective, said Michael D. Byrne, his campaign manager.
But Byrne told the New Jersey Monitor Tuesday that he expects most or all of those 486 rejected signatures will ultimately be counted because they had curable defects, such as missing notarizations and petition circulators who were unaffiliated voters. Petition circulators must be affiliated with the same party named in the petition.
Campaign volunteers now are working to collect needed notarizations and register the unaffiliated circulators as Republican by Thursday’s deadline to amend defective petitions, Byrne said.

Rasmussen predicted that one of Kranjac’s primary opponents would challenge his nominating petitions in an attempt to knock him off the ballot and narrow the competition. Friday afternoon is the deadline to file objections to nominating petitions.
“On the Democratic side, those six candidates viewed (collecting signatures) as an opportunity to organize and get out there and rally support,” Rasmussen said. “It was a different story on the Republican side — it’s a smaller party, a smaller number of voters, and those candidates were much closer to the 2,500 requirement.”
Rasmussen said President Donald Trump promises to motivate voters this year, especially among Republicans.
“For rank-and-file Republican voters, Trump has been extremely energizing,” he said. “We’re all sort of holding our breath and seeing whether or not the actions that he’s taking to drown the federal government in the bathtub, which Republicans have talked about for many, many years, has made them more enthusiastic and draws them out more.”
Whether Trump will drive Democratic voters to the polls remains a toss-up, he added.
“Where a candidate has not had a coherent, convincing answer on how to oppose these federal policies that Democratic voters do not agree with, I think it could dampen enthusiasm,” he said. “Where a candidate is offering a roadmap and a clear idea and a clear agenda and a clear sense of this is how we do this, I think voters will respond to it.”

Rep. Donny Lambeth (R-Forsyth), a primary sponsor of House Bill 491, said it is intended as a signal to Republicans in Washington that North Carolina is okay with work requirements, and written in the hope it will ward off federal budget cuts that would threaten the existence of Medicaid expansion in the state. 
The state’s 2023 expansion law includes a trigger that will end Medicaid expansion if the federal government alters the funding formula and decides to cut how much it pays. The federal government now covers 90% of the cost for people covered under Medicaid expansion.
  Rep. Donny Lambeth (Photo: ncleg.gov)
“I thought that if we were proactive on the work requirement and silent on the formula change, my hope is the feds will not mess with the formula,” Lambeth said. Changing the formula “would be a disaster,” he said. “It puts the whole program at risk.”
About 640, 000 North Carolinians have enrolled in expanded Medicaid since its launch in December 2023. They are adults younger than 65 without dependent children who make less than 138% of the federal poverty level. 
Work requirements and reducing the federal contribution to states for people covered under expansion were among the options for Medicaid cuts included in a recent U.S. House budget committee document. 
North Carolina’s expansion law already requires the state Department of Health and Human Services to ask the federal government for permission to impose work requirements on Medicaid expansion beneficiaries if “there is an indication” that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) would approve. The new bills add that DHHS must implement work requirements that receive the federal government’s okay. 
In President Donald Trump’s first term, CMS approved states’ plans for Medicaid work requirements. Some of those plans were later invalidated by federal courts. President Joe Biden’s administration rescinded permission granted to other states. 
With Trump back in charge, Republicans at the state level see another chance to have Medicaid work requirements approved. 
Arkansas imposed a Medicaid work requirement for less than a year in 2018 before a judge ended it. About 18,000 people lost their health insurance in Arkansas, according to a study, and the work requirement did not lead to increased employment. 
Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders is again seeking permission for a work requirement, the Arkansas Advocate reported. Governors in South Carolina and Ohio are also seeking permission for Medicaid work requirements. 
Lambeth is a longtime supporter of work requirements as a qualification for adults’ health insurance coverage. Bills he sponsored that were precursors to the Medicaid expansion law included work requirements for participants. 
About 80% of people who gained insurance coverage under expansion are already working, Lambeth said Tuesday. 
The bills stop short of requiring DHHS to apply for permission to impose work requirements. 
Rather than wasting time seeking something that won’t be approved, it would be good to see whether courts allow work requirements as part of Medicaid expansion in other states, Lambeth said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Medicaid-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

The effort to challenge changes to voting laws in the Michigan Constitution is being pursued by two Michigan state senators and nine state representatives and has been tossed out of lower courts since the group filed in late 2023 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan.
The lawmakers are requesting that the U.S. Supreme Court recognize the group’s individual standing to challenge changes to Michigan’s constitution that they say violate the Elections Clause in the U.S. Constitution which sets the mandate as a state legislature to prescribe the “times, places and manner of holding elections”.
“The legislators insist that the Elections Clause confers upon individual lawmakers a right to vote on federal election regulations and any deprivation of that right injures them,” the petition reads.
The effort is being led by state Sens. Jonathan Lindsey (R-Coldwater) and James Runestad (R-White Lake) as well as state Reps. James DeSana (R-Carleton), Rachelle Smit (R-Martin), Steve Carra (R-Three Rivers), Joseph Fox (R-Fremont), Matt Maddock (R-Milford), Angela Rigas (R-Caledonia), Josh Schriver (R-Oxford), and Brad Paquette (R-Niles), as well as former state Rep. for northern Michigan Neil Friske. Runestad is also the newly-elected chair of the Michigan Republican Party.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed late last year that as the U.S. and state constitution vest election law authority on the state legislature, individual lawmakers, not even supported by the majority of either chamber, do not have authority for a legal challenge in this case. 
“They filed this lawsuit as individuals, not as approved representatives of their legislature. They do not allege that they passed election laws foreclosed by the 2018 or 2022 state constitutional amendments. And they do not allege that they command votes sufficient to pass contrary election laws in the future,” Federal Appeals Judge Jeffrey Sutton wrote in an opinion in December 2024. 
Sutton further argued that the proof for the lawmakers not being totally representative of the state Legislature is the fact that the Legislature itself has approved policies to carry out the measures approved by the people of Michigan.
In 2018, two-thirds of Michigan voters approved Proposal 2, which resulted in the Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission, as well as Proposal 3 establishing that any eligible voter can vote absentee or register to vote on Election Day, amongst other changes.
In 2022, about 60% of Michigan voters approved Proposal 2 mandating a minimum of nine days of early voting and allowing voters to be added to a list to automatically be sent absentee ballots each election, amongst other changes.
Many of the lawmakers involved in the legal battle challenging the voter-approved changes have been vocal about their support for President Donald Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election was “stolen” and they have sounded alarm bells for future fraud under new voting rules.
Michigan GOP lawmakers condemn new election laws

The U.S. Supreme Court looks at a small percentage of the cases filed requesting its review.
Michigan voters have the right to petition and to vote to amend the state constitution, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said in a statement in response to the Republican lawmakers’ request to the U.S. Supreme Court. And even if the nation’s highest court were to take on the case, Benson said she would be ready to defend those rights.
 “Michigan voters have a right to enact laws that reflect their values, and politicians have a duty to stand by the will of the voters. The idea that the time, place and manner of federal elections law-making is beyond the right of voters to self-determine is anti-democratic, and already multiple courts have reaffirmed this under law,” Benson said.

Senate Bill 942 from Sen. Kristen Thompson, R-Edmond, passed on Tuesday by a vote of 31-15 with support from a majority of Republicans.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma public schools and universities would be held accountable to an international definition of antisemitism under a bill the state Senate approved despite bipartisan concerns of limiting free speech.
Senate Bill 942 from Sen. Kristen Thompson, R-Edmond, passed on Tuesday by a vote of 31-15 with support from a majority of Republicans. Democrats and members of the chamber’s most conservative caucus opposed it.
The legislation implements a definition of antisemitism from the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. The definition considers antisemitism as “a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews” and also includes “rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism” that are directed toward individuals or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.
SB 991, also from Thompson, adopts this language as the state of Oklahoma’s definition of antisemitism. Thompson’s bills now head to the state House for consideration.

Both bills consider the antisemitism definition to be non-legally binding, but schools and colleges still could face significant consequences for alleged violations, including a federal investigation and threats of decreased funding.
SB 942 requires schools and colleges to treat antisemitic harassment or discrimination “in an identical manner to discrimination motivated by race,” and it forbids unequal treatment based on race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, disability, religion or marital status.
Both the Oklahoma State Department of Education and the State Regents for Higher Education would have to designate a Title VI coordinator to investigate reports of antisemitism at a public school or college, referencing Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The agencies wouldn’t have to hire an extra employee for the role, Thompson said.
If a Title VI coordinator finds a school or college has failed to address an antisemitism complaint, the state must report it to the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Education.
This could spur a law enforcement investigation, and the state Legislature could change the school or university’s funding, Thompson said.
The Jewish federations of greater Oklahoma City and Tulsa endorsed both bills and said multiple national groups, like the Anti-Defamation League, also are supportive.
“Without these bills, Jewish Oklahomans remain vulnerable,” the Tulsa and Oklahoma City federations wrote in an endorsement. “We cannot afford ambiguity when it comes to hate.”
If the legislation becomes law, public schools and universities would be encouraged, but not required, to incorporate antisemitism awareness training for all students and employees and to teach a Jewish American heritage curriculum.

The bills follow pro-Palestine protests that emerged nationwide, particularly on college campuses. College students across the country have called for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war and for their universities to cut financial ties with Israel.
President Donald Trump’s administration threatened colleges with repercussions over the protests and canceled $400 million in federal grants to Columbia University, where a “Gaza Solidarity Encampment” made national news. Last year, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill adopting the same antisemitism definition included in the Oklahoma legislation. 
Oklahoma Senate members in the far-right-wing Freedom Caucus said they oppose the college campus protests but were concerned the definition is overbroad.
Sen. Dusty Deevers, R-Elgin, questioned whether Oklahomans could make political statements criticizing Israel if the bills become law. 
The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance considers manifestations targeting Israel and statements that the state of Israel is a “racist endeavor” to be examples of antisemitism. The organization doesn’t consider criticism of Israel to be antisemitic if it is “similar to that leveled against any other country,” according to its website.
  Sen. Dusty Deevers, R-Elgin, voted against a bill requiring reporting of antisemitism complaints in schools and colleges. He said the bill’s definition of antisemitism is too broad.  (Photo by Carmen Forman/Oklahoma Voice)
Deevers, a pastor, and other GOP senators also voiced concerns that biblical accounts of Jewish involvement in Jesus’ crucifixion would be labeled antisemitic. The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance includes “claims of Jews killing Jesus” as an example of “classic antisemitism.”
Thompson said the context in which the statements are made would be crucial in determining whether there was antisemitic intent. She said an investigation by a Title VI coordinator or law enforcement would help determine that.
Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, said the legislation prioritizes one group while it “tramples on the potential free speech rights of many.”
Deevers said “a lot more people would be on board” with the legislation if the definition were narrower. He offered an alternative definition of “hostility towards or discrimination against Jewish people based on their ethnicity, religion or cultural identity.”
“I support the efforts to discourage ethnic hatred, including antisemitism in Oklahoma,” Deevers said while debating against SB 942. “Our universities need to ensure that support for terrorist organizations like Hamas has no place on our college campuses, but the definition provided in this bill does not solve that problem. It simply creates other problems.”

Phil Amato, a Republican from Arnold, originally filed legislation that would have required that the state “maintain a central registry of each expectant mother who is at risk for seeking an abortion of her unborn child"" (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).The revamp of widely-criticized legislation that sought to create a registry of pregnant girls and women “at risk” of abortion raised bipartisan concerns of government overreach during a House committee hearing Tuesday morning.
The initial bill, filed by state Rep. Phil Amato, a Republican from Arnold, would have required that the state “maintain a central registry of each expectant mother who is at risk for seeking an abortion of her unborn child.” 
Amato has said this registry would have been voluntary, though it was unclear who would have collected that information.
His initial bill was highlighted in a smattering of national and international headlines raising concerns about data privacy in one of the most anti-abortion states in the country. Dozens of people filed testimony in opposition. 
The bill was set aside, and Amato filed a new version. 
“The verbiage was a little clumsy,” Amato admitted Tuesday before his colleagues on the House Committee on Children and Families as he presented his new legislation.
Amato said he first approached an adoption attorney about drafting this bill after he learned how costly and difficult adoption can be. He said he hoped the legislation would help more easily get resources to expectant parents, make adoption easier and use modern technology to match pregnant individuals with potential adoptive parents. 
He previously referred to the idea on several occasions as “eHarmony for babies.” 
‘Lifeline for women’: Missouri bill removes obstacles for pregnant women seeking divorce

This new bill would still create a Division of Maternal and Child Resources within the Department of Social Services that would be designed to help anyone who doesn’t want to keep their baby connect with families hoping to adopt.  
Amato removed all references to a registry, but the bill still refers to people “at risk” of abortion.
“The system shall coordinate community resources and provide assistance or services to expectant mothers identified to be at risk for seeking abortion services,” the bill reads. “And to prevent abortion through the adoption of children by fit and proper persons seeking to adopt.”
While some concerns about the “at risk” language were again raised, most of Tuesday’s debate centered around hesitations from both Democrats and Republicans about how much government control this would create in the adoption space — and at what price. 
The fiscal note cites a potential cost of more than $40 million in state revenue for the program in 2026. Much of this goes to staff salaries, including the cost of five legal counsel who would help with referral processes from school districts, non-profits, homeless shelters and faith-based organizations “that could refer up to 3,700 expectant mothers” a year.
Sam Lee, a longtime anti-abortion lobbyist, raised concerns that the legislation would require agencies that fall within the Alternatives to Abortion program, like maternity homes and pregnancy resources centers, “to start looking at eyeballing these women and seeing if they’re candidates to place their child for adoption.” 
“I don’t think that’s something we want to have the government doing,” he said.
The fiscal note goes on to estimate that there were 3,653 abortions in 2021 and 3,012 abortions in 2022 in Missouri. However, data previously provided to The Independent by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services show that data refers to the numbers of Missourians who received abortions anywhere in the country during those years. 
In 2021, only 150 abortions were performed in the state, according to the health department. In 2022, the year the procedure became illegal, it dropped to 88. 
State Rep. Jamie Gragg, an Ozark Republican, said his main concern was the creation of a department that would put the government in direct competition with the private sector since adoption agencies already exist.
“The most dangerous words ever spoken are ‘Hello, I’m from the government. I’m here to help,’” said Gragg. “ … I appreciate the intent, but I would like to see how we can make the existing things work cheaper, instead of the government basically coming and taking over and really screwing it up.”
The committee took no action on the legislation Tuesday.

Republican Sen. Jay Collins faced opposition from members of both parties and from children’s advocates during the Commerce and Tourism committee Tuesday morning, when he presented his bill, SB 918.
“This is a parental-rights thing. Parents know their kids best. I can promise you that, even though I was challenged, my mom would have smacked me with a flip flop if my academic grades had suffered, that’s very much the same thing in most families. For those that don’t, often this is the respite they need to step forward and grow and become the best version of themselves,” Collins said. 
The bill would allow 16- and 17-year-olds and certain 14- and 15-year-olds to work overnight on school days and work longer than eight hours the day before school days.
Public-comment speakers feared that the bill would take power away from parents and give it to employers. Florida law provides an opportunity to opt out of working restrictions.  
Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith noted a line from Gov. Ron DeSantis last week during a roundtable at New College of Florida on immigration. “Why do we say that we need to import foreigners, even import them illegally, when, you know, teenagers used to work at these resorts, college students should be able to do this stuff,” DeSantis said. 
DeSantis was “saying the quiet part out loud, the quiet part being that we’re somehow going to solve the current labor shortage that we have in Florida, that was worsened with anti-immigrant rhetoric, with child labor,” Smith said. 
Collins later told reporters that he believes DeSantis was talking about “soft skills” benefits of young people working. 
Collins reiterated that workers remain protected under the Fair Labor Standards Act, a federal law spelling out labor protections for minors, including prohibiting hazardous working conditions.

‘Bad message’
The measure advanced 5-4, with three Democrats joined by Republican Sen. Joe Gruters in opposition.
“I think this sends a bad message,” Gruters said. “I think we need to let kids be kids, I think the guardrails that we’re removing, even though it may be a part of federal law, not in favor of it.”
According to Florida Policy Institute, more than 110,000 Florida workers would be affected by the bill. 
An uncommonly long list of public commenters advocated against the bill. 
Jackson Oberlink from Florida For All suggested labor shortages can be addressed by other means. 
“This is not about opportunity, it’s about exploitation. Make no mistake, the children who will suffer the most under this law will be low-income, working-class, and migrant youth, the same communities that corporations already exploit. Let’s be honest about the real labor crisis in Florida — it’s not a worker shortage, it’s a wage shortage,” Oberlink said. 
Republican Sens. Nick DiCeglie and Tom Wright said that, although they voted up, they want to continue the conversation about how the legislation could be improved before it goes in front of the entire Senate. 
“This is not about corporations, this is not about demonizing small businesses or Publix or organizations out there,” Collins said. Instead, he continued, it’s about students learning “soft skills,” “self-determination,” managing money, and growing.  
Collins said he would continue to work on the bill.
The bill has two more committee stops, Regulated Industries and Rules, before it would head to the Senate floor.

Idaho voters will be asked whether the Idaho Constitution should be amended to declare English as the state’s official language. 
The Idaho Legislature widely approved House Joint Resolution 6, the resolution that proposes the constitutional amendment. The amendment would also specify that English will be used in “all public proceedings, public documents, public instruction, and any other public acts of any public institution in the state of Idaho,” except as required by federal law.

“This is a resolution that essentially says that language matters,” said Sen. Brian Lenney, R-Nampa, who cosponsored the resolution. “It speaks to who we are as a nation. It binds us together as a people. It ties us to our history, our heroes and our heritage.”
The Idaho Senate passed the resolution on a 30-5 vote on Tuesday, about two weeks after the House passed it on a 59-8 vote. The resolution needed two-thirds support in each legislative chamber to pass. 
All but two of the 15 Democrats serving in the Idaho Legislature opposed the resolution. Sen. James Ruchti, D-Pocatello, and Rep. John Gannon, D-Boise, voted for it.
Ruchti told the Idaho Capital Sun he saw the resolution as just acknowledging “what we already do.”
“The language of it was not restrictive of other languages being used in … the official government operations (in the) state of Idaho,” he told the Sun in an interview. “It was just acknowledging what I believe is already taking place, which is English is the primary language we use here. It’s used in our communications, in government agencies, things like that.”
Gannon told the Sun on Monday night his vote in support of the resolution was a mistake on his part.
“The reference to ‘public instruction’ causes me to oppose it because people who are unable to speak English have to be taught in their language until they are familiar with English,” Gannon said in a text message. “I got an unavoidable cell call during the vote and hit the green (button) instead of the red (button) and didn’t realize it until after the one was closed and I saw the board. The House no longer allows a request to change the vote at that time.”
On March 1, President Donald Trump signed an executive order declaring English as the United States’ official language, the Associated Press reported. Idaho is in the United States.

 Idaho’s constitutional amendment slated for 2026 general election

The proposed constitutional amendment is slated to be on Idaho’s November 2026 general election ballots. To pass, it would need a simple majority support from Idaho voters.
The proposed constitutional amendment will ask Idaho voters:
“Shall Article X of the Constitution of the State of Idaho be amended by the addition of a new Section 8, to provide that the English language shall be the official language for the state of Idaho, and to further provide that, except as required by federal law, English shall be used in all public proceedings, public documents, public instruction, and any other public acts of any public institution in the state of Idaho?” the resolution says. 
Pursuing the constitutional amendment is expected to cost as much as $300,000, according to the resolution’s fiscal note. But if other amendments or ballot initiatives qualify for that election, the resolution’s fiscal note says those costs “will occur anyway.”

Idaho Senate Minority Leader Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, said she thought putting the amendment on the ballot was a waste of taxpayer dollars. She also worried it could impact court reporting and interpretations of court services.
“It’s pretty clear that English is our official language, and now we’re going to spend $300,000 to put it on the ballot — when we are struggling to pay the bills,” Wintrow said. 
Idaho lawmakers who sponsored the resolution that proposes the amendment include House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, Sen. Lenney, Rep. Dale Hawkins, R-Fernwood, and Rep. Kyle Harris, R-Lewiston.
As part of the process of amending the Idaho Constitution, state legislators finalize arguments for and against the amendment to be distributed to voters through mailed pamphlets.

A divided Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC, on Tuesday took up the fiscal year 2026 budget enhancements for the state’s colleges and universities. JFAC sets every budget for every state agency and department. 
The higher education budget was one of the final large budgets JFAC has set during the 2025 legislative session as legislators seek to wind down the session.

Rep. Elaine Price, R-Coeur d’Alene, led the effort to reduce the funding for Boise State University and University of Idaho. Price, who has an accounting associate degree from North Idaho College, and JFAC did not make corresponding reductions to Idaho State University or any of the state’s other colleges.
When asked for an explanation of the cuts, Rep. Josh Tanner, R-Eagle, said he was concerned the two universities were incorporating elements of diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, into programs despite the state prohibiting colleges and universities from using state money for such programs.
“I’ve had a real tough time with universities,” Tanner, a graduate of Boise State, said. “The more I dig in, the more frustrated I actually get. The more I actually look into – whether you look into the DEI aspects, critical race theory, the actual professors and some of the classes that are actually being taught – it saddens me to see the direction that our universities have taken.”
 Some Republican legislators push back on cuts to Idaho universities

Rep. James Petzke, R-Meridian, a Boise State and Harvard Extension School grad, and Sen. Codi Galloway, R-Boise, who attended Brigham Young University for undergrad and Northwest Nazarene University for her graduate degree, attempted to push back against the $2 million cuts and the suggestion universities were using state money on DEI programs.
  Idaho state Rep. James Petzke, R-Meridian, listens to proceedings during the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee meeting on Jan. 7, 2025, at the State Capitol Building in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)
“If this is related to DEI, I guess I’m a little bit confused, because there’s been language in the university’s budget the last couple of years that has specifically prohibited the universities from using any state appropriated funds on anything DEI related,” Petzke said. “So this reduction would not impact any DEI programs that were at the universities, which to my knowledge, have all been eliminated thanks to the State Board’s actions.”
Galloway was even more outspoken. Galloway said she had concerns about the use of DEI programs several years ago. But Galloway said college and university officials and the State Board of Education have made changes to restrict and eliminate DEI programs. 
“I would argue now, today, that there has been a course change, there’s been a correction, and it’s not over, and there’s more to be done,” Galloway said. “But if we continue to punish and be punitive to our universities, we lose our negotiating power. We cannot ask people to make change, watch them make change and then continue to punish them. That is not how it works in negotiations. That is not how it works in the real business world.”
Galloway warned that continuing to punish universities after they make changes could backfire.

“The money here is not very important,” Galloway continued. “$2 million, when you take the balance out, the money is small. A message we send is big. If we ask our agencies to make changes, they make significant changes and we refuse to change course with them, then our power of the purse is no longer relevant. They have no reason to listen to us or to make accommodations, because it doesn’t matter.”
 How the votes broke down in the Idaho Legislature’s budget committee

Galloway pushed unsuccessfully to pass the higher education budget without cutting funding from Boise State and the University of Idaho, but it failed on votes of 5-5 among Senate JFAC members and 5-5 among House members.
Price’s motion to cut $2 million in funding from both universities also produced a 5-5 vote among the Senate JFAC members, but House JFAC members voted 8-2 to support it, yielding a 13-7 vote among all of JFAC. 
Without formal published rules in place, JFAC co-chairs Rep. Wendy Horman, R-Idaho Falls, and Sen. Scott Grow, R-Eagle, have different interpretations of JFACs voting procedures, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
In adherence to the Senate interpretation of JFAC voting procedures that Grow supports, Grow sent the colleges and universities budget with the funding cuts to the Idaho Senate on Tuesday because that is the legislative chamber where it failed to achieve a majority vote. It will be up to Senate Republican leaders to decide what to do with the budget. 
The higher education budget provides funding for more than just Boise State University and University of Idaho.
The higher education budget provides funding for all of Idaho’s public universities and community colleges. Compared to the current fiscal year 2025 budget, the fiscal year 2026 higher education budget JFAC set Tuesday includes an increase of $3.2 million in total funding, and a 5.6% increase from the current budget.
The higher education budget will be sent next to the Idaho Senate for consideration. In order for the budget to take effect, it must pass the Idaho Senate and Idaho House of Representatives with a simple majority of votes in each legislative chamber and not be vetoed by Gov. Brad Little.
JFAC is scheduled to reconvene at 8 a.m. on Wednesday to resume setting budgets.

All reported infections are in the state’s southeastern corner, with 41 cases in Lea County and two in Eddy County.
Cases in New Mexico are split between children and adults, with eight infections in very young children, 11 in children aged 5 to 17-years old and 23 infections in adults.
“Just because we’re seeing this small increase in cases, does not mean we see this as any sort of downward trend,” New Mexico Department of Health Communications Director Robert Nott told Source NM. “We are still offering vaccination clinics and are encouraging people to go to their public health offices for vaccination information and vaccines at no cost.”
NMDOH warned last week that a Texas traveler with measles exposed people to the virus in a gas station, restaurant, church and hotel in Guadalupe and Valencia counties in early March.
NMDOH: Possible measles exposure in Guadalupe and Valencia counties

Measles symptoms can take anywhere from one to three weeks to develop.
Nott said there has been no update regarding any measles cases in Guadalupe and Valencia counties since NMDOH issued the health advisory.
Measles, one of the most contagious diseases in the world, is a respiratory virus spread by contact with droplets in the air, which can linger for hours. People can spread the virus several days before symptoms such as fever, spotty red rash, cough, runny nose or red eyes appear. About one in five cases is serious enough to warrant hospitalization, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Complications from measles include brain swelling, blindness, pneumonia and death.
The most effective prevention against the measles is two doses of the measles, mumps rubella vaccine, according to health officials.
In Texas, health officials on Tuesday reported another 18 cases, totaling 327 infections since the outbreak began in late January, mostly impacting unvaccinated children. The deaths of a 6-year old Texas child, and a Lea County adult, both unvaccinated, earlier this year are the first measles deaths in the U.S. in 10 years.
Just over 13,000 New Mexicans received a vaccine between Feb. 1 and March 21, which is more than double the vaccine rate in the same time last year, Nott said.
NMDOH directs any questions about measles tests, symptoms or vaccines to the Helpline at 1-833-796-8773. The helpline is staffed by nurses who can answer questions in English or Spanish.
Vaccine records can be found at the Vax View website or by calling the NMDOH immunization program at 1-833-882-6454, available weekdays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.

(David Bordewyk/South Dakota NewsMedia Association)If the state wants to build a prison on land zoned for agriculture, it should get the county’s permission first.
Or it shouldn’t.
A 45-minute session of oral arguments Tuesday at Black Hills State University in Spearfish laid the groundwork for the South Dakota Supreme Court to decide, for the first time, whether the state should bow to local zoning officials under certain circumstances. The justices will rule at a later date.
The high court’s call on the matter has implications for a Lincoln County prison project that’s proven controversial — and is now paused, thanks to its lukewarm reception during the 2025 legislative session.
But there are wider implications for the state as a whole.
If the justices rule in favor of the proposed prison’s neighbors and force the state to seek permission to build, the state argues, locals could brow-beat planning boards into saying no to nearly any building project that’s necessary for the general public but unpopular with its neighbors.
State officials, Assistant Attorney General Grant Flynn argued, “would not be able to perform their essential governmental functions” if they had to follow county ordinances.
Prison opponents: State can’t act unilaterally 
The case is an appeal from a group called Neighbors Opposed to Prison Expansion, or NOPE. Lincoln County Judge Jennifer Mammenga ruled against the group late last year, saying the state is immune from lawsuits over county zoning.
NOPE sued in 2023, shortly after the state Department of Corrections (DOC) announced its intent to build a 1,500-bed prison on a farm site 14 miles south of Sioux Falls.
Governor relents, appoints task force to reset prison talks after legislative loss

The neighbors argued that such a massive project would fundamentally alter the character of land Lincoln County had envisioned as agricultural in its long-term zoning plan.
If the state wants to build something industrial in an area zoned for farming, they argued, it ought to ask for a conditional use permit, like anyone else.
A.J. Swanson, the lawyer for a group of prison opponents, told the justices there’s no solid reason to strip a county of its right to plan its land use.
The high court has never waded directly into the question of state vs. county supremacy in zoning matters. There’s another complication in this case, Justice Mark Salter pointed out. Lincoln County didn’t sue the state over the DOC’s failure to seek its approval. The neighbors did. The county eventually filed a “friend of the court” brief that sided with the neighbors, but it’s not leading the charge.
Salter asked Swanson if there’s a place in state law or a Supreme Court decision to suggest that neighbors can file a private lawsuit to enforce public zoning laws.
“I’m not aware of a prior case in South Dakota that would have involved a comparable set of circumstances,” Swanson replied. “I have found that, generally speaking, county boards are pretty vigilant about enforcing their comprehensive plans and zoning ordinances. And I think in this case, Lincoln County was the clear exception.”
State: Neighbors can’t ask for a hearing on behalf of county
Flynn told the justices that the neighbors “do not qualify” for the kind of legal remedy they’re after. In her ruling, Judge Mammenga referred to the “general rule” of sovereign immunity, which essentially shields the state from most legal actions that might stem from the carrying out of its public responsibilities.
Judge dismisses lawsuit from neighbors opposed to men’s prison site

Housing prisoners is part of a state’s essential functions, Flynn said.
Justices Salter and Patricia DeVaney both pointed out, however, that the neighbors didn’t ask Judge Mammenga to stop the prison. They only asked for a hearing before the county.
“I understand your response to the merits of that, but can they seek that?” DeVaney said.
Flynn didn’t disagree with the justices’ characterization of the case. But he said there’s no state law or case law that gives private citizens a right to be heard in a situation where the state is acting to carry out an essential function.
Moreover, Flynn said, the motivations of the opponents are clear. The neighbors, he said, “simply do not want this prison in their backyard, and they’re attempting to use the county zoning laws to prevent that from happening.”
NOPE group: State wants to ‘trample’ due process
Swanson seized upon the due process issue in his rebuttal.
For decades, Swanson said, the state has been a good neighbor in the rural section of Lincoln County. The state obtained the property a few years before the county adopted an ordinance requiring landowners to ask for a conditional use permit to build something that doesn’t fit.
Until its transfer to the DOC, the ground had been leased for farming by the state’s School and Public Lands Office, with profits from the operation used to help fund education.
The decision to bring the “catastrophic change” of a large prison to the neighborhood, Swanson said, shouldn’t be made with the stroke of a pen by the DOC secretary.
“That these due process interests mean nothing to the state, quite frankly, is startling,” Swanson said. “I can’t believe they can so easily trample those interests. I find that incomprehensible.”
Prison site’s uncertain future
The arguments over the prison site came one week before the first meeting of a task force dubbed “Project Prison Reset” by Gov. Larry Rhoden. The governor had hoped to convince lawmakers to approve the final round of funding for prison construction during the 2025 legislative session, but was unable to convince enough of them to sign off on the $825 million project.
As envisioned by the state’s executive branch, the prison would largely replace the oldest portions of the South Dakota State Penitentiary in Sioux Falls, which was built in 1881.
In 2024, lawmakers allocated $62 million to plan for a new men’s prison at the Lincoln County site. All but $7.9 million of that money has been spent to design and prepare for a 1,500-bed prison there.
The task force group, set to meet April 2 in Sioux Falls, is supposed to address the concerns that brought about the demise of that hoped-for facility: cost, size, necessity and location.

Glenn Youngkin carried out his duty to sign, veto and amend hundreds of bills handed to him by the Democratic-controlled legislature for the last time Monday, rejecting a proposal to raise the minimum wage incrementally to $15 per hour, a multiple-year attempt to establish a Prescription Drug Affordability Board and several voter registration and election measures. 
Youngkin also signed into law a bill that classifies fusion as a clean energy source, one that expands maternal health care access and a bill banning the personal use of political campaign funds, the most significant campaign finance reform measure the state has passed in years.
Youngkin vetoes minimum wage hike, prescription affordability board bills

“The legislation that I’ve signed into law and the budget amendments I’ve put forward this year will go a long way to helping ensure Virginia remains a great place to live, work, and raise a family,” Youngkin stated in a news release announcing his actions. 
“And I have vetoed bills that I think will take the commonwealth backward by raising the cost of living, hurting our strong job growth, stifling innovation, undermining our All-American All-of-the-Above Power and Energy Plan or making our communities less safe,” Youngkin added, relaying his thanks to legislators for their work during the General Assembly session.
With the action deadline Monday night at 11:59 p.m., much of Youngkin’s actions were still trickling onto Virginia’s Legislative Information System website well into Tuesday. 
Though still digesting some of what he’d seen by 11:30 a.m., Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, participated in a virtual press gathering to relay his thoughts. 
Surovell said during his 16 years as a lawmaker, governors typically call legislative leaders to discuss amendments in the period between when session ends and their action deadline begins. This is done sometimes in lieu of some vetoes, Surovell said, and in other instances, representatives from the governor’s administration have been more actively engaged in the committee process during session. 
But when it comes to  the Youngkin administration, Surovell claimed, “the first time a member finds out they got a problem with the bill is usually when the veto drops, or when the amendment drops.” 
It’s also part of why he thinks Youngkin has a higher veto count than other governors have had. The governor issued a record 201 bills from the 2024 General Assembly session, according to the Virginia Public Access Project,“more legislation than any recent Governor of Virginia has in their full four-year term.”
Here are some of the key bills the governor signed, vetoed and amended this year. 
 Approved bills

No more personal use of campaign funds
House Bill 2165 by Del. Josh Cole, D-Fredricksburg, and Senate Bill 1002 by Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, prohibits the personal use of campaign funds. Youngkin’s signature marks a victory for Boysko, who has been a key champion for campaign finance reform over the years. 
Though lawmakers have tried numerous times to address campaign finance reform, their efforts over the past decade have never borne fruit. 
A subcommittee established to study the issue never held a meeting in 2022 and campaign finance bills to limit contribution amounts failed in 2023. This year a bill by Del. Mike Jones, D-RIchmond, would have directed a state research agency to study potential gaps in campaign finance enforcement, but it failed in the legislature. Jones plans to try again on that bill, meanwhile Cole’s and Boysko’s successful bill represents a breakthrough in overall reform on the issue in Virginia. 
Their bills cleared with overwhelming bipartisan support and Republican co-patrons on the House version. 
Fusion officially classified as a clean energy source
Virginia is expanding its definition of clean energy to include fusion power under a bill approved by the General Assembly that Youngkin signed into law.
HB 1779, sponsored by Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, updates state law to classify fusion energy as a form of “carbon-free” or “clean” energy. The change means fusion will now be recognized alongside other non-carbon-emitting sources such as solar, wind, hydroelectric, tidal, geothermal, and nuclear power.
Under the legislation, “clean energy” refers to electricity generated from sources that do not emit carbon dioxide during production. The inclusion of fusion — a technology still in development for commercial use — signals Virginia’s intent to stay ahead of emerging energy innovations as the state transitions toward a lower-carbon grid.
Special health plan enrollment for pregnancy
HB 2083 by Del. Irene Shin, D-Fairfax, was among several signed or amended bills aimed at improving maternal health outcomes. 
Shin’s bill requires the Virginia Health Benefit Exchange to establish a special enrollment period for qualifying pregnant people. 
A survey the state conducted last year showed long wait times for new enrollees’ paperwork to be processed. This contributed to delayed access to care for people to schedule their appointments. 
Military tuition program update
The governor signed a proposal on Monday to address the rising costs of the Virginia Military Survivors & Dependents Education Program (VMSDEP). The state initiative provides college tuition waivers for spouses and children of permanently disabled military veterans or those killed in action.
HB 1694, sponsored by Del. Alex Askew, D-Virginia Beach, will address the rising cost of the VMSDEP by directing the Virginia Department of Veterans Services and the State Council of Higher Education (SCHEV) to provide a detailed data report on the program to lawmakers.
The report will include the number of eligible survivors and dependents who qualify for tuition and mandatory fee waivers as well as an estimate of how many qualified beneficiaries who are currently enrolled at each public institution as of Nov. 1 during the fall semester.
According to SCHEV, the program’s annual cost increased to $65 million in 2023 from $19 million in 2019.
Steeper penalties for unauthorized drone activity
The governor agreed to a proposal that stipulates a Class 4 felony charge for people who operate uncrewed aerial vehicles in areas to obtain video or photos without authorization.
HB 1726, Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, will also protect the property owner or operator of a contracted defense facility and its employees from criminal prosecution and civil liability should they need to act if an aircraft system enters the property, as long as their action doesn’t result in injury to any person. 
Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, who carried the companion bill in the Senate, and Price proposed new measures in response to national security concerns that arose when a Chinese national citizen was discovered illegally operating a drone over ship repair yards in Newport News on January 5, 2024, according to court records obtained by the Virginian-Pilot.
The Naval Station Norfolk is the world’s largest naval base.
Class 4 felony offenses carry a jail sentence of two to 10 years and $100,000 fine.  
Privacy protection for retired law enforcement officers
The governor supported a proposal to protect retired and former law enforcement officers from having their names published publicly.
HB 1874, carried by Del. Rozia Henson, D-Woodbridge, amends state law by adding retired or former law-enforcement officers to the definition of “public official” for the purposes of prohibiting their names and personal information from being published on the internet.
Sen. Jennifer Carroll Foy, D-Prince William, carried a similar bill in the Senate.
In both versions of the bill, the retired or former law-enforcement officer must be in “good standing” with no pending investigations or disciplinary actions. 
Retired and former officers can request a court to keep their information private, according to the legislation. The privacy measure will last for four years, provided that such officer was retired or ended their service within four years of filing a petition with a circuit court.
Job search help for formerly incarcerated people
Formerly incarcerated people can have a little extra help in landing a job after they’re released, now that Youngkin signed laws to give them that boost. 
HB 1759 by Del. Debra Gardner, D-Chesterfield, and Senate Bill 877 by Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, directs the Department of Corrections and Department of Workforce Development and Advancement to team up on job search assistance. 
A pilot program already exists, and the proposals from Gardner and Ebbin would codify it into state law. While presenting the bill earlier this year, Gardner said that from September to December 2024, the pilot helped over 1,500 people — making them more likely to become self-sufficient, less likely to reoffend and less reliant on public financial assistance. 
The bill is among a slate of proposals aimed at helping current and formerly incarcerated people this legislative session, others of which aren’t fully law yet as Youngkin is seeking amendments before he signs them. 
 Rejected bills

Plastic bag tax bagged
The governor rejected a proposal sponsored by Del. Marty Martinez, D-Loudoun, which would have amended the state law directing counties to allocate a percentage of the plastic bag tax collected to towns within the county that have imposed a sales tax.
“Plastic bag taxes fail to achieve their intended goals and burden Virginians with higher prices at the grocery store,” Youngkin said in a statement. “Redirecting tax revenues to towns may further encourage governments to rely on these taxes, exacerbating the issue.”
In 2020, the Virginia General Assembly passed legislation that authorized any locality in Virginia to impose a tax of five cents per bag on disposable plastic bags provided to customers by convenience stores, drug stores, and grocery stores.
The local sales tax distribution formula would have determined the town appropriations. 
Under current law, all revenues can be used for environmental cleanup, providing education programs designed to reduce environmental waste, mitigating pollution and litter, or providing reusable bags to recipients of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or Women, Infants, and Children Program (WIC) benefits.
Voter registration and elections proposals blocked
Youngkin vetoed a proposal that would have aligned Virginia’s primary elections for state and local offices with the presidential primary in election years, rejecting a proposal aimed at simplifying the voting calendar and increasing turnout.
HB 1794, sponsored by Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, passed both chambers with bipartisan support. The measure would have required that all primaries for offices to be filled in the November general election during presidential years take place on the same day as the presidential primary — typically in early March. 
The bill also would have allowed candidates running in those years to begin collecting petition signatures before Jan. 1 and adjusted campaign finance reporting deadlines to accommodate the earlier schedule.
Supporters argued the measure would modernize and streamline Virginia’s election process. But Youngkin said the proposal would create unnecessary confusion and unequal treatment for candidates depending on the timing of their election cycle.
“By creating different filing deadlines for candidates depending on whether their election falls in a presidential or nonpresidential year, this bill increases the risk of missed deadlines, ballot access issues, and campaign finance compliance errors,” the governor said in his veto explanation. 
“Candidates with general elections during presidential years would have to collect petitions, file ballot access documents, and file campaign finance reports on a schedule different from candidates with general elections during non-presidential years.
The legislation was identical to Senate Bill 1119.
HB 2002, sponsored by Del. Amy Laufer, D-Albemarle, sought to ensure that, aside from a written request from the voter, local election officials could only cancel a voter’s registration based on information provided by the Virginia Department of Elections or another state agency approved by the State Board of Elections.
Supporters of the bill said it was aimed at preventing erroneous or premature removals from the voter rolls, and ensuring that only verified, official sources could be used to make such decisions. But Youngkin said the bill would create unnecessary limitations and impede registrars from doing their jobs effectively.
“Virginia’s voter registration system is nationally recognized for its accuracy and security,” Youngkin said in a statement explaining his veto. “General registrars rely on a range of verified sources, including the Virginia Department of Elections and the Virginia Department of Health, while also using obituaries and family reports to confirm voter deaths. This bill eliminates those effective tools, making it harder to maintain accurate voter rolls and creating unnecessary bureaucratic barriers.”
Youngkin further rejected a bill aimed at tightening how the Virginia Department of Elections processes voter registration data, arguing it would reduce the accuracy of voter rolls and weaken the role of local election officials.
HB 2276, introduced by Price, would have required that specific identification information be included in any list or record submitted to the Department of Elections for the purpose of maintaining the state’s voter registration list. 
The measure also mandated that the department compare these records to the state’s list of registered voters and assign each potential match a “confidence score.” Only matches scoring at least 80 points would be forwarded to local general registrars for further action.
Price’s proposal came on the heels of a federal lawsuit against Virginia, alleging that a state program aimed at removing people from the voter rolls, which Youngkin touted in an executive order in August, was implemented too close to the Nov. 5 elections and wrongfully included eligible voters.
Supporters of Price’s legislation said it would help ensure more accurate and verified matches before voter registrations are canceled, aiming to avoid mistaken removals and promote transparency in list maintenance procedures.
Youngkin, however, said the proposal overlooked a more fundamental issue: the reliability of the underlying data itself. In his veto statement, he argued that raising the match threshold to 80 points would reduce the number of voter record matches sent to registrars, ultimately hindering the cancellation of outdated or invalid registrations. 
“Raising the matching threshold to 80 points reduces the number of list maintenance data matches provided to general registrars, limiting necessary cancellations and reducing voter roll accuracy,” Youngkin said.
The governor also objected to the bill’s provision that would centralize all voter data matching within the Department of Elections, rather than allowing local registrars to investigate potential discrepancies. He warned that the change would diminish local control and oversight. 
“By centralizing all matching within ELECT, registrars lose the ability to research potential discrepancies, weakening local election oversight,” he said.
Collective bargaining 
SB 917 by Surrovell and HB 2764 by Del. Kathy Tran, D-Fairfax, would have expanded on a 2020 law that permits local government employees in Virginia to opt into collective bargaining if their localities allow it. While some jurisdictions — like Alexandria, Loudoun County and the city of Richmond — have adopted bargaining rights, public employees in areas without such ordinances remain without a seat at the table. 
The proposals from Surovell and Tran were among other also-vetoed bills meant to help workers like raising the minimum wage and paid sick leave. Surovell said it was “disappointing” to see these vetoes. 
“I think there’s been a lot of talk amongst conservatives lately about focusing on affordability,” Surovell said. “That’s exactly what we did this session, and the governor basically stuck (up) a finger.”
A rental grace period 
Under current Virginia law, landlords have a five day waiting period after rent is due before they can notify tenants they intend to evict them for not paying rent. SB 812 by Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach and HB 1719, also by Price, would have extended that grace period to 14 days. 
The reasoning for the proposed extension, housing advocates have said, is that tenants who have fallen behind may be more likely to have had a payday by then and be more likely to make up their rental payment. 
Several housing-related bills this session sparked a clash over local and state roles in housing policy. While this proposal cleared the legislature to make it to Youngkin’s desk, it did so because of Democrats’ majority in both chambers. 
Addressing racial bias in appraisals
Last summer a Virginia Beach house sale gone awry made national news when it was revealed that a condo’s owner backed out of a sale when learning that her buyer was a Black woman. But racial bias also affects sellers in Virginia, a survey conducted in Richmond last year revealed. 
According to the report, the average home appraises for around $436,000 in majority white neighborhoods, in juxtaposition to $256,000 where people of color are the majority of residents. 
But some Black-owned homes have never had equitable assessments in the first place due to the nation’s history of racist housing policies. In the 1930s, appraisers lined Black-populated neighborhoods nationwide in red and deemed them “hazardous” areas for home loans. The effects can still be present today, the report shows, because each past appraisal became the basis for future appraisals. 
Additionally, the report notes human bias as another factor for disparity in home appraisals. This is when appraisers overlook comparable homes with different racial demographics or allow personal prejudice to prevent them from making objective consideration of a home’s attributes.
HB 1693 by Askew and SB 995 by Sen. Angela Williams Graves, D-Norfolk,  would have required applicants for real estate appraisers to complete a minimum of two hours of education on fair housing and appraisal bias. It also would have subjected the course to be annually audited by the Fair Housing Board. 
In his veto explanation, Youngkin deemed their bills unnecessary because a similar bill, with no required audits, had been enacted in 2022. 
Employee protections
Youngkin rejected a proposal to hold employers accountable for failing to pay their employees.
HB 2561, carried by Del. Alfonso Lopez, D-Arlington, would have made employers liable if they failed to pay the minimum wage or overtime wages due to an employee.
While the legislation aims to enhance worker protections, Youngkin wrote in his veto statement that the proposal imposes “excessive liabilities” and “compliance burdens” that will negatively harm Virginia’s business climate.
Youngkin added that with Lopez’s bill extending the timeframe for filing wage and misclassification claims, it would allow for collective lawsuits and remove key legal protections for businesses acting in good faith. Additionally, the governor wrote that the bill would move Virginia away from federal Fair Labor Standards Act guidelines, which he says would create “regulatory hurdles” for current and future businesses in the Commonwealth.
“To maintain Virginia’s pro-business environment and continue attracting employers and investment, it is essential to reject policies that create legal uncertainty and impose excessive penalties,” Youngkin wrote. “This bill would make Virginia one of the most punitive states for wage violations, discouraging business growth and job creation.”
Sales tax for school construction
A proposal that would have allowed all localities to impose a 1% sales tax for school construction also met its death at Youngkin’s veto pen. 
Youngkin agreed there is a need to to support school construction, but said the proposed plan could result in an annual tax increase of nearly $1.5 billion for Virginians. 
In response to that need, Youngkin proposed an additional $50 million for school construction grants and loans above the current biennial budget, bringing the total to $610 million, if adopted.
The governor said the commonwealth should pursue other tax proposals rather than authorizing all counties and cities to levy an additional local sales and use tax to fund public services.
“The commonwealth should pursue a tax policy that unleashes economic development and prioritizes job and wage growth through innovative reforms,” Youngkin said. “These reforms must allow hardworking Virginians to keep more of their money, not less; any proposal that increases the cost of living and the cost of business is not a policy we should pursue.”
The governor also excluded the proposal in his budget amendments published on Monday after reviewing the amendments passed by the General Assembly.
Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, the patron of the bill, reacted to the veto on X, formerly Twitter, stating that “Less than a week after Trump announced the dismantling of the Department of Education, which will be devastating for (Virginia) school funding, Governor Youngkin just vetoed SB 1307, blocking local communities from even having the choice to invest in school construction and renovation through a local referendum. … This governor is out of touch.”
 Amended bills

Automatic license plate readers
Youngkin has amended a bill governing the use of automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) systems, extending the data retention period from 21 to 30 days. The change gives law enforcement agencies more time to utilize collected data, while still requiring it to be deleted after that period. 
HB 2724, sponsored by Del. Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, aims to regulate the use of automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) systems in Virginia. The legislation requires the Division of Purchases and Supply within the Department of General Services to approve any ALPR systems used in the state. 
It also sets strict limits on how these systems can be deployed by law enforcement. Under the bill, ALPR technology can only be used for specific purposes: conducting criminal investigations where there is reasonable suspicion of a violation, investigating cases involving missing or endangered persons (including issuing alerts or addressing human trafficking), and receiving notifications about stolen vehicles, stolen license plates, or individuals with outstanding warrants. 
The legislation further includes penalties for law enforcement agencies that violate these guidelines.
Data centers
Youngkin amended HB 1601, sponsored by Del. Josh Thomas, D-Prince William, tweaking how localities handle the approval process for new high-energy use facilities (HEUFs), or data centers. 
Originally, the bill required applicants to submit a site assessment before rezoning or special use permits could be approved, examining the impact of the facility’s sound profile on nearby residential units and schools. 
Youngkin’s amendment now makes this site assessment optional for localities, allowing them to decide whether to require it. Additionally, the amended bill allows localities to examine the potential effects of the facility on other environmental factors, including water resources, agricultural land, parks, historic sites and forests.
The bill also includes a provision that exempts expansions of existing facilities that do not exceed 100 megawatts from these site assessment requirements. 
Youngkin added that the provisions of the bill will not go into effect unless reenacted by the 2026 General Assembly. The bill clarifies that it does not interfere with existing local zoning authority.

(Tanner Ecker/Bismarck Tribune)The state of North Dakota on Tuesday asked the North Dakota Supreme Court to overturn a district court’s ruling that struck down a 2023 abortion ban, arguing that the state constitution does not give women the right to seek elective abortions.
“Nothing in our history suggests our constitution has ever been understood to guarantee abortions unrelated to the mother’s life or health,” North Dakota Solicitor General Philip Axt said in oral arguments before the court.
Daniel Narum appeared on the bench in place of Justice Douglas Bahr, who recused from the case.
North Dakota judge vacates state abortion ban, ruling it unconstitutional

The ban, signed into law by then-Gov. Doug Burgum in April 2023, outlawed abortion in all cases except rape or incest in the first six weeks of pregnancy, or when the pregnancy poses a serious physical health threat. Psychological conditions did not count as serious health risks under the law.
A group of reproductive health care doctors and an abortion clinic filed suit over the ban in 2023, arguing it violates individual rights and presents a due process concern to doctors by not making it clear when an abortion may be performed for health reasons.
South Central Judicial District Court Judge Bruce Romanick struck down the ban in September 2024, declaring it unconstitutionally vague and an infringement on medical freedom. 
Romanick further found that “pregnant women in North Dakota have a fundamental right to choose abortion before viability exists.” 
Romanick’s decision established broader abortion protections than previously recognized by the North Dakota Supreme Court in 2023, when it struck down a previous abortion law and ruled that North Dakota women have a right to obtain abortions for health reasons.
The state of North Dakota quickly appealed Romanick’s decision, asking the high court to rule that Romanick had overstepped and that the law is not unconstitutionally vague.

Axt argued Tuesday that the justices have previously found that the state has an interest in preserving unborn life, so the Legislature may pass laws that restrict fundamental rights in service of this interest. He said the 2023 law is narrowly tailored to this end.
Axt also said it would be atypical for the Supreme Court to strike down an entire statute on the basis of vagueness. He said that the court should at least keep the law in effect in situations where its application is clear-cut. If a patient is seeking an abortion but does not have any medical problems, for example, they would obviously not qualify for the health exemption, Axt reasoned.
If the court has concerns about whether an abortion would be legal in specific circumstances not addressed in the ban, it could issue an order carving out additional exemptions, he said.
Some justices expressed reservations about Axt’s proposal, questioning whether he was asking them to legislate from the bench.
“Isn’t it just as much of an infringement of the Legislature’s authority to strike down the law as it is to add an exception to it?” Justice Jerod Tufte asked.
Axt said that it would be less of an infringement for the court to invalidate part of the law than to declare the whole statute void.
“I’m not understanding how it’s infringing on the legislative process for us to describe what the constitution’s bounds are, and whether a particular statute falls within those bounds,” Justice Daniel Crothers said to Axt. 
Representing the plaintiffs, attorney Meetra Mehdizadeh asked the high court to uphold Romanick’s decision. She argued that the North Dakota Legislature passed the 2023 law knowing it would raise constitutional questions.
“Legislators passed the amended abortion ban to, in the words of one legislator who disagreed with this Court’s decision, send a ‘message to the North Dakota Supreme Court,’” Mehdizadeh said, referencing remarks reportedly made by House Majority Leader Mike Lefor in 2023.
She said laws that affect fundamental rights require a high degree of specificity so that citizens understand how to follow them. The abortion ban doesn’t meet this standard, Mehdizadeh said.

She added that evidence filed in the case shows that there is not a consensus among doctors about when the health care exemption should apply.
“Doctors shouldn’t have to face felony charges and risk jail time just to learn what the law allows them to do,” she said. “It’s the Legislature’s job to tell them what the law allows them to do.”

Axt said that in order to convict a doctor for providing an illegal abortion under the 2023 law, a prosecutor would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that no doctor in good judgment would have also performed the procedure.
“Either doctors are capable of understanding the standard or they’re not,” he said.
The attorneys also briefly discussed the law’s exemption for sex crimes. 
Mehdizadeh said the provision unreasonably requires doctors to make legal conclusions about whether their patient has been a victim of rape or incest.
Axt countered that a doctor wouldn’t need to “prove with a legal certainty that the crime occurred” in order to provide an abortion under the provision.
“So the patient simply claims they are pregnant as the result of one of the qualifying offenses — is that sufficient for a doctor to rely on the patient’s fair assertion?” Tufte asked him.
Judge denies North Dakota request to keep abortion ban in place until state Supreme Court rules

Axt said it’s not uncommon for doctors to take their patients’ words at face value when deciding whether to provide a treatment.
“I think if there would be a basis for a doctor to give credence to their statement and why they need treatment, then it would be a reasonable basis,” he said.
In a January majority opinion authored by Crothers, justices expressed skepticism about many of the state’s arguments defending the law. Justice Lisa Fair McEvers and Narum joined Crothers in the majority opinion. Chief Justice Jon Jensen and Tufte dissented.
North Dakota sets a high bar for declaring laws unconstitutional, requiring the vote of four of five Supreme Court justices. The Supreme Court did not indicate when it planned to issue a ruling.
The North Dakota Legislature is considering passing a law that, among other things, would require any doctor who can perform an abortion to watch a state-funded video explaining the abortion law, The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead reported. The bill sets aside $50,000 for the video, which would have to go to the North Dakota attorney general for final approval.
House Bill 1511 was passed by the House in February and will soon go to the Senate floor for a vote. Opponents of the bill have expressed doubts that doctors would find the video useful and said it would pose an additional administrative hurdle to them providing care.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)This commentary originally appeared in Big Pivots.
Colorado sends four Democrats and four Republicans to the U.S. House of Representatives. Of them, Jeff Hurd, a Republican from Grand Junction, and Gabe Evans, a Republican from Fort Lupton, will be the most interesting to watch during the next two years.
These two representatives, both new to Congress in January, were among 21 Republican signatories in the House to a letter calling for restraint in efforts to gut the Inflation Reduction Act.
The letter expresses concern about “disruptive changes to our nation’s energy tax structure.” The New York Times and Utility Dive both interpreted the language as a reference to the IRA, the landmark climate legislation adopted in August 2022. President Donald Trump, the Times notes, often talks about repealing the law.
Atlas Public Policy, a research firm, reported in February that 80% of funds authorized by the law have gone to Congressional districts represented by Republicans.

Hurd, an attorney who formerly was chief counsel for the Delta-Montrose Electric Association, replaced Lauren Boebert in the 3rd Congressional District. Boebert was almost certainly headed for defeat had she tried to run against Aspen’s Adam Frisch a second time in the Western Slope-dominated and Republican-leaning district. With a new home in Windsor, she easily won election in November in Colorado’s 4th Congressional District.
While Boebert inevitably echoes Trump, Hurd signaled his measured distance from MAGA hat-wearing positions when he criticized Trump’s blanket pardon of rioters who had invaded the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. At the same time, his bill, Productive Public Lands Act, rhymes with Trump’s drill-baby-drill slogan. Never mind that the United States has already been setting records for oil and gas extraction.
As long as he can survive Republican primaries. Hurd can probably return to Washington for a good many terms. His drill bill is likely part of that political dance.
Evans has a more tricky path to negotiate. He narrowly beat the incumbent Democrat, Yadira Caraveo, in the 8th Congressional District. The district extends from the edge of Denver to the farm country of northern Colorado. Although a former police officer in Arvada, he nonetheless refrained from criticizing Trump’s pardons of the rioters, as Denver TV newscaster Kyle Clark pointed out.
Most of Weld County lies in his district. The county delivers 82% of Colorado’s crude oil and 56% of its natural gas extraction. The district also has the Vestas factory in Brighton that produces nacelles for wind turbines. Vestas has 1,800 employees in Colorado between that factory and another in Windsor. Evans’ district also has many solar energy installations.
On March 13, Evans visited the Vestas factory, a 5-megawatt solar installation near LaSalle, and an oil installation. Bayswater, operator of the latter, proclaims itself a producer of “some of the cleanest energy molecules in the country and world.”
Invited to tag along, a local TV news crew gave Evans the time to say that he favored an “all-of-the-above safe, affordable, secure energy supply to bring costs down to consumers and jobs back to the United States.”
That “all-of-the-above energy approach” was a key element of the letter signed by Evans and Hurd. Combined with a robust advanced manufacturing sector, the approach “will support the United States’ position as a global energy leader,” the letter said. “Both our constituencies and the energy industry alike remain concerned about disruptive changes to our nation’s energy tax structure.”
Tax credits adopted over the last decade “allowed energy developers to plan with these tax incentives in mind. These timelines have been relied upon when it comes to capital allocation, planning, and project commitments, all of which would be jeopardized by premature credit phase outs or additional restrictive mechanisms such as limiting transferability.”
The Evans all-of-the-above tour was arranged by a former Republican state senator, Greg Brophy. Brophy grows watermelons north of Wray and operates an organization called The Western Way. Brophy has been a strong supporter of renewable energy for eastern Colorado and also has a presence on the Western Slope.
Brophy told me that he has organized a similar tour for another member of Congress from Colorado, but it has not been scheduled. He declined to identify the representative.
What if Trump succeeds in rolling back the federal energy tax credits? Energy Innovation, a think tank, estimates increased average household energy costs in Colorado of $180 per year by 2030.
Will other Republicans in Colorado’s congressional delegation join Evans and Hurd? After all, renewable energy didn’t start out as a partisan issue.

His article was published less than 24 hours prior to their appearance before the panel.Goldberg told of receiving an invitation, presumably inadvertent, from National Security Advisor Michael Waltz to join a group chat of top security officials. Goldberg remained in the chat, apparently unnoticed, for multiple days and witnessed discussion of planning details and subsequent celebrations of U.S. strikes on Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.‘I don’t want to get into this’Gabbard initially refused to confirm she was part of the chat, under the initials “TG.” “I don’t want to get into this,” she told Sen. Mark Warner, the panel’s vice chair.Turning to the CIA director, Warner asked “You were the ‘John Ratcliffe’ on that chat?”“I was,” Ratcliffe confirmed to the Virginia Democrat.Ratcliffe defended the use of Signal, an encrypted commercial messaging app, as a regularly used channel by government officials to “communicate and coordinate for work purposes provided, Senator, that any decisions that are made are also recorded through formal channels.”“My communications, to be clear, in the Signal message group were entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information,” Ratcliffe said.Gabbard also testified to the panel that no classified information was discussed in the group chat.Sen. Angus King, independent of Maine, told Gabbard he was “puzzled” by her assertion.“According to open source reporting, at 11:44 on the morning of March 15, (Defense) Secretary Hegseth put into this group text a detailed operation plan, including targets, the weapons we were going to be using, attack sequences and timing,” King said. “Wouldn’t that be classified?”“Senator, I can attest to the fact that there were no classified or intelligence equities that were included in that chat group at any time,” Gabbard said, telling King to ask the Pentagon for further information on classification.“If that's the case, please release that whole text stream so that the public can have a view of what actually transpired on this discussion,” King said.While Goldberg did publish verbatim portions and screenshots of the chat — including emoji symbols the officials used to celebrate the strikes — the national magazine editor, citing troop safety concerns, did not quote from Hegseth’s messages regarding targets, weapons to be used and sequencing of strikes.Adversary nationsSen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia brought up the scenario that a wider leak of the chat would have been of interest to adversary countries, particularly revealing the “time period during which enemy air defenses could target U.S. air crews flying in enemy airspace.”“Director Ratcliffe, this was a huge mistake, correct?” Ossoff asked.“No,” Ratcliffe replied.A Pentagon-wide advisory warned officials on March 18 against using Signal because of possible spying, according to an NPR investigative report published Tuesday.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the Signal group chat Tuesday morning in a post on the social media platform X, attacking Goldberg as “well-known for his sensationalist spin.”“Here are the facts about his latest story: 1. No ‘war plans’ were discussed. 2. No classified material was sent to the thread. 3. The White House Counsel’s Office has provided guidance on a number of different platforms for President Trump’s top officials to communicate as safely and efficiently as possible,” Leavitt wrote.She added, “the White House is looking into how Goldberg’s number was inadvertently added to the thread.”Attack on mediaJust after noon Eastern Tuesday, the White House press office issued a statement characterizing media reporting on the breach as a “coordinated effort to distract from the successful actions taken by President Trump and his administration to make America’s enemies pay.”When pressed by a reporter Monday at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickman in Hawaii, Hegseth attacked Goldberg and said, “Nobody was texting war plans, and that’s all I have to say about that.”Warner and other Democratic lawmakers have called for the resignations of Hegseth and Waltz.Tuesday’s Senate Intelligence panel hearing was streamed in its entirety on C-SPAN.Dozens were killed in the March 15 strikes, according to reporting by The Associated Press that cited Houthi-run health officials.Former President Joe Biden, joined by British forces, also targeted Houthi strongholds in Yemen beginning in January 2024.The rebel group has been attacking commercial ships in the Red Sea since the beginning of Israel’s war on Hamas following the Oct. 7, 2023 attack.",,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

Ty Burns, R-Morrison, attends the final day of the 2024 legislative session. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Citing safety concerns and Oklahomans’ ability to eat “real meat from real animals,” House lawmakers advanced a measure Tuesday that would ban lab-grown meat alternatives.
Critics, though, said House Bill 2829, which targets the science of using animal cells to grow meat in laboratories, is based in fear, is protectionist, and impedes Oklahomans’ freedom to choose what they want to eat and how to practice their religions.
Rep. Ty Burns, R-Morrison, said the measure is necessary to protect Oklahomans and their culture as well as the agriculture industry, which is one of the state’s biggest economic drivers. He said cell-cultivated meat is popular in Israel. While it may not be in Oklahoma yet, the bill aims to ban it before it arrives, he said.
Burns, the bill’s author, said the government’s top job is to protect and promote general welfare and health, and this bill does that.
“I don’t think it’s about being afraid of competition, obviously,” Burns said. “We start talking about protecting Oklahomans and consumption of a product that we have naturally done healthier and better for you. I think it’s an easy protective measure to put ahead of before we get it here.”
Last year, Florida and Alabama both passed laws banning lab-grown meats.
Rep. Tom Gann, R-Inola, said the product should be considered dangerous until it’s known to be safe.
“It’s not about free market. It’s about really making sense,” he said. “We have plenty of opportunity to eat real meat from real animals, and the fact that this stuff is being developed is nothing more than it is just acquiescing to the climate change agenda, the animal rights agenda, and everything green. And it’s an attack on our growers who produce our food.”
Oklahomans need to “play it safe” by banning the product, he said.

“Let somebody else experiment and keep the people of the state of Oklahoma safe,” Gann said. 
But Rep. Jared Deck, D-Norman, said when there are so many other health concerns in the state, he wonders why his colleagues are so afraid of this option.
“We put Twinkies in our body. Heck we deep fat fry them even,” he said. “These are the things that we eat on a daily basis, that we feed our children, that we stock our grocery shelves with, and we’re going to ban something that we don’t even know about supposedly, but a lot of religions and cultures use such products in order to help abide by their own faith.”
Deck said the state’s agricultural industry isn’t afraid of anything that’s cultivated, including this product. He said genetic cultivation is also being used to develop seeds and vegetation, but that’s not being targeted.
“We ought to be afraid of this stuff because it’s not meat,” said Rep. Rick West, R-Heavener. “It’s cells that have been modified to grow forever and ever and ever. It’s closer to a science experiment than it is to a steak. The cells used to grow it act like cancer cells, and the legal ground it stands on is shaky at best.”
He said nobody knows the long-term health effects of eating lab-grown meats. Consumers  need to ask if these are safe to eat because it’s not just about biology, but about what’s legal, he said. 
West said the Federal Meat Inspection Act overseas meat products. Lab grown meat is “a blob of cells cooked up in a tank.” He said federal law also bans food labels that mislead people.
“If you buy chicken expecting a drumstick and you get a pile of lab cells instead, have you been duped?” he said. “My answer to that is yes, you have.”
Forrest Bennett, D-Oklahoma City, said he’s “caught a lot of grief” for liking boneless chicken wings and suggesting that the people who developed the technology to remove the bones from the wing be honored. And even though critics argue that it’s not “real chicken,” it’s still his prerogative to eat it, he said.
If lawmakers are so certain lab-grown meat is bad, he looks forward to watching them reject a bread roll because it’s also made of duplicating cells, Bennett said.
“I just wish my colleagues would call this what it is,” Bennett said. “We want to pick winners and losers in this building, and in this case, the winner is the beef industry, and the loser is an innovative new science that’s trying to create non-meat alternatives for people who need that for their diets.”
The bill, which passed 72-18, now heads to the Senate for consideration.

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson on Tuesday reversed a decision by former Gov. Jay Inslee to allow a man convicted of a triple murder more than four decades ago to be released from state prison.
Inslee’s decision drew backlash from victims’ families and Republicans.
Timothy Pauley is serving consecutive life sentences for a deadly armed robbery at a SeaTac tavern in 1980 that ended with the deaths of three employees — Loran Dowell, Robert Pierre and Linda Burford — and two other women being severely assaulted. 
Pauley was 21 at the time of the crime. He is now 66 and was set to be released from state prison Thursday.

In an order Tuesday, the governor acknowledged Pauley had worked to better himself while in prison the past four-plus decades. But he questioned whether Pauley had recently apologized for his crimes “from a place of true remorse rather than self-interest in being paroled.”
“I am unconvinced that Mr. Pauley is truly rehabilitated and fit for release at this time,” Ferguson continued.
The state Indeterminate Sentence Review Board approved Pauley’s release in 2022, sending the question to Inslee. 
But after meeting with the victims’ families and Dave Reichert, who was one of the detectives on the case in 1980 before becoming King County sheriff, Inslee canceled parole for Pauley, despite his work to rehabilitate himself in custody. 
Similar to Ferguson, Inslee argued Pauley, who is currently held at the Monroe Correctional Complex, hadn’t shown remorse for his actions. 
But in January, on his last day in office, Inslee reversed course, paving the way for Pauley’s parole. 
In the past week, the victims’ families, the state House Republican leader and the mayor of Bonney Lake, where Pauley could have lived after release, urged Ferguson to block Pauley’s parole.
Reps. Drew Stokesbary and Joshua Penner, whose shared district includes Bonney Lake, called on Ferguson to stay true to his campaign rhetoric of standing up for crime survivors.
“If you stand by and allow Pauley to be freed after brutally murdering three people and irreparably damaging two others, those words will ring hollow — not just to his victims and their families, but to crime victims and families everywhere,” they wrote in a letter to the governor on Monday. “And you will be responsible for unleashing a fresh wave of devastating emotional trauma on the victims’ families.”
“Governor Ferguson, this is a defining moment for your administration,” the lawmakers continued.
The victims’ families met with Ferguson on Monday.
Stokesbary applauded the governor’s move and the work of the families “who refused to let their loved ones be forgotten.”
“We commend the governor for his willingness to meet with them this week and carefully review the extensive record before reaching this conclusion,” he said in a statement. “Today, their voices mattered, and justice prevailed.”
Pauley’s attorney, Marla Zink, said in a statement that Ferguson did not meet with Pauley before making his decision, which she said was disappointing.
“The experts in criminal justice, restorative justice, and psychology who have met with or gotten to know Tim Pauley over the years all disagree with the governor’s conclusion,” Zink said. “Tim also has a strong community of family and friends who proudly stand by him and know the true depth of his rehabilitation and remorse.”
Asked about his decision Tuesday, Ferguson said, “I think my letter speaks for itself.” He believed this was the only case of its kind his office was reviewing.

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)PLATTSMOUTH, Nebraska — The prospects are again uncertain for a long-sought recreation trail across rural Cass County.
On Tuesday, the Cass County Board voted 4-1 to withdraw its November approval of a route for the trail, a 10-mile segment that would achieve a long-held dream to connect Lincoln and Omaha via a hike and bike trail.
The vote was an abrupt about-face for the board, which had voted 3-2 in November to OK a memorandum of understanding with the Lower Platte South Natural Resources District to build the trail from the end of the Wabash Trail south of Elmwood to the Lied Bridge that spans the Platte River near South Bend.
Since November, two members of the County Board changed, and both voted against the route that had been OK’d by the previous board — “Route D,” which roughly follows a little-traveled, north-south gravel road along 334th Street.


Lawsuit filed
Complicating matters involving the construction of a connector trail across Cass County is that a lawsuit was filed recently against the County Board there.
Mark Meyer, a Cass County resident whose family has land on the proposed route, accused the Board of violating the Open Meetings and Interlocal Agreement Acts when they approved a route for the trail in November.
The lawsuit, filed March 4, by J.L. Spray and Raymond Daugherty of the Mattson Ricketts Law Firm in Lincoln, asked that the November approval of the route and the agreement to work with the NRD be nullified.
The request and a response from the county are pending.


Board member Daniel Stohlmann of Louisville, a new board member elected in November, said commissioners weren’t give enough information about the precise route the trail would take — including which side of the road it would impact — and that commissioners needed that before giving a final OK.
“I think it’s really important to evaluate all options,” Stohlmann said after the vote. “This trail is a permanent thing. It’s really important to get it right the first time.”
Tuesday’s vote was reminiscent of two decades ago, when a similar trail proposal, following a different route, was shot down over landowner complaints that a trail would devalue their property, provide a hazard for farm equipment and put an eyesore in the ditch before their homes.
Biking groups tout trail
Representatives of bicycle and trail groups from Bellevue, Omaha and Lincoln disputed that during public comments at the meeting, saying that existing vehicle traffic poses more of a safety risk and that projections indicate a completed trail would generate $2.5 million in economic activity for the county.
Already, there’s a weekly “nacho ride” from Lincoln to Eagle, and a regular “pie ride” to Elmwood that draws dozens of bikers.
When asked the status of the estimated $15.5 million trail project, Mike Sousek, general manager of the Lower Platte South NRD, responded “I’ll have to figure that out myself.”
“We will have to sit down with the county and reevaluate Route D and go from there,” Sousek said.
In rejecting the once-approved route — agreed to after months of public meetings and discussion — the Cass County Board set its April 22 meeting for the NRD to return with more precise plans for the route.
While a big win for local landowners who dispute the benefits of a recreational trail, it was a crushing defeat for bike enthusiasts, who see completion of the connector as a major step in the state and national development of a trail network.
The state, in 2022, allocated $8.3 million toward completion of the trail link.

Sousek said Tuesday that $400,000 had been spent on a consultant’s study of possible routes, and to conduct several public meetings to gather input. A $1.9 million contract was recently signed with JEO Consulting to design and engineer the trail, a limestone path that would be built in existing right-of-way in ditches parallel to existing county roads.
November’s agreement made clear that no private property would be used for the trail, and thus, the use of eminent domain was off limits. Route D was chosen in large part because it crossed the fewest residential driveways, nine, than the three other routes considered.
Sousek said the “gap” in financing the trail — between the $8.3 million allocated and the final cost, which he said he hoped to get down to $10 million or $12 million — would be covered by private donations from trail enthusiasts or, if the NRD Board deemed appropriate, property tax revenue. Trail advocates have said private donations would not be difficult to obtain.
Cass County is not contributing financially to the project, and the NRD has agreed to cover all costs of operation and maintenance. But because county road ditches are being used, the county has a big say on the route.
Some landowners object
Over and over at Tuesday’s meeting, Sousek said that the NRD would work with landowners who don’t want the trail crossing their driveways. Already, he said, he’d worked around the objections of one family by rerouting the trail to the other side of the road.
“I hear the complaints … I understand your concerns,” he told landowners attending the meeting, which overflowed the board meeting room. “I’m going to do everything in my power to address them.”

“We don’t come in and act like a bulldozer,” Sousek added. “We have a history that shows that partnerships work.”
Cass County Attorney Chris Perrone told county board members that they had a say in the final design of the trail, and if the trail caused any damage to county roads — by washing out a road or gravel — the county could seek legal action for the NRD to pay for it.
Perrone also told the board that the county could be liable for the costs already spent on the trail if it eventually doesn’t get built. He added that the county could also be sued for not proceeding with the trail project, noting that one lawsuit has already been filed to block the completion of the trail.
Stohlmann, who introduced the motion to rescind approval of the trail route, told the Examiner he wasn’t against the trail in any location, but wanted to talk to the NRD about other options.
Alex DeGarmo, chairman of the Cass County Board and the lone “no” vote to rescind the route decision, said after the meeting that a lot of the objections to the trail had been voiced, and heard, over the past few months.
“Hopefully, we’ll find an amiable resolution,” DeGarmo said.

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)More than a dozen states in the past two years have launched or expanded programs that allow families to use taxpayer dollars to send their students to private schools. Now, President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress want to supercharge those efforts.
Trump in January issued an executive order directing several federal agencies to allow states, tribes and military families to tap into federal money for so-called school choice opportunities. Those can come in the form of education savings accounts, voucher programs, tax credits or scholarships. Trump’s order also aims to expand access to public charter schools, which are free from some of the rules that apply to traditional public schools.
Meanwhile in Congress, 24 Republican senators have signed on to legislation that would provide $10 billion in annual tax credits to individuals and corporations who make charitable contributions to organizations that provide private-school scholarships. A Nebraska Republican introduced a companion measure in the House.
Already this year, Idaho, Tennessee and Wyoming have approved school choice programs, and bills are advancing in Kansas, New Hampshire, Ohio, South Carolina and Texas. A bill in Mississippi died before advancing. Most of the measures still in play would open programs to all families regardless of income, though some states would cap the total amount of money available.
Iowa’s Education Savings Account program, enacted in 2023, will remove all income limits for the 2025-26 school year.
Supporters of school choice say it gives parents control of their kids’ education — and an escape hatch if they are dissatisfied with their local public school. Many conservatives, religious institutions and private schools are in favor of school choice, along with some people of color who live in districts with underperforming public schools.
“Every child is different. They learn in different environments. There are just so many factors, that I believe that parents should be the ones that make the decision on where their child is going to do the best and have the most success,” said Indiana Republican state Sen. Linda Rogers. A former educator, Rogers has sponsored a bill in her state that would provide additional money to charter schools, which are considered to be a form of school choice.
Opponents, including teachers unions, public school professionals and many rural lawmakers of both parties, say such measures undermine traditional public schools by shifting money away from them.
“When we start to take from public schools, we’re hurting our kids, our lower-income kids. They will not prosper from this legislation,” Tennessee Democratic state Rep. Ronnie Glynn said during the floor debate on a far-reaching voucher bill in his state.
Joshua Cowen, a professor of education policy at Michigan State University, said vouchers are a budget-buster for states.
“Vouchers don’t shift costs — they add costs,” Cowen said in a phone interview. “Most voucher recipients were already in private schools, meaning states are paying for education they previously didn’t have to fund.”
The switch to remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, which gave parents a front-row seat to watch what their children were — or were not — learning in their classes, contributed to the recent school choice momentum. So did parent frustration over prolonged public school closures.










I believe that parents should be the ones that make the decision on where their child is going to do the best and have the most success.


– Indiana Republican state Sen. Linda Rogers


“Parents got a good look into sort of what was happening in schools,” said Bella DiMarco, a senior K-12 education policy analyst at FutureEd, an independent think tank at Georgetown University. “There was a lot of talk during the pandemic around school choice … of what public schools aren’t doing for their kids.”
The first modern school voucher program, created in Milwaukee in 1990, was a bipartisan effort to help lower-income families afford private schools. In recent years, more states have moved from school choice programs focused on certain groups, such as low-income students or students with disabilities, to universal programs open to students of all backgrounds.
“Historically, the programs were always sort of targeted to students in need,” DiMarco said. “But in the last couple of years, the new push has been for these universal programs.”
Currently, more than 30 states and Washington, D.C., have at least one school choice program. More than a dozen states now offer universal or near-universal access, allowing K–12 students to participate in school choice regardless of income.
EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice, estimates that 1.2 million students are attending private schools this school year with the help of public tax credits, scholarships or vouchers.
Different strategies
States that enacted school choice programs this year have pursued different strategies.
The program Idaho enacted last month, for example, will provide an annual tax credit of $5,000 per child ($7,500 for students with disabilities) to help cover private education expenses.










Most voucher recipients were already in private schools, meaning states are paying for education they previously didn’t have to fund.


– Joshua Cowen, a professor of education policy at Michigan State University


Tennessee’s new program will provide 20,000 scholarships of roughly $7,000 each. During its first year, half of the Tennessee scholarships will be reserved for households earning less than $173,000 for a family of four, but that restriction will be removed in subsequent years.
About 65% of the Tennessee vouchers are expected to be awarded to students who already attend private schools, according to a legislative analysis.
Critics say the cost of the program will grow quickly, creating a hole in the state’s budget. Tennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee, who pushed hard for the proposal, suggested that Trump’s executive order might provide additional resources. Lee told reporters he hasn’t yet analyzed the order, “but I think there’s opportunity there.”
“The president wants to support states like ours who are advocating for school choice,” Lee said in a news conference after lawmakers approved the measure. Lee was at the White House on Thursday when Trump signed an order calling for the U.S. Department of Education to be dismantled.
Texas lawmakers also are actively debating a voucher program, a longtime priority for Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who worked to defeat resistant rural Republicans in last year’s state legislative elections and who also attended the White House event. The Senate passed a bill that would provide $10,000 per student ($11,500 for students with disabilities) annually through education savings accounts. A similar House proposal is under review.
Kansas is considering a universal refundable tax credit — $8,000 per child for accredited private school tuition and $4,000 for non-accredited private schools. The program starts with a $125 million cap, increasing annually if participation hits certain thresholds.
Ballot box defeats
School choice opponents question the wisdom of sending taxpayer dollars to schools that may lack certified teachers, follow nonstandardized curricula or discriminate in admissions. Many private schools have testing standards, maintain religious requirements or exclude LGBTQ+ students or those with certain disabilities, for example.
In some Republican-led states that have expanded school choice, Democrats have filed bills to increase oversight and place restrictions on these programs. A bill in Tennessee would require background checks for teachers at private schools that receive voucher money. And an Iowa bill would require that property tax statements include information on how much money education savings accounts subtracted from local public schools.
As voucher programs have grown, they have attracted greater scrutiny.
ProPublica, an investigative journalism outlet, last year found that Arizona’s universal voucher program has mostly benefited wealthier families. Some Arizona parents have tried to use voucher money to pay for dune buggies and expensive Lego sets, according to press reports.
Critics also note that despite recent legislative successes, school ballot initiatives fared poorly at the ballot box last fall.
Voters in Colorado rejected a measure that sought to enshrine school choice rights in the state constitution.
In Nebraska, voters partially repealed a state-funded private school scholarship program.
And in Kentucky, voters overwhelmingly rejected a constitutional amendment that would have allowed the use of public money to support private schools, with 65% of voters — and a majority in every county — opposed.
“There’s a handful of these billionaires that have been pushing vouchers for 30 years,” said Cowen, the Michigan State University professor. “The school choice movement is not necessarily driven by public demand, but rather by wealthy donors and political maneuvering.”

Including ones that represent a “racial, sexual orientation and gender, or politically ideology viewpoint.”
The measure (SB 100) is sponsored by Republicans Randy Fine from Brevard County and Jonathan Martin from Lee County.
“If someone wants to walk in here draped in a flag of any political group, so be it, it’s their First Amendment right. If you want to hang it your yard, so be it. But a teacher should not be hanging a political flag in their classroom, having a government take a position on political views,” Fine told the Senate Community Affairs Committee.
“That is the idea. You shouldn’t be hanging them on flagpoles. Government should be in the governing business. Politics should be left to the politicians.”
LGBTQ advocates said the measure is aimed at local governments that display the Pride flag in June during Pride Month, and argued there is no compelling reason to pass such mandates on to local governments.
“The flag ban bill is unnecessary, unclear, unconstitutional, and dangerous,” said Jon Harris Mauer, public policy director with Equality Florida. “This bill is unnecessary. It does not help Floridians struggling with insurance and housing affordability. Instead it is a made-up solution to a cultural war for political purposes. But it will have real harms.”
“It’s wrong because LGBTQ+ is not political and this bill sends a message that our diversity shouldn’t be celebrated and people identifying as LGBTQ+ should be ashamed of who they are and hurts the fight against bullying,” said Tallahassee resident Colton Taylor. “I believe we should embrace each other lovingly, have compassion, see each other’s humanity, protect the LGBTQ+ community, and recognize that diversity is our strength.”
‘Special’ rights
John Labriola with the Christian Family Coalition of Florida supported the bill.
“The bill does not mention LGBTQ flags but it does say that you can’t have political flags, which that flag would be,” he said. After he was challenged on that assertion by South Florida Democratic Sen. Shevrin Jones that the Pride and/or Black Lives Matter flags were political, he fired back.
“The LGBT flag promotes a specific viewpoint that there should be special rights for LGBT people which isn’t going —” Labriola began.
“Special rights or equal rights?” Jones interjected.
“No, special rights. We believe in equal rights. We don’t believe in special rights,” Labriola said.
Perhaps most controversially, the bill would allow active or retired members of the armed forces or National Guard to “take reasonable efforts to stop someone from desecration, destruction, or removal of the United States flag.”
“I don’t want a retired military person to want or feel that they would have to enforce this bill,” said Naples Republican Kathleen Passidomo. “I do not want to see a 90-year-old veteran getting into an altercation with someone twice his size.”
Although she supported it on Tuesday, Passidomo, chair of the Rules Committee, said that unless constitutional problems are resolved for the measure, “I don’t see it going forward.”
Party-line vote
Fine argued that the citizens who spoke out about how their First Amendment rights would be violated if the measure passed wouldn’t feel the same way if some of those local governments were flying “Make America Great Again” flags.
The bill passed along party lines.
With Fine leaving the Senate today to campaign for a congressional seat next week, Lee County Republican Sen. Jonathan Martin will carry the bill the rest of the way this session. It has one more committee stop before making it to the floor.
The measure’s House companion (HB 75) is being sponsored by Republicans Berny Jacques from Pinellas County and David Borrero from Miami-Dade County. It has yet to be heard in any committee so far.

(Photo by Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)The race for an open seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court continues to draw  record-breaking campaign donations, with both candidates receiving contributions from billionaires and out-of-state donors. 
With less than a week left in the race that will decide the ideological balance  of the Court between Dane County Judge Susan Crawford and Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel, observers believe the total amount raised will reach $100 million by Election Day on April 1. That amount makes the race the most expensive state court election in U.S.history and far surpasses Wisconsin’s record of $56 million, which was set when Justice Janet Protasiewicz defeated former Justice Dan Kelly in the 2023 race. 
On Monday, the Crawford campaign announced that it had raised $17 million since early February and $24 million since she entered the race last summer. 
Full campaign finance reports of the reporting period are not yet available, but late contribution reports filed on Monday show Crawford’s campaign received more than $1.2 million in just the last few days, including more than $600,000 of in-kind donations from the Democratic Party of Wisconsin. 
The report also shows a number of contributions to Crawford of more than $1,000 from donors across the state and the U.S., including a $5,000 donation from the actor Kevin Bacon and $1,000 from former state Department of Revenue Secretary Peter Barca. 
Schimel’s late-filing report showed he received about $1.2 million from the Republican Party of Wisconsin. 
State law puts a $20,000 limit on individuals’ donations to a judicial campaign, however both candidates are benefiting from a workaround that allows unlimited donations to both political parties, which can in turn transfer unlimited amounts of cash to the campaigns. 
Schimel’s campaign has also received $13 million in outside support from a political action committee associated with Elon Musk. Musk has been an outspoken supporter of Schimel, and Musk’s America PAC, which he used to back President Trump during the 2024 election, has offered Wisconsin voters $100 to sign a petition opposing “activist judges” and has sent staff to knock on doors in Wisconsin.  Schimel was also endorsed by President Donald Trump over the  weekend. WisPolitics reported last week that Musk had also given $2 million to the state Republican party, the largest contribution ever recorded to the state GOP.

Jonah, 18, smiled as he left a fourth floor courtroom in downtown Louisville after a Tuesday hearing before Jefferson County Family Court Judge Angela Johnson, who approved an order agreed to by the parties. 
“I got what I needed. I got the protection order,” Jonah said. “I felt like the judge … understood. I felt like she’s more kind.” 
He also called out Matt Bevin for “intimidating” him in court last week. 
“That was pretty stressful, but I like the way it turned out. It turned out good today,” he said.  
In contrast with his Friday appearance before Johnson, when he represented himself and questioned Jonah, Matt Bevin had legal representation in court Tuesday and barely spoke.

The protective order, which all parties agreed to, says Matt Bevin cannot contact Jonah for six months. If there are no violations, the order will transition into a civil restraining order. 
Under this order, “the protections afforded to any victim of domestic violence would be in full force and effect,” Jonah’s lawyer, John Helmers, said in court. 
Then, “if there are any violations, my client (will) be afforded the protections of a domestic violence victim,” Helmers said.  
While the former governor is subject to a protective order, Glenna Bevin, his ex-wife, negotiated a civil restraining order. Glenna Bevin, who attended court via Zoom Tuesday, said in a statement that “this situation has been extremely difficult and painful for our entire family.” 
“I am glad it is over and the case against me is dismissed,” she said. “I love my children and want what is best for all of them.”

The extended order also directs the Bevins to provide Jonah, via his attorneys, information about his biological family. 
“That should not be required for this young man to learn about who his family is,” Judge Johnson said. “And I’ll leave that there. That should be done regardless.” 
Jonah has said he had  been told that his biological mother is dead but that Matt Bevin recently contacted him with an offer to reunite him with his mother if he left immediately for Ethiopia. 
The judge  also clarified to Matt Bevin: “While this is in effect, let’s just say that this young man goes into McDonald’s and you happen to interact with him. You have to leave, not him. You can’t contact him by social media, by third party message, by message. You cannot contact him. You can’t post on social media a message that is meant for him. You cannot have a gun while this order is in effect. Any violation of this will be considered a criminal offense.” 
Bevin ignored reporters who asked him questions as he left the courtroom. 
‘Huge step’  
Jonah was adopted by the Bevins at age 5 from Ethiopia. He alleges he experienced abuse and neglect in the Bevin home, culminating in his abandonment at a brutally abusive youth facility last year in Jamaica while he was 17. 
Tuesday’s order extends the temporary protective order he obtained on March 7 against Matt Bevin, saying he fears him and wants no contact with him.

Dawn J. Post, a New York lawyer and child advocate who is also representing Jonah, said after the hearing that the extension is “a very important first step.” 
“Jonah is an amazing, wonderful, intelligent young man. I am so glad that he had the opportunity to speak his truth,” Post said. 
She also said she expects other youth from the Jamaica facility to file cases in the future.

“This is not the end of this journey, but it is a huge step for all the boys who were told repeatedly, ‘no one will believe you, everyone will believe that you’re liars, you’re just liars and manipulators,’” Post said. “And that’s not true, and whether or not race plays a part in this or not, the fact is that Jonah finally was able to have his truth spoken and he was heard. And I really, really appreciate that fact.” 
Jonah Bevin also expressed gratitude for the chance to share his story and be heard. 
“A lot of the kids get adopted by rich, white families, and they don’t get to speak what they need to speak. People don’t hear them out. People don’t know what’s going on, because it looks like to everybody that … Matt Bevin had everything figured out in his life. But he had nothing figured out,” Jonah said. “There’s an image they want people to see, and they don’t want an actual image of what’s actually going on in their homes. And today we brought it out. We brought out what he didn’t want people to see.”

United States hold a press conference in 2019 outside the Supreme Court Building in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Robin Loznak, courtesy of Our Children’s Trust)The nation’s highest court declined to hear a petition that would have revived a landmark climate change lawsuit against the federal government, led by young Oregonians and their peers from across the country.
The court’s denial ends 21 youths’ decade-long fight for a trial where they could hold the U.S. government accountable for accelerating global climate change through lawmakers’ policies and fossil fuel subsidies. Despite the setback, it has spurred dozens more cases like it in individual states and around the world.
The nine members of the U.S. Supreme Court denied Monday a petition to throw out a lower court’s decision to dismiss the case Juliana v. United States. The Supreme Court justices dismissed the petition without prejudice, meaning the plaintiffs could attempt to bring it back one day.
Juliana v. United States was first filed in U.S. District Court in Eugene in 2015. Eleven Oregon youths and 10 of their peers from Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, New York, Pennsylvania and Washington, who were between 8 and 18 years old at the time the suit was filed, are listed as plaintiffs.
Among them is Miko Vergun of Bearverton, who said in a news release that she was proud of the impact the case has had on more than 60 similar lawsuits filed against other states and nations.
“For almost ten years, we’ve stood up for the rights of present and future generations, demanding a world where we can not only survive, but thrive,” Vergun said. “We’ve faced extreme resistance by the federal government, yet we’ve never wavered in our resolve.”
Vergun, now 22, has been involved in climate activism since she was in seventh grade, according to Our Children’s Trust. She was born in the Marshall Islands, a Pacific island nation, and attributed her activism to making sure that land stays above sea level.
In the U.S., the Juliana case most recently inspired Held v. State of Montana and Navahine v. Hawaii Department of Transportation, both of which led to 2024 decisions affirming the youth plaintiffs’ state constitutional rights to a clean, healthful and life-sustaining environment.
Since 2015, fossil fuel companies, the U.S. Department of Justice, former President Joe Biden, current President Donald Trump and Republican states attorneys general have filed court documents to dismiss the case and to keep it from going to trial.
Most recently, in May, three Trump-appointed judges on the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco sided with the U.S. Department of Justice in ordering the case be dismissed. In June Julia Olson, attorney for the youth behind the case, filed a request for a rehearing with the Ninth Circuit.
Oregon’s U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, filed a “friend of the court brief” urging the court to grant it. It was signed by 39 other congressional Democrats, including Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, state Rep. Val Hoyle, representing Oregon’s 4th Congressional District and former state Rep. Earl Blumenauer, who represented Oregon’s 3rd Congressional District.
“The Supreme Court’s decision today is not the end of the road and the impact of Juliana cannot be measured by the finality of this case alone,” Olson said in a news release.
Olson said the trust would continue supporting other cases worldwide, and that she would see the U.S. government back in court one day soon. The Supreme Court did not address the merits of the case, and Our Children’s Trust noted in its news release that the court hears less than 2% of the cases it’s brought each year.
“This fight is far from over,” Olson said. “This is a call to all young people who want to stand up to those in the executive office of the president who would silence you and threaten your health and safety — join us in protecting your constitutional rights.”

Free.,U.S. House progressives rally for detained Palestinian activist,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-progressives-rally-detained-palestinian-activist,,"WASHINGTON — A group of progressive U.S. House Democrats on Tuesday rebuked the detainment by immigration authorities of Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil and demanded that he be released from a Louisiana detention center.At a press conference steps outside the U.S. Capitol, Reps. Delia Ramirez of Illinois, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Pramila Jayapal of Washington state and Greg Casar of Texas argued that Khalil’s First Amendment rights were violated, as the Syria-born lawful permanent resident appeared to be targeted for his activism and not any immigration violations.“The detention and threatened deportation of Mahmoud is illegal, and it is a direct assault on our constitutional rights to due process, freedom of speech and right to protest and on dissent itself,” Tlaib said.Vince Warren, executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights and Mike Zamore, national director of policy and government affairs at the American Civil Liberties Union, joined the members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus in speaking out against Khalil’s arrest Tuesday.Both advocacy groups are among those providing legal representation for Khalil.“We should also be clear that this is not a regular deportation proceeding,” Warren said.“What this is is an attempt at disappearance, again, something that happens routinely in authoritarian countries, and it is happening right here.”In a filing on Sunday, the administration alleged that Khalil did run afoul of immigration law, saying he lied on his permanent residency application when he “withheld membership in certain organizations and failed to disclose continuing employment by the Syria Office in the British Embassy in Beirut.”Court challengeU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested Khalil — a former Columbia University student who helped organize protests against the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza — in New York City this month. He was later moved to a detention facility in Louisiana.Khalil challenged the lawfulness of his detention in a New York federal court, and a federal judge last week transferred his case to a court in New Jersey.The administration claimed that Khalil “led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization” and is calling for his deportation.President Donald Trump has vowed to crack down on students protesting against the war in Gaza.He and his administration conflated Khalil’s protests of the war in Gaza with support for Hamas to rationalize the arrest.BacklashThe lawmakers’ event Tuesday was part of the backlash against the arrest that civil rights groups view as targeting political speech.Tlaib referenced a letter Khalil wrote inside the detention center, where he described his arrest as a “direct consequence” of exercising his right to free speech.

“The Trump administration is targeting me as part of a broader strategy to suppress dissent,” Khalil wrote. “Visa-holders, green-card carriers, and citizens alike will all be targeted for their political beliefs.”Jayapal dubbed the administration’s actions regarding Khalil “unconstitutional.”The Washington state Democrat, who led the Congressional Progressive Caucus  until this year, said Khalil’s detainment marked the start of a “chilling war” on free speech rights in the United States.Casar added “the administration targeting people for detention based on their political views should send a chill down the spine of every single American.”“This administration’s plans will not end with Mr. Khalil — they will target activists who speak out about the plundering of taxpayer dollars by billionaires,” said the Texas Democrat, who chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus.“They will target those whistleblowers who speak out about the incompetence that we see within this administration,” he said.Meanwhile, the American Association of University Professors, its chapters at Harvard University, Rutgers University and New York University, along with the Middle East Studies Association, filed suit against the Trump administration on Tuesday to block them “from carrying out large-scale arrests, detentions, and deportations of noncitizen students and faculty members who participate in pro-Palestinian protests and other protected First Amendment activities.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

Senate bills 30 and 39 would further restrict access to life-saving medical care for adolescent transgender patients, and, [&#8230;]","Opponents of legislation that would place restrictions on transgender Georgians gathered across from the state Capitol in January. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderAs medical and mental health providers, we are deeply concerned about two bills currently making their way through the state Legislature that would prevent us from providing necessary medical care for some of our most vulnerable patients.
 Senate bills 30 and 39 would further restrict access to life-saving medical care for adolescent transgender patients, and, in an unprecedented step, would make it more difficult for some adult transgender patients to obtain gender-affirming care. These policies would infringe on the rights of health care providers, families, and patients to make important medical decisions, risking the medical and mental health of transgender people in our state. We unequivocally believe that all Georgians should have access to high-quality, evidence-based medical care, and we strongly oppose any legislation that would harm the health and wellbeing of our transgender and gender diverse patients. 
In 2023, Gov. Brian Kemp signed Senate Bill 140 into law, a ban on essential health care for transgender youth preventing medical providers from prescribing hormone therapy to minors but maintaining patient access to puberty-delaying medications. For transgender adolescents, puberty can be a time of significant distress, with bodily changes that are upsetting, unwelcome, inconsistent with the way they see themselves, and can contribute to anxiety and depressive symptoms. Puberty-delaying medications allow adolescents in the early stages of puberty and their families more time to make decisions about their medical care with guidance from their trusted health care providers. Importantly, puberty-delaying medications have been used safely for more than three decades for various conditions like precocious puberty and endometriosis, and they not only have reversible effects on puberty but also are well-studied and have a good safety profile.
Despite assurances from the sponsors of SB 140 that they would not seek to further restrict medical care for transgender patients, these same lawmakers are now proposing SB 30, which would prohibit access to puberty-delaying medications for transgender youth while ensuring that cisgender youth can continue to benefit from this treatment.
 Restricting these medications for transgender youth not only goes against the current scientific evidence, but it is also discriminatory against a particular group of adolescents. Furthermore, the mental health consequences for transgender youth that will occur because of this policy are quite severe and entirely preventable. Prohibiting health care professionals from providing necessary and life-saving treatment to our transgender patients is a stark example of government overreach and directly challenges our professional responsibility to prevent harm and reduce suffering for those entrusted in our care.
Provisions in SB 39 would also restrict access to health care for adult and pediatric transgender patients in two distinct ways. First, this bill denies coverage of gender-affirming care for Georgians who rely on the State Health Benefit Plan, which currently covers more than half a million state employees, teachers, retirees, and their dependents. This bill expands upon current restrictions and those proposed in SB 30 as it would be the first law proposed in Georgia that prevents transgender adults from accessing their medications and other treatments. 
Additionally, SB 39 would prevent health care providers at state-owned or -operated medical facilities from providing gender-affirming care to any transgender patient regardless of their age or insurance plan. Due to the vague language used in the bill, the potential impact of this policy on the practice of health care professionals remains unclear. When questioned during a hearing in the Senate Committee on Insurance and Labor, Sen. Blake Tillery, the bill’s sponsor, failed to assuage concerns that this policy could impact medical institutions throughout Georgia that receive any amount of state funding. Instead of trusting medical professionals in Georgia to assess and treat patients based on our best clinical judgement and medical treatment guidelines, lawmakers undermine our expertise by inserting themselves into the medical decision-making process in service of an ill-informed and explicitly harmful political agenda. 
Gender-affirming health care for transgender people, which can include the use of puberty-delaying medication and hormone therapy, is considered the standard of care by every major medical and mental health association in the United States, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Endocrine Society, the Pediatric Endocrine Society, and the American Psychological Association, among many others. Numerous clinical studies have repeatedly demonstrated the positive and often life-saving effects of gender-affirming medical care. Transgender patients with access to the care they need have better mental health outcomes, including lower levels of depression and suicidal thoughts, as well as an improved sense of wellbeing. The substantial health benefits of gender-affirming care are indisputable based on scientific evidence and further supported by our clinical experiences caring for transgender patients. We fervently advocate for our patients to maintain access to medical care that helps improve their overall health and wellbeing. 
Georgia currently faces substantial challenges with recruiting and retaining medical and mental health providers. More than 30 counties in Georgia have been identified as high need areas impacted by provider shortages. Laws that restrict health care professionals from practicing evidence-based medicine further exacerbate this problem. Many medical and mental health providers, regardless of specialty, have concerns for their safety, their patients’ well-being, and the freedom to provide effective and compassionate care in states where lawmakers prioritize partisan politics over health care access and patient autonomy. Georgians across the state will ultimately suffer the consequences of provider shortages as a result of legislative overreach into health care decisions and aggressive efforts to criminalize medical care that is robustly supported by scientific evidence.
We, as health care providers in Georgia, stand in strong opposition to a political strategy that seeks to dehumanize transgender people and restrict the rights of adult and pediatric transgender patients to fully access the medical care that they need. The protection of personal freedom and choice are core values of our state and include decisions made in health care settings. We urge lawmakers to vote no on SB 30 and SB 39 and to stop all efforts to politicize medical care for transgender Georgians.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Tuesday discussion around a Bureau of Motor Vehicle (BMV) bill descended into impassioned debate over marijuana advertising, which Republican lawmakers said should be restricted.
In contention was House Bill 1390, authored by Rep. Jim Pressel, R-Rolling Prairie. The underlying legislation originally just dealt with BMV agency matters, like insurance verification, specialty license plates and registration stickers.
But among multiple changes adopted by the Senate transportation committee on Tuesday — including a significant amendment addressing “predatory” towing — was a ban on “outdoor” marijuana advertising, notably on highway billboards. 
Specifically, the amended bill language seeks to prohibit outdoor advertisements for products containing marijuana or a variety of other controlled substances, including heroin, LSD and ecstasy.

The bill now moves to the Senate Appropriations Committee.
Pressel — whose district extends to Indiana’s northern border — described “billboards all over the place that say, ‘Come to my store and buy this,’” referencing dispensaries in Michigan, where recreational marijuana is legal. 
“And we have trucks, mobile billboards, that drive around and sit in front of our parks. That’s unacceptable, and it sends a mixed message to the consumer that this product is legal in Indiana, which it is not,” Pressel said, who unsuccessfully attempted to add the provision to a separate House bill earlier in the session.
“I think that’s an unfair message,” he continued, “and I believe that we should get in front of this to say that if it’s an illegal substance, listed on our illegal substance list in the state of Indiana, you should not be able to advertise for that.”
Multiple advertisers pushed back.
Ron Breymier, executive director of the Outdoor Advertising Association of Indiana, cited First Amendment issues. He argued that policymakers can dictate the size and placement of billboards, but “not the actual advertisement itself.”
Phones and internet searches, Breymier said, are a “greater threat” than billboards.
Rather than a ban, he recommended a requirement for advertisers to include disclaimers on the billboards “so citizens know that it’s not legal to possess or consume” marijuana or other substances in Indiana.
Jason Graham, vice president of Lamar Advertising, the state’s largest billboard operator, wasn’t opposed to regulation, but took issue with a ban “that’s directly targeted towards just one media.” 
“If we feel this strongly … I don’t think it should be just billboards,” he said.
Pressel and other lawmakers said they’d be open to expanding the prohibition to other forms of advertising, too.

Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa and House Assistant Majority Leader Josh Tanner, R-Eagle, would allow the death penalty in a new criminal [&#8230;]","Idaho Gov. Brad Little gives his annual State of the State address on Jan. 6, 2025, on the House floor at the Statehouse in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)A bill to allow the death penalty for adults who sexually abuse children age 12 and younger in Idaho is headed to Idaho Gov. Brad Little for final consideration.
House Bill 380, cosponsored by Rep. Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa and House Assistant Majority Leader Josh Tanner, R-Eagle, would allow the death penalty in a new criminal charge the bill creates: Aggravated lewd conduct with children age 12 and younger.
The bill also would add mandatory minimum prison sentences for cases of aggravated lewd conduct with minors — which would only apply to abuse of children age 16 and below — that don’t meet the bill’s proposed criteria for death penalty eligibility.
The Idaho Legislature widely passed the bill this year. The Idaho Senate passed the bill Monday on a 30-5  vote, with opposition from three Senate Democrats and two Senate Republicans. Last week, the Idaho House unanimously passed the bill, with 63 votes in favor and seven lawmakers absent.
When the bill is transmitted to Gov. Brad Little, he has five days, excluding Sundays, to decide on it. He has three options: sign it into law, allow it to become law without his signature, or veto it.
If passed into law, the bill would take effect July 1.
  Bill would send a message, Sen. Doug Ricks says 

Skaug has told lawmakers Idaho has some of the nation’s most lenient child rape laws.
“Unlike most states, Idaho currently lacks mandatory minimum sentences for these horrific crimes — meaning judges have the discretion to place the worst offenders on probation,” bill cosponsor Sen. Doug Ricks, R-Rexburg, told the Senate on Monday. “This legislation ensures that those who commit the most severe offenses against children face significant consequences, sending a clear message that Idaho will not tolerate the sexual abuse of minors, especially our children.”
Idaho law only allows the death penalty in first-degree murder cases with aggravating circumstances.
Idaho Gov. Brad Little recently signed a bill into law that will make the Gem State the only state to use firing squads as its main execution method. Skaug also cosponsored that bill.
Idaho Senate Minority Leader Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, voted against the death penalty for child sex abuse bill. She said harming a child should carry significant penalties, but she said the bill represents a significant policy shift for Idaho.
“Unfortunately, I only heard from four sources regarding this bill. And that feels very uncomfortable, when I think we need a vigorous and long debate and discussion,” Wintrow said.
  U.S. Supreme Court already struck down death penalties for child rape. Idaho lawmakers expect a legal challenge. 

The U.S. Supreme Court in 2008 blocked death penalties for child rape in Kennedy v. Louisiana.
Florida passed a child rape death penalty law two years ago. Last year, Tennessee passed a child rape death penalty law.
Bracing for a legal challenge to the bill, Skaug told lawmakers he expects the U.S. Supreme Court would rule differently.
“You can say, ‘Well, that’s unconstitutional, Bruce. Why would you bring that?’ Well, it was — according to a 5-4 decision in 2008. I don’t think that would be the case today,” Skaug, an attorney, told lawmakers in a House committee hearing. “That’s my professional opinion. That’s the opinion of many other attorneys.”
Skaug has said the death penalty would be rarely sought under his bill. Nine people are on death row in Idaho, according to the Idaho Department of Correction.
  Defense attorney suggests many cases would be death penalty eligible 

Public testimony has been largely supportive of the bill.
But in a Senate Judiciary and Rules Committee hearing on the bill on Wednesday, David Martinez of the Idaho Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers testified against the bill, arguing the bill doesn’t focus on “the worst of the worst,” could potentially expose victims of decades of reliving trauma, and fails to account for Idaho’s shortage of qualified death penalty defense attorneys.
The bill outlines more than a dozen aggravating factors under which prosecutors can seek the death penalty. Only three are required to seek the death penalty, which would only be available in cases of aggravated lewd conduct against minors age 12 and younger.
But in almost every lewd conduct case Martinez has handled or supervised, he said at least three of those factors are already present.
Using force or coercion is one of the aggravating factors outlined in the bill. But that’s inherently present in every lewd conduct case because minors can’t consent to the conduct, Martinez said.
“What this bill actually does is subsume the underlying crime, because potentially all (lewd and lascivious cases) will fall under this new statute, and none under the old,” Martinez testified in committee.
Holly Rebholtz, representing the Idaho Prosecuting Attorneys Association, said she disagreed, saying the new aggravated lewd conduct crime wouldn’t be charged very often.
“I don’t think these crimes are going to come into play very often. But when they do, they are the most serious crimes we see. And again, the prosecutors believe that the most serious crimes against children deserve a serious punishment,” Rebholtz testified.
Skaug told the committee that Idaho public defenders were not able to immediately estimate the bill’s costs. But in a worst case scenario, Skaug said, there could be two cases each year at a cost of as much as a million dollars per case.
 Senate Republican opposed bill, saying ‘We are starting to equate revenge with justice’ 

Sen. Dan Foreman, R-Moscow, a combat veteran and retired police officer, voted against the bill on the Senate floor. He was also one of few Republicans to vote against a bill to make the firing squad the main death penalty method in Idaho.
“I see society starting to go down a dangerous road here. Not just with this bill, but in general — where we are starting to equate revenge with justice. And that’s a slippery slope,” Foreman said in a committee hearing last week on the child sex abuse death penalty bill.
Senate Majority Leader Lori Den Hartog, R-Meridian, argued on the Senate floor that the bill isn’t about retribution.
“When I look at the types of circumstances that would lead to these charges — and I think about the irreparable and irreversible damage done to a child who then has to live with the consequences of these actions upon them for the rest of their lives — I think this is about accountability and about how we value life,” she said.
 This is Skaug’s second attempt at child sex abuse death penalty bill 

This year’s child sex abuse death penalty bill is Skaug and Tanner’s second attempt at such a bill. Last year, another bill they brought widely passed the House but never received a Senate committee hearing.
Skaug and Tanner’s new bill this year — cosponsored by eight other Idaho lawmakers — would establish the new crime, and mandatory minimums criminal sentences. For instance, the bill’s proposed mandatory minimum sentence for aggravated lewd conduct with minors under age 16 would carry at least 25 years in prison.
Under the bill, lewd conduct with a minor would include but is not limited to “genital-genital contact, oral-genital contact, anal-genital contact, oral-anal contact, manual-anal contact, or manual-genital contact” when such acts are meant to arouse, appeal to or gratify “lust or passions or sexual desires.”

(Daniel Finsley | Finsley Creative for West Virginia Watch)The West Virginia Senate is considering legislation that would prohibit homeless people and others from “camping” on public property throughout the state. Homeless services providers say the resources it would take to enforce such a ban would be better spent to bolster the state’s emergency shelter network and affordable housing.
House Bill 2382 would impose up to a $500 fine or 30 days in jail for camping or storing personal belongings on streets, parks, trails or other public property. It defines camping as using backpacks, sleeping bags, blankets and other equipment. 
The bill has already been approved by the House of Delegates. The Senate Judiciary Committee last week amended the bill to add that law enforcement may refer people to shelters, mental health or addiction services instead of imposing a penalty. 
The bill was referred to the Senate’s Rules Committee on second reading Tuesday due to calendar management, a spokeswoman for the Senate said.  
Mark Phillips, president and CEO of Catholic Charities West Virginia — an organization that provides homeless services throughout the state, including an emergency shelter in Morgantown and a day shelter in Wheeling — testified last week that though the legislation allows law enforcement to tell people about resources to get help finding shelter, the state does not have enough emergency shelter beds for every homeless person. 
The state has approximately 600 emergency shelter beds during the winter, and about half that during the warmer months, he said. 
There were about 1,800 sheltered and unsheltered homeless people counted during the 2024 Point in Time count. 
During an interview, Phillips said his main concern with the bill is that it’s an attempt to hide homelessness rather than addressing the reasons people end up without housing. 
“The primary concern just seems to be getting people who are experiencing homelessness off a street or park or wherever, and moving them somewhere, even if that doesn’t help the root cause of the problem,” he said. 
According to the state Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation, it costs about on average $20,000 per year to jail someone. Phillips said it would be cheaper to fund shelters. 
“These shelters are specifically structured to help people move back toward housing, whether that’s counseling toward treatment, counseling toward mental illness, or breaking down barriers to housing, whatever it is, that’s what these places do,” he said. “To put people experiencing homelessness right into a prison system that we know does not work for people experiencing homelessness, just continues to perpetuate the problem. These people would just end up right back on the street, and now they have an additional something on their record.”
The bill would push the cost of enforcement to the cities and counties when it could be funding housing initiatives, he said. 
In Charleston, the two emergency shelters stay full, said Traci Strickland, executive director of the Kanawha Valley Collective, a continuum of care that serves Kanawha, Clay, Boone and Putnam counties. 
“I’m sure this morning, like every other morning, we had people line up at our centralized assessment office to try to get a bed in shelter, and they’re going to be told that there aren’t beds available, that the beds are full,” Strickland said. 
Beyond the lack of shelter beds, Strickland said people have a hard time finding and securing affordable housing because of their history with homelessness and mental illness.
“We have individuals experiencing homelessness that want to be in shelter or want to be housed, and we have agencies that are working really hard to make that happen, but there are barriers every step of the way,” she said.
A shortage of affordable housing units in the state also contributes to homelessness, providers say.
West Virginia has a shortage of about 25,000 low income housing units, according to the latest analysis by the National Low Income Housing Coalition. 
“Criminalizing homelessness is a harmful policy that not only fails to address the root causes of homelessness, but also exacerbates economic challenges in rural communities and states,” said Lauren Frederick, continuum of care director for the West Virginia Coalition to End Homelessness.
“Focusing on criminalization ignores long-term solutions like affordable housing, mental health care and job programs, which are more effective and cost-efficient,” she said. “Investing in affordable housing and support services is a more compassionate, sustainable and cost-effective solution to homelessness.”
While homeless providers generally do not support encampments as an ideal situation for communities or the people living in them in encampments, Frederick said there’s a cost-effective, humane way to dismantle an encampment, offering connection to permanent housing resources and proper notice to those living there to arrange to remove their belongings. 
“Criminalizing homelessness does nothing to address the root issues that cause homelessness. It simply adds more barriers for people to have to overcome to try to get out of it,” said Ashley Hawkins, director of community relations for the West Virginia Coalition to End Homelessness.
Homeless people very likely cannot afford the fine associated with the offense, and criminal offenses on a person’s record can prevent access to housing assistance and be a deterrent to a landlord, she said. 
  Del. Geno Chiarelli, D-Monongalia
“Adding barriers to people is never going to help solve the problem,” Hawkins said. “What would help solve the problem is if there was a bit more of a focus on long-term housing situations, on mental health, on job programs, things of that nature that actually address some of the causes. This does not.”
Since the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a camping ban in Grants Pass, Oregon last summer, dozens of local governments around the country have passed similar laws as they grapple with record levels of homelessness amid a shortage of affordable housing.
In West Virginia, Morgantown, Clarksburg, Bluefield and Princeton passed camping bans last year. Morgantown residents successfully petitioned to have the ban reconsidered. The issue is expected to be decided during the city’s election next month. Del. Geno Chiarelli, R-Monongalia, the lead sponsor of House Bill 2382, said he introduced the legislation in response to Morgantown’s camping ban possibly being overturned. 
  Sen. Mike Stuart, R-Kanawha
Proponents of camping bans say encampments are a deterrent to economic development and discourage people from using public parks and spaces.
An attorney for the Senate Judiciary Committee said that, should it become law, House Bill 2382, would allow municipalities to authorize camping within certain areas in their jurisdictions. 
Senate Judiciary Chairman Mike Stuart, R-Kanawha, said House Bill 2382 is not aimed only at homeless people, but could be used during anti-Israeli protests. 
“This would apply, you see these outrageous pro-Hamas demonstrations that are violent in places like New York,” Stuart said. “This would apply there, where some of those violent radical groups are camping and disturbing the peace. It would apply.”

I mean, I know what they want right now. Lower (or nonexistent) taxes, the dismantling of public education, fewer (or zero) protections for LGBTQ people, the disappearance of migrants who lack the proper documentation, the elimination of environmental regulations, the continued dominance of fossil fuels, [&#8230;]","People protest various actions undertaken by the Trump administration and Elon Musk during a rally in front of the State House on March 14, 2025. (Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)I’m confused about what Republican voters in New Hampshire want.
I mean, I know what they want right now. Lower (or nonexistent) taxes, the dismantling of public education, fewer (or zero) protections for LGBTQ people, the disappearance of migrants who lack the proper documentation, the elimination of environmental regulations, the continued dominance of fossil fuels, reductions to (or the end of) the social safety net, more power for parents to control what their kids learn at school, a version of the American story that redacts any mention of genocide or slavery, a male- and Christian-dominated system of women’s reproductive health care, freedom from vaccination and other public health initiatives, and the overall elimination of the public sector as we know it.
That much is clear. What I don’t understand is what they want ultimately.
Once all of the so-called liberal or progressive policies and systems are eradicated, what kind of state and nation are we left with? The replies from the right are not tough to predict: “Sounds like paradise to me.” But that’s just the politics of retribution talking, with all of its B.S. bravado and “Make America Great Again” inanity.
Is a society without community-based public education a better society? Republicans seem to think so, but I can’t wrap my brain around what it is they are picturing instead. When education is privatized, which is the ultimate goal of school vouchers, how can the system create anything other than rich schools for rich kids and poor schools for poor kids, a predicament-by-design not unlike the one we find ourselves in now. So, vouchers can’t be the solution. The answer to New Hampshire’s equity problem is fair taxation and distribution — a system of public education no longer reliant on collective wealth within town lines. Republicans like to scare voters away from this kind of unity by screaming “socialism” at every opportunity, but what they are proposing instead is increased inequality through privatization. How is that a better situation for anyone other than the already wealthy and powerful?
How is society stronger when our transgender or immigrant neighbors are afraid for their very lives because of policies instituted or protections repealed based on nothing more than apocryphal anecdotes and cultivated fear? How is our beautiful state an even better place to live because environmental regulations are eliminated and clean power and energy efficiency initiatives are blocked? Even if you buy the economic arguments of the need for fossil fuel-based energy policies, is the degradation of New Hampshire’s natural environment (and, you know, the continued destruction of the planet) worth it? And are we such big fans of free-market liberty that we’ll accept the White Mountain National Forest being opened up to any and all kinds of corporate exploitation?
Is all of that the goal?
And what do New Hampshire Republicans want for their children? Freedom from vaccines that are intended to make their very future more assured? Do they want their kids to believe that the American experiment was of divine creation, that there was no tragic abandonment of human principles at any point along the way to the 21st century? No colonization, no genocide, no slavery, no segregation, no lynchings, no red-lining. To what end do we create those gaps in our children’s knowledge? Is it the belief that there can be darkness or light, good or evil, but not both? That we are a nation built and maintained only by heroes, so different from the rest of us in our daily imperfection and inability to live up to our own standards of behavior? What is more human than wanting, needing to know — about what lies over the horizon, in the stars, at the bottom of the ocean, in the hearts of those who are so different from ourselves? 
Is the point to stop the kids from yearning for knowledge and understanding about the complexities of how this moment came to be?
I know that not all New Hampshire Republicans want the same things. For some, it’s the pro-business, anti-tax piece of the platform that makes them register as Republicans. For others, it’s a desire for revenge against societal shifts that they don’t like or that make them uncomfortable — for which they use the shorthand “woke.” But in this moment, made unique by the appetite and actions of Donald Trump and his administration, it is impossible for a New Hampshire Republican to pick and choose the way the party does or does not represent their desires.
In the March 27 edition of The New York Review of Books, Neal Ascherson writes about a recent book by Richard J. Evans titled “Hitler’s People: The Faces of the Third Reich.” 
Here’s Ascherson, under the headline “Ordinary Germans”: “The late Erhard Eppler, a radical Christian who became ‘the conscience of Social Democrats’ in postwar West Germany, used to invoke the Roman fasces as the image of twentieth-century fascism: a bundle of quite disparate rods (or policies) held together by the strap of the leader. When the strap is cut, the rods scatter, and people could claim that ‘I agreed with Hitler about revising the Versailles Treaty or ‘degenerate culture,’ but I always thought the persecution of the Jews a grave mistake. So I never believed in the whole fasces-bundle. So I was never truly a Nazi!’ To which Evans’s book in effect retorts: During the Third Reich, you could not pick and choose between ‘rods.’ You either accepted or rejected the bundle as a whole.”
I bring up Ascherson’s description of the rods and the bundle not to compare regimes but rather to see what one political moment can tell us about another. To be a Republican in New Hampshire in 2025 is to be for all of the things I mentioned at the top of this essay. The social, cultural, political, and economic toll of that bundle is such that no one can claim liberty to choose from among the rods, now or later. 
There was a time when a Republican could declare themselves a “moderate” or a “fiscal conservative,” but times have changed in a way that disallows that luxury. All that remains is history’s clear choice: You either accept or reject the bundle as a whole.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/statehouseGOPdesires-1024x639.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Gov. Dan McKee’s pitch to raise salaries for 11 state cabinet members is not getting the typical stamp of approval by state lawmakers.
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi in an interview with Tara Granahan on WPRO on Monday expressed reservations with McKee’s proposed pay hikes, noting the projected $250 million budget deficit for the fiscal year that starts July 1.
“We simply don’t have that money,” Shekarchi, a Warwick Democrat, told Granahan. 
Of McKee’s pay raises, Shekarchi said, “It’s a different message than what I am saying to every single advocacy group that comes to see me that wants funding.”
Shekarchi also revealed he was not given any advanced notice of the governor’s proposed pay bumps prior to reading about them in the Providence Journal. The Journal first reported on the annual salary increases last Friday, based on a public hearing notice filed by the Rhode Island Department of Administration.
A public hearing on the pay increases for 11 cabinet heads will take place at 11 a.m. Wednesday at the William E. Powers Department of Administration building, with an option for remote participation.


 

It’s not uncommon for some or all state cabinet directors to get an annual pay bump; state law allows for a vetting of department leaders each year in March. Proposed pay raises automatically take effect within 30 days of being referred to the Rhode Island General Assembly unless both chambers of the legislature reject them.
Last year’s raises were adopted without pushback from lawmakers. The 2024 pay hikes included a 42% raise for the vacant state health director post, which was subsequently filled by Dr. Jerry Larkin.
This year, McKee has proposed 5% raises for nine cabinet heads. Another two positions heading the Rhode Island Department of Transportation and Department of Public Safety would see raises of 2% and 0.5%, respectively.
Karen Greco, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Department of Administration, said in an email Tuesday that the adjustments aim to bring salaries in line with neighboring states.
“Compensation consideration is based on several factors, most notably wage comparisons for similar roles from Maine to Maryland, with particular attention paid to salaries in neighboring Massachusetts and Connecticut, to ensure Rhode Island attracts and retains top talent in a very competitive market,” Greco said of the combined $82,000 in increases.
Nine of the 11 cabinet positions slated to see increases in their “base salary” levels — which does not account for overtime or other compensation and benefits — also received pay bumps in 2024. All of the cabinet heads set to receive a second year of consecutive salary raises are men, except for Ashley Deckert, director of the Department of Children, Youth and Families.
Also in line for a salary increase: Rhode Island Department of Public Transportation Director Peter Alviti Jr., who remains under close public scrutiny over his department’s handling of the Washington Bridge closure and rebuild. Alviti’s 2% raise, if approved, would bring his base salary to $192,000 a year. Alviti was appointed by then-Gov. Gina Raimondo in 2015; and is the longest-serving state cabinet member.
DOA Director Jonathan Womer, who also got a raise last year, would see the largest dollar increase this year, from $185,590 to $194,880, under McKee’s proposal, equal to 5%. Col. Darnell Weaver, Rhode Island State Police superintendent and director of the public safety department, would have the highest base pay of the 11 department heads proposed to receive increases; however, his $196,000 salary reflects only a 0.5% bump over the prior year.
Other cabinet positions slated to receive raises for a second consecutive year include director of the Department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals; director of the Department of Corrections; director of the Department of Environmental Management; director of the Department of Labor and Training; and the director of the Department of Revenue. 
Two of the 11 cabinet positions up for raises this year did not receive them last year, both of which are held by women.  Department of Business Regulation Director Elizabeth Dwyer and Department of Human Services Director Kimberly Merolla-Brito were both appointed to their positions by McKee in 2023.
Strong reaction
Shekarchi told Granahan Monday that lawmakers are already hearing from constituents who are “reacting very strongly” to the proposed salary increases this year. He did not specify whether certain positions were subject to more public scrutiny.
Rep. Enrique Sanchez, a Providence Democrat, blasted the proposed increases as “ridiculous” in a post on X on Monday night.
“Governor McKee is out of his mind if he thinks raising the salaries of Director Alviti and other cabinet members is a good idea,” Sanchez wrote.
Senate Minority Leader Jessica de la Cruz, a North Smithfield Republican, also criticized the proposed pay raises in a statement Tuesday.
“As average hard-working Rhode Islanders face staggering energy prices and historic highs for housing costs, the Governor’s proposal is tone deaf and irresponsible,” de la Cruz said.
She renewed calls for state inspector general, a long-held priority of Republican lawmakers, to “increase accountability and affordability before rewarding highly paid political appointees.”
House Minority Leader Michael Chippendale declined to comment.
In 2022, McKee walked back his initial salary increases, spreading out pay bumps over two years amid pushback from the legislature. In 2013, former Gov. Lincoln Chafee in 2013 withdrew his proposed 6% raises for cabinet heads due to concern from legislative leaders of both parties, according to news reports.
Despite opposition, McKee plans to “stay the course” on this year’s salary proposals, Laura Hart, a spokesperson for the governor’s office, said on an email Tuesday. Hart described the raises as “modest,” noting that many cabinet members had not received raises in years when McKee became governor.
“Their salaries had fallen below the standard for their roles,” Hart said. “To rectify this situation, the state had to implement considerable raises over a three-year period. Moving forward, providing small, incremental increases over time will help Rhode Island maintain competitive salaries without causing a significant impact on any one budget year.”
Shekarchi and Senate President Dominick Ruggerio in a joint statement Tuesday said they plan to discuss the proposed pay bumps with the governor this week and monitor the public hearing. They have not yet come out with plans to veto the pay increases. De la Cruz said she would support a legislative resolution to reject the pay raises, if submitted to the General Assembly.
There’s no record of lawmakers exercising their powers to reject pay raises through formal legislative action, according to Larry Berman, a spokesperson for Shekarchi. State law requires both chambers “act concurrently” to take formal action to reject the proposed raises within 30 days.
Updated to include responses from Karen Greco on behalf of the Rhode Island Department of Administration, Laura Hart from Gov. Dan McKee’s office, and Senate Minority Leader Jessica de la Cruz.

(Photo by Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Senate Bill 81, which aimed to make it easier for New Mexicans in wildfire-prone areas to secure home insurance, was tabled* at its final committee hearing in the 60-day session, but the bill’s Republican sponsor said reason for optimism remains for those trying to rebuild after wildfires.
The bill would have required the board overseeing the Fair Access to Insurance Requirements plan to increase coverage limits to $750,000 for homes and overhauled a board now composed of insurance executives. 
The state’s top 10 home insurers have increased premiums 60%, on average, since 2022, and insurers are also increasingly refusing to renew policies or canceling them. That’s what makes reforms to the FAIR plan, often referred to as the state’s home “insurer of last resort,” all the more necessary, sponsors have said.
NM Gov fire-insurance proposal ‘won’t happen this session’

Even with the increase of costs to rebuild homes and rising home prices, the plan only covered $250,000 of losses for most of its existence until shortly after the South Fork and Salt Fires in Ruidoso, when the board agreed to increase it to $350,000.
The FAIR plan board met again during the legislative session and increased the coverage limits to $750,000, plus up to $1 million for commercial properties, according to Rep. Harlan Vincent (R-Ruidoso Downs).
Increasing the coverage cap to $750,000 was expected to increase the number of FAIR plan holders from about 7,000 to about 11,000, state insurance officials have said.
“SB81 had lots of traction, and it was a bipartisan effort,” Vincent told Source New Mexico on Saturday, following a post-session press conference with Republican leaders. “However, the board [was] able to meet all the demands that the bill was asking for, except for the reforming of the board.”
The bill’s proposed board reforms included adding a consumer advocate, climate scientist and catastrophic risk expert to the board. It was amended again on the Senate floor to scrap that proposal and instead allow legislative leaders to appoint board members.
None of the proposed amendments would have allowed the public to see what happens in FAIR Plan board meetings, even though the Legislature created the FAIR plan in 1969 and sought a major overhaul of the program this session. Vincent told Source New Mexico he believes the meetings should be public, however.
“I’m a very transparent person,” he said. “So, yes, I do.”
Why the state’s insurance regulator thinks SB81 will save New Mexicans’ homes from wildfire

Even without SB81, Vincent said he thinks other legislative acts this session will help homeowners protect their homes from wildfires and also get enough coverage to rebuild if they occur.
Several bills aim to address the insurance problem, directly or indirectly, including one that creates a state wildfire suppression fund and others that encourage or incentivize wildfire mitigation through the use of thinning and ignition-resistant construction materials. 
“I’m thinking that a lot of our insurance problems are eventually going to start going away, traditional insurance starts to come back, because we were able to get four, three bills across the finish line that had to do with wildfire,” he said. “So we’re going to try to start doing wildfire mitigation so that we can make it not such a risk for insurance companies to come back.”
 
Update 5:38 p.m. on Tuesday: This post has been updated to reflect that, according to House Judiciary Committee member Rep. Matthew McQueen (D-Galisteo), the bill was tabled.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The federal government will unfreeze $50 million in funds that the Biden administration had originally awarded Utah in an effort to get more water to the Great Salt Lake. 
That’s according to Great Salt Lake Commissioner Brian Steed, who said the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation lifted the Trump administration’s pause on Thursday. 
The bureau announced the funding in the waning days of the Biden administration, marking the largest single investment in the Great Salt Lake from the federal government. The funding was then put on hold for much of the winter, part of Trump’s review of federal programs and spending. 
“That $50 million will go a long way towards helping the lake be in a much better spot,” Steed told reporters during a news conference on Tuesday. 
The state still has some guardrails — about $10 million will go toward leasing, which allows the state to pay water rights holders in the Great Salt Lake basin to set aside some of their water for the lake. The remaining $40 million will go toward habitat projects around the lake. 
Feds pause $50 million Biden-era investment in Great Salt Lake

The announcement comes as lake levels hover around 4,193 feet on the south arm, and 4,192 on the north arm (the two sections are divided by a causeway, with the north arm typically experiencing lower water levels and higher salinity). 
That’s about one foot lower for the south arm and two feet higher for the north arm compared to last year, when the Great Salt Lake Basin saw above-average snowpack levels. It’s far better than the historically low water levels in 2022, where the lake bottomed out at 4,188.5 feet. 
Now, with snowpack currently at about 113% of normal for the Great Salt Lake Basin, Steed said the outlook is looking good, calling it a “remarkably average year” given how dry the fall was.   
“We expect we’ll have a pretty significant runoff into the Great Salt Lake, which gives us a lot of cause for hope,” said Steed, pointing to a report from the Natural Resources Conservation Service that suggested lake levels could rise between 6 inches to 1.5 feet as the snow continues to melt. 
That’s all good news for the lake’s salinity levels, a vital metric for overall ecosystem health. As lake levels drop, salinity becomes more concentrated, which can impact brine shrimp and brine fly populations — those populations are essential food for the millions of migratory birds that stop by the Great Salt Lake on their journey.

Current salinity levels were around 10.5% on Tuesday. “That’s actually in a really healthy spot,” Steed said. 
For reference, when lake levels hit a historic low in 2022, salinity levels in the south arm hit 19%, nearing the tipping point of what brine flies can handle.
A slow year for the Great Salt Lake on capitol hill 
Steed’s remarks come on the heels of the 2025 Legislative General Session, where lawmakers passed more than 500 bills and funded a number of programs. 
But unlike recent years, it was a slow year for the Great Salt Lake. After several sessions of prioritizing water and Great Salt Lake-related legislation, House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, said lawmakers should evaluate the success of these policies before further tweaking water law.
Still, Steed said it was “a relatively successful legislative session for the Great Salt Lake.” That includes: 

HB446, which was mostly a clean-up bill clarifying existing policies, including Great Salt Lake Commissioner’s authority to lease water for the lake
HB520, which officially moves Steed’s office under the Utah Division of Natural Resources and pushes for more coordination between the Great Salt Lake Trust Council and the Great Salt Lake Commissioner’s Office. 
A $1 million allocation for Steed’s office to lease more water for the Great Salt Lake. 
About $150,000 in annual funds for the Utah Department of Environmental Quality to monitor dust pollution from the lake.

Glenn Youngkin vetoed legislation Monday that would have required developers and companies using “high-risk” artificial intelligence systems to take steps to protect consumers from discrimination.
If signed into law, Virginia would have become the second state to enact comprehensive artificial intelligence rules, behind Colorado. The Virginia measure would have made companies responsible for protecting consumers from bias in areas such as hiring, housing and health care decisions.
In his veto explanation, Youngkin said that while he supports responsible governance of artificial intelligence, the bill’s framework “fails to account for the rapidly evolving and fast-moving nature of the AI industry and puts an especially onerous burden on smaller firms and startups that lack large legal compliance departments.”
The bill, sponsored by Virginia Democratic state Del. Michelle Lopes Maldonado, would have required AI developers to disclose the intended uses of their AI system while assessing its risks and limitations. Businesses using these systems would then be required to implement risk management policies. Both AI developers and deployers would have been subject to civil penalties for noncompliance.
As the Trump administration loosens AI rules, states look to regulate the technology

While many companies use artificial intelligence, the measure would have applied only to the ones developing and using “high-risk” AI systems, such as those used for employment decisions or financial services.
“I think it’s really critical for us to create guardrails and frameworks that are flexible and breathable, so that we don’t stifle innovation and creativity,” Maldonado told the Virginia Mercury when introducing the bill in January.
Opponents of the bill, including the Chamber of Progress, a center-left tech industry coalition, argued that it would hinder innovation and cost taxpayers.
AI should be regulated sector by sector, said Brianna January, Chamber of Progress’ Northeast state and local government relations director.
“When you have an omnibus approach like HB 2094, you unintentionally stack the cards against smaller innovators that want to operate in the state because you’re creating such a regulatory and liability framework that really only the big players can operate in,” January said in a phone interview.
While the Trump administration has lowered some artificial intelligence guardrails in hopes of boosting innovation, states are continuing to establish policies for the safe use of AI, including measures to prevent algorithmic discrimination.
Lawmakers in other states — including California, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New York, Texas and more — are considering similar legislation to curb potential AI abuses.

In February 2022, Yuzvak, her husband Oleh, and their son Dima knew that Russian forces had arrived by the sound of explosions. 
“The full invasion started,” recalled Yuzvak, speaking from a quiet, sunlit room in one of her medical clinics. “The artillery and mines and helicopters started to destroy everything, and there was no electricity.” 
The quiet village in the suburbs of Kyiv was suddenly the front line. Yuzvak, the physician-manager of four health clinics, began treating shrapnel wounds and concussions, making home visits with a commandeered ambulance amid constant gunfire, then treating people from home when that got too risky, relying on a neighbor’s generator for power. 
“But we didn’t have medicine,” like insulin, she recalled, partly a result of blackouts.
A month into the invasion, Yuzvak heard screaming from her front yard. She rushed out to find Dima, 25, pleading with Russian soldiers who’d shot her husband twice in the leg. The family was bundled off, bags put over their heads. After two days of interrogation, Olena was freed. Oleh was returned after a month. But Dima is still being held in Russia.
Still, she’s continued her work.
Yuzvak walks outside and points to the clinic’s roof, where solar panels gleam under a dusting of snow. Rebuilt after missile damage, her Hostomel clinic now runs completely on solar from May to October. That kind of reliability, she says, is critical, and has made the facility a pillar for the area, even during wartime blackouts. 
“People can come anytime, when there is no electricity or heating, and they can have a tea, warm up, watch TV because we always have electricity,” Yuzvak said. 
She’d like to continue the shift to renewable energy sources, as it allows the clinics to be more independent – and thereby more secure. For the rest of the year, they supplement with electricity from the grid, which has been widely damaged by Russian attacks.
Ukraine is hedging its energy security, in part, on Louisiana. In December, as part of a gambit to replace Russia as the gas hub for Europe, Ukraine received its first shipment of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States. Exported from a Venture Global terminal in Plaquemines Parish, it’ll be held in Ukraine’s gas storage tanks – the largest in Europe – before being piped around the region. 
The Trump administration has framed LNG as a win, part of an “energy dominance” plan that will provide security for Europe amid sanctions on Russian gas. Since the invasion, the European Union has banned imports of Russian coal and nearly all Russian oil and pipeline gas. 
But some energy and national security experts in the U.S. and Ukraine suggest that embracing LNG will primarily benefit the industry, pose security concerns for Ukraine, raise U.S. energy prices and threaten the health of the Gulf of Mexico.

Ukraine turns to Louisiana for LNG
Ukraine’s largest private energy company, DTEK, has agreed to buy LNG from Venture Global through the end of 2026. Earlier this month, Trump administration officials visited the company’s Plaquemines export terminal and stood alongside Venture Global CEO Mike Sabel as they announced plans to make it the largest one in the country. 
The rapid LNG buildout on the Gulf Coast accelerated after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, as European countries panicked over gas shortages and scrambled to increase imports of U.S. gas. Though the much-feared shortages never materialized, the war still wound up being a boon to the industry.
“American LNG has created a lot of security of supply, both for Ukraine and Europe in general,” said James O’Brien, head of LNG at DTrading, the international trading arm of DTEK. 
O’Brien added that much depends on what happens at the war’s end, but most likely “there will be more increased reliance on American [LNG] and maybe some other sources. But the really fast ramp-up of U.S. LNG production over the last eight, nine years has been quite amazing.”
The bulk of that ramp-up has come from Louisiana, now the biggest LNG exporter in the country. That’s helped make Venture Global a darling of the Trump administration. When his Energy and Interior secretaries visited the Plaquemines terminal last week, they gave speeches praising the company.

O’Brien likewise said an end to the war “could be amazing potential for American companies in Ukraine.” If Trump wants to balance trade deficits, “LNG is a quick, easy win for him” as “Ukraine is like a new market ready to be opened up, and it could be one of the biggest economic success stories of our time.”
But DTEK picked a beleaguered partner when it signed with Venture Global in June 2024. The company is embroiled in lawsuits with multiple clients, including BP and Shell, over unfulfilled contracts. Two environmental organizations also recently filed a 60-day notice of intent to sue over Clean Air Act violations at a Cameron Parish terminal. 
Last month, the CEO of TotalEnergies, a French petroleum corporation, declined to take LNG from the Plaquemines terminal, citing a lack of trust. 
“I don’t want to deal with these guys,” Patrick Pouyanne told Reuters. 
That turmoil has contributed to a class action lawsuit brewing against Venture Global by its own investors. 
And amid it all, Venture Global share prices have “cratered,” losing about 50% of their value since going public in January.

LNG in Louisiana communities
Louisiana shrimpers and fishers have, for years, protested and litigated against Venture Global, which has five LNG projects planned in the state. They argue its terminals damage fishing grounds, destroying their livelihoods. Nearby residents complain of the pollution and erosion the Plaquemines terminal causes, while the company receives billions in state tax breaks. Locals have reported an increase in already-high levels of illnesses among adults and children, including cancer and unexplained rashes.
Regardless, on Wednesday, Trump’s Department of Energy authorized exports from Venture Global’s CP2 terminal in Cameron Parish, which has contracted 10% of its supply to Ukraine.
DTEK says Venture Global has been a reliable partner. When asked about adverse impacts to Louisiana, O’Brien said they fall under Venture Global’s purview. 
“They’re the ones responsible for that. This is something they should be looking after,” he said. 
But Henry McAnespy, a retired fisherman and Lake Hermitage resident, warns the Plaquemines terminal near his home does not seem to be responsibly run.
“We’ve been concerned about the flaring – a lot of black smoke and a kind of reddish fire at times,” McAnespy said. 
He said the plant flares every day, all day – even though Venture Global told the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in its environmental impact statement that flaring at that terminal “may occur up to forty times a year. Venture Global does not anticipate any other flaring/venting during normal operating conditions.” He added that he hears constant alarms from the plant, which sound for hours, sometimes waking him up at night.
The pattern of excessive flaring McAnespy reports witnessing mirrors the near-daily flaring documented in the pending lawsuit against Venture Global’s Cameron Parish terminal.

Fossil fuels are ‘always going to be vulnerable’
So far, American LNG has not succeeded in displacing Russian LNG, which isn’t sanctioned like piped gas. Russian LNG supplies to Europe have actually increased since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. 
LNG imports can also present national security risks according to Mike Wallin, CEO of the American Security Project, a nonpartisan think tank.
“Generally speaking, fossil fuels are always going to be vulnerable,” Wallin told the Louisiana Illuminator. 
Because fossil fuels are sold on the global marketplace, conflicts, wars or economic shifts in any one region can cause price shocks or supply shortages. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has also suggested Trump’s proposal to mine rare earth minerals in his country  would allow Ukraine to build LNG import terminals, but these facilities on the Black Sea would be vulnerable to Russian attacks, Wallin said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Renewable energy, on the other hand, tends to be more secure, because it’s “much more centralized, because it’s in your own country. You’re not depending on outside resources,” he said. 
Wallin added that as Russia’s been attacking infrastructure, the Ukrainian energy industries have been looking into and building renewables for resiliency. 
“It’s easier to stand up a windmill, or solar panels wired up to some houses, than it is to build an entire gas-burning power plant,” he said.
Some Ukrainians echo that viewpoint. 
“Fossil fuel companies and their political allies in the United States have capitalized on the horrific war we are experiencing in Ukraine to justify” LNG exports, said Svitlana Romanko, founder of Razom We Stand, an organization calling for a permanent embargo on Russian fossil fuels. 
Fossil fuels are “fueling global energy insecurity and autocrats’ expansion. In Ukraine, we don’t want more LNG. We need decentralized renewable energy sources,” Romanko said.
DTEK itself states that “Russia has used energy as a geopolitical weapon” and “by creating a strong, decentralized and low-carbon energy system, Ukraine can limit its exposure to Russian aggression.”
The nation has faced constant attacks on its conventional power plants, and Russia currently occupies Zaporizhzhia, home to the largest nuclear power plant in the world. 
“Things like microgrids can help in the resilience of their energy network,” Wallin said. “And I think they’ve been forced to learn this rather quickly.”

Renewables could make Ukraine a ‘green powerhouse’
Three years of Russian attacks have already spurred a buildout of renewable-powered microgrids for critical infrastructure in Ukraine, such as schools,  water utilities – and Yuzvak’s clinic. 
“We are 100% independent,” said Yuzvak, pointing to the glinting solar panels on the roof of the rebuilt clinic in Hostomel. 
Fences in this neighborhood are still riddled by bullet holes. The shell of a bombed house looms behind the nearby Mushchyn clinic. But both are solid and gleaming and – with the help of Greenpeace and EcoAction, a Ukrainian renewables advocacy organization – boast solar panels, battery packs and heat pumps. Even amid a blackout, they’ll no longer need to find fuel for generators, which was difficult and expensive.
EcoAction has established 15 other sites in Ukraine with renewable microgrids. The challenge is scaling up. 
DTEK recently announced plans to quadruple the size of its wind farm near the Black Sea. It’s the single largest private investment in Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion in 2022. At that size, it would produce enough electricity for 900,000 Ukrainian homes.
The shift to renewables helps shield Yuzvak’s clinic from another source of instability: the Trump administration. 
Even as donated Tesla batteries help power the clinic, much of the Ukrainian health system relies on funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Since Elon Musk dismantled the agency, Yuzvak and her colleagues, whose salaries came from Ukraine’s USAID-reliant Ministry of Health, have struggled. 
“We don’t even have enough to pay the employees’ salary,” she explained. The hospital has had to lower its budget and change what they charge patients as a result.

But being energy independent helps ease some of the clinic’s financial pressure. It has reduced its heating costs by 80%, according to EcoAction.
“We’d like to have a solar plant,” Yuzvak said. “We have projects, but we don’t have the finances.” She and other health care providers planned to construct a fifth hospital with solar panels, but the project was dependent on USAID funding. Now its future is uncertain, like so much else in Yuzvak’s life.

Yuzak said she sometimes gets information about her son from freed POWs. She knows where Dima is, and that he is in poor health. But she didn’t disclose the prison where he’s being held, “because then they’ll transfer him to another one, and during this transportation, they get beaten and tortured again,” she said, her voice strained.
Meanwhile, any goodwill created by the donated Tesla batteries has evaporated.
“We didn’t even need these toys that Musk and USAID are bringing us. We had enough electricity before,” Yuzvak said. 
“The mood is changing in the speech of the politicians,” she added. “But after what we went through, what we survived – nothing can make us silent.”

Michelle Lujan Grisham on Friday signed an election reform bill into law allowing two local government entities focused on conserving water to hold their own elections separate from other local governments.
In 2018, the New Mexico Local Election Act consolidated all local contests into a single election. But special conservancy districts have never been included, because of the complexities of running an election in which people might not be registered voters, but own property in the counties where the districts lie.
The original law delayed implementation for conservancy districts until 2022, and New Mexico in 2023 again pushed back implementation for the districts, until this year.
House Bill 308 permanently exempts two local conservancy districts from the Local Election Act: the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District based in Albuquerque and the Arch Hurley Conservancy District based in Tucumcari.
County clerks, constituents and the six Pueblo governments in the Middle Rio Grande area in the central part of New Mexico have raised concerns about implementing the Local Election Act, HB308 Sponsor Rep. Derrick Lente (D-Sandia Pueblo) told the House Judiciary Committee on Feb. 28.
Jason Casuga, chief engineer and CEO for the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District, explained to the committee that the two conservancy districts shouldn’t be part of the other local elections because their voters are landowners, not registered voters.
“That’s what makes the conservancy district unique, and what makes tribal participation within the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District elections unique, in that tribal members don’t necessarily have to be registered voters, but they own a stake in the land that’s being benefitted,” Casuga said. “That’s where the technical issues came in — and that what we’ve been working on for years trying to solve — is how do you create a unified voter database that doesn’t require the same kind of information for a registered voter database as you would for a land-based one.”
Lente called HB308 a “measure of last resort” to ensure that voters from those Pueblos can fully participate in the conservancy district’s election process.
In a Friday news release, the Secretary of State’s Office highlighted HB308 as one of three pieces of legislation that would “add stability, transparency, and safety to New Mexico’s elections,” along with proposals to make lobbying more transparent and allow ‘decline to state’ voters — aka independents — the ability to participate in primaries without changing their voter registrations.
Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver commended lawmakers for passing the bills, saying they “will further enhance the quality of New Mexico’s already top-ranked elections” and give election officials more tools and voters more ways to participate.
“I’m grateful for the hard work put in by the bill sponsors, advocates, and the members of my staff to support the passage of these bills,” Toulouse Oliver said. “I look forward to Governor Lujan Grisham signing these important pieces of legislation into law.”
HB308 was one of eight bills passed by both the House and Senate that required a signature or a veto by Saturday, because they landed on the governor’s desk in the session’s final 72 hours.
Two good government groups on Friday also applauded lawmakers’ passage of SB16, saying open primaries in other states have led to stronger voter turnout and more competitive elections.
Sila Avcil, executive director of New Mexico Open Elections and NM Voters First, said the new law represents a step toward hundreds of thousands of New Mexicans gaining more access to some of the most consequential elections.
“New Mexico made history today,” Avcil said. “New Mexico, and our democracy, is better for it.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Release-21-Edited-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-27 10:52:15.805014

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images)New York state’s highest court struck down a New York City statute that would have allowed 800,000 noncitizens to vote in mayoral, city council and school board elections.
This month, six of the seven judges on the New York State Court of Appeals upheld an earlier ruling that found the city’s statute unconstitutional, siding with the New York Republican State Committee, the Republican National Committee and others. The statute, which passed the City Council in 2021 and would have gone into effect the following year, was never implemented after it was immediately challenged in court.
“[I]t is facially clear that only citizens may vote in elections within the State of New York,” wrote Chief Judge Rowan D. Wilson for the majority.
Proponents of allowing legal permanent residents and those in the United States on work authorization to vote solely in local elections argue that it helps integrate immigrants into American society, allowing them to vote on issues dear to them, such as their children’s education or taxes.
Taking that away is a “grave injustice,” said Murad Awawdeh, president and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition, one of the groups that appealed a lower court’s ruling.
“New York City needs more democracy, not less,” Awawdeh said in a statement. “Expanding voting rights strengthens our communities, and improves our school, housing, and public services.”
New York City was one of about 20 cities and towns in California, Maryland and Vermont — along with the District of Columbia — that allow noncitizens to vote in some local elections. Those laws make it clear that the vote would only be extended for local elections, noting that only U.S. citizens may vote in statewide and federal elections.
In November, 60% of voters in Santa Ana, California, rejected a ballot measure that would have allowed noncitizens to vote in local elections.
Last month, a Vermont Superior Court judge dismissed a conservative group’s lawsuit challenging Burlington’s statute allowing noncitizens to vote in local elections, including those for school board.
As Stateline has reported, very few noncitizens have actually participated in these local elections, many either afraid that voting would alert federal immigration officials or unaware that the statutes even existed.
Those challenging the New York City statute argued that not only did the statute language violate the state constitution, but that it also would dilute the voice of the city’s 5 million registered voters.
The issue of noncitizens participating in American elections has become a focus of Republican efforts to add more restrictions to the voting process. The GOP-led Congress has made enacting the proposed Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act a major priority. The legislation, known as the SAVE Act, would require voters to show a birth certificate, passport or some proof of citizenship to register to vote in federal elections.
But passing the SAVE Act could disenfranchise U.S. citizens, some voting rights advocates say.
Critics of the measure point out that more than 21 million American citizens lack access to such documents. They also note that women who have changed their names after marriage are also at risk of being disenfranchised. Finally, they point out that it is already illegal under federal law for noncitizens to vote.
